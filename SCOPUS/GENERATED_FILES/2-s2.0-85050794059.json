Methods: At the ICI-RS 2017 meeting, a panel of Functional Urologists and Basic Scientists presented literature data generating a proposal to discuss whether there is \u201cbrain OAB\u201d and how we could recognize it. Results: Existing data point toward organic brain causes of OAB, in particular concerning white matter disease (WMD) and aging, but with currently speculative mechanisms. Imaging techniques have revealed connectivity changes between brain regions which may explain brain-peripheral interactions in OAB patients, further to acknowledged structural and functional changes in the central nervous system (CNS). Furthermore, psychological disorders like stress and depression have been identified as causes of OAB, with animal and human studies proposing a neurochemical and neuroendocrine pathophysiological basis, involving either the serotoninergic system or the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. Finally, childhood data suggest that OAB could be a developmental disorder involving the CNS, although childhood OAB could be a different condition than that of adults in many children. Conclusions: Future research should aim to identify the pathogenesis of WMD and the aging processes affecting the brain and the bladder, with possible benefits in prevention strategies, as well as connectivity disorders within the CNS, the pathophysiology of OAB in childhood and the neurochemical pathways connecting affective disorders with OAB.", "AuthorKeywords": ["aging", "brain", "childhood", "depression", "incontinence", "overactive bladder", "stress"], "IndexKeywords": ["Depressive Disorder", "Humans", "Hypothalamo-Hypophyseal System", "Pituitary-Adrenal System", "Stress, Psychological", "Urinary Bladder, Overactive", "Urinary Incontinence"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85050794059", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Urology", "MEDI", "2748"]], "AuthorData": {"7003455677": {"Name": "Apostolidis A.", "AuthorID": "7003455677", "AffiliationID": "60015331", "AffiliationName": "2nd Department of Urology, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki"}, "7003991162": {"Name": "Wagg A.", "AuthorID": "7003991162", "AffiliationID": "60030835", "AffiliationName": "Division of Geriatric Medicine, University of Alberta"}, "26641426200": {"Name": "Rahnam\u00ad\u00ad\u00ada'i M.", "AuthorID": "26641426200", "AffiliationID": "60018869", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, Maastricht University Medical Centre"}, "56440005600": {"Name": "Vrijens D.", "AuthorID": "56440005600", "AffiliationID": "60018869", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, Maastricht University Medical Centre"}, "8862148900": {"Name": "Panicker J.", "AuthorID": "8862148900", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Uro-Neurology, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "7007120070": {"Name": "von Gontard A.", "AuthorID": "7007120070", "AffiliationID": "60023686", "AffiliationName": "Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Saarland University Hospital"}}}
