Here, we show that the impact of mild BMI1 overexpression observed in mouse models is translatable to human cells. In human myoblasts, BMI1 overexpression increases mitochondrial activity, leading to an enhanced energetic state with increased ATP production and concomitant protection against DNA damage both in vitro and upon xenografting in a severe dystrophic mouse model. These preclinical data in mouse models and human cells provide a strong rationale for the development of pharmacological approaches to target BMI1-mediated mitochondrial regulation and protection from DNA damage to sustain the regenerative potential of the skeletal muscle in conditions of chronic muscle wasting.", "AuthorKeywords": ["DMD", "muscle regeneration", "myoblasts", "myopathy", "oxidative phosphorylation", "Polycomb gene", "satellite cells"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Biopsy", "Cell Differentiation", "Cell Line, Transformed", "Cell Proliferation", "Cells, Cultured", "Disease Models, Animal", "DNA Damage", "Energy Metabolism", "Gene Expression", "Humans", "Mice", "Mitochondria", "Muscle, Skeletal", "Muscular Dystrophy, Duchenne", "Myoblasts", "Oxidation-Reduction", "Oxidative Phosphorylation", "Oxidative Stress", "Polycomb Repressive Complex 1", "Regeneration", "Satellite Cells, Skeletal Muscle"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85025438075", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Developmental Biology", "BIOC", "1309"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"55791029300": {"Name": "Dibenedetto S.", "AuthorID": "55791029300", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Blizard Institute, Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London"}, "6505679978": {"Name": "Niklison-Chirou M.", "AuthorID": "6505679978", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Blizard Institute, Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London"}, "16948868300": {"Name": "Robson L.G.", "AuthorID": "16948868300", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Blizard Institute, Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London"}, "35311122400": {"Name": "Knopp P.", "AuthorID": "35311122400", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Blizard Institute, Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London"}, "25648892000": {"Name": "Di Foggia V.", "AuthorID": "25648892000", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Blizard Institute, Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London"}, "55757783542": {"Name": "Marino S.", "AuthorID": "55757783542", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Blizard Institute, Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London"}, "57201181791": {"Name": "Cabrera C.P.", "AuthorID": "57201181791", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Translational Bioinformatics, William Harvey Research Institute, Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London"}, "35498112100": {"Name": "Barnes M.R.", "AuthorID": "35498112100", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Translational Bioinformatics, William Harvey Research Institute, Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London"}, "35418898300": {"Name": "Ellis M.", "AuthorID": "35418898300", "AffiliationID": "60020736", "AffiliationName": "Division of Neuropathology, the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "7006168683": {"Name": "Tedesco F.S.", "AuthorID": "7006168683", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University College London"}, "55274350800": {"Name": "Ragazzi M.", "AuthorID": "55274350800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University College London"}, "55791416200": {"Name": "Radunovic A.", "AuthorID": "55791416200", "AffiliationID": "60159931", "AffiliationName": "Neuroscience and Trauma Centre, Barts Health NHS Trust"}}}
