In this study, we developed decellularized human liver scaffolds for cell culture and further applied for HBV infection. As a result, primary human hepatocytes (PHHs) engrafted into liver scaffolds and maintained differentiation with stable albumin secretion and liver-specific gene expression. Comparing to mono-layer cell culture, scaffold-based three-dimensional (3D) culture system significantly augment HBV DNA (including cccDNA), RNA level as well as HBsAg secretion. Moreover, HepG2-NTCP cells cultured on 3D system exhibited higher infection efficiency and longer infection period in vitro. In addition, HBV DNA level was suppressed when anti-HBV medicine Entecavir (ETV) introduced into HepG2-NTCP 3D system. Herein, we evaluated the potential of decellularized human liver scaffold-based in 3D cell culture and disclosed that scaffold-based 3D culture system can facilitate HBV infection in vitro. This 3D culture system could be further applied in HBV-related study. \u00a9 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
