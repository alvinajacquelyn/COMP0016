This direct causality is incompatible with clinical observations. We review evidence supporting a long, complex cellular phase consisting of feedback and feedforward responses of astrocytes, microglia, and vasculature. The field must incorporate this holistic view and take advantage of advances in single-cell approaches to resolve the critical junctures at which perturbations initially amenable to compensatory feedback transform into irreversible, progressive neurodegeneration.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Alzheimer Disease", "Amyloid beta-Peptides", "Animals", "Astrocytes", "Brain", "Humans", "Mice", "Microglia", "Neural Pathways", "Oligodendroglia", "Single-Cell Analysis"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84958225958", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"7006241978": {"Name": "De Strooper B.", "AuthorID": "7006241978", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neurology, University College London, Queen Square"}, "7003335135": {"Name": "Karran E.", "AuthorID": "7003335135", "AffiliationID": "113799064", "AffiliationName": "Alzheimer Research UK"}}}
