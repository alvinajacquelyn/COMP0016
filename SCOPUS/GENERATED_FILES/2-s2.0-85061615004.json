Background: Women are more likely to experience ADRs than men, and these reactions may negatively affect women's immediate and long-term health. HF in particular is associated with increased ADR risk because of the high number of comorbidities and older age. However, little is known about ADRs in women with HF who are treated with guideline-recommended drugs. Methods: A systematic search of PubMed and EMBASE was performed to collect all available information on ADRs to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, \u03b2-blockers, angiotensin II receptor blockers, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, ivabradine, and digoxin in both women and men with HF. Results: The search identified 155 eligible records, of which only 11 (7%) reported ADR data for women and men separately. Sex-stratified reporting of ADRs did not increase over the last decades. Six of the 11 studies did not report sex differences. Three studies reported a higher risk of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor\u2013related ADRs in women, 1 study showed higher digoxin-related mortality risk for women, and 1 study reported a higher risk of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist\u2013related ADRs in men. No sex differences in ADRs were reported for angiotensin II receptor blockers and \u03b2-blockers. Sex-stratified data were not available for ivabradine. Conclusions: These results underline the scarcity of ADR data stratified by sex. The study investigators call for a change in standard scientific practice toward reporting of ADR data for women and men separately.", "AuthorKeywords": ["adverse drug reactions", "heart failure", "sex differences", "sex-specific reporting", "women"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adrenergic beta-Antagonists", "Angiotensin Receptor Antagonists", "Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors", "Cardiotonic Agents", "Cardiovascular Agents", "Digoxin", "Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions", "Female", "Heart Failure", "Humans", "Ivabradine", "Male", "Mineralocorticoid Receptor Antagonists", "Mortality", "Practice Guidelines as Topic", "Research Design", "Research Report", "Sex Distribution", "Sex Factors", "Stroke Volume"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85061615004", "SubjectAreas": [["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"57190247197": {"Name": "Bots S.H.", "AuthorID": "57190247197", "AffiliationID": "60032724, 60007989", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Experimental Cardiology, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht University"}, "56182744000": {"Name": "Eikendal A.L.M.", "AuthorID": "56182744000", "AffiliationID": "60032724, 60007989", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Experimental Cardiology, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht University"}, "14071039800": {"Name": "den Ruijter H.M.", "AuthorID": "14071039800", "AffiliationID": "60032724, 60007989", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Experimental Cardiology, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht University"}, "57195338964": {"Name": "Groepenhoff F.", "AuthorID": "57195338964", "AffiliationID": "60032724, 60007989", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Clinical Chemistry and Haematology, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht University"}, "57204258837": {"Name": "Tannenbaum C.", "AuthorID": "57204258837", "AffiliationID": "60009507", "AffiliationName": "Faculties of Pharmacy and Medicine, Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al"}, "56014103800": {"Name": "Rochon P.A.", "AuthorID": "56014103800", "AffiliationID": "60016849", "AffiliationName": "Dalla Lana School of Public Health, University of Toronto"}, "7006921582": {"Name": "Regitz-Zagrosek V.", "AuthorID": "7006921582", "AffiliationID": "60106629", "AffiliationName": "DZHK (German Center for Cardiovascular Research), partner site Berlin"}, "55545613900": {"Name": "Miller V.M.", "AuthorID": "55545613900", "AffiliationID": "60005558", "AffiliationName": "Women's Health Research Center, Mayo Clinic"}, "57194160515": {"Name": "Day D.", "AuthorID": "57194160515", "AffiliationID": "60111911", "AffiliationName": "UniQure"}, "57202567488": {"Name": "Asselbergs F.W.", "AuthorID": "57202567488", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Health Data Research UK and Institute of Health Informatics, University College London"}}}
