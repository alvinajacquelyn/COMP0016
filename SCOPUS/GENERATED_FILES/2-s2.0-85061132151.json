Our aim was to evaluate the expression of miR-16, miR-20a, miR-150 and miR-155 in several grades of ASIL obtained from high-risk patients, submitted to anal cancer screening from July 2016 to January 2017. Lesions were classified according to the Lower Anogenital Squamous Terminology (LAST) in low-grade (LSIL) and high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL), and the AIN classification in AIN1, AIN2 and AIN3. A hundred and five biopsies were obtained from 60 patients. Ten samples were negative (9.5%), 63 were LSIL (60%) and 32 were HSIL (30.5%) according to the LAST. Twenty seven (26%) were negative for dysplasia, 46 were classified as AIN1 (44%), 14 as AIN2 (13%) and 18 as AIN3 (17%) according to the AIN classification. There was no statistically significant difference in the fold expression of miR-16, miR-20a, miR-150 and miR-155, according to either classification. Although non- significant, there was an increasing trend in the miR-155 fold expression from negative samples to HSIL, with the highest fold expression increase in both LSIL and HSIL compared to the other miRNAs.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Anus Neoplasms", "Biomarkers, Tumor", "Carcinoma in Situ", "Case-Control Studies", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "MicroRNAs", "Papillomaviridae", "Papillomavirus Infections", "Precancerous Conditions", "Prognosis", "Risk Factors", "Squamous Intraepithelial Lesions"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85061132151", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"38662384900": {"Name": "Albuquerque A.", "AuthorID": "38662384900", "AffiliationID": "60028845", "AffiliationName": "Gastroenterology Department, Centro Hospitalar S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o"}, "39863433300": {"Name": "Rios E.", "AuthorID": "39863433300", "AffiliationID": "60007249, 60105804", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Molecular Pathology and Immunology of the University of Porto (IPATIMUP) and i3S - Instituto de Investiga\u00e7\u00e3o e Inova\u00e7\u00e3o em Sa\u00fade, University of Porto"}, "7006018364": {"Name": "Macedo G.", "AuthorID": "7006018364", "AffiliationID": "60028845", "AffiliationName": "Gastroenterology Department, Centro Hospitalar S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o"}, "7006241641": {"Name": "Medeiros R.", "AuthorID": "7006241641", "AffiliationID": "60019826", "AffiliationName": "CEBIMED, Faculty of Health Sciences, Fernando Pessoa University"}, "55441500900": {"Name": "Fernandes M.", "AuthorID": "55441500900", "AffiliationID": "60003102", "AffiliationName": "Molecular Oncology and Viral Pathology Group, Portuguese Oncology Institute of Porto Research Center (CI-IPOP), Portuguese Oncology Institute"}, "24729593900": {"Name": "Teixeira A.L.", "AuthorID": "24729593900", "AffiliationID": "60003102", "AffiliationName": "Molecular Oncology and Viral Pathology Group, Portuguese Oncology Institute of Porto Research Center (CI-IPOP), Portuguese Oncology Institute"}, "35741788500": {"Name": "Santos J.", "AuthorID": "35741788500", "AffiliationID": "60003102", "AffiliationName": "Molecular Oncology and Viral Pathology Group, Portuguese Oncology Institute of Porto Research Center (CI-IPOP), Portuguese Oncology Institute"}, "56333656200": {"Name": "Stirrup O.", "AuthorID": "56333656200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Clinical Research in Infection and Sexual Heath, Institute for Global Health, University College London"}, "57199723280": {"Name": "Rodrigues M.", "AuthorID": "57199723280", "AffiliationID": "60028845", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, Centro Hospitalar S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o"}}}
