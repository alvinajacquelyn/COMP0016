To achieve this goal requires predictions of patient risk that are continuously updated and accurate, and delivered at an individual level with sufficient context and enough time to act. Here we develop a deep learning approach for the continuous risk prediction of future deterioration in patients, building on recent work that models adverse events from electronic health records2\u201317 and using acute kidney injury\u2014a common and potentially life-threatening condition18\u2014as an exemplar. Our model was developed on a large, longitudinal dataset of electronic health records that cover diverse clinical environments, comprising 703,782 adult patients across 172 inpatient and 1,062 outpatient sites. Our model predicts 55.8% of all inpatient episodes of acute kidney injury, and 90.2% of all acute kidney injuries that required subsequent administration of dialysis, with a lead time of up to 48 h and a ratio of 2 false alerts for every true alert. In addition to predicting future acute kidney injury, our model provides confidence assessments and a list of the clinical features that are most salient to each prediction, alongside predicted future trajectories for clinically relevant blood tests9. Although the recognition and prompt treatment of acute kidney injury is known to be challenging, our approach may offer opportunities for identifying patients at risk within a time window that enables early treatment.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Acute Kidney Injury", "Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Clinical Laboratory Techniques", "Computer Simulation", "Datasets as Topic", "False Positive Reactions", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive", "Risk Assessment", "ROC Curve", "Uncertainty", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85070862380", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"23092209100": {"Name": "Toma\u0161ev N.", "AuthorID": "23092209100", "AffiliationID": "60111161", "AffiliationName": "DeepMind"}, "49861305800": {"Name": "Glorot X.", "AuthorID": "49861305800", "AffiliationID": "60111161", "AffiliationName": "DeepMind"}, "57194202717": {"Name": "Rae J.W.", "AuthorID": "57194202717", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "CoMPLEX, Computer Science, University College London"}, "57210553368": {"Name": "Zielinski M.", "AuthorID": "57210553368", "AffiliationID": "60111161", "AffiliationName": "DeepMind"}, "55481308400": {"Name": "Askham H.", "AuthorID": "55481308400", "AffiliationID": "60111161", "AffiliationName": "DeepMind"}, "57210565738": {"Name": "Saraiva A.", "AuthorID": "57210565738", "AffiliationID": "60111161", "AffiliationName": "DeepMind"}, "57210553157": {"Name": "Mottram A.", "AuthorID": "57210553157", "AffiliationID": "60111161", "AffiliationName": "DeepMind"}, "57203636305": {"Name": "Meyer C.", "AuthorID": "57203636305", "AffiliationID": "60111161", "AffiliationName": "DeepMind"}, "24778684900": {"Name": "Ravuri S.", "AuthorID": "24778684900", "AffiliationID": "60111161", "AffiliationName": "DeepMind"}, "57210554510": {"Name": "Protsyuk I.", "AuthorID": "57210554510", "AffiliationID": "60111161", "AffiliationName": "DeepMind"}, "56982662900": {"Name": "Connell A.", "AuthorID": "56982662900", "AffiliationID": "60111161", "AffiliationName": "DeepMind"}, "56351939700": {"Name": "Hughes C.O.", "AuthorID": "56351939700", "AffiliationID": "60111161", "AffiliationName": "DeepMind"}, "24385249000": {"Name": "Karthikesalingam A.", "AuthorID": "24385249000", "AffiliationID": "60111161", "AffiliationName": "DeepMind"}, "14031214500": {"Name": "Cornebise J.", "AuthorID": "14031214500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "15839738700": {"Name": "Hassabis D.", "AuthorID": "15839738700", "AffiliationID": "60111161", "AffiliationName": "DeepMind"}, "35589953900": {"Name": "King D.", "AuthorID": "35589953900", "AffiliationID": "60111161", "AffiliationName": "DeepMind"}, "57189098021": {"Name": "Suleyman M.", "AuthorID": "57189098021", "AffiliationID": "60111161", "AffiliationName": "DeepMind"}, "57193128349": {"Name": "Back T.", "AuthorID": "57193128349", "AffiliationID": "60111161", "AffiliationName": "DeepMind"}, "57195333840": {"Name": "Ledsam J.R.", "AuthorID": "57195333840", "AffiliationID": "60111161", "AffiliationName": "DeepMind"}, "57209146118": {"Name": "Mohamed S.", "AuthorID": "57209146118", "AffiliationID": "60111161", "AffiliationName": "DeepMind"}, "35482685300": {"Name": "Montgomery H.", "AuthorID": "35482685300", "AffiliationID": "60029950, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Human Health and Performance, University College London"}, "7202374409": {"Name": "Rees G.", "AuthorID": "7202374409", "AffiliationID": "60109771, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, University College London"}, "8925800300": {"Name": "Laing C.", "AuthorID": "8925800300", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "University College London Hospitals"}, "57214514315": {"Name": "Baker C.R.", "AuthorID": "57214514315", "AffiliationID": "60023695", "AffiliationName": "Department of Veterans Affairs"}, "57205465063": {"Name": "Peterson K.", "AuthorID": "57205465063", "AffiliationID": "60025488", "AffiliationName": "Division of Epidemiology, University of Utah"}, "57210552818": {"Name": "Reeves R.", "AuthorID": "57210552818", "AffiliationID": "60023695", "AffiliationName": "Department of Veterans Affairs"}, "57055372100": {"Name": "Nielson C.", "AuthorID": "57055372100", "AffiliationID": "60023695", "AffiliationName": "Department of Veterans Affairs"}}}
