Pediatric Blood & Cancer Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.Introduction: The International Society of Paediatric Oncology (SIOP) protocols recommend preoperative chemotherapy appropriate for Wilms tumors (WTs) in children with renal tumors aged \u22656 months, reserving biopsy for \u201catypical\u201d cases. The Children's Cancer and Leukaemia Group (CCLG) joined the SIOP-WT-2001 study but continued the national practice of biopsy at presentation. Method: Retrospective study of concordance between locally reported renal tumor biopsies and central pathology review nephrectomy diagnoses of children enrolled by CCLG centers in the SIOP-WT-2001 study. Results: Biopsy reports were available for 552/787 children with unilateral tumors. 36 of 552 (6.5%) were nondiagnostic: 2 normal tissue, 12 necrotic, 9 insufficient sample, and 13 indeterminate results (disproportionately non-WTs). The sensitivity and specificity of biopsy to identify tumors that did not require SIOP empirical preoperative chemotherapy were 86.0% and 99.6%, respectively. 13 of 548 (2.4%) biopsy results were discordant with nephrectomy; non-WTs other than renal cell carcinoma and clear cell sarcoma of the kidney (CCSK) were poorly recognized. In children aged 6-119 months, 480 of 518 (91.6%) had WT or nephroblastomatosis. 5 of 518 (1%) had benign tumors, and only one diagnosed on biopsy. Biopsy results correctly changed clinical management in 25 of 518 (4.8%), including identifying 19 of 20 CCSKs, but would have led to overtreatment in 5 of 518 (1%) or undertreatment in 4 of 518 (0.8%). In children aged \u226510 years, biopsy correctly changed management in 5 of 19 (26%) cases with no discordance. Conclusion: Biopsy is less effective at identifying non-WTs than WTs and rarely changes management in younger children. Biopsy should be reserved in SIOP protocols for children \u226510 years and in younger children with clinical or radiological features inconsistent with WT.", "AuthorKeywords": ["diagnostic accuracy", "pediatric", "renal biopsy", "sensitivity and specificity"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Biopsy", "Carcinoma, Renal Cell", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Diagnosis, Differential", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Humans", "Infant", "Kidney Neoplasms", "Male", "Neoplasm Staging", "Retrospective Studies", "ROC Curve", "United Kingdom", "Wilms Tumor"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85061450369", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Hematology", "MEDI", "2720"], ["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"]], "AuthorData": {"47861115900": {"Name": "Jackson T.J.", "AuthorID": "47861115900", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "8345145000": {"Name": "Williams R.D.", "AuthorID": "8345145000", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "6602326435": {"Name": "Brok J.", "AuthorID": "6602326435", "AffiliationID": "60006564", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Oncology and Haematology, Rigshospitalet"}, "57113174400": {"Name": "Chowdhury T.", "AuthorID": "57113174400", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Oncology, Great Ormond Street Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7005535741": {"Name": "Pritchard-Jones K.", "AuthorID": "7005535741", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "6505848973": {"Name": "Ronghe M.", "AuthorID": "6505848973", "AffiliationID": "60190225", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Oncology, Royal Hospital for Children"}, "6603221176": {"Name": "Powis M.", "AuthorID": "6603221176", "AffiliationID": "60012508", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Surgery, Leeds Teaching Hospital NHS Trust"}, "7005591155": {"Name": "Vujani\u0107 G.M.", "AuthorID": "7005591155", "AffiliationID": "60107609", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, Sidra Medicine"}, "null": {"Name": null, "AuthorID": null, "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
