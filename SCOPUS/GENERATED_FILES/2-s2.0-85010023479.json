Methods One hundred twelve women who received a diagnosis of ovarian, fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer, completed primary treatment by surgery alone or with chemotherapy, irrespective of outcome with regard to remission, and expected survival of more than 3 months. Fifty-seven participants were randomized to individualized follow-up and 55 patients to conventional follow-up. Well-being was measured at baseline and at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months after randomization for QoL (QLQ-C30 [European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Core Quality of Life Questionnaire], QLQ-Ov28), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and a Patient Satisfaction Questionnaire (PSQ-III). The primary endpoints were the effects of follow-up on each of the scores (via hierarchical mixed-effects model) and on relapse-free time (via Cox model). The total cost of follow-up was compared between each group. Results There was evidence for a QoL and patient satisfaction benefit for individualized versus standard follow-up (QLQ-C30, P = 0.013; 95% confidence interval, -0.03 to -0.001; PSQ-III P = 0.002; 95% confidence interval, -0.003 to -0.015; QLQ-Ov28, P = 0.14). Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale data provided no evidence in favor of either treatment (P = 0.42). Delivered to protocol individualized follow-up resulted in a delay in the presentation of symptomatic relapse (P = 0.04), although the effect on survival in this study is unknown. Cost was \u00a3700 lower on average for the individualized follow-up group, but the difference was not statistically significant at the 5% level (P = 0.07). Conclusions Individualized follow-up was superior to conventional follow-up in 3 of the 4 QoL and patient satisfaction surveys in this preliminary study. Further prospective studies are needed in a larger population.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Follow-up", "Nurse-led", "Ovarian cancer"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Humans", "Middle Aged", "Ovarian Neoplasms", "Patient Satisfaction", "Precision Medicine", "Prospective Studies", "Psychiatric Status Rating Scales", "Quality of Life", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85010023479", "SubjectAreas": [["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Obstetrics and Gynecology", "MEDI", "2729"]], "AuthorData": {"10040678500": {"Name": "Lanceley A.", "AuthorID": "10040678500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Women's Cancer, UCL Elizabeth Garrett Anderson Institute for Women's Health, University College London"}, "16834524900": {"Name": "Burnell M.", "AuthorID": "16834524900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Women's Cancer, UCL Elizabeth Garrett Anderson Institute for Women's Health, University College London"}, "24480998900": {"Name": "Gessler S.", "AuthorID": "24480998900", "AffiliationID": "60024544, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London Hospitals (UCLH), Gynaecological Cancer Centre, University College London"}, "57193923293": {"Name": "Ryan A.", "AuthorID": "57193923293", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Women's Cancer, UCL Elizabeth Garrett Anderson Institute for Women's Health, University College London"}, "6603961382": {"Name": "Berzuini C.", "AuthorID": "6603961382", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Biostatistics, University of Manchester"}, "7007134127": {"Name": "Ledermann J.A.", "AuthorID": "7007134127", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60012754", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Research UK, UCL Cancer Trials Centre, University College London"}, "56449994300": {"Name": "Morris S.", "AuthorID": "56449994300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Applied Health Research, University College London"}, "34975076100": {"Name": "Jacobs I.", "AuthorID": "34975076100", "AffiliationID": "60028333", "AffiliationName": "University of New South Wales"}}}
