Modern AFM setups are capable of characterizing the nanomechanical behaviour of bacterial cells at both the cellular and molecular levels, where elastic properties and adhesion forces of single bacterium cells can be examined under different experimental conditions. Considering that bacterial and biofilm-mediated infections continue to challenge the biomedical field, it is important to understand the biophysical events leading towards bacterial adhesion and colonization on both biological and non-biological substrates. The purpose of this review is to present the latest findings concerning the field of single-bacterium nanomechanics, and discuss future trends and applications of nanoindentation and single-cell force spectroscopy techniques in biomedicine.", "AuthorKeywords": ["AFM", "bacterial adhesion", "force-spectroscopy", "microbiology", "nanomechanics"], "IndexKeywords": ["Bacterial adhesion", "Biological substrates", "Biomedical fields", "Elastic properties", "Experimental conditions", "Force spectroscopy", "High-resolution imaging", "Molecular levels", "Animals", "Bacterial Adhesion", "Bacterial Physiological Phenomena", "Biofilms", "Biomechanical Phenomena", "Biomedical Technology", "Humans", "Microscopy, Atomic Force", "Nanoparticles", "Nanotechnology", "Surface Properties"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84921632889", "SubjectAreas": [["Bioengineering", "CENG", "1502"], ["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Mechanics of Materials", "ENGI", "2211"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"56492783200": {"Name": "Aguayo S.", "AuthorID": "56492783200", "AffiliationID": "60013985, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomaterials and Tissue Engineering, UCL Eastman Dental Institute, University College London"}, "6602787947": {"Name": "Bozec L.", "AuthorID": "6602787947", "AffiliationID": "60013985, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomaterials and Tissue Engineering, UCL Eastman Dental Institute, University College London"}, "7004314492": {"Name": "Donos N.", "AuthorID": "7004314492", "AffiliationID": "60013985, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Periodontology Unit, UCL Eastman Dental Institute, University College London"}, "7004394482": {"Name": "Spratt D.", "AuthorID": "7004394482", "AffiliationID": "60013985, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Microbial Diseases, UCL Eastman Dental Institute, University College London"}}}
