As a result, the exact functional annotation of individual members can be extrapolated to a very limited extent. Here, we revise the previous simplified view on the classification of the 2HADH family; specifically, we show that the previously delineated glyoxylate/hydroxypyruvate reductase (GHPR) subfamily consists of two evolutionary separated GHRA and GHRB subfamilies. We compare two representatives of these subfamilies from Sinorhizobium meliloti (SmGhrA and SmGhrB), employing a combination of biochemical, structural, and bioinformatics approaches. Our kinetic results show that both enzymes reduce several 2-ketocarboxylic acids with overlapping, but not equivalent, substrate preferences. SmGhrA and SmGhrB show highest activity with glyoxylate and hydroxypyruvate, respectively; in addition, only SmGhrB reduces 2-keto-d-gluconate, and only SmGhrA reduces pyruvate (with low efficiency). We present nine crystal structures of both enzymes in apo forms and in complexes with cofactors and substrates/substrate analogues. In particular, we determined a crystal structure of SmGhrB with 2-keto-d-gluconate, which is the biggest substrate cocrystallized with a 2HADH member. The structures reveal significant differences between SmGhrA and SmGhrB, both in the overall structure and within the substrate-binding pocket, offering insight into the molecular basis for the observed substrate preferences and subfamily differences. In addition, we provide an overview of all GHRA and GHRB structures complexed with a ligand in the active site.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Active site", "Evolutionary history", "Exact functional", "Gene duplications", "Lateral gene transfers", "Molecular basis", "Sinorhizobium meliloti", "Substrate binding", "Alcohol Oxidoreductases", "Aldehyde Oxidoreductases", "Bacterial Proteins", "Crystallography, X-Ray", "Hydroxypyruvate Reductase", "Kinetics", "Models, Molecular", "Phylogeny", "Protein Conformation", "Sinorhizobium meliloti", "Substrate Specificity"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85041948513", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"]], "AuthorData": {"36864153400": {"Name": "Kutner J.", "AuthorID": "36864153400", "AffiliationID": "60110624, 60013756", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory for Structural and Biochemical Research, Biological and Chemical Research Centre, Department of Chemistry, University of Warsaw"}, "35339906800": {"Name": "Shabalin I.G.", "AuthorID": "35339906800", "AffiliationID": "60030846, 60021918", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Physiology and Biological Physics, University of Virginia"}, "55865613600": {"Name": "Matelska D.", "AuthorID": "55865613600", "AffiliationID": "60110595, 60013756", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Bioinformatics and Systems Biology, Centre of New Technologies, University of Warsaw"}, "56674753900": {"Name": "Handing K.B.", "AuthorID": "56674753900", "AffiliationID": "60030846, 60021918", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Physiology and Biological Physics, University of Virginia"}, "57090790400": {"Name": "Gasiorowska O.", "AuthorID": "57090790400", "AffiliationID": "60030846, 60021918", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Physiology and Biological Physics, University of Virginia"}, "57192008347": {"Name": "Sroka P.", "AuthorID": "57192008347", "AffiliationID": "60030846, 60021918", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Physiology and Biological Physics, University of Virginia"}, "7003314184": {"Name": "Minor W.", "AuthorID": "7003314184", "AffiliationID": "60013756", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Warsaw"}, "24558815400": {"Name": "Gorna M.W.", "AuthorID": "24558815400", "AffiliationID": "60110624, 60013756", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory for Structural and Biochemical Research, Biological and Chemical Research Centre, Department of Chemistry, University of Warsaw"}, "36859940500": {"Name": "Wozniak K.", "AuthorID": "36859940500", "AffiliationID": "60110624, 60013756", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory for Structural and Biochemical Research, Biological and Chemical Research Centre, Department of Chemistry, University of Warsaw"}, "7004494547": {"Name": "Ginalski K.", "AuthorID": "7004494547", "AffiliationID": "60110595, 60013756", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Bioinformatics and Systems Biology, Centre of New Technologies, University of Warsaw"}}}
