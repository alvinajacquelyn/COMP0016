The use of a guard ring (GR) was originally proposed for the in situ sorptivity test, but little information can be found for the water permeability test. In this study, the effect of a GR was carefully examined through the flow simulation, which was verified by carrying out experiments. It was observed that the GR can confine the flow near the surface, but cannot achieve a uni-directional flow across the whole depth of flow. To achieve a better performance, it is essential to consider the effects of the size of the inner seal and the GR and the significant interaction between these two. The analysis of the experimental data has indicated that the GR influences the flow for porous concretes, but there is no significant effect for dense concretes. Further investigation, validated using the flow-net theory, has shown a strong correlation between the water permeability coefficients obtained with the GR (Kw-GR) and without it (Kw-No GR), suggesting that one dimensional flow is not essential for interpreting data for site tests. Another practical issue was that more than 30 % of the tests with GR failed due to the difficulty of achieving a good seal between the inner and the outer chambers. Based on the work reported in this paper, a new water permeability test is proposed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Flow simulation", "Guard ring", "On-site water permeability test", "Steady rate of flow"], "IndexKeywords": ["Better performance", "Guard-rings", "Non destructive evaluation", "Onedimensional flow", "Porous concretes", "Steady rate of flow", "Strong correlation", "Water permeability"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84921067680", "SubjectAreas": [["Civil and Structural Engineering", "ENGI", "2205"], ["Building and Construction", "ENGI", "2215"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Mechanics of Materials", "ENGI", "2211"]], "AuthorData": {"56970113600": {"Name": "Yang K.", "AuthorID": "56970113600", "AffiliationID": "60023380", "AffiliationName": "College of Material Science and Engineering, Chongqing University"}, "8612834400": {"Name": "Basheer P.", "AuthorID": "8612834400", "AffiliationID": "60029738", "AffiliationName": "School of Planning, Architecture and Civil Engineering, Queen\u2019s University"}, "7202417206": {"Name": "Long A.", "AuthorID": "7202417206", "AffiliationID": "60029738", "AffiliationName": "School of Planning, Architecture and Civil Engineering, Queen\u2019s University"}, "55461062100": {"Name": "Bai Y.", "AuthorID": "55461062100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil, Environmental and Geomatic Engineering, University College"}, "7006454684": {"Name": "Magee B.", "AuthorID": "7006454684", "AffiliationID": "60020730", "AffiliationName": "University of Ulster"}}}
