Two experienced readers, unaware of the results with the other modalities, interpreted the PET/MR images independently. Discordances were resolved in consensus. PET/MR TNM staging was compared to surgical staging from thoracotomy as the reference standard in 33 patients. In the remaining 17 nonsurgical patients, TNM was determined based on histology from biopsy, imaging results (CT and PET/CT) and follow-up. ROC curve analysis was used to assess accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of the PET/MR in assessing the surgical resectability of primary tumour. The kappa statistic was used to assess interobserver agreement in the PET/MR TNM staging. Two different readers, without knowledge of the PET/MR findings, subsequently separately reviewed the PET/CT images for TNM staging. The generalized kappa statistic was used to determine intermodality agreement between PET/CT and PET/MR for TNM staging.Results: ROC curve analysis showed that PET/MR had a specificity of 92.3 % and a sensitivity of 97.3 % in the determination of resectability with an AUC of 0.95. Interobserver agreement in PET/MR reading ranged from substantial to perfect between the two readers (Cohen\u2019s kappa 0.646 \u2013 1) for T stage, N stage and M stage. Intermodality agreement between PET/CT and PET/MR ranged from substantial to almost perfect for T stage, N stage and M stage (Cohen\u2019s kappa 0.627 \u2013 0.823).Conclusion: In lung cancer patients PET/MR appears to be a robust technique for preoperative staging.Purpose: To assess the diagnostic performance of PET/MR in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Lung cancer", "Non-small-cell lung cancer", "PET/MR", "TNM staging"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung", "Female", "Fluorodeoxyglucose F18", "Humans", "Lung Neoplasms", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Multimodal Imaging", "Neoplasm Staging", "Observer Variation", "Positron-Emission Tomography", "Preoperative Period", "Radiopharmaceuticals", "Tomography, X-Ray Computed"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84912049711", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"36905492400": {"Name": "Fraioli F.", "AuthorID": "36905492400", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nuclear Medicine and Radiology, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "24335636100": {"Name": "Menezes L.", "AuthorID": "24335636100", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nuclear Medicine and Radiology, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "8960246500": {"Name": "Kayani I.", "AuthorID": "8960246500", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nuclear Medicine and Radiology, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "8960246900": {"Name": "Syed R.", "AuthorID": "8960246900", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nuclear Medicine and Radiology, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57192184689": {"Name": "O\u2019Meara C.", "AuthorID": "57192184689", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nuclear Medicine and Radiology, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "24075571700": {"Name": "Barnes A.", "AuthorID": "24075571700", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nuclear Medicine and Radiology, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7005791371": {"Name": "Bomanji J.B.", "AuthorID": "7005791371", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nuclear Medicine and Radiology, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "17036141700": {"Name": "Punwani S.", "AuthorID": "17036141700", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nuclear Medicine and Radiology, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7004435019": {"Name": "Groves A.M.", "AuthorID": "7004435019", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nuclear Medicine and Radiology, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "55882856100": {"Name": "Screaton N.J.", "AuthorID": "55882856100", "AffiliationID": "60033313", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Papworth Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "56514246800": {"Name": "Janes S.M.", "AuthorID": "56514246800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Lungs for Living Research Centre, UCL Respiratory Division of Medicine, University College London"}, "7003920942": {"Name": "Win T.", "AuthorID": "7003920942", "AffiliationID": "60027616", "AffiliationName": "Respiratory Medicine, Lister Hospital"}, "24402331400": {"Name": "Zaccagna F.", "AuthorID": "24402331400", "AffiliationID": "60032350", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiological sciences, University of Rome \u201cSapienza\u201d"}}}
