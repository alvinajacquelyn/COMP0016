Specifically, we use a learning typology to organize the different resources and actors involved in learning processes in the public management and administration literatures. We divide capacity into absorptive, administrative, and analytical. By combining modes of learning with these three challenges of capacity building, we generate a matrix that allows us to consider a range of experiences, cases, policy instruments, design, and implementation processes we will draw on to illustrate and explain. Throughout the chapter, we point to the difficulties, limitations, and sometimes incongruence of learning, and what can go wrong with the quality of governance. This normative theme is addressed explicitly in the conclusions, where we discuss the future of this research agenda.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85042321530", "SubjectAreas": [["Social Sciences (all)", "SOCI", "3300"]], "AuthorData": {"15925222700": {"Name": "Dunlop C.A.", "AuthorID": "15925222700", "AffiliationID": "60026479", "AffiliationName": "Department of Politics, University of Exeter"}, "6701387604": {"Name": "Radaelli C.M.", "AuthorID": "6701387604", "AffiliationID": "60026479", "AffiliationName": "Centre for European Governance, The University of Exeter"}}}
