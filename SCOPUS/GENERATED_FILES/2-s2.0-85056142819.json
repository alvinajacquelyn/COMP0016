The flow and scalar fields are investigated over the range 0.1 \u2264 Rep \u2264 10 and \u2264 Pep \u2264 1000 , where and are respectively the Reynolds and P\u00e9clet numbers imposed at the inlet pipe when either a Dirichlet (D) or a Neumann (N) scalar boundary condition is imposed at the wall unattached to the inlets and outlets. A scalar no-flux boundary condition is imposed at all the other walls. An axisymmetric model is applied to understand the flow and scalar transport in the inlet and outlet regions, which consist of a turning region close to the pipe centreline and a channel region away from it. A separate two-dimensional model is then developed for the channel region by solving the integral form of the momentum and scalar advection-diffusion equations. Analytical relations between geometrical, flow and scalar transport parameters based on similarity and integral methods are generated and agree closely with numerical solutions. Finally, three-dimensional numerical calculations are undertaken to test the validity of the axisymmetric and depth-averaged analyses. Dominant flow and scalar transport features vary dramatically across the flow domain. In the turning region, the flow is a largely irrotational straining flow when \u03f5 \u2265 \u03b4 and a dominantly viscous straining flow when \u03f5 \u03b4 . The thickness of the scalar boundary layer scales to the local P\u00e9clet number to the power . The diffusive flux jd and the scalar Cs at the wall where or is imposed, respectively, are constant. In the channel region, the flow is parabolic and dominated by a source flow near the inlet and an irrotational straining flow away from it 1/3 . When is imposed the scalar decreases exponentially with distance from the inlet and the normalised scalar transfer coefficient converges to \u03bb\u221e= 2.5694 . When is imposed, Cs varies proportionally to surface area. Transport in the straining region downstream of the inlet is diffusion-limited, and jd and Cs are functions of the geometrical parameters L, \u03f5 ,\u03b1 and \u03b4. In addition to describing the fundamental properties of the flow and passive transport in multipolar configurations, the present work demonstrates how geometrical and flow parameters should be set to control transfers in the different regions of the flow domain.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Hele-Shaw flows", "low-Reynolds-number flows"], "IndexKeywords": ["Analytical relations", "Axisymmetric modeling", "Flux boundary conditions", "Fundamental properties", "Hele-Shaw flow", "Low Reynolds number flow", "Three-dimensional numerical calculations", "Two dimensional model"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85056142819", "SubjectAreas": [["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Mechanics of Materials", "ENGI", "2211"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"]], "AuthorData": {"56682071700": {"Name": "Zouache M.A.", "AuthorID": "56682071700", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}, "7004946531": {"Name": "Luthert P.J.", "AuthorID": "7004946531", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}, "7006126106": {"Name": "Eames I.", "AuthorID": "7006126106", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "35484365400": {"Name": "Klettner C.A.", "AuthorID": "35484365400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}}}
