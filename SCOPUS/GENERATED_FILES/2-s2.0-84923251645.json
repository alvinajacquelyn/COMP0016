All rights reserved.Background To compare the diagnostic accuracy of post-mortem magnetic resonance imaging (PMMR) specifically for abdominal pathology in foetuses and children, compared to conventional autopsy. Methods Institutional ethics approval and parental consent was obtained. 400 unselected foetuses and children underwent PMMR using a 1.5 T Siemens Avanto MR scanner before conventional autopsy. PMMR images and autopsy findings were reported blinded to the other data respectively. Results Abdominal abnormalities were found in 70/400 (12%) autopsies. Overall sensitivity and specificity (95% confidence interval) of PMMR for abdominal pathology was 72.5% (61.0, 81.6) and 90.8% (87.0, 93.6), with positive (PPV) and negative predictive values (NPV) of 64.1% (53.0, 73.9) and 93.6% (90.2, 95.8) respectively. PMMR was good at detecting renal abnormalities (sensitivity 80%), particularly in foetuses, and relatively poor at detecting intestinal abnormalities (sensitivity 50%). Overall accuracy was 87.4% (83.6, 90.4). Conclusions PMMR has high overall accuracy for abdominal pathology in foetuses, newborns and children. PMMR is particularly good at detecting renal abnormalities, and relatively poor at detecting intestinal abnormalities. In clinical practice, PMMR may be a useful alternative or adjunct to conventional autopsy in foetuses and children for detecting abdominal abnormalities.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Accuracy", "Autopsy", "Children", "Foetuses", "MRI", "Pathology"], "IndexKeywords": ["Abdomen", "Autopsy", "Child", "Female", "Fetus", "Humans", "Infant, Newborn", "Intestinal Diseases", "Liver Diseases", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Renal Insufficiency, Chronic", "Reproducibility of Results", "Sensitivity and Specificity", "Splenic Diseases"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84923251645", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"6507902996": {"Name": "Arthurs O.J.", "AuthorID": "6507902996", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Child Health, UCL"}, "7102511623": {"Name": "Owens C.M.", "AuthorID": "7102511623", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Cardiorespiratory Division, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}, "56675453400": {"Name": "Olsen O.E.", "AuthorID": "56675453400", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Child Health, UCL"}, "24484901000": {"Name": "Thayyil S.", "AuthorID": "24484901000", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Perinatal Neurology and Neonatology, Imperial College London"}, "55390593900": {"Name": "Addison S.", "AuthorID": "55390593900", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Perinatal Neurology and Neonatology, Imperial College London"}, "55722599100": {"Name": "Jones R.", "AuthorID": "55722599100", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Cardiorespiratory Division, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57218666629": {"Name": "Norman W.", "AuthorID": "57218666629", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Cardiorespiratory Division, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57195810900": {"Name": "Taylor A.M.", "AuthorID": "57195810900", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Cardiorespiratory Division, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7202754332": {"Name": "Wade A.", "AuthorID": "7202754332", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Epidemiology, Nutrition and Biostatistics Section, UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "7404342636": {"Name": "Scott R.J.", "AuthorID": "7404342636", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Histopathology, University College London Hospital NHS Trust"}, "7102941268": {"Name": "Robertson N.J.", "AuthorID": "7102941268", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Academic Neonatology, UCL Institute for Women's Health"}, "7006741537": {"Name": "Chitty L.S.", "AuthorID": "7006741537", "AffiliationID": "60018207, 60012662", "AffiliationName": "Genetics and Genomic Medicine, UCL Institute of Child Health, London, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7004794073": {"Name": "Sebire N.J.", "AuthorID": "7004794073", "AffiliationID": "60018207, 60012662", "AffiliationName": "Department of Histopathology, UCL Institute of Child Health, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
