Although a few studies showed that culture influences cognitive strategies [6\u201313], the interaction between these factors has never been globally assessed as this requires testing millions of people of all ages across many different countries in the world. Since countries vary in their geographical and cultural properties, we predicted that these variations give rise to an organized spatial distribution of cognition at a planetary-wide scale. To test this hypothesis, we developed a mobile-app-based cognitive task, measuring non-verbal spatial navigation ability in more than 2.5 million people and sampling populations in every nation state. We focused on spatial navigation due to its universal requirement across cultures. Using a clustering approach, we find that navigation ability is clustered into five distinct, yet geographically related, groups of countries. Specifically, the economic wealth of a nation was predictive of the average navigation ability of its inhabitants, and gender inequality was predictive of the size of performance difference between males and females. Thus, cognitive abilities, at least for spatial navigation, are clustered according to economic wealth and gender inequalities globally, which has significant implications for cross-cultural studies and multi-center clinical trials using cognitive testing. Coutrot et al. used a mobile app to test the spatial ability of more than 2.5 million people around the world. Spatial ability declines across the adult lifespan and at the population level is strongly correlated with a country's economic wealth, with gender differences being reflective of the gender inequality in a country.", "AuthorKeywords": ["aging", "cross-country analysis", "crowdsourcing", "gender differences", "spatial cognition"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cognition", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Sex Factors", "Socioeconomic Factors", "Spatial Navigation", "Video Games"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85053847348", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"]], "AuthorData": {"55553538900": {"Name": "Coutrot A.", "AuthorID": "55553538900", "AffiliationID": "60032006, 60008134, 60110511", "AffiliationName": "Laboratoire des Sciences du Num\u00e9rique de Nantes, CNRS, Universit\u00e9 de Nantes"}, "57193674802": {"Name": "de Cothi W.", "AuthorID": "57193674802", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Behavioural Neuroscience, Department of Experimental Psychology, Division of Psychology and Language Sciences, University College London"}, "6603575074": {"Name": "Spiers H.J.", "AuthorID": "6603575074", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Behavioural Neuroscience, Department of Experimental Psychology, Division of Psychology and Language Sciences, University College London"}, "54887640500": {"Name": "Silva R.", "AuthorID": "54887640500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Statistical Science and CSML, University College London"}, "55436850500": {"Name": "Manley E.", "AuthorID": "55436850500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis, University College London"}, "13205434600": {"Name": "Sami S.", "AuthorID": "13205434600", "AffiliationID": "60117932, 60000112", "AffiliationName": "Norwich Medical School, University of East Anglia"}, "8682297900": {"Name": "Hornberger M.", "AuthorID": "8682297900", "AffiliationID": "60117932, 60000112", "AffiliationName": "Norwich Medical School, University of East Anglia"}, "57203774651": {"Name": "Bohbot V.D.", "AuthorID": "57203774651", "AffiliationID": "60028492, 60002494", "AffiliationName": "Douglas Mental Health University Institute, Department of Psychiatry, McGill University"}, "8886011800": {"Name": "Wiener J.M.", "AuthorID": "8886011800", "AffiliationID": "60029336", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Ageing and Dementia Research Centre, Bournemouth University"}, "56350590400": {"Name": "H\u00f6lscher C.", "AuthorID": "56350590400", "AffiliationID": "60025858", "AffiliationName": "ETH Z\u00fcrich, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology"}, "7201569959": {"Name": "Dalton R.C.", "AuthorID": "7201569959", "AffiliationID": "60004636", "AffiliationName": "Department of Architecture and Built Environment, Northumbria University"}}}
