Previously we found that adenocarcinoma (A549.B2) cells favored wild-type (WT) mtDNA, whereas rhabdomyosarcoma (RD.Myo) cells favored mutant (m3243G) mtDNA. Mitochondrial quality control (mtQC) can purge the cells of dysfunctional mitochondria via mitochondrial dynamics and mitophagy and appears to offer the perfect solution to the human diseases caused by mutant mtDNA. In A549.B2 and RD.Myo cybrids, with various mutant mtDNA levels, mtQC was explored together with macroautophagy/autophagy and bioenergetic profile. The 2 types of tumor-derived cell lines differed in bioenergetic profile and mitophagy, but not in autophagy. A549.B2 cybrids displayed upregulation of mitophagy, increased mtDNA removal, mitochondrial fragmentation and mitochondrial depolarization on incubation with oligomycin, parameters that correlated with mutant load. Conversely, heteroplasmic RD.Myo lines had lower mitophagic markers that negatively correlated with mutant load, combined with a fully polarized and highly fused mitochondrial network. These findings indicate that pathological mutant mitochondrial DNA can modulate mitochondrial dynamics and mitophagy in a cell-type dependent manner and thereby offer an explanation for the persistence and accumulation of deleterious variants.", "AuthorKeywords": ["A549.B2 adenocarcinoma cells", "autophagy", "mitochondria", "mitochondrial dynamics", "mitochondrial quality control", "mitophagy", "mutation-m3243G", "pathological mtDNA", "RD.Myo rhabdomyosarcoma cells"], "IndexKeywords": ["A549 Cells", "Autophagy", "Cytoplasm", "DNA, Mitochondrial", "Energy Metabolism", "Humans", "Microtubule-Associated Proteins", "Mitochondria", "Mitochondrial Degradation", "Mutation", "Oligomycins", "Sequestosome-1 Protein"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84990190553", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"22135322600": {"Name": "Malena A.", "AuthorID": "22135322600", "AffiliationID": "60000481", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurosciences, University of Padova"}, "35409888200": {"Name": "Pantic B.", "AuthorID": "35409888200", "AffiliationID": "60000481", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurosciences, University of Padova"}, "57163552500": {"Name": "Borgia D.", "AuthorID": "57163552500", "AffiliationID": "60000481", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurosciences, University of Padova"}, "7004504821": {"Name": "Vergani L.", "AuthorID": "7004504821", "AffiliationID": "60000481", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurosciences, University of Padova"}, "7003889076": {"Name": "Sgarbi G.", "AuthorID": "7003889076", "AffiliationID": "60028218", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomedical and Neuromotor Sciences, University of Bologna"}, "7006081443": {"Name": "Solaini G.", "AuthorID": "7006081443", "AffiliationID": "60028218", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomedical and Neuromotor Sciences, University of Bologna"}, "6603935912": {"Name": "Baracca A.", "AuthorID": "6603935912", "AffiliationID": "60028218", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomedical and Neuromotor Sciences, University of Bologna"}, "7004330316": {"Name": "Holt I.J.", "AuthorID": "7004330316", "AffiliationID": "60015879", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council, Mill Hill Laboratory"}, "7004454164": {"Name": "Spinazzola A.", "AuthorID": "7004454164", "AffiliationID": "60015879", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council, Mill Hill Laboratory"}, "6603447034": {"Name": "Perissinotto E.", "AuthorID": "6603447034", "AffiliationID": "60000481", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiac, Thoracic and Vascular Sciences, Biostatistics, Epidemiology and Public Health Unit, University of Padova"}, "7006653510": {"Name": "Sandri M.", "AuthorID": "7006653510", "AffiliationID": "60073808", "AffiliationName": "Venetian Institute of Molecular Medicine"}}}
