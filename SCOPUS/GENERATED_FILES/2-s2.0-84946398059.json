This paper presents the development and testing of multi-source flow model for predicting the entire flow conditions such as pressure, temperature, fluid phase and CO2 composition throughout the pipeline network and the delivery to the storage site. The model also accounts for pipeline elevation and periodic variations in feed source flow rate, for example as a result of the ramping up or ramping down of power production from coal fired power stations connected to the pipeline network. The ability to produce the above information is of vital importance given the large impact of the stream impurities on the CO2 phase behaviour and their physiochemical interactions with the pipeline material of construction, compressor power requirements and the storage reservoir performance.", "AuthorKeywords": ["CCS pipeline transportation", "Multi-source network", "Thermo-hydraulic model"], "IndexKeywords": ["Coal fired power station", "Development and testing", "Multi-Sources", "Multiple emission sources", "Periodic variation", "Physio-chemical interaction", "Pipe-line transportations", "Thermo-hydraulic model"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84946398059", "SubjectAreas": [["Pollution", "ENVI", "2310"], ["Energy (all)", "ENER", "2100"], ["Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering", "ENGI", "2209"], ["Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law", "ENVI", "2308"]], "AuthorData": {"57214631878": {"Name": "Brown S.", "AuthorID": "57214631878", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "7003505415": {"Name": "Mahgerefteh H.", "AuthorID": "7003505415", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "26531554000": {"Name": "Martynov S.", "AuthorID": "26531554000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "55921743100": {"Name": "Sundara V.", "AuthorID": "55921743100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "35775476400": {"Name": "Dowell N.M.", "AuthorID": "35775476400", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Process Systems Engineering, Imperial College London"}}}
