This complex immune remodeling affects the adaptive immune system and the CD8+ T cell compartment in particular, leading to the accumulation of terminally differentiated T cells, which can rapidly exert their effector functions at the expenses of a limited proliferative potential. In this review, we will discuss evidence suggesting that senescent \u03b1\u03b2CD8+ T cells acquire the hallmarks of innate-like T cells and use recently acquired NK cell receptors as an alternative mechanism to mediate rapid effector functions. These cells concomitantly lose expression of co-stimulatory receptors and exhibit decreased T cell receptor signaling, suggesting a functional shift away from antigen-specific activation. The convergence of innate and adaptive features in senescent T cells challenges the classic division between innate and adaptive immune systems. Innate-like T cells are particularly important for stress and tumor surveillance, and we propose a new role for these cells in aging, where the acquisition of innate-like functions may represent a beneficial adaptation to an increased burden of malignancy with age, although it may also pose a higher risk of autoimmune disorders.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Aging", "Immunosenescence", "Innate-like T lymphocytes", "Natural killer receptors", "T cell receptor"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85006160492", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"]], "AuthorData": {"57214263206": {"Name": "Pereira B.", "AuthorID": "57214263206", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London"}, "7006856048": {"Name": "Akbar A.", "AuthorID": "7006856048", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London"}}}
