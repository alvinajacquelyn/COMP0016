To this purpose, Energy-Based Models for Knowledge Graphs that embed entities and relations in continuous vector spaces have been largely used. The main limitation in their applicability lies in the parameter learning phase, which may require a large amount of time for converging to optimal solutions. In this article, we first propose an unified view on different Energy-Based Embedding Models. Hence, for improving the model training phase, we propose the adoption of adaptive learning rates. We show that, by adopting adaptive learning rates during training, we can improve the efficiency of the parameter learning process by an order of magnitude, while leading to more accurate link prediction models in a significantly lower number of iterations. We extensively evaluate the proposed learning procedure on a variety of new models: our result show a significant improvement over state-of-the-art link prediction methods on two large Knowledge Graphs, namely WordNet and Freebase.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Energy-based embedding models", "Link predictions", "RDF knowledge graphs"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adaptive learning rates", "Energy-based", "Energy-based models", "Knowledge graphs", "Learning procedures", "Link prediction", "Number of iterations", "Parameter learning"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84978743290", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Information Systems", "COMP", "1710"], ["Hardware and Architecture", "COMP", "1708"], ["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"], ["Artificial Intelligence", "COMP", "1702"]], "AuthorData": {"36617521100": {"Name": "Minervini P.", "AuthorID": "36617521100", "AffiliationID": "60022778", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University of Bari"}, "49861247200": {"Name": "d\u2019Amato C.", "AuthorID": "49861247200", "AffiliationID": "60022778", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University of Bari"}, "6602096916": {"Name": "Fanizzi N.", "AuthorID": "6602096916", "AffiliationID": "60022778", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University of Bari"}}}
