Using data from a pilot skills\u2013building intervention for MSWs in Lima, Peru, an analysis of the economic characteristics of 209 MSWs is presented. The majority reported livable incomes with median earnings of US$250 per month, 83% earning above the urban poverty line. Interestingly, non-sex work was also an important source of income, especially for the high-earning MSWs. Spending data revealed that a large portion of income went to necessities (55%), luxuries (11%), and gifts (11%), with less toward savings (5%) and studies (1%). Such data on MSWs\u2019 earnings and spending, which suggest that a lack of overall income is not the MSW\u2019s main impediment to escaping poverty, could direct future poverty alleviation and health improvement programs in this key population.", "AuthorKeywords": ["economy", "income", "Lima", "male sex worker (MSW)", "Peru", "spending"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85044730185", "SubjectAreas": [["Arts and Humanities (all)", "ARTS", "1200"], ["Social Sciences (all)", "SOCI", "3300"]], "AuthorData": {"57118962100": {"Name": "George P.", "AuthorID": "57118962100", "AffiliationID": "107642944", "AffiliationName": "Texas Children\u2019s Hospital"}, "35298563000": {"Name": "Bayer A.", "AuthorID": "35298563000", "AffiliationID": "60071237", "AffiliationName": "Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia"}, "57188860648": {"Name": "Bazo-Alvarez J.", "AuthorID": "57188860648", "AffiliationID": "120477475", "AffiliationName": "Peruvian Research Institute of Educational and Social Psychology (PSYCOPERU)"}}}
