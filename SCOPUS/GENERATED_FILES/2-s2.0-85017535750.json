In contrast, in low- and middle-income countries, medical training and in particular nephrology training has lagged behind owing to resource limitations. Some of the challenges to adequately provide training to health care professionals in low- and middle-income countries include shortage of teaching faculty, difficulty in developing curricula to meet regional needs, and a lack of resources to provide competency-based medical education. The task of providing nephrology education becomes even harder when it comes to training physicians and health care workers to manage patients with complex kidney diseases without adequate infrastructure, government support, or proper health care policies. The nephrology training curriculum for low- and middle-income countries ideally should focus on local and regional needs, implementation of preventive measures for risk modification, education of a multidisciplinary health care workforce, raising general awareness of kidney disease, and optimizing the use of available resources. The ultimate goal being overall better recognition and care for patients with kidney disease.", "AuthorKeywords": ["chronic kidney disease", "health care", "low middle income countries", "Nephrology education", "training"], "IndexKeywords": ["Education, Medical, Continuing", "Health Resources", "Humans", "Nephrology", "Program Evaluation", "Renal Insufficiency, Chronic"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85017535750", "SubjectAreas": [["Nephrology", "MEDI", "2727"]], "AuthorData": {"6602218907": {"Name": "Vachharajani T.J.", "AuthorID": "6602218907", "AffiliationID": "60014232", "AffiliationName": "Division of Nephrology, W.
