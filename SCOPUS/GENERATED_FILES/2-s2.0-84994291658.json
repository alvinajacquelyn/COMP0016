While secretion has been implicated in the transfer of many proteins, including prions and \u03b1-synuclein, tunneling nanotubes (TNTs) have also been demonstrated for prions and mutant Huntingtin. Here, we provide further evidence that Tau aggregates, which have been demonstrated to predominantly be transferred via secretion, can also be found in TNTs. Additionally, cells that have taken up Tau have increased TNT formation. Coupled with previous evidence that other amyloidogenic aggregates also induce TNT formation we propose that misfolded protein aggregates can, through a common mechanism, promote the formation of TNTs and thereby their own intercellular transfer, contributing to the propagation of pathology.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "HeLa Cells", "Humans", "Mice", "Nanotubes", "Neurodegenerative Diseases", "Prion Proteins", "tau Proteins"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84994291658", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"54961026000": {"Name": "Abounit S.", "AuthorID": "54961026000", "AffiliationID": "60001772", "AffiliationName": "Unit\u00e9 Trafic Membranaire et Pathogen\u00e8se, Institut Pasteur"}, "37027458100": {"Name": "Victoria G.", "AuthorID": "37027458100", "AffiliationID": "60001772", "AffiliationName": "Unit\u00e9 Trafic Membranaire et Pathogen\u00e8se, Institut Pasteur"}, "7003821944": {"Name": "Zurzolo C.", "AuthorID": "7003821944", "AffiliationID": "60001772", "AffiliationName": "Unit\u00e9 Trafic Membranaire et Pathogen\u00e8se, Institut Pasteur"}, "35787487600": {"Name": "Wu J.", "AuthorID": "35787487600", "AffiliationID": "60027565", "AffiliationName": "Taub Institute, Columbia University Medical Center"}, "35393105600": {"Name": "Duff K.", "AuthorID": "35393105600", "AffiliationID": "60027565", "AffiliationName": "Taub Institute, Columbia University Medical Center"}}}
