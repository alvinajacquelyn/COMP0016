A previously successful intervention to promote walking by altering PBC has been adapted for delivery in general practice. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of this intervention on Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) constructs in this context. Methods: Cluster randomized controlled trial, with n= 315 general practice patients. Practice nurses and Healthcare Assistants delivered a self-regulation intervention or information provision (control). Questionnaires assessed TPB variables at baseline, post-intervention, 6 weeks and 6 months. Walking was measured by pedometer. Results: The control group reported significantly higher subjective norm at all follow-up time points. There were no significant differences between the two groups in PBC, intention, attitude or walking behavior. TPB variables significantly predicted intentions to walk more, but not objective walking behavior, after accounting for clustering. Conclusion: The lack of effect of the intervention was probably due to a failure to maintain intervention fidelity, and the unsuitability of the behavior change techniques included in the intervention for the population investigated. Practice implications: This previously successful intervention was not successful when delivered in this context, calling into question whether practice nurses are best placed to deliver such interventions.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Intervention", "Mediators", "Physical activity", "Self-efficacy", "Theory of Planned Behavior", "Walking"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Behavior Therapy", "Female", "General Practice", "Health Behavior", "Health Promotion", "Humans", "Intention", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Psychological Theory", "Walking"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84933280011", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"37062336300": {"Name": "Williams S.L.", "AuthorID": "37062336300", "AffiliationID": "60017326", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Technology Enabled Health Research, Coventry University"}, "7004779970": {"Name": "Michie S.", "AuthorID": "7004779970", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College"}, "7201678930": {"Name": "Dale J.", "AuthorID": "7201678930", "AffiliationID": "60000064, 60022020", "AffiliationName": "Division of Health Sciences, Warwick Medical School, University of Warwick"}, "7004043268": {"Name": "Stallard N.", "AuthorID": "7004043268", "AffiliationID": "60000064, 60022020", "AffiliationName": "Division of Health Sciences, Warwick Medical School, University of Warwick"}, "7203015854": {"Name": "French D.P.", "AuthorID": "7203015854", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "Manchester Centre for Health Psychology"}}}
