In this work,we propose a novel approach for pharmacokinetic modelling with significantly reduced PET acquisition time,by incorporating the blood flow information from simultaneously acquired arterial spin labelling (ASL) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). A relationship is established between blood flow,measured by ASL,and the transfer rate constant from plasma to tissue of the PET tracer,leading to modified PET kinetic models with ASL-derived flow information. Evaluation on clinical amyloid imaging data from an Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) study shows that the proposed approach with the simplified reference tissue model can achieve amyloid burden estimation from 30min [18F]florbetapir PET data and 5min simultaneous ASL MR data,which is comparable with the estimation from 60 min PET data (mean error= \u22120.03). Conversely,standardised uptake value ratio (SUVR),the alternative measure from the data showed a positive bias in areas of higher amyloid burden (mean error= 0.07).", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Acquisition time", "Arterial spin labelling", "Clinical practices", "Flow informations", "Pharmacokinetic analysis", "Positron emission tomography (PET)", "Reference tissue model", "Transfer rate constants"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84996599539", "SubjectAreas": [["Theoretical Computer Science", "MATH", "2614"], ["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"]], "AuthorData": {"57212176569": {"Name": "Scott C.J.", "AuthorID": "57212176569", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Translational Imaging Group, CMIC, University College London"}, "55211821500": {"Name": "Jiao J.", "AuthorID": "55211821500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Translational Imaging Group, CMIC, University College London"}, "22980645100": {"Name": "Melbourne A.", "AuthorID": "22980645100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Translational Imaging Group, CMIC, University College London"}, "6602233595": {"Name": "Ourselin S.", "AuthorID": "6602233595", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dementia Research Centre, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "7103177641": {"Name": "Schott J.M.", "AuthorID": "7103177641", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dementia Research Centre, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "7005479075": {"Name": "Hutton B.F.", "AuthorID": "7005479075", "AffiliationID": "60011664", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Radiation Physics, University of Wollongong"}}}
