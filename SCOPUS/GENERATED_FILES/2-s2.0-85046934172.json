The DSC reveals very small differences in the phase-transition temperatures for both compounds. The IR and Raman spectroscopies indicate different frequencies of the vibrational modes that involve a nitrogen atom. The temperature-dependent IR and Raman spectra also show a tiny isotope effect on the properties and temperature of the phase transition. The EPR measurements are performed for both compounds doped with small amount of paramagnetic Mn2+ ions. The obtained continuous-wave Mn2+ EPR spectra of the disordered phase are very similar for both frameworks, whereas the temperature dependence of the zero-field splitting parameter indicates a slightly different distortion of the MnO6 octahedra in the low-temperature phase. The EPR line width analysis reveals that the activation energy of the (CH3)2NH2+ cation hopping in the disordered phase is 0.21 eV for both compounds. The 15N NMR spectroscopy measurements of the framework containing the 15N isotope are used to directly probe this motion. The obtained temperature dependence of the spin-lattice relaxation time is approximated using the same value of the activation energy as determined from the EPR spectroscopy. The negligible nitrogen isotope effect indicates an order-disorder nature of the phase transitions in the investigated compounds.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Electron paramagnetic resonances (EPR)", "IR and Raman spectroscopy", "Low temperature phase", "Order-disorder nature", "Spectroscopic studies", "Temperature dependence", "Temperature dependent", "Zero-field splitting parameters"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85046934172", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Energy (all)", "ENER", "2100"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"], ["Surfaces, Coatings and Films", "MATE", "2508"]], "AuthorData": {"55865561500": {"Name": "\u0160imenas M.", "AuthorID": "55865561500", "AffiliationID": "60059987", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Physics, Vilnius University"}, "56610279300": {"Name": "Dagys L.", "AuthorID": "56610279300", "AffiliationID": "60059987", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Physics, Vilnius University"}, "57193078089": {"Name": "Balevi\u010dius V.", "AuthorID": "57193078089", "AffiliationID": "60059987", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Physics, Vilnius University"}, "7003687871": {"Name": "Banys J.", "AuthorID": "7003687871", "AffiliationID": "60059987", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Physics, Vilnius University"}, "36905137400": {"Name": "Ptak M.", "AuthorID": "36905137400", "AffiliationID": "60089023, 60006353", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Low Temperature and Structure Research, Polish Academy of Sciences"}, "15725818100": {"Name": "Maczka M.", "AuthorID": "15725818100", "AffiliationID": "60089023, 60006353", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Low Temperature and Structure Research, Polish Academy of Sciences"}, "56537318000": {"Name": "Khan A.", "AuthorID": "56537318000", "AffiliationID": "60008042", "AffiliationName": "Felix Bloch Institute for Solid State Physics, Leipzig University"}, "6602593839": {"Name": "Bertmer M.", "AuthorID": "6602593839", "AffiliationID": "60008042", "AffiliationName": "Felix Bloch Institute for Solid State Physics, Leipzig University"}, "6701687163": {"Name": "V\u00f6lkel G.", "AuthorID": "6701687163", "AffiliationID": "60008042", "AffiliationName": "Felix Bloch Institute for Solid State Physics, Leipzig University"}, "36875147700": {"Name": "P\u00f6ppl A.", "AuthorID": "36875147700", "AffiliationID": "60008042", "AffiliationName": "Felix Bloch Institute for Solid State Physics, Leipzig University"}}}
