This study tested the hypothesis that Sherpas exposed to hypobaric hypoxia on ascent to 5,300 m develop increased microcirculatory blood flow as a means of maintaining tissue oxygen delivery. Incident dark-field imaging was used to obtain images of the sublingual microcirculation from 64 Sherpas and 69 lowlanders. Serial measurements were obtained from participants undertaking an ascent from baseline testing (35 m or 1,300 m) to Everest base camp (5,300 m) and following subsequent descent in Kathmandu (1,300 m). Microcirculatory flow index and heterogeneity index were used to provide indexes of microcirculatory flow, while capillary density was assessed using small vessel density. Sherpas demonstrated significantly greater microcirculatory blood flow at Everest base camp, but not at baseline testing or on return in Kathmandu, than lowlanders. Additionally, blood flow exhibited greater homogeneity at 5,300 and 1,300 m (descent) in Sherpas than lowlanders. Sublingual small vessel density was not different between the two cohorts at baseline testing or at 1,300 m; however, at 5,300 m, capillary density was up to 30% greater in Sherpas. These data suggest that Sherpas can maintain a significantly greater microcirculatory flow per unit time and flow per unit volume of tissue at high altitude than lowlanders. These findings support the notion that peripheral vascular factors at the microcirculatory level may be important in the process of adaptation to hypoxia.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Acclimatization", "Adaptation, Physiological", "Adult", "Altitude", "Blood Flow Velocity", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Microcirculation", "Middle Aged", "Mouth Floor", "Nepal", "United Kingdom", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85027504959", "SubjectAreas": [["Physiology", "BIOC", "1314"], ["Physiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2737"]], "AuthorData": {"55895040200": {"Name": "Gilbert-Kawai E.", "AuthorID": "55895040200", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60172674", "AffiliationName": "University College London Centre for Altitude, Space, and Extreme Environment Medicine, University College London, Hospitals National Institute for Health Research Biomedical Research Centre, Institute of Sport and Exercise Health"}, "57076772000": {"Name": "Coppel J.", "AuthorID": "57076772000", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60172674", "AffiliationName": "University College London Centre for Altitude, Space, and Extreme Environment Medicine, University College London, Hospitals National Institute for Health Research Biomedical Research Centre, Institute of Sport and Exercise Health"}, "57195368074": {"Name": "Court J.", "AuthorID": "57195368074", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60172674", "AffiliationName": "University College London Centre for Altitude, Space, and Extreme Environment Medicine, University College London, Hospitals National Institute for Health Research Biomedical Research Centre, Institute of Sport and Exercise Health"}, "6504830297": {"Name": "Van Der Kaaij J.", "AuthorID": "6504830297", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60172674", "AffiliationName": "University College London Centre for Altitude, Space, and Extreme Environment Medicine, University College London, Hospitals National Institute for Health Research Biomedical Research Centre, Institute of Sport and Exercise Health"}, "57218952916": {"Name": "Vercueil A.", "AuthorID": "57218952916", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60172674", "AffiliationName": "University College London Centre for Altitude, Space, and Extreme Environment Medicine, University College London, Hospitals National Institute for Health Research Biomedical Research Centre, Institute of Sport and Exercise Health"}, "7006359064": {"Name": "Feelisch M.", "AuthorID": "7006359064", "AffiliationID": "60025287", "AffiliationName": "Integrative Physiology and Critical Illness Group, Clinical and Experimental Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton"}, "16052616700": {"Name": "Levett D.", "AuthorID": "16052616700", "AffiliationID": "60025287", "AffiliationName": "Integrative Physiology and Critical Illness Group, Clinical and Experimental Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton"}, "35458587700": {"Name": "Mythen M.", "AuthorID": "35458587700", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60172674", "AffiliationName": "University College London Centre for Altitude, Space, and Extreme Environment Medicine, University College London, Hospitals National Institute for Health Research Biomedical Research Centre, Institute of Sport and Exercise Health"}, "55348894800": {"Name": "Grocott M.P.", "AuthorID": "55348894800", "AffiliationID": "60025287", "AffiliationName": "Integrative Physiology and Critical Illness Group, Clinical and Experimental Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton"}, "24594583700": {"Name": "Martin D.", "AuthorID": "24594583700", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60172674", "AffiliationName": "University College London Centre for Altitude, Space, and Extreme Environment Medicine, University College London, Hospitals National Institute for Health Research Biomedical Research Centre, Institute of Sport and Exercise Health"}}}
