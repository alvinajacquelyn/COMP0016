A three-dimensional (3D) collagen model was developed using plastic compression, which produces dense, cellular, mechanically strong native collagen structures. Osteoblast cells (MG-63) and magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) were incorporated into collagen gels to produce a range of cell-laden models. A magnetic bio-reactor to support cell growth under static magnetic fields (SMFs) was designed and fabricated by 3D printing. The influences of SMFs on cell proliferation, differentiation, extracellular matrix production, mineralisation and gene expression were evaluated. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) further determined the effects of SMFs on the expression of runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2), osteonectin (ON), and bone morphogenic proteins 2 and 4 (BMP-2 and BMP-4). Results demonstrate that SMFs, IONPs and the collagen matrix can stimulate the proliferation, alkaline phosphatase production and mineralisation of MG-63 cells, by influencing matrix/cell interactions and encouraging the expression of Runx2, ON, BMP-2 and BMP-4. Therefore, the collagen model developed here not only offers a novel 3D bone model to better understand the effect of magnetic stimulation on osteogenesis, but also paves the way for further applications in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Bioreactors", "Bone Matrix", "Bone Regeneration", "Cell Culture Techniques", "Cell Differentiation", "Cell Line, Tumor", "Collagen", "Fractures, Bone", "Humans", "Magnetic Field Therapy", "Magnets", "Osteoblasts", "Osteogenesis", "Printing, Three-Dimensional", "Tissue Engineering"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85056054215", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"57204541287": {"Name": "Yuan Z.", "AuthorID": "57204541287", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London, Torrington Place"}, "35242219300": {"Name": "Huang J.", "AuthorID": "35242219300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London, Torrington Place"}, "55253894900": {"Name": "Memarzadeh K.", "AuthorID": "55253894900", "AffiliationID": "112776266", "AffiliationName": "Orthopaedic Research UK, Furlong House"}, "54585983600": {"Name": "Stephen A.", "AuthorID": "54585983600", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Dentistry, Barts & The London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London"}, "7003425470": {"Name": "Allaker R.", "AuthorID": "7003425470", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Dentistry, Barts & The London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London"}, "55574210357": {"Name": "Brown R.", "AuthorID": "55574210357", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Tissue Repair and Engineering Centre, University College London, Stanmore Campus"}}}
