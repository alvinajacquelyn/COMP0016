The epicardium is a source of several cardiovascular cell types during heart development and is widely regarded as a resident progenitor population, which becomes dormant during adulthood. In adult mice, MI induces epicardial reactivation characterized by an upregulation of fetal genes and subsequent epicardium derived cell (EPDC) proliferation, migration, and differentiation. Determining whether the epicardium can be therapeutically targeted following cardiovascular disease requires an in vitro system for the study of adult human EPDCs (hEPDCs). This protocol describes techniques to establish and maintain human epicardium explant cultures from patient-derived right atrial appendage biopsies and documents methods to probe the resultant outgrowth of hEPDCs. The model facilitates a high-throughput approach to either genetic or chemical phenotypic screening for drug-like modifiers of hEPDC activation and potential cell fate.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Epicardium", "Heart", "hEPDCs", "Human", "Regeneration"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Cell Adhesion", "Cell Culture Techniques", "Cell Differentiation", "Cell Movement", "Cell Proliferation", "Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition", "Heart Atria", "Humans", "Mice", "Myocardial Infarction", "Myocardium", "Myocytes, Cardiac", "Pericardium", "Phenotype", "Stem Cells", "Transforming Growth Factor beta"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84988458257", "SubjectAreas": [["Developmental Biology", "BIOC", "1309"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"57195258982": {"Name": "Clunie-O\u2019connor C.", "AuthorID": "57195258982", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Chemistry Research Laboratory"}, "57194786909": {"Name": "Riley P.R.", "AuthorID": "57194786909", "AffiliationID": "60002634", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physiology, Anatomy and Genetics, University of Oxford"}, "8363206300": {"Name": "Smits A.M.", "AuthorID": "8363206300", "AffiliationID": "60015618", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Cell Biology, Leiden University Medical Centre"}, "6701388504": {"Name": "Goumans M.J.", "AuthorID": "6701388504", "AffiliationID": "60015618", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Cell Biology, Leiden University Medical Centre"}, "35412194900": {"Name": "Antoniades C.", "AuthorID": "35412194900", "AffiliationID": "60026851, 60008323", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, University of Oxford, John Radcliffe Hospital"}, "7402736387": {"Name": "Russell A.J.", "AuthorID": "7402736387", "AffiliationID": "60002634", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacology, University of Oxford"}, "7103223278": {"Name": "Yellon D.M.", "AuthorID": "7103223278", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "The Hatter Cardiovascular Institute, University College"}}}
