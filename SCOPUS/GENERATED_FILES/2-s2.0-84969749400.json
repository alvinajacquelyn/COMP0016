The departure point for the present article is the earliest phase of these distributions. The potential for multi-sited ethnographic approaches to illuminate the history and significance of such collections is explored. It is argued that, through such analyses, it is possible to chart shifting tensions in the status of objects as they were collected, circulated and re-evaluated between the field and the museum. The article concludes by suggesting that multi-sited frameworks may also be able to re-animate \u2018orphaned\u2019 archaeological collections, some of which could be at risk from commercial sale.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Egyptian archaeology", "history of collections", "Multi-sited ethnography", "museum"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84969749400", "SubjectAreas": [["Archeology (arts and humanities)", "ARTS", "1204"], ["Archeology", "SOCI", "3302"], ["Earth and Planetary Sciences (all)", "EART", "1900"]], "AuthorData": {"55937136900": {"Name": "Stevenson A.", "AuthorID": "55937136900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "57189362592": {"Name": "Libonati E.", "AuthorID": "57189362592", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "57189370376": {"Name": "Williams A.", "AuthorID": "57189370376", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "University of Oxford"}}}
