In this paper, three subconnected hybrid beamforming structures with different combinations of phase shifters and switches will be considered. Firstly we assume that perfect channel state information (CSI) is available and the wireless channel follows uncorrelated Rayleigh fading model. Then, we derive the closed-form expressions of the low-complexity beamformers and their asymptotic achievable sum-rates. Based on the proposed beamformers, we develop quantized hybrid beamforming and channel estimation techniques for correlated Rayleigh fading channels. These methods rely on designing novel RF codebooks and they can be used in both CSI acquisition and data transmission phases. The proposed methods benefit from low computational complexity, low signaling overhead and robustness to estimation errors. Moreover, they are applicable to both frequency and time division duplex systems.", "AuthorKeywords": ["hybrid beamforming", "Massive MIMO", "phase shifter selection", "quantized beamforming."], "IndexKeywords": ["Closed-form expression", "Correlated Rayleigh fading channels", "Hybrid beamforming", "Low computational complexity", "Massive multiple-input- multiple-output system (MIMO)", "Perfect channel state information", "Quantized beamforming", "Time-division duplex systems"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85063480250", "SubjectAreas": [["Information Systems and Management", "DECI", "1802"], ["Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment", "ENER", "2105"], ["Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality", "ENGI", "2213"], ["Signal Processing", "COMP", "1711"], ["Modeling and Simulation", "MATH", "2611"], ["Instrumentation", "PHYS", "3105"], ["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"]], "AuthorData": {"55263519600": {"Name": "Payami S.", "AuthorID": "55263519600", "AffiliationID": "60019656", "AffiliationName": "Heriot-Watt University"}, "6701538512": {"Name": "Sellathurai M.", "AuthorID": "6701538512", "AffiliationID": "60019656", "AffiliationName": "Heriot-Watt University"}, "57208000868": {"Name": "Masouro C.", "AuthorID": "57208000868", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College"}}}
