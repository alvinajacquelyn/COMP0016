To date, nystagmus, cortical visual impairment, impairment of central vision, optic nerve hypoplasia, and optic atrophy have been described in this condition. This article describes the retinal findings in a patient with biallelic deleterious sequence variants in BRAT1. Materials and methods: Case report of a child with biallelic sequence variants in the BRAT1 gene. Results: This patient had developmental delay, microcephaly, nystagmus, and esotropia, and full-field electroretinography (ERG) revealed an inner retinal dystrophy. She was found on exome sequencing to have compound heterozygous sequence variants in the BRAT1 gene: one maternally inherited frameshift variant (c.294dupA, predicting p.Leu99Thrfs*92), which has previously been reported, and one paternally inherited novel missense variant (c.803G>A, p.Arg268His), which is likely to affect protein function. Conclusions: Biallelic sequence variants in BRAT1 have been reported to cause a variety of ocular and systemic manifestations, but to our knowledge, this is the first report of inner retinal dysfunction manifest as selective loss of full-field ERG scotopic and photopic b-wave amplitudes.", "AuthorKeywords": ["BRAT1", "electroretinography", "retinal dystrophy"], "IndexKeywords": ["Developmental Disabilities", "Electroretinography", "Esotropia", "Female", "Frameshift Mutation", "High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing", "Humans", "Infant", "Microcephaly", "Mutation, Missense", "Nuclear Proteins", "Nystagmus, Pathologic", "Retinal Dystrophies"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85014437005", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"], ["Genetics (clinical)", "MEDI", "2716"]], "AuthorData": {"54917170600": {"Name": "Oatts J.T.", "AuthorID": "54917170600", "AffiliationID": "60023691", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, University of California, San Francisco"}, "7401893019": {"Name": "Duncan J.L.", "AuthorID": "7401893019", "AffiliationID": "60023691", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, University of California, San Francisco"}, "7005584365": {"Name": "Hoyt C.S.", "AuthorID": "7005584365", "AffiliationID": "60023691", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, University of California, San Francisco"}, "56573251100": {"Name": "Moore A.T.", "AuthorID": "56573251100", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Inherited Eye Disease and Medical Retina Service, Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "7006752703": {"Name": "Slavotinek A.M.", "AuthorID": "7006752703", "AffiliationID": "60023691", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatrics, Division of Genetics, University of California, San Francisco"}}}
