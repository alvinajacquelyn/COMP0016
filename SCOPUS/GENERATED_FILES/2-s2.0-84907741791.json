Though defined as a state, recent research has hinted at potential individual differences in engagement, meaning that employees differ in their tendencies to engage at work. This study investigated the effects of the Big Five personality traits, work-specific personality, and trait emotional intelligence, on work engagement among a sample of 1050 working adults. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses identified trait EI, openness to experience, interpersonal sensitivity, ambition, extraversion, adjustment, and conscientiousness as predictors of engagement. Trait EI predicted work engagement over and above personality. Practical and theoretical implications are discussed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Engagement", "Personality", "Trait EI"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84907741791", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychology (all)", "PSYC", "3200"]], "AuthorData": {"55450595700": {"Name": "Akhtar R.", "AuthorID": "55450595700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, UCL"}, "56378580800": {"Name": "Boustani L.", "AuthorID": "56378580800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, UCL"}, "24598393300": {"Name": "Tsivrikos D.", "AuthorID": "24598393300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, UCL"}, "8244744300": {"Name": "Chamorro-Premuzic T.", "AuthorID": "8244744300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, UCL"}}}
