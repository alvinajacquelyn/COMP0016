To address the increasing amount and complexity of data being submitted, an entirely upgraded version of the IPD-MHC Database was recently released to maintain IPD-MHC as the central platform for the comparison of curated MHC data. As a consequence, a new level of nomenclature standardisation is required between the different species to enable data submission and to allow the unambiguous inter- and intra-species comparison of alleles. However, any changes must retain the flexibility demanded by the unique biology of different taxonomic groups. Here, we describe the rationale for a standardised nomenclature system and summarise the changes that have been driven by the requirements of implementing the IPD-MHC database. This modified nomenclature system is essential to maintain the current functionality of IPD-MHC and provide a scalable future-proof database organisation to fully exploit the bioinformatic tools used for analysis.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Comparative MHC", "Database", "IPD-MHC", "MHC", "Nomenclature", "Variation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Alleles", "Animals", "Cattle", "Computational Biology", "Databases, Genetic", "High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing", "Histocompatibility Antigens", "Humans", "Major Histocompatibility Complex", "Sheep"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85050336888", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"]], "AuthorData": {"36167061300": {"Name": "Maccari G.", "AuthorID": "36167061300", "AffiliationID": "60020641", "AffiliationName": "Anthony Nolan Research Institute"}, "57209151912": {"Name": "Hammond J.A.", "AuthorID": "57209151912", "AffiliationID": "60027004", "AffiliationName": "The Pirbright Institute"}, "57198433717": {"Name": "Robinson J.", "AuthorID": "57198433717", "AffiliationID": "60109234", "AffiliationName": "UCL Cancer Institute, Royal Free Campus"}, "55942654100": {"Name": "Marsh S.G.E.", "AuthorID": "55942654100", "AffiliationID": "60109234", "AffiliationName": "UCL Cancer Institute, Royal Free Campus"}, "7005421550": {"Name": "Bontrop R.E.", "AuthorID": "7005421550", "AffiliationID": "60017403", "AffiliationName": "Biomedical Primate Research Centre"}, "7003409354": {"Name": "Otting N.", "AuthorID": "7003409354", "AffiliationID": "60017403", "AffiliationName": "Biomedical Primate Research Centre"}, "7005620496": {"Name": "de Groot N.G.", "AuthorID": "7005620496", "AffiliationID": "60017403", "AffiliationName": "Biomedical Primate Research Centre"}, "8948903400": {"Name": "Ho C.S.", "AuthorID": "8948903400", "AffiliationID": "100416891", "AffiliationName": "Gift of Life Michigan"}, "6701810212": {"Name": "Ballingall K.T.", "AuthorID": "6701810212", "AffiliationID": "60016146", "AffiliationName": "Moredun Research Institute"}}}
