While it has long been clear the mPTP is a druggable target, current agents are limited by off-target effects and low therapeutic efficacy. Therefore identification and development of novel inhibitors is necessary. To rapidly screen large compound libraries for novel mPTP modulators, a method was exploited to cryopreserve large batches of functionally active mitochondria from cells and tissues. The cryopreserved mitochondria maintained respiratory coupling and ATP synthesis, Ca2+ uptake and transmembrane potential. A high-throughput screen (HTS), using an assay of Ca2+-induced mitochondrial swelling in the cryopreserved mitochondria identified ER-000444793, a potent inhibitor of mPTP opening. Further evaluation using assays of Ca2+-induced membrane depolarisation and Ca2+ retention capacity also indicated that ER-000444793 acted as an inhibitor of the mPTP. ER-000444793 neither affected cyclophilin D (CypD) enzymatic activity, nor displaced of CsA from CypD protein, suggesting a mechanism independent of CypD inhibition. Here we identified a novel, CypD-independent inhibitor of the mPTP. The screening approach and compound described provides a workflow and additional tool to aid the search for novel mPTP modulators and to help understand its molecular nature.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adenosine Triphosphate", "Animals", "Cryopreservation", "Cyclophilins", "Energy Metabolism", "Female", "HeLa Cells", "High-Throughput Screening Assays", "Humans", "Mitochondria", "Mitochondrial Membrane Transport Proteins", "Rats", "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84998591763", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"54418552800": {"Name": "Briston T.", "AuthorID": "54418552800", "AffiliationID": "60018508", "AffiliationName": "UCL Collaboration Research Group, NGM-PCU, Eisai Ltd."}, "57192165495": {"Name": "Lewis S.", "AuthorID": "57192165495", "AffiliationID": "60018508", "AffiliationName": "UCL Collaboration Research Group, NGM-PCU, Eisai Ltd."}, "57192154652": {"Name": "Koglin M.", "AuthorID": "57192154652", "AffiliationID": "60018508", "AffiliationName": "UCL Collaboration Research Group, NGM-PCU, Eisai Ltd."}, "57192158832": {"Name": "Mistry K.", "AuthorID": "57192158832", "AffiliationID": "60018508", "AffiliationName": "UCL Collaboration Research Group, NGM-PCU, Eisai Ltd."}, "57192164305": {"Name": "Hartopp N.", "AuthorID": "57192164305", "AffiliationID": "60018508", "AffiliationName": "UCL Collaboration Research Group, NGM-PCU, Eisai Ltd."}, "57217408103": {"Name": "Staddon J.M.", "AuthorID": "57217408103", "AffiliationID": "60018508", "AffiliationName": "UCL Collaboration Research Group, NGM-PCU, Eisai Ltd."}, "57192158725": {"Name": "Roberts M.", "AuthorID": "57192158725", "AffiliationID": "60018508", "AffiliationName": "UCL Collaboration Research Group, NGM-PCU, Eisai Ltd."}, "16242433600": {"Name": "Powney B.", "AuthorID": "16242433600", "AffiliationID": "60018508", "AffiliationName": "UCL Collaboration Research Group, NGM-PCU, Eisai Ltd."}, "35790568100": {"Name": "Shen Y.", "AuthorID": "35790568100", "AffiliationID": "60012470", "AffiliationName": "Next Generation Systems CFU, Eisai Inc."}, "57192163644": {"Name": "Katsumata R.", "AuthorID": "57192163644", "AffiliationID": "60018508", "AffiliationName": "Next Generation Systems CFU, Eisai Co., Ltd"}, "57192159890": {"Name": "Fukumoto H.", "AuthorID": "57192159890", "AffiliationID": "60018508", "AffiliationName": "NGM-PCU, Eisai Co.
