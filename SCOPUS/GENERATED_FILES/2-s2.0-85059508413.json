We also explored whether these improvements would be greater than those experienced by an active comparison group that was read the same stories from books and a comparison group that continued with their usual classroom literacy practices. We used a quasi-experimental between-participants design: 194 participants took part, and classes (rather than participants) were randomly assigned to intervention conditions. Results showed that the storytelling group retold stories that were significantly longer and used a significantly wider range of vocabulary than both the group that was read the same stories and the comparison group at posttest and 3-month follow-up. The story-reading group scored significantly higher on an oral vocabulary test than the comparison group at follow-up.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85059508413", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["Linguistics and Language", "SOCI", "3310"]], "AuthorData": {"57205324733": {"Name": "Wright C.", "AuthorID": "57205324733", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "8125960600": {"Name": "Dunsmuir S.", "AuthorID": "8125960600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
