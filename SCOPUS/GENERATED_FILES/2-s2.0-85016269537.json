We compare, in a routine clinical setting, brand versus generic levetiracetam (LEV) bioequivalence in patients with epilepsy and also the clinical efficacy and tolerability of the substitution. Methods A prospective, open-label, non-randomized, steady-state, multiple-dose, bioequivalence study was conducted in 12 patients with epilepsy (5 females), with a mean age of 38.4 \u00b1 16.2 years. Patients treated with the brand LEV (Keppra; UCB Pharma) were closely followed for a four-week period and subsequently switched to a generic LEV (Pharmaten) and followed for another four-week period. Blood samples were collected at the end of each 4-week period, during a dose interval for each formulation, for LEV concentration measurements by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. Steady-state area under the curve (AUC) and peak plasma concentration (Cmax) data were subjected to conventional average bioequivalence analysis. Secondary clinical outcomes, including seizure frequency and adverse events, were recorded. Results Patients had epilepsy for a mean period of 14.1 \u00b1 10.6 years and the mean daily LEV dose was 2583.3 \u00b1 763.7 mg. The mean AUC \u00b1 SD and Cmax \u00b1 SD was 288.4 \u00b1 86.3 (mg/L) h and 37.8 \u00b1 10.4 mg/L respectively for brand LEV and 319.2 \u00b1 104.7 (mg/L) h and 41.6 \u00b1 12.3 mg/L respectively for the generic LEV. Statistic analysis showed no statistical significant difference in bioequivalence. Also, no change in seizures frequency and/or adverse events was recorded. Conclusions In our clinical setting, generic LEV was determined to be bioequivalent to brand LEV. Furthermore, seizures frequency or/and adverse events were not affected upon switching from brand to generic LEV.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Antiepileptic drug", "Bioequivalence", "Clinical practice", "Generic drug substitution", "Keppra", "Pharmacokinetics"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Anticonvulsants", "Drug Substitution", "Drugs, Generic", "Epilepsy", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Piracetam", "Prospective Studies", "Therapeutic Equivalency", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85016269537", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"15925775000": {"Name": "Markoula S.", "AuthorID": "15925775000", "AffiliationID": "60026075", "AffiliationName": "University Hospital of Ioannina, Department of Neurology"}, "35486991900": {"Name": "Chatzistefanidis D.", "AuthorID": "35486991900", "AffiliationID": "60026075", "AffiliationName": "University Hospital of Ioannina, Department of Neurology"}, "57193749754": {"Name": "Siarava E.", "AuthorID": "57193749754", "AffiliationID": "60026075", "AffiliationName": "University Hospital of Ioannina, Department of Neurology"}, "35418976800": {"Name": "Kyritsis A.P.", "AuthorID": "35418976800", "AffiliationID": "60026075", "AffiliationName": "University Hospital of Ioannina, Department of Neurology"}, "6603906815": {"Name": "Gatzonis S.", "AuthorID": "6603906815", "AffiliationID": "60067083, 60028900", "AffiliationName": "Medical School, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens"}, "23098142900": {"Name": "Siatouni A.", "AuthorID": "23098142900", "AffiliationID": "60067083, 60028900", "AffiliationName": "Medical School, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens"}, "56398397300": {"Name": "Verentzioti A.", "AuthorID": "56398397300", "AffiliationID": "60067083, 60028900", "AffiliationName": "Medical School, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens"}, "7005781451": {"Name": "Patsalos P.N.", "AuthorID": "7005781451", "AffiliationID": "60030943", "AffiliationName": "Epilepsy Society, Chalfont Centre for Epilepsy"}}}
