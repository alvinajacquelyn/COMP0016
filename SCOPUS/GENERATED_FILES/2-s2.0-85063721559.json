Design: Systematic review. Study sample: A search of two electronic data sources yielded 32 studies, which met the inclusion criteria. A quality assessment and two evidence-based practice (EBP) review rating schemes were used to grade studies. Results: Due to the heterogeneity of speech perception measures, CI device type and study design, comparisons were made by structured review. Conclusion: The quality of studies was found to be moderate to poor. Increasing T levels above behavioural threshold, or as a proportion of electrical dynamic range (EDR), has been demonstrated to improve perception of monosyllables in quiet and sentences in both quiet and in noise. Specific IIDR and IDR setting may improve perception of monosyllables in quiet and sentences in noise. However, no recommendation could be determined for setting rate of stimulation as speech perception varied significantly across rates examined. To optimise speech perception, a bespoke approach to parameter setting providing an individualised CI fitting is recommended; however, detail of how to optimise settings and the interactions between parameters is as yet unknown.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cochlear implants", "input dynamic range", "speech perception", "stimulation rate"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cochlear Implants", "Humans", "Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted", "Speech Perception"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85063721559", "SubjectAreas": [["Language and Linguistics", "ARTS", "1203"], ["Linguistics and Language", "SOCI", "3310"], ["Speech and Hearing", "HEAL", "3616"]], "AuthorData": {"6603814716": {"Name": "Nunn T.B.", "AuthorID": "6603814716", "AffiliationID": "60005518", "AffiliationName": "Guy\u2019s and St Thomas\u2019 NHS Trust, Hearing Implant Centre"}, "7401574526": {"Name": "Jiang D.", "AuthorID": "7401574526", "AffiliationID": "60005518", "AffiliationName": "Guy\u2019s and St Thomas\u2019 NHS Trust, Hearing Implant Centre"}, "7401860102": {"Name": "Green T.", "AuthorID": "7401860102", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Speech Hearing and Phonetic Sciences, University College London"}, "7006164240": {"Name": "Vickers D.A.", "AuthorID": "7006164240", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Speech Hearing and Phonetic Sciences, University College London"}, "35236315900": {"Name": "Boyle P.J.", "AuthorID": "35236315900", "AffiliationID": "100518520", "AffiliationName": "Advanced Bionics GmbH, European Research Centre"}}}
