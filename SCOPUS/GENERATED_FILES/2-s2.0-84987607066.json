Production optimisation in CHO cells hinges on analytical technologies such as the use of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to quantify genetic factors within the CHO genome and to detect the presence of contaminant organisms. PCR-based assays, whilst sensitive and accurate, are limited by (i) requiring lengthy sample preparation and (ii) a lack of standardisation. Results: In this study we directly assess for the first time the effect of CHO cellular material on quantitative PCR (qPCR) and end-point PCR (e-pPCR) when used to measure and detect copies of a CHO genomic locus and a mycoplasma sequence. We also perform the first head-to-head comparison of the performance of a conventional qPCR method to that of the novel linear regression of efficiency (LRE) method when used to perform absolute qPCR on CHO-derived material. LRE qPCR features the putatively universal \u2018CAL1\u2019 standard. Conclusions: We find that sample preparation is required for accurate quantitation of a genomic target locus, but mycoplasma DNA sequences can be detected in the presence of high concentrations of CHO cellular material. The LRE qPCR method matches performance of a conventional qPCR approach and as such we invite the synthetic biology community to adopt CAL1 as a synthetic biology calibration standard for qPCR.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Mammalian cells", "PCR", "Standardisation", "Synthetic biology"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84987607066", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"57189217807": {"Name": "Templar A.", "AuthorID": "57189217807", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemical Engineering, University College London"}, "56073499500": {"Name": "Marsh D.", "AuthorID": "56073499500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemical Engineering, University College London"}, "8856685700": {"Name": "Nesbeth D.", "AuthorID": "8856685700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemical Engineering, University College London"}}}
