Given that the range of energy flux is enough to obtain an approximation of the amount of energy produced, the purpose of this discretisation is to simplify the prediction task. A special kind of autoregressive models are considered, where the category to be predicted depends on both the previous values of energy flux and a set of meteorological variables estimated by numerical models. Apart from this, this paper introduces two different ways of adjusting the order of the autoregressive models, one based on nested cross-validation and the other one based on a dynamic window. The results show that these kind of models are able to predict the time series in an acceptable way, and that the dynamic window procedure leads to the best accuracy without needing the additional computational cost of adjusting the order of the model.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Autoregressive models", "Flux of energy", "Multi-class classification", "Wave energy prediction"], "IndexKeywords": ["Auto regressive models", "Computational costs", "Dynamic windows", "Meteorological variables", "Multi-class classification", "Nested cross validations", "Prediction tasks", "Wave energy"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84937678776", "SubjectAreas": [["Theoretical Computer Science", "MATH", "2614"], ["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"]], "AuthorData": {"23473354200": {"Name": "Guti\u00e9rrez P.", "AuthorID": "23473354200", "AffiliationID": "60003138", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science and Numerical Analysis, University of Cordoba"}, "24474144000": {"Name": "Fern\u00e1ndez J.", "AuthorID": "24474144000", "AffiliationID": "60003138", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science and Numerical Analysis, University of Cordoba"}, "35068542300": {"Name": "P\u00e9rez-Ortiz M.", "AuthorID": "35068542300", "AffiliationID": "60003138", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science and Numerical Analysis, University of Cordoba"}, "6603240334": {"Name": "Herv\u00e1s-Mart\u00ednez C.", "AuthorID": "6603240334", "AffiliationID": "60003138", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science and Numerical Analysis, University of Cordoba"}, "56732912600": {"Name": "Cornejo-Bueno L.", "AuthorID": "56732912600", "AffiliationID": "60027800", "AffiliationName": "Department of Signal Processing and Communications, Universidad de Alcal\u00e1"}, "22978729400": {"Name": "Alexandre-Cortizo E.", "AuthorID": "22978729400", "AffiliationID": "60027800", "AffiliationName": "Department of Signal Processing and Communications, Universidad de Alcal\u00e1"}, "12789591800": {"Name": "Salcedo-Sanz S.", "AuthorID": "12789591800", "AffiliationID": "60027800", "AffiliationName": "Department of Signal Processing and Communications, Universidad de Alcal\u00e1"}}}
