The ASRv1 precipitation generally agrees with the corrected DMI gauge-based precipitation measured at coastal or near-coastal stations in Greenland, but the corresponding data at Ikerasassuaq and Nuuk are not the case. ASRv1 precipitation at Summit, i.e., in a higher continental environment, is overestimated compared with the POSS observations. The North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO index and ASRv1 precipitation are moderately correlated over northern Greenland, the North Atlantic, and the Greenland Sea regions (0.32\u20130.49). It is presumed that local wind events have a larger influence on precipitation where smaller correlations occur. Suggested future work to understand discrepancies between ASRv1 and DMI precipitation fields in Greenland coastal regions is to include case studies of local wind events and corresponding precipitation variations utilizing in-situ measurements during both strong positive and negative NAO phases. At high-altitude and inland areas, further observations are needed to confirm the ASRv1 overestimation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Arctic", "Greenland", "North atlantic oscillation", "Precipitation"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85053909568", "SubjectAreas": [["Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics", "AGRI", "1105"], ["Aquatic Science", "AGRI", "1104"], ["Ecology", "ENVI", "2303"], ["Earth and Planetary Sciences (all)", "EART", "1900"]], "AuthorData": {"57194407220": {"Name": "Koyama T.", "AuthorID": "57194407220", "AffiliationID": "60006790", "AffiliationName": "Arctic Environment Research Center, National Institute of Polar Research"}, "6602079010": {"Name": "Stroeve J.", "AuthorID": "6602079010", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Polar Observation and Modelling, Earth Sciences, University College London"}}}
