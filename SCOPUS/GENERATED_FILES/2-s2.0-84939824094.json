The measured \u0394<inf>soln</inf>H<sup>A/Solvent</sup> data, along with published \u0394<inf>soln</inf>H<sup>A/Solvent</sup> values taken from the published literature for solutes dissolved in both chlorobenzene solvents, were converted to enthalpies of solvation, \u0394<inf>solv</inf>H<sup>A/Solvent</sup>, using standard thermodynamic equations. Abraham model correlations were developed from the experimental \u0394<inf>solv</inf>H<sup>A/Solvent</sup> data. The best derived correlations describe the experimental gas-to-chlorobenzene and gas-to-1,2-dichlorobenzene enthalpies of solvation to within standard deviations of 1.5 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup> and 1.9 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. Enthalpies of X-H\u22ef\u03c0 (X - O, N, and C) hydrogen bond formation of proton donor solutes (alcohols, amines, chlorinated hydrocarbons, etc.) with chlorobenzene and 1,2-dichlorobenzene were calculated based on the Abraham solvation equation. Obtained values are in good agreement with the results determined using conventional methods.", "AuthorKeywords": ["1,2-Dichlorobenzene", "Chlorobenzene", "Enthalpy of solution", "Enthalpy of solvation", "Hydrogen bonding", "Molecular interactions"], "IndexKeywords": ["1 ,2-dichlorobenzene", "Chlorinated hydrocarbon", "Chlorobenzene", "Effect of halogen substitution", "Enthalpy of solution", "Enthalpy of solvation", "Hydrogen-bond formation", "Thermodynamic equations"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84939824094", "SubjectAreas": [["Instrumentation", "PHYS", "3105"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"]], "AuthorData": {"8955366900": {"Name": "Varfolomeev M.A.", "AuthorID": "8955366900", "AffiliationID": "60070941", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physical Chemistry, Kazan Federal University"}, "26032659800": {"Name": "Rakipov I.T.", "AuthorID": "26032659800", "AffiliationID": "60070941", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physical Chemistry, Kazan Federal University"}, "56589691500": {"Name": "Khachatrian A.A.", "AuthorID": "56589691500", "AffiliationID": "60070941", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physical Chemistry, Kazan Federal University"}, "35496753700": {"Name": "Acree W.E.", "AuthorID": "35496753700", "AffiliationID": "60024438", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of North Texas"}, "56320564500": {"Name": "Brumfield M.", "AuthorID": "56320564500", "AffiliationID": "60024438", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of North Texas"}, "7202901240": {"Name": "Abraham M.H.", "AuthorID": "7202901240", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}}}
