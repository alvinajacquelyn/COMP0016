By exploring the structure of NRs natural ligands, the representative arotenoid ligands and RORs specific ligands share some chemical homologies which can be exploited to design a novel molecular structure characterized by a polycyclic core bearing a polar head and a hydrophobic tail. Compound MG 2778 (8), a cyclopenta[a]phenantrene derivative, was identified as lead compound which was chemically modified at position 2 in order to obtain a small library for preliminary SARs. Cell viability and estrogenic activity of compounds 7, 8, 19a, 30, 31 and 32 were evaluated to attest selectivity. The selected 7, 8, 19a and 31 compounds were assayed in a Gal4 UAS-Luc co-transfection system in order to determine their ability to modulate ROR\u03b3t activity in a cellular environment. They were evaluated as inverse agonists taken ursolic acid as reference compound. The potency of compounds was lower than that of ursolic acid, but their efficacy was similar. Compound 19a was the most active, significantly reducing ROR\u03b3t activity at low micromolar concentrations.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Autoimmune disorders", "Gal4 UAS-Luc co-transfection", "Inverse agonists", "NR ROR\u03b3t"], "IndexKeywords": ["Autoimmune Diseases", "Cell Cycle", "Cell Survival", "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug", "Drug Inverse Agonism", "HEK293 Cells", "Hep G2 Cells", "Humans", "Molecular Docking Simulation", "Molecular Structure", "Receptors, Retinoic Acid", "Steroids", "Structure-Activity Relationship", "Tumor Cells, Cultured"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85042234741", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Molecular Medicine", "BIOC", "1313"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Pharmaceutical Science", "PHAR", "3003"], ["Drug Discovery", "PHAR", "3002"], ["Clinical Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1308"], ["Organic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1605"]], "AuthorData": {"57198448258": {"Name": "Dal Pr\u00e0 M.", "AuthorID": "57198448258", "AffiliationID": "60000481", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmaceutical and Pharmacological Sciences, University of Padova"}, "16642041800": {"Name": "Carta D.", "AuthorID": "16642041800", "AffiliationID": "60000481", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmaceutical and Pharmacological Sciences, University of Padova"}, "56728860000": {"Name": "Fri\u00f3n-Herrera Y.", "AuthorID": "56728860000", "AffiliationID": "60000481", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmaceutical and Pharmacological Sciences, University of Padova"}, "57191095146": {"Name": "Paccagnella N.", "AuthorID": "57191095146", "AffiliationID": "60000481", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmaceutical and Pharmacological Sciences, University of Padova"}, "57191089930": {"Name": "Castellani G.", "AuthorID": "57191089930", "AffiliationID": "60000481", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmaceutical and Pharmacological Sciences, University of Padova"}, "7801626699": {"Name": "De Martin S.", "AuthorID": "7801626699", "AffiliationID": "60000481", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmaceutical and Pharmacological Sciences, University of Padova"}, "6701847281": {"Name": "Ferlin M.", "AuthorID": "6701847281", "AffiliationID": "60000481", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmaceutical and Pharmacological Sciences, University of Padova"}, "6602576918": {"Name": "Szabadkai G.", "AuthorID": "6602576918", "AffiliationID": "60000481", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of Padova"}, "55314392400": {"Name": "Suman M.", "AuthorID": "55314392400", "AffiliationID": "60000481", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of Padova"}}}
