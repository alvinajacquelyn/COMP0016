In this paper, we formulate and test a new psychological theory to account for this intuition. We combined previous semantic and psychological theorizing to propose that the key to the intuition is a relevance-driven, satisficing-bounded inferential connection between antecedent and consequent. To test our theory, we created a novel experimental paradigm in which participants were presented with a soritical series of objects, notably colored patches (Experiments 1 and 4) and spheres (Experiment 2), or both (Experiment 3), and were asked to evaluate related conditionals embodying non-causal inferential connections (such as \u201cIf patch number 5 is blue, then so is patch number 4\u201d). All four experiments displayed a unique response pattern, in which (largely determinate) responses were sensitive to parameters determining inference strength, as well as to consequent position in the series, in a way analogous to belief bias. Experiment 3 showed that this guaranteed relevance can be suppressed, with participants reverting to the defective conditional. Experiment 4 showed that this pattern can be partly explained by a measure of inference strength. This pattern supports our theory's \u201cprinciple of relevant inference\u201d and \u201cprinciple of bounded inference,\u201d highlighting the dual processing characteristics of the inferential connection.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Belief bias", "Conditionals", "Dual processing", "Inferential semantics", "Relevance", "Satisficing"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85044567539", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuropsychology and Physiological Psychology", "PSYC", "3206"], ["Experimental and Cognitive Psychology", "PSYC", "3205"], ["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"], ["Linguistics and Language", "SOCI", "3310"], ["Artificial Intelligence", "COMP", "1702"]], "AuthorData": {"16401429600": {"Name": "Douven I.", "AuthorID": "16401429600", "AffiliationID": "120464980", "AffiliationName": "SND/CNRS/Sorbonne University"}, "22984837000": {"Name": "Elqayam S.", "AuthorID": "22984837000", "AffiliationID": "60017098", "AffiliationName": "School of Applied Social Sciences, De Montfort University"}, "46161708800": {"Name": "Singmann H.", "AuthorID": "46161708800", "AffiliationID": "60012614", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Psychology, University of Z\u00fcrich"}, "56601402500": {"Name": "van Wijnbergen-Huitink J.", "AuthorID": "56601402500", "AffiliationID": "60016529", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Philosophy, University of Nijmegen"}}}
