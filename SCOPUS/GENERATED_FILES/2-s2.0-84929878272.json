This review explores key stages in the almost 20-year history of abiraterone acetate's development, starting with a program aiming to develop inhibitors of androgen synthesis at the Institute of Cancer Research, London. Clinical development was initially slow owing to insufficient data supporting targeting of androgen synthesis as a therapeutic approach in CRPC and safety concerns of adrenocortical insufficiency from suppression of cortisol. Regulatory authorities approved abiraterone acetate in 2011 after a survival benefit was demonstrated when given in combination with prednisone as compared with prednisone alone in docetaxel-treated men. Licensing approval extended to include chemotherapy-naive patients with CRPC in 2012 following a significant increase in radiographic progression-free survival. Ongoing research focuses on identifying predictive biomarkers and understanding mechanisms of resistance to improve its administration.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Abiraterone Acetate", "Antineoplastic Agents", "Disease Progression", "Disease-Free Survival", "Humans", "Male", "Prostatic Neoplasms, Castration-Resistant", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84929878272", "SubjectAreas": [["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Urology", "MEDI", "2748"]], "AuthorData": {"54404648700": {"Name": "Grist E.", "AuthorID": "54404648700", "AffiliationID": "60017166", "AffiliationName": "Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust"}, "9740870900": {"Name": "Attard G.", "AuthorID": "9740870900", "AffiliationID": "60017166", "AffiliationName": "Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
