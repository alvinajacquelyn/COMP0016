All Rights Reserved.Background: Estimates of sexually transmitted infection (STI) prevalence are essential for efforts to prevent and control STIs. Few large STI prevalence studies exist, especially for low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Our primary objective was to estimate the prevalence of chlamydia, gonorrhea, trichomoniasis, syphilis, herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2), and bacterial vaginosis (BV) among women in sub-Saharan Africa by age, region, and population type. Methods and findings: We analyzed individual-level data from 18 HIV prevention studies (cohort studies and randomized controlled trials; conducted during 1993\u20132011), representing >37,000 women, that tested participants for \u22651 selected STIs or BV at baseline. We used a 2-stage meta-analysis to combine data. After calculating the proportion of participants with each infection and standard error by study, we used a random-effects model to obtain a summary mean prevalence of each infection and 95% confidence interval (CI) across ages, regions, and population types. Despite substantial study heterogeneity for some STIs/populations, several patterns emerged. Across the three primary region/population groups (South Africa community-based, Southern/Eastern Africa community-based, and Eastern Africa higher-risk), prevalence was higher among 15\u201324-year-old than 25\u201349-year-old women for all STIs except HSV-2. In general, higher-risk populations had greater prevalence of gonorrhea and syphilis than clinic/community-based populations. For chlamydia, prevalence among 15\u201324-year-olds was 10.3% (95% CI: 7.4%, 14.1%; I2= 75.7%) among women specifically recruited from higher-risk settings for HIV in Eastern Africa and was 15.1% (95% CI: 12.7%, 17.8%; I2= 82.3%) in South African clinic/community-based populations. Among clinic/community-based populations, prevalence was generally greater in South Africa than in Southern/Eastern Africa for most STIs; for gonorrhea, prevalence among 15\u201324-year-olds was 4.6% (95% CI: 3.3%, 6.4%; I2= 82.8%) in South Africa and was 1.7% (95% CI: 1.2%, 2.6%; I2= 55.2%) in Southern/Eastern Africa. Across the three primary region/population groups, HSV-2 and BV prevalence was high among 25\u201349-year-olds (ranging from 70% to 83% and 33% to 44%, respectively). The main study limitation is that the data are not from random samples of the target populations. Conclusions: Combining data from 18 HIV prevention studies, our findings highlight important features of STI/BV epidemiology among sub-Saharan African women. This methodology can be used where routine STI surveillance is limited and offers a new approach to obtaining critical information on STI and BV prevalence in LMICs.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Africa South of the Sahara", "Female", "Health Promotion", "HIV", "HIV Infections", "Humans", "Middle Aged", "Prevalence", "Sexually Transmitted Diseases", "Vaginosis, Bacterial", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85042661308", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"14825917000": {"Name": "Torrone E.A.", "AuthorID": "14825917000", "AffiliationID": "60000177, 60021658", "AffiliationName": "Division of STD Prevention, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"}, "7201897940": {"Name": "Morrison C.S.", "AuthorID": "7201897940", "AffiliationID": "60120612", "AffiliationName": "Global Health, Population and Nutrition"}, "7408353049": {"Name": "Chen P.L.", "AuthorID": "7408353049", "AffiliationID": "60120612", "AffiliationName": "Global Health, Population and Nutrition"}, "7102029080": {"Name": "Kwok C.", "AuthorID": "7102029080", "AffiliationID": "60120612", "AffiliationName": "Global Health, Population and Nutrition"}, "25227484500": {"Name": "Francis S.C.", "AuthorID": "25227484500", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Tropical Epidemiology Group, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"}, "7402082478": {"Name": "Hayes R.J.", "AuthorID": "7402082478", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Tropical Epidemiology Group, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"}, "57202553673": {"Name": "Looker K.J.", "AuthorID": "57202553673", "AffiliationID": "60171764, 60020650", "AffiliationName": "Population Health Sciences, Bristol Medical School, University of Bristol"}, "23482010600": {"Name": "McCormack S.", "AuthorID": "23482010600", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60003108", "AffiliationName": "MRC Clinical Trials Unit, University College London"}, "16069002500": {"Name": "McGrath N.", "AuthorID": "16069002500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Epidemiology & Public Health, University College London"}, "6602887266": {"Name": "van de Wijgert J.H.H.M.", "AuthorID": "6602887266", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Infection and Global Health, University of Liverpool"}, "57202658170": {"Name": "Watson-Jones D.", "AuthorID": "57202658170", "AffiliationID": "60071565", "AffiliationName": "Mwanza Intervention Trials Unit, National Institute for Medical Research"}, "7006432437": {"Name": "Low N.", "AuthorID": "7006432437", "AffiliationID": "60105053, 60020486", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine, University of Bern"}, "7201685399": {"Name": "Gottlieb S.L.", "AuthorID": "7201685399", "AffiliationID": "60027142", "AffiliationName": "Department of Reproductive Health and Research, World Health Organization"}, "null": {"Name": null, "AuthorID": null, "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
