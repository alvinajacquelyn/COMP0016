This study aimed to systematically evaluate the delayed investigation strategies and clinical outcomes in these cases, often described as \u201cnon-aneurysmal\u201d SAH (naSAH). Methods: A systematic review was performed in concordance with the PRISMA checklist. Pooled proportions of primary outcome measures were estimated using a random-effects model. Results: Fifty-eight studies were included (4473 patients). The cohort was split into perimesencephalic naSAH (PnaSAH) (49.9%), non-PnaSAH (44.7%) and radiologically negative SAH identified on lumbar puncture (5.4%). The commonest initial vascular imaging modality was digital subtraction angiography. A vascular abnormality was identified during delayed investigation in 3.9% [95% CI 1.9\u20136.6]. There was no uniform strategy for the timing or modality of delayed investigations. The pooled proportion of a favourable modified Rankin scale outcome (0\u20132) at 3\u20136 months following diagnosis was 92.0% [95% CI 86.0\u201396.5]. Complications included re-bleeding (3.1% [95% CI 1.5\u20135.2]), hydrocephalus (16.0% [95% CI 11.2\u201321.4]), vasospasm (9.6% [95% CI 6.5\u201313.3]) and seizure (3.5% [95% CI 1.7\u20135.8]). Stratified by bleeding pattern, we demonstrate a higher rate of delayed diagnoses (13.6% [95% CI 7.4\u201321.3]), lower proportion of favourable functional outcome (87.2% [95% CI 80.1\u201392.9]) and higher risk of complications for non-PnaSAH patients. Conclusion: This study highlights the heterogeneity in delayed investigations and outcomes for patients with naSAH, which may be influenced by the initial pattern of bleeding. Further multi-centre prospective studies are required to clarify optimal tailored management strategies for this heterogeneous group of patients.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Meta-analysis", "Non-aneurysmal", "Subarachnoid haemorrhage", "Systematic review"], "IndexKeywords": ["Angiography, Digital Subtraction", "Female", "Humans", "Hydrocephalus", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Subarachnoid Hemorrhage", "Tomography, X-Ray Computed"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85071154156", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"56384152400": {"Name": "Mohan M.", "AuthorID": "56384152400", "AffiliationID": "60160417, 60020661", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurosurgery, The Walton Centre NHS Foundation Trust and University of Liverpool"}, "57193280026": {"Name": "Islim A.I.", "AuthorID": "57193280026", "AffiliationID": "60160417, 60020661", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurosurgery, The Walton Centre NHS Foundation Trust and University of Liverpool"}, "55355731000": {"Name": "Rasul F.T.", "AuthorID": "55355731000", "AffiliationID": "60007937", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurosurgery, Queen\u2019s Hospital"}, "54391697200": {"Name": "Rominiyi O.", "AuthorID": "54391697200", "AffiliationID": "60024453", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurosurgery, Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "55053674400": {"Name": "deSouza R.M.", "AuthorID": "55053674400", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "55915557600": {"Name": "Poon M.T.C.", "AuthorID": "55915557600", "AffiliationID": "60110825, 60027272", "AffiliationName": "Usher Institute, University of Edinburgh"}, "24474922900": {"Name": "Jamjoom A.A.B.", "AuthorID": "24474922900", "AffiliationID": "60013999", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Neurosciences, Western General Hospital"}, "54382610400": {"Name": "Woodfield J.", "AuthorID": "54382610400", "AffiliationID": "60013999", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Neurosciences, Western General Hospital"}, "26649956100": {"Name": "Kolias A.G.", "AuthorID": "26649956100", "AffiliationID": "60031101, 60017488", "AffiliationName": "Division of Neurosurgery, Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Cambridge and Addenbrooke\u2019s Hospital"}, "6603373005": {"Name": "Kirollos R.", "AuthorID": "6603373005", "AffiliationID": "60031101, 60017488", "AffiliationName": "Division of Neurosurgery, Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Cambridge and Addenbrooke\u2019s Hospital"}, "56267554700": {"Name": "Patel K.", "AuthorID": "56267554700", "AffiliationID": "60016849, 60002401, 60014468", "AffiliationName": "Division of Neurosurgery, Krembil Research Institute, Toronto Western Hospital, University Health Network and University of Toronto"}, "55204436800": {"Name": "Chari A.", "AuthorID": "55204436800", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurosurgery, Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "null": {"Name": null, "AuthorID": null, "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
