For the first time in this paper, the core-shell ZIF-8@ZIF-67 crystals are thermally converted into porous ZnO@Co3O4 composites by combining a seed-mediated growth process with a two-step calcination. The designed porous ZnO@Co3O4 composites exhibited the highest photocatalytic activity with an excellent stability for the reduction of CO2 among the commonly reported composite photocatalysts. Their superior photocatalytic performance is demonstrated to be resulting from the unique porous structure of ZnO@Co3O4 and the co-catalytic function of Co3O4 which can effectively suppress the photocorrosion of ZnO.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Carbon based materials", "Composite photocatalysts", "Metalorganic frameworks (MOFs)", "Photocatalytic activities", "Photocatalytic performance", "Rhombic dodecahedron", "Two-step calcination", "Zeolitic imidazolate frameworks"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84962332379", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"]], "AuthorData": {"56270639100": {"Name": "Wang T.", "AuthorID": "56270639100", "AffiliationID": "60021666", "AffiliationName": "College of Materials Science and Technology, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Materials and Technology for Energy Conversion, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics"}, "56735033200": {"Name": "Shi L.", "AuthorID": "56735033200", "AffiliationID": "60002414", "AffiliationName": "World Premier International Research Center for Materials Nanoarchitectonics, National Institute for Materials Science"}, "55811236500": {"Name": "Tang J.", "AuthorID": "55811236500", "AffiliationID": "60002414", "AffiliationName": "World Premier International Research Center for Materials Nanoarchitectonics, National Institute for Materials Science"}, "54414548200": {"Name": "Malgras V.", "AuthorID": "54414548200", "AffiliationID": "60002414", "AffiliationName": "World Premier International Research Center for Materials Nanoarchitectonics, National Institute for Materials Science"}, "56285205200": {"Name": "Liu G.", "AuthorID": "56285205200", "AffiliationID": "60002414", "AffiliationName": "World Premier International Research Center for Materials Nanoarchitectonics, National Institute for Materials Science"}, "36803157600": {"Name": "Zhang H.", "AuthorID": "36803157600", "AffiliationID": "60002414", "AffiliationName": "World Premier International Research Center for Materials Nanoarchitectonics, National Institute for Materials Science"}, "56271008300": {"Name": "Meng X.", "AuthorID": "56271008300", "AffiliationID": "60002414", "AffiliationName": "World Premier International Research Center for Materials Nanoarchitectonics, National Institute for Materials Science"}, "7404879106": {"Name": "Chang K.", "AuthorID": "7404879106", "AffiliationID": "60002414", "AffiliationName": "World Premier International Research Center for Materials Nanoarchitectonics, National Institute for Materials Science"}, "36919720400": {"Name": "Yamauchi Y.", "AuthorID": "36919720400", "AffiliationID": "60019533, 60129089", "AffiliationName": "TU-NIMS Joint Research Center, School of Materials Science and Engineering, Tianjin University"}, "55513929900": {"Name": "Ye J.", "AuthorID": "55513929900", "AffiliationID": "113718900", "AffiliationName": "Collaborative Innovation Center of Chemical Science and Engineering"}, "55801891100": {"Name": "He J.", "AuthorID": "55801891100", "AffiliationID": "60021666", "AffiliationName": "College of Materials Science and Technology, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Materials and Technology for Energy Conversion, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics"}, "7003593662": {"Name": "Asahina S.", "AuthorID": "7003593662", "AffiliationID": "60010751", "AffiliationName": "SM Business Unit, JEOL Ltd."}, "15054964800": {"Name": "Terasaki O.", "AuthorID": "15054964800", "AffiliationID": "60028378", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials and Environmental Chemistry, Berzelii Centre EXSELENT on Porous Materials, Stockholm University"}}}
