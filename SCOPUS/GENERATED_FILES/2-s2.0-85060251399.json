Nevertheless, the crucial role of informal social networks and actors in the catering for human needs in disaster circumstances remains largely under-explored. If we have to rethink the \u2018work\u2019 that informality does for our understanding of urban areas, its contribution to resilience, and take it seriously in the \u2018full spectrum of risk\u2019 in urban and peri-urban centres, better and more balanced methods are needed. This paper attends to this gap. Examining the mechanisms of aid provision in the aftermath of the 2015 Gorkha Earthquake in Nepal, it details an experimental set of quantitative research methods to explore the role of informal social networks in the provision of critical human needs in natural disasters. Relying on a sample of 160 households across four districts and 16 villages in the built environment affected by the Gorkha earthquake, the paper reveals that, overall, a wide disparity exists in the comparative importance of organisations in the provision of aid and resources. Much crucial after-disaster care is catered for by a mix of relatives, temples, friends, neighbours and local clubs. It highlights the importance of informal networks in understanding, and theorising, governance (of disaster and of the \u2018urban\u2019 more in general), and calls for greater attention to its role. It is time, it argues, to revalue informal disaster governance networks as a crucial, not tacit, component of disaster response.", "AuthorKeywords": ["community", "disasters", "governance", "informality", "method", "networks", "urban informality"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85060251399", "SubjectAreas": [["Environmental Science (miscellaneous)", "ENVI", "2301"], ["Urban Studies", "SOCI", "3322"]], "AuthorData": {"55850431900": {"Name": "Carrero R.", "AuthorID": "55850431900", "AffiliationID": "60004182", "AffiliationName": "The New School"}, "26021005000": {"Name": "Acuto M.", "AuthorID": "26021005000", "AffiliationID": "60026553", "AffiliationName": "University of Melbourne"}, "55778884100": {"Name": "Tzachor A.", "AuthorID": "55778884100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "57205496257": {"Name": "Subedi N.", "AuthorID": "57205496257", "AffiliationID": "121995179", "AffiliationName": "KfW Development Bank"}, "36454631900": {"Name": "Campbell B.", "AuthorID": "36454631900", "AffiliationID": "60022175", "AffiliationName": "University of Durham"}, "55537897000": {"Name": "To L.S.", "AuthorID": "55537897000", "AffiliationID": "60000891", "AffiliationName": "Loughborough University"}}}
