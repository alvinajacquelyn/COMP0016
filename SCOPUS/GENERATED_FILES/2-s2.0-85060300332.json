This sensory attenuation phenomenon is commonly attributed to prediction processes implicated in motor control. However, accumulating evidence suggests that attenuation effects can also result from prediction processes beyond the motor domain. The aim of the present study was two-fold. First, we attempted to replicate the role of identity-specific motor predictions in sensory attenuation. Second, we set out to examine whether attenuation effects can be observed when tones cannot be predicted from preceding actions, but only from the non-motor cues accompanying them. Participants completed a two-alternative forced choice task on the loudness of tones whose pitch was congruent or incongruent with previously learned key-tone or cue-tone associations. No convincing evidence was observed for identity predictions on a perceptual level nor on a neurophysiological level. However, exploratory analyses revealed that attenuation was more pronounced for participants who first learned to rely on motor (instead of non-motor predictions). Together, these findings suggest that the role of motor identity predictions in sensory attenuation might have to be reconsidered.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Action prediction", "Event-related potentials (ERP)", "Sensory attenuation", "Visuo-Auditory prediction"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adaptation, Physiological", "Adult", "Association Learning", "Auditory Perception", "Brain", "Electroencephalography", "Evoked Potentials", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Psychomotor Performance", "Visual Perception", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85060300332", "SubjectAreas": [["Experimental and Cognitive Psychology", "PSYC", "3205"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"], ["Behavioral Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2802"]], "AuthorData": {"54395178900": {"Name": "Dogge M.", "AuthorID": "54395178900", "AffiliationID": "60007989", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Utrecht University"}, "23995606200": {"Name": "Hofman D.", "AuthorID": "23995606200", "AffiliationID": "60007989", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Utrecht University"}, "6506357747": {"Name": "Custers R.", "AuthorID": "6506357747", "AffiliationID": "60007989", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Utrecht University"}, "7006045724": {"Name": "Aarts H.", "AuthorID": "7006045724", "AffiliationID": "60007989", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Utrecht University"}}}
