Among these conditions, trigeminal neuralgia (TN), persistent idiopathic facial pain, temporomandibular joint pain, and trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias (TAC) are the most well described conditions. Conclusion TN has been known for centuries, and is recognised by its characteristic and almost pathognomonic clinical features. The other facial pain conditions are less well defined, and over the years there has been confusion about their classification.", "AuthorKeywords": ["History", "persistent idiopathic facial pain", "temporomandibular disorders", "trigeminal autonomic cephalagias", "trigeminal neuralgia"], "IndexKeywords": ["Facial Pain", "History, 17th Century", "History, 18th Century", "History, 19th Century", "History, 20th Century", "Humans"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85020162770", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"56810833400": {"Name": "Zakrzewska J.M.", "AuthorID": "56810833400", "AffiliationID": "60013985, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "UCLH NHS Foundation Trust, Eastman Dental Hospital"}, "7401539634": {"Name": "Jensen T.S.", "AuthorID": "7401539634", "AffiliationID": "60023882", "AffiliationName": "IDNC, DPRC Department of Neurology, Aarhus University Hospital"}}}
