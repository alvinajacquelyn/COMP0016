The type 1 and P pili of uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) play important roles during urinary tract colonization, mediating attachment to the bladder and kidney, respectively. The biomechanical properties of the helical pilus rods allow them to reversibly uncoil in response to flow-induced forces, allowing UPEC to retain a foothold in the unique and hostile environment of the urinary tract. Here we provide the 4.2-\u00c5 resolution cryo-EM structure of the type 1 pilus rod, which together with the previous P pilus rod structure rationalizes the remarkable \u201cspring-like\u201d properties of chaperone-usher pili. The cryo-EM structure of the type 1 pilus rod differs in its helical parameters from the structure determined previously by a hybrid approach. We provide evidence that these structural differences originate from different quaternary structures of pili assembled in vivo and in vitro. Chaperone-usher pili are crucial virulence factors of uropathogenic E. coli that mediate host recognition and adhesion. Hospenthal et al. present the cryo-EM structure of the type 1 pilus rod explaining its \u201cspring-like\u201d biomechanical properties. Biochemical data suggest that the rod can exist in more than one helical quaternary assembly.", "AuthorKeywords": ["chaperone", "chaperone-usher pilus", "cryo-EM", "FimA", "pilus", "pilus rod", "quaternary structure", "type 1 pilus", "unfolding kinetics", "usher"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cryoelectron Microscopy", "Fimbriae Proteins", "Protein Domains", "Protein Folding"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85033397456", "SubjectAreas": [["Structural Biology", "BIOC", "1315"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"]], "AuthorData": {"55638169500": {"Name": "Hospenthal M.K.", "AuthorID": "55638169500", "AffiliationID": "60009016, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London and Birkbeck"}, "56644167900": {"Name": "Costa T.R.D.", "AuthorID": "56644167900", "AffiliationID": "60009016, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London and Birkbeck"}, "16319961600": {"Name": "Redzej A.", "AuthorID": "16319961600", "AffiliationID": "60009016, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London and Birkbeck"}, "36476344200": {"Name": "Lillington J.", "AuthorID": "36476344200", "AffiliationID": "60009016, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London and Birkbeck"}, "7004804200": {"Name": "Waksman G.", "AuthorID": "7004804200", "AffiliationID": "60009016, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London and Birkbeck"}, "57196450121": {"Name": "Zyla D.", "AuthorID": "57196450121", "AffiliationID": "60025858", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Molecular Biology and Biophysics, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich"}, "57197497771": {"Name": "Giese C.", "AuthorID": "57197497771", "AffiliationID": "60025858", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Molecular Biology and Biophysics, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich"}, "7006463850": {"Name": "Glockshuber R.", "AuthorID": "7006463850", "AffiliationID": "60025858", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Molecular Biology and Biophysics, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich"}}}
