Our aim in the present study is to explore the potential of renewable energy communities in the Netherlands, as social niches, to contribute to transitions in the energy system. To do so, we propose three proxies for measuring the transition potential of social niches, based on proxies for technological innovations derived from the literature. In addition, we reinterpret the notion of niches and the way transition occurs by arguing that niches are complex systems in which both technological and social innovations develop simultaneously and that during a transition entire niches link up with the regime. Furthermore, we make a distinction between internally and externally oriented niches based on their orientation and application focus. We use a comparative case study analysis complemented by a systematic literature and documentary review to show that these communities are already changing the Dutch energy system, by connecting to regime actors. Their further advancement depends on strengthening their links to established actors, but also on providing a favorable regulatory framework.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Multi Level Perspective", "Renewable energy communities", "Social innovation", "Social niche"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84921459540", "SubjectAreas": [["Business and International Management", "BUSI", "1403"], ["Development", "SOCI", "3303"], ["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"]], "AuthorData": {"56491351000": {"Name": "D\u00f3ci G.", "AuthorID": "56491351000", "AffiliationID": "60117141, 60008734", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Environmental Studies, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam"}, "15051301500": {"Name": "Vasileiadou E.", "AuthorID": "15051301500", "AffiliationID": "60032882", "AffiliationName": "School of Innovation Sciences, Eindhoven University of Technology"}, "55551003300": {"Name": "Petersen A.", "AuthorID": "55551003300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Science, Technology Engineering and Public Policy, University College London"}}}
