Published by John Wiley & Sons LtdThe skin-associated chemokine CTACK plays a key role in many inflammatory conditions and could be instrumental in the pathophysiology of tissue-specific immunological diseases such as oral lichen planus (OLP). In this study, we investigated, by RT-PCR, ELISA, chemotaxis assays, and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), the production of CTACK in oral keratinocytes, its expression in tissues from normal and OLP patients, and its role in T-cell recruitment.CTACK was produced by the oral epithelium, and it affects chemotaxis of memory CLA+ cells to the oral epithelium. CTACK mRNA was expressed constitutively in primary oral epithelium and was increased during pro-inflammatory IFN-\u03b3 treatment. We found a constitutive production of CTACK at a protein level in oral primary cells that increased after IFN-\u03b3 treatment. Moreover, we confirmed that CTACK attracts memory T cells and those T cells that express CLA above the level of basal migration.", "AuthorKeywords": ["CCL27", "chemokine", "CTACK", "lichen planus", "oral inflammation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cell Line", "Cell Movement", "Cell Separation", "Chemokine CCL27", "Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay", "Flow Cytometry", "Humans", "Inflammation", "Interferon-gamma", "Keratinocytes", "Lichen Planus, Oral", "Mouth Mucosa", "Recombinant Proteins", "RNA, Messenger"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85038076550", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Dermatology", "MEDI", "2708"]], "AuthorData": {"57191382042": {"Name": "Marshall A.", "AuthorID": "57191382042", "AffiliationID": "60013985, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, UCL Eastman Dental Institute"}, "7201730425": {"Name": "Porter S.", "AuthorID": "7201730425", "AffiliationID": "60013985, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, UCL Eastman Dental Institute"}, "56421801200": {"Name": "Celentano A.", "AuthorID": "56421801200", "AffiliationID": "60118550, 60026553", "AffiliationName": "Melbourne Dental School, Oral Health CRC, The University of Melbourne"}, "56047579700": {"Name": "Cirillo N.", "AuthorID": "56047579700", "AffiliationID": "116422585", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Innovation, Research, Education and Health (IRIS)"}, "7101948634": {"Name": "McCullough M.", "AuthorID": "7101948634", "AffiliationID": "60118550, 60026553", "AffiliationName": "Melbourne Dental School, Oral Health CRC, The University of Melbourne"}}}
