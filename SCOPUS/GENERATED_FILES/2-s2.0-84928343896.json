In our ICU we traditionally use short-course antibiotic monotherapy as the mainstay of treatment. We sought to document the impact of this strategy on pathogen type, resistance patterns and patient outcomes. A comparison was made against data collected during a similar exercise in 2000. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed data on all patients with community-, hospital- and ICU-acquired bacteraemia over a 6 month period (1 December 2012 to 31 May 2013) in a general medical-surgical ICU in a London university hospital. Causative pathogens, resistance patterns, use and duration of monotherapy or combination therapy, breakthrough and relapse rates, and patient outcomes were assessed. Results: The 2013 cohort comprised 113 episodes in 87 patients. Short-course monotherapy (median course 4-5 days) was used in 65.7% of episodes (73.5% in 2000). As with the 2000 cohort, the incidence of antimicrobial resistance, fungaemia, bacteraemia breakthrough and relapse remained low. Of note, there was a decreasing incidence of ICU-acquired MRSA, MDR Gram-negative bacteraemia and fluconazole-resistant candidaemia. Hospital mortality was 32% (45% in 2000). Conclusions: Our strategy predominantly utilizing short-course antibiotic monotherapy remains effective in achieving good clinical outcomes among patients with bloodstream infections, with low rates of antibiotic resistance and clinical relapse. Prospective trials of short-course monotherapy are warranted to assess clinical efficacy and antimicrobial resistance.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Antibiotic combination therapy", "Antibiotic duration", "Antibiotic monotherapy", "Antibiotic resistance", "Fungaemia", "Intensive care", "Mortality"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Anti-Bacterial Agents", "Bacteremia", "Bacteria", "Drug Resistance, Bacterial", "Drug Therapy", "Drug Utilization", "Female", "Hospitals, University", "Humans", "Incidence", "Intensive Care Units", "London", "Male", "Microbial Sensitivity Tests", "Middle Aged", "Retrospective Studies", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84928343896", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"], ["Microbiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2726"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"35263525700": {"Name": "de santis V.", "AuthorID": "35263525700", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "Bloomsbury Institute of Intensive Care Medicine, University College London, and Department of Critical Care, UCL Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "56604139200": {"Name": "Gresoiu M.", "AuthorID": "56604139200", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "Bloomsbury Institute of Intensive Care Medicine, University College London, and Department of Critical Care, UCL Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7401654716": {"Name": "Singer M.", "AuthorID": "7401654716", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "Bloomsbury Institute of Intensive Care Medicine, University College London, and Department of Critical Care, UCL Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7003960020": {"Name": "Corona A.", "AuthorID": "7003960020", "AffiliationID": "60002200, 60030318", "AffiliationName": "Azienda Ospedaliera Luigi Sacco, University of Milan"}, "35463228600": {"Name": "Wilson A.P.R.", "AuthorID": "35463228600", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Microbiology and Virology, UCLH NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
