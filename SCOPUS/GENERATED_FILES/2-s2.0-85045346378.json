Five preschool DMD children and five age-matched healthy children were studied with shear-wave elastography. In the DMD children, muscle stiffness was moderately higher compared with the muscle stiffness in HC, in the rectus femoris, vastus lateralis, adductor magnus and gluteus maximus muscles. On muscle MRI T1-w images showed fatty replacement in 3/5 patients at the level of the GM, while thigh and leg muscles were affected in 2/5; hyperintensity on STIR images was identified in 4/5 patients. No significant correlation was observed between stiffness values and MRI scoring. Our study demonstrated that lower limb muscles of preschool DMD patients show fatty replacement and patchy edema on muscle MRI and increased stiffness on shear-wave elastography. In conclusion, although further studies in larger cohorts are needed, shear-wave elastography could be considered a useful non-invasive tool to easily monitor muscle changes in early stages of the disease.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Duchenne muscular dystrophy", "Elastosonography", "Muscle edema", "Muscle MRI", "Ultrasound elastography"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adipose Tissue", "Case-Control Studies", "Child, Preschool", "Elasticity Imaging Techniques", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Muscle, Skeletal", "Muscular Dystrophy, Duchenne", "Severity of Illness Index", "Thigh"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85045346378", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Genetics (clinical)", "MEDI", "2716"]], "AuthorData": {"6603006986": {"Name": "Pichiecchio A.", "AuthorID": "6603006986", "AffiliationID": "60083543", "AffiliationName": "Neuroradiology Department, C.
