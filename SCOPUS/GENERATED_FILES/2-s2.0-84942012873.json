Specifically, we have modeled the surface potential and electric field at the surface of the nucleus during the initial Rosetta rendezvous at 3.5 AU and the release of the Philae lander at 3 AU. We have also investigated the possibility of dust acceleration and ejection above the nucleus due to electrostatic forces. Finally, we discuss these modeling results in the context of possible observations by instruments on both the Rosetta orbiter and the Philae lander.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Comets", "Dust", "Plasma", "Plasma interaction with unmagnetized bodies", "Solar wind", "Surface charging"], "IndexKeywords": ["67p/churyumov-gerasimenko", "Comets", "Electrostatic charging", "Model results", "Rosetta", "Surface charging"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84942012873", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"25638594500": {"Name": "Nordheim T.A.", "AuthorID": "25638594500", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60162133", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Planetary Sciences at UCL/Birkbeck, University College London"}, "55224172000": {"Name": "Jones G.H.", "AuthorID": "55224172000", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60162133", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Planetary Sciences at UCL/Birkbeck, University College London"}, "7103145751": {"Name": "Coates A.J.", "AuthorID": "7103145751", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60162133", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Planetary Sciences at UCL/Birkbeck, University College London"}, "35567069400": {"Name": "Halekas J.S.", "AuthorID": "35567069400", "AffiliationID": "60024324", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Iowa"}, "16064559500": {"Name": "Roussos E.", "AuthorID": "16064559500", "AffiliationID": "60017695", "AffiliationName": "Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research"}}}
