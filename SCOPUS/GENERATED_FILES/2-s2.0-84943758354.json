We examined the relationship between diurnal cortisol rhythmandadverse events in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery.We hypothesized that a flatter presurgical diurnal cortisol slope would be associated with higher rates of adverse cardiac events and death in the years following the CABG procedure. Methods: Repeated measures of saliva were taken over the day from 250 CABG patients 1 month before surgery to assess diurnal cortisol slope and overall output (area under the curve). Long-term clinical outcomes were occurrence of a major adverse cardiac event (MACE) and death, and were collected up to 2.68 (SD = 0.40) years after surgery. Cox proportional hazard models were used to determine relationships between presurgical cortisol and clinical outcomes. EuroSCORE, chronic illness burden, and whether or not the patient had undergone cardiopulmonary bypass were included as covariates in the models. Results: Diurnal cortisol slope predicted the occurrence of MACE or death after surgery (hazard ratio = 0.73; 95% confidence interval = 0.56-0.96; P = .023). Patients with a steeper slope were at reduced risk of adverse outcomes. This association was driven by changes in both waking and evening cortisol levels. Conclusion: These results provide evidence for a link between diurnal cortisol rhythm and recovery after CABG. Measuring diurnal cortisol slope before surgery may help to identify those patients at risk of adverse outcomes in the years after the procedure.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Cardiovascular Diseases", "Circadian Rhythm", "Coronary Artery Bypass", "Coronary Artery Disease", "Female", "Humans", "Hydrocortisone", "Hypothalamo-Hypophyseal System", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Pituitary-Adrenal System", "Risk Factors", "Saliva"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84943758354", "SubjectAreas": [["Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism", "MEDI", "2712"], ["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Endocrinology", "BIOC", "1310"], ["Clinical Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1308"], ["Biochemistry (medical)", "MEDI", "2704"]], "AuthorData": {"55926917100": {"Name": "Ronaldson A.", "AuthorID": "55926917100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "9042254800": {"Name": "Kidd T.", "AuthorID": "9042254800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "36946348400": {"Name": "Poole L.", "AuthorID": "36946348400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "54794172400": {"Name": "Leigh E.", "AuthorID": "54794172400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "7102289942": {"Name": "Steptoe A.", "AuthorID": "7102289942", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "16039205300": {"Name": "Jahangiri M.", "AuthorID": "16039205300", "AffiliationID": "60010426, 60029329", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiac Surgery, St. George's Hospital, University of London"}}}
