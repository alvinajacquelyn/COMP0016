Many slip-weakening mechanisms are active in the upper-mid crust, but healing is not always well-explained. Here we show that the distinct structure and rate-dependent properties of amorphous nanopowder (not silica gel) formed by grinding of quartz can cause extreme strength loss at high slip rates. We propose a weakening and related strengthening mechanism that may act throughout the quartz-bearing continental crust. The action of two slip rate-dependent mechanisms offers a plausible explanation for the observed weakening: thermally-enhanced plasticity, and particulate flow aided by hydrodynamic lubrication. Rapid cooling of the particles causes rapid strengthening, and inter-particle bonds form at longer timescales. The timescales of these two processes correspond to the timescales of post-seismic healing observed in earthquakes. In natural faults, this nanopowder crystallizes to quartz over 10s\u2013100s years, leaving veins which may be indistinguishable from common quartz veins.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85060152075", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"56542746400": {"Name": "Rowe C.D.", "AuthorID": "56542746400", "AffiliationID": "60002494", "AffiliationName": "Earth and Planetary Sciences, McGill University"}, "57194426756": {"Name": "Lamothe K.", "AuthorID": "57194426756", "AffiliationID": "60002494", "AffiliationName": "Earth and Planetary Sciences, McGill University"}, "55806037200": {"Name": "Rempe M.", "AuthorID": "55806037200", "AffiliationID": "60005322", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Geology, Mineralogy, and Geophysics, Ruhr-Universit\u00e4t Bochum"}, "6506298737": {"Name": "Di Toro G.", "AuthorID": "6506298737", "AffiliationID": "60000243", "AffiliationName": "Sezione di Tettonofisica e Sismologia, Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia"}, "7202479304": {"Name": "Andrews M.", "AuthorID": "7202479304", "AffiliationID": "60002494", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, McGill University"}, "39262157300": {"Name": "Mitchell T.M.", "AuthorID": "39262157300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Rock and Ice Physics and UCL Seismological Laboratory, Earth Sciences Department, University College London"}, "56646472200": {"Name": "Aretusini S.", "AuthorID": "56646472200", "AffiliationID": "60000243", "AffiliationName": "Sezione di Tettonofisica e Sismologia, Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia"}, "55387791100": {"Name": "White J.C.", "AuthorID": "55387791100", "AffiliationID": "60016983", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, University of New Brunswick"}}}
