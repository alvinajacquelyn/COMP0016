Design: Randomised controlled, cross-over trial. Settings: Spinal manipulation (SM) is used as therapeutic modality for various neuromuscular disorders and also in sport with asymptomatic individuals to improve range of motion and/or facilitate motor control. Experimental evidence of its effectiveness is lacking. Participants: 27 asymptomatic participants (15 males and 12 females) [age (mean\u00b1standard deviation) 24\u00b13 years] were exposed to three separate treatments in random order: 1) Spinal Manipulation of the lumbar spine (MAN); 2) Stretching of the Lumbar spine (STR); 3) sham manipulation (SHA). Main outcome measures: Before (PRE), after (POST) and 15min after (15_MIN) each treatment, the participants were asked to perform three tasks always in the same order: 1) force fluctuation task; 2) Modified S\u00f6rensen's test; 3) sit and reach. Surface EMG was recorded from Gastrocnemius medialis and Erector Spinae muscles using linear arrays during task 1 and 2. Results: MAN was not shown to determine improvements superior to other treatments in the control of force output and sEMG parameters. Conclusions: Studies with larger populations are needed in order to ascertain the effectiveness of SM on neuromuscular function.", "AuthorKeywords": ["EMG", "Force fluctuation", "Neuromuscular responses", "Spinal manipulation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cross-Over Studies", "Electromyography", "Female", "Humans", "Lumbar Vertebrae", "Male", "Manipulation, Spinal", "Muscle Contraction", "Muscle Stretching Exercises", "Muscle, Skeletal", "Patient Positioning", "Range of Motion, Articular", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84928584856", "SubjectAreas": [["Orthopedics and Sports Medicine", "MEDI", "2732"], ["Physical Therapy, Sports Therapy and Rehabilitation", "HEAL", "3612"]], "AuthorData": {"7003493917": {"Name": "Cardinale M.", "AuthorID": "7003493917", "AffiliationID": "60015875", "AffiliationName": "University of Aberdeen, College of Life Sciences and Medicine"}, "55933534800": {"Name": "Boccia G.", "AuthorID": "55933534800", "AffiliationID": "60012259", "AffiliationName": "Motor Science Research Center, School of Exercise and Sport Sciences, Department of Medical Sciences, University of Turin"}, "6701835821": {"Name": "Rainoldi A.", "AuthorID": "6701835821", "AffiliationID": "60012259", "AffiliationName": "Motor Science Research Center, School of Exercise and Sport Sciences, Department of Medical Sciences, University of Turin"}, "56532409200": {"Name": "Greenway T.", "AuthorID": "56532409200", "AffiliationID": "115030028", "AffiliationName": "The Waldegrave Clinic"}, "57213538078": {"Name": "Evans O.", "AuthorID": "57213538078", "AffiliationID": "115030028", "AffiliationName": "The Waldegrave Clinic"}}}
