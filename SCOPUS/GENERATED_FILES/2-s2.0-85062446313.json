Supported by a growing body of scientific research, autistic adults argue that these behaviours may serve as useful coping mechanisms, yet little research has examined stimming from the perspective of autistic adults. Through interviews and focus groups, we asked 32 autistic adults to share their perceptions and experiences of stimming, including the reasons they stim, any value doing so may hold for them and their perceptions of others\u2019 reactions to stimming. Using thematic analysis, we identified two themes: stimming as (1) a self-regulatory mechanism and (2) lacking in social acceptance, but can become accepted through understanding. Autistic adults highlighted the importance of stimming as an adaptive mechanism that helps them to soothe or communicate intense emotions or thoughts and thus objected to treatment that aims to eliminate the behaviour.", "AuthorKeywords": ["adults", "autism", "neurodiversity", "repetitive behaviour", "repetitive movements", "self-stimulatory behaviour", "stereotypies", "stimming"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adaptation, Psychological", "Adult", "Attitude", "Autistic Disorder", "Female", "Focus Groups", "Humans", "Interviews as Topic", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Stereotypic Movement Disorder", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85062446313", "SubjectAreas": [["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"]], "AuthorData": {"45561375100": {"Name": "Kapp S.K.", "AuthorID": "45561375100", "AffiliationID": "60026479", "AffiliationName": "University of Exeter"}, "57217366377": {"Name": "Elliott D.", "AuthorID": "57217366377", "AffiliationID": "60026479", "AffiliationName": "University of Exeter"}, "57196376987": {"Name": "Elphick C.", "AuthorID": "57196376987", "AffiliationID": "60026479", "AffiliationName": "University of Exeter"}, "36020699200": {"Name": "Russell G.", "AuthorID": "36020699200", "AffiliationID": "60026479", "AffiliationName": "University of Exeter"}, "54921744700": {"Name": "Steward R.", "AuthorID": "54921744700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "23766915000": {"Name": "Crane L.", "AuthorID": "23766915000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "6507658484": {"Name": "Pellicano E.", "AuthorID": "6507658484", "AffiliationID": "60019544", "AffiliationName": "Macquarie University"}}}
