Background: Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is a rare and aggressive thoracic malignancy that is difficult to cure. Dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI is a functional imaging technique used to analyze tumor microvascular properties and to monitor therapy response. Purpose of this study was to compare two tracer kinetic models, the extended Tofts (ET) and the adiabatic approximation tissue homogeneity model (AATH) for analysis of DCE-MRI and examine the value of the DCE parameters to predict response to chemotherapy in patients with MPM. Method: This prospective, longitudinal, single tertiary radiology center study was conducted between October 2013 and July 2015. Patient underwent DCE-MRI studies at three time points: prior to therapy, during and after cisplatin-based chemotherapy. The images were analyzed using ET and AATH models. In short-term follow-up, the patients were classified as having disease control or progressive disease according to modified response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (mRECIST) criteria. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was used to examine specificity and sensitivity of DCE parameters for predicting response to therapy. Comparison tests were used to analyze whether derived parameters are interchangeable between the two models. Results: Nineteen patients form the study population. The results indicate that the derived parameters are not interchangeable between the models. Significant correlation with response to therapy was found for AATH-calculated median pre-treatment efflux rate (k ep ) showing sensitivity of 83% and specificity of 100% (AUC 0.9). ET-calculated maximal pre-treatment k ep showed 100% sensitivity and specificity for predicting treatment response during the early phase of the therapy and reached a favorable trend to significant prognostic value post-therapy. Conclusion: Both models show potential in predicting response to therapy in MPM. High pre-treatment k ep values suggest MPM disease control post-chemotherapy.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Biomarker", "Magnetic resonance imaging", "Mesothelioma", "Perfusion", "Prognosis", "Response evaluation criteria in solid tumors"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols", "Cisplatin", "Contrast Media", "Female", "Humans", "Longitudinal Studies", "Lung Neoplasms", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Mesothelioma", "Middle Aged", "Pleural Neoplasms", "Prognosis", "Prospective Studies", "Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85062352812", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiological and Ultrasound Technology", "HEAL", "3614"], ["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"57207259476": {"Name": "Vivoda Tom\u0161i\u010d M.", "AuthorID": "57207259476", "AffiliationID": "60023955", "AffiliationName": "Jozef Stefan International Postgraduate School"}, "14627355000": {"Name": "Bisdas S.", "AuthorID": "14627355000", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "Lysholm Department of Neuroradiology, National Hospital of Neurology and Neurosurgery, UCLH"}, "7005444734": {"Name": "Kova\u010d V.", "AuthorID": "7005444734", "AffiliationID": "60000966", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiotherapy, Institute of Oncology Ljubljana"}, "6604065491": {"Name": "Ser\u0161a I.", "AuthorID": "6604065491", "AffiliationID": "60023955", "AffiliationName": "Jozef Stefan Institute"}, "24081339600": {"Name": "\u0160urlan Popovi\u010d K.", "AuthorID": "24081339600", "AffiliationID": "60031106", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Medicine, University of Ljubljana"}}}
