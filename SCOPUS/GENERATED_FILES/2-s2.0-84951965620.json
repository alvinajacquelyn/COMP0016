In this paper, we explore a node-based Gaussian Graphical Model (NBGGM) that facilitates identification of brain regions attributing to connectivity differences seen between a pair of graphs. To enable group analysis, we propose an extension of NBGGM via incorporation of stability selection. We evaluate NBGGM on two functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) datasets pertaining to within and between-group studies. We show that NBGGM more consistently selects the same brain regions over random data splits than using node-based graph measures. Importantly, the regions found by NBGGM correspond well to those known to be involved for the investigated conditions.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Brain", "Connectivity", "fMRI", "Node-based Gaussian Graphical Model"], "IndexKeywords": ["Brain functions", "Connectivity", "Connectivity graph", "Edge-based approach", "fMRI", "Functional magnetic resonance imaging", "Gaussian graphical models", "Stability selections"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84951965620", "SubjectAreas": [["Theoretical Computer Science", "MATH", "2614"], ["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"]], "AuthorData": {"15521369200": {"Name": "Ng B.", "AuthorID": "15521369200", "AffiliationID": "60109227, 60105988", "AffiliationName": "Parietal Team, Neurospin, INRIA Saclay"}, "56688283500": {"Name": "Milazzo A.", "AuthorID": "56688283500", "AffiliationID": "60012708", "AffiliationName": "FIND Lab, Stanford University"}, "24448145000": {"Name": "Altmann A.", "AuthorID": "24448145000", "AffiliationID": "60012708", "AffiliationName": "FIND Lab, Stanford University"}}}
