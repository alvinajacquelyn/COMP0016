The aim of the present study is to identify obstacles for the feasibility of PFIs in routine care. Methods This was a multicentre, real-world, controlled, outpatient trial, carried out in 11 randomly recruited Italian mental health centres. Two mental health professionals from each center attended a modular training course on PFI and provided the intervention. Difficulties and benefits experienced by mental health professionals in implementing the intervention were assessed through the Family Intervention Schedule (FIS-R), which was administered six times. Results Sixteen out of the 22 recruited professionals completed the training and administered the PFI to 70 patients with bipolar I disorder and their relatives. The retention rate of families receiving the intervention was 93%. Mental health professionals reported high levels of organizational difficulties, several benefits in their daily clinical work and low levels of intervention-related difficulties. The most important organizational obstacles were related to the need to integrate the intervention with other work responsibilities and to the lack of time to carry out the intervention. These difficulties did not decrease over time. Intervention-related difficulties were rated as less problematic since the first time assessment and tended to improve over time. Limitations Low number of recruited professionals; use of a not previously validated assessment instrument. Conclusions PFIs are feasible in routine care for the treatment of patients with bipolar I disorder and their relatives, and main obstacles are related to the organization/structure of mental health centres, and not to the characteristics of the intervention itself.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bipolar I disorder", "Feasibility", "Implementation", "Psychoeducational family intervention", "Routine care"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Bipolar Disorder", "Caregivers", "Family Therapy", "Feasibility Studies", "Female", "Health Education", "Humans", "Italy", "Male", "Mental Health Services", "Middle Aged", "Professional-Family Relations", "Professional-Patient Relations"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84947431257", "SubjectAreas": [["Clinical Psychology", "PSYC", "3203"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"55141656400": {"Name": "Fiorillo A.", "AuthorID": "55141656400", "AffiliationID": "60026777", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, University of Naples SUN"}, "39561042900": {"Name": "Del Vecchio V.", "AuthorID": "39561042900", "AffiliationID": "60026777", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, University of Naples SUN"}, "53984898200": {"Name": "Luciano M.", "AuthorID": "53984898200", "AffiliationID": "60026777", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, University of Naples SUN"}, "54409538300": {"Name": "Sampogna G.", "AuthorID": "54409538300", "AffiliationID": "60026777", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, University of Naples SUN"}, "56966538600": {"Name": "Sbordone D.", "AuthorID": "56966538600", "AffiliationID": "60026777", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, University of Naples SUN"}, "57218348823": {"Name": "Catapano F.", "AuthorID": "57218348823", "AffiliationID": "60026777", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, University of Naples SUN"}, "7102114680": {"Name": "De Rosa C.", "AuthorID": "7102114680", "AffiliationID": "60026777", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, University of Naples SUN"}, "6602942167": {"Name": "Malangone C.", "AuthorID": "6602942167", "AffiliationID": "106146469", "AffiliationName": "Mental Health Centre of Ravello"}, "57207790131": {"Name": "Tortorella A.", "AuthorID": "57207790131", "AffiliationID": "60026777", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, University of Naples SUN"}, "7102716455": {"Name": "Maj M.", "AuthorID": "7102716455", "AffiliationID": "60026777", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, University of Naples SUN"}, "56966379000": {"Name": "Graziani A.", "AuthorID": "56966379000", "AffiliationID": "106146469", "AffiliationName": "Mental Health Centre of Ravello"}, "6602719716": {"Name": "Veltro F.", "AuthorID": "6602719716", "AffiliationID": "114721564", "AffiliationName": "Mental Health Department of Campobasso"}, "57200955769": {"Name": "Nicol\u00f2 G.", "AuthorID": "57200955769", "AffiliationID": "114721031", "AffiliationName": "Mental Health Centre of Rome"}, "57202568234": {"Name": "Piselli M.", "AuthorID": "57202568234", "AffiliationID": "114721521", "AffiliationName": "Mental Health Centre of Foligno"}, "16425192100": {"Name": "Bardicchia F.", "AuthorID": "16425192100", "AffiliationID": "114721411", "AffiliationName": "Mental Health Centre of Grosseto"}, "54408257000": {"Name": "Ciampini G.", "AuthorID": "54408257000", "AffiliationID": "114720934", "AffiliationName": "Mental Health Centre of Lanciano"}, "54409034200": {"Name": "Lampis D.", "AuthorID": "54409034200", "AffiliationID": "114721232", "AffiliationName": "Mental Health Centre of Lanusei"}, "56400419600": {"Name": "Moroni A.", "AuthorID": "56400419600", "AffiliationID": "60015708", "AffiliationName": "Niguarda Hospital, Milan"}, "57211362201": {"Name": "Bassi M.", "AuthorID": "57211362201", "AffiliationID": "60015708", "AffiliationName": "Niguarda Hospital, Milan"}, "6506733126": {"Name": "Iapichino S.", "AuthorID": "6506733126", "AffiliationID": "114721791", "AffiliationName": "Mental Health Centre of Montecatini"}, "57197539835": {"Name": "Biondi S.", "AuthorID": "57197539835", "AffiliationID": "114721791", "AffiliationName": "Mental Health Centre of Montecatini"}, "57198113839": {"Name": "Orlandi E.", "AuthorID": "57198113839", "AffiliationID": "114721002", "AffiliationName": "Mental Health Centre of Sassuolo"}, "7004624219": {"Name": "Starace F.", "AuthorID": "7004624219", "AffiliationID": "114721002", "AffiliationName": "Mental Health Centre of Sassuolo"}, "54408148100": {"Name": "Baronessa C.", "AuthorID": "54408148100", "AffiliationID": "115986488", "AffiliationName": "Mental Health Centre of Monza"}, "7003818736": {"Name": "Carr\u00e0 G.", "AuthorID": "7003818736", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College of London"}}}
