We show here that layer 6 (L6) principal neurons in mouse primary visual cortex (V1) receive a diffuse, vestibular-mediated synaptic input that signals the angular velocity of horizontal rotation. Behavioral and theoretical experiments indicate that these inputs, distributed over a network of 100 L6 neurons, provide both a reliable estimate and, therefore, physiological separation of head-velocity signals. During head rotation in the presence of visual stimuli, L6 neurons exhibit postsynaptic responses that approximate the arithmetic sum of the vestibular and visual-motion response. Functional input mapping reveals that these internal motion signals arrive into L6 via a direct projection from the retrosplenial cortex. We therefore propose that visual-motion processing in V1 L6 is multisensory and contextually dependent on the motion status of the animal's head. V1 layer 6 neurons receive a widespread head-motion signal that is integrated with visual input during visual-motion processing. These V1 head-motion inputs project from the retrosplenial cortex, a multisensory area involved in spatial navigation and contextual processing.", "AuthorKeywords": ["2P imaging", "Bayesian approach", "egocentric framework", "go/no go task", "head-velocity signals", "layer 6 neurons", "mouse primary visual cortex", "Neuropixels dense silicon probe", "whole-cell patch clamp"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Female", "Head Movements", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Mice, Transgenic", "Motion Perception", "Nerve Net", "Photic Stimulation", "Visual Cortex", "Visual Pathways"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85043357803", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"]], "AuthorData": {"34067938600": {"Name": "V\u00e9lez-Fort M.", "AuthorID": "34067938600", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60020649", "AffiliationName": "The Sainsbury Wellcome Centre for Neural Circuits and Behaviour, University College London"}, "34067510500": {"Name": "Bracey E.", "AuthorID": "34067510500", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60020649", "AffiliationName": "The Sainsbury Wellcome Centre for Neural Circuits and Behaviour, University College London"}, "57201086885": {"Name": "Keshavarzi S.", "AuthorID": "57201086885", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60020649", "AffiliationName": "The Sainsbury Wellcome Centre for Neural Circuits and Behaviour, University College London"}, "55150995100": {"Name": "Rousseau C.", "AuthorID": "55150995100", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60020649", "AffiliationName": "The Sainsbury Wellcome Centre for Neural Circuits and Behaviour, University College London"}, "36871685500": {"Name": "Cossell L.", "AuthorID": "36871685500", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60020649", "AffiliationName": "The Sainsbury Wellcome Centre for Neural Circuits and Behaviour, University College London"}, "57194425906": {"Name": "Lenzi S.", "AuthorID": "57194425906", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60020649", "AffiliationName": "The Sainsbury Wellcome Centre for Neural Circuits and Behaviour, University College London"}, "57196567675": {"Name": "Strom M.", "AuthorID": "57196567675", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60020649", "AffiliationName": "The Sainsbury Wellcome Centre for Neural Circuits and Behaviour, University College London"}, "6602716645": {"Name": "Margrie T.", "AuthorID": "6602716645", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60020649", "AffiliationName": "The Sainsbury Wellcome Centre for Neural Circuits and Behaviour, University College London"}}}
