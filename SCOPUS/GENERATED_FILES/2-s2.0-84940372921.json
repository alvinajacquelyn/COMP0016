All rights reserved.Fully nonlinear interactions between solitary waves and structures are studied based on a finite element method (FEM) in two-dimensions. A mesh with higher order 8-node quadrilateral isoperimetric element is used in the simulation. The velocity potential is obtained by solving a linear matrix system using the conjugate gradient (CG) method with a symmetric successive overelaxlation (SSOR) preconditioner, and the velocity in the fluid domain is calculated through differentiating shape functions directly. The wave elevation and potential on the free surface are updated by the fourth order Runge-Kutta method. Waves and hydrodynamic forces are obtained for single solitary waves acting on a wall and propagating on a tank with a step, collision between two solitary waves, interactions between a solitary wave and a single and twin rectangular cylinders on free surface. Some results are compared with previous studies of analytical solutions and those by experiment. The simulations have provided many results to show the nonlinearities of waves and hydrodynamic forces with different incoming wave amplitudes, and the effect of dimensions of the single cylinder and the spacing between twin cylinders on the wave and forces are also discussed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Higher order finite element method", "Nonlinear interaction", "Potential flow theory", "Solitary wave"], "IndexKeywords": ["Fourth order Runge-Kutta methods", "Higher order finite element method", "Hydrodynamic forces", "Nonlinear interactions", "Potential-flow theory", "Rectangular cylinder", "Single cylinders", "Velocity potentials"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84940372921", "SubjectAreas": [["Environmental Engineering", "ENVI", "2305"], ["Ocean Engineering", "ENGI", "2212"]], "AuthorData": {"56171687800": {"Name": "Sun J.", "AuthorID": "56171687800", "AffiliationID": "60025761", "AffiliationName": "School of Naval Architecture and Ocean Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"}, "16204733600": {"Name": "Wang C.", "AuthorID": "16204733600", "AffiliationID": "60025761", "AffiliationName": "School of Naval Architecture and Ocean Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"}, "14012675900": {"Name": "Wu G.", "AuthorID": "14012675900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "7006437595": {"Name": "Khoo B.", "AuthorID": "7006437595", "AffiliationID": "60017161", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, National University of Singapore"}}}
