Our results reveal that for armchair nanotubes, the energy gaps at K points in the Brillouin zone decrease as 1/r scaling law with the radii (r) increasing, while they are scaled by -1/r 2 + C at \u0393 points, here, C is a constant. Further studies show that such scaling law of K points is independent of both the chiral vector and the type of elements. Therefore, the band gaps of nanotubes for a given radius can be determined by these scaling laws easily. Interestingly, we also predict the existence of indirect band gap for both germanium and tin nanotubes. Our new findings provide an efficient way to determine the band gaps of group IV element nanotubes by knowing the radii, as well as to facilitate the design of functional nanodevices.", "AuthorKeywords": ["band gap scaling law", "group IV elements", "nanotube"], "IndexKeywords": ["Arm-chair nanotubes", "Bandgap properties", "Brillouin zones", "Chiral vectors", "First-principles calculation", "Group-IV", "Indirect band gap", "Nano-devices"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85014512659", "SubjectAreas": [["Bioengineering", "CENG", "1502"], ["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Mechanics of Materials", "ENGI", "2211"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"57208227935": {"Name": "Wang C.", "AuthorID": "57208227935", "AffiliationID": "60003146, 60001604", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory for Special Functional Materials, Ministry of Education, Henan University"}, "56984608400": {"Name": "Guo Y.", "AuthorID": "56984608400", "AffiliationID": "60018554", "AffiliationName": "International Laboratory for Quantum Functional Materials of Henan, School of Physics and Engineering, Zhengzhou University"}, "7401504128": {"Name": "Jia Y.", "AuthorID": "7401504128", "AffiliationID": "60003146, 60001604", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory for Special Functional Materials, Ministry of Education, Henan University"}, "7402205086": {"Name": "Fu X.", "AuthorID": "7402205086", "AffiliationID": "60017970", "AffiliationName": "College of Science, Henan University of Technology"}, "15119394300": {"Name": "Xia C.", "AuthorID": "15119394300", "AffiliationID": "60029943", "AffiliationName": "School of Physics and Materials Science, Henan Normal University"}, "57198560184": {"Name": "Guo Z.", "AuthorID": "57198560184", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}}}
