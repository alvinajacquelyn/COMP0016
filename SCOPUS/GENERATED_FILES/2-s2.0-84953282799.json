The ubiquitous expression of voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) throughout the central nervous system (CNS), along with their involvement in fundamental processes, such as neuronal excitability and synaptic transmission, has made them attractive candidates. Recent insights provided by the identification of mutations in the P/Q-type calcium channel in humans and rodents with epilepsy and the finding of thalamic T-type calcium channel dysfunction in the absence of seizures have raised expectations of a causal role of calcium channels in the polygenic inheritance of idiopathic epilepsy. In this review, we consider how genetic variation in neuronal VGCCs may influence the development of epilepsy.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Brain", "Calcium Channels", "Epilepsy", "Humans"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84953282799", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"16064306000": {"Name": "Rajakulendran S.", "AuthorID": "16064306000", "AffiliationID": "60015879", "AffiliationName": "UCL\u2013Institute of Neurology, MRC Centre for Neuromuscular Diseases"}, "15075798500": {"Name": "Hanna M.", "AuthorID": "15075798500", "AffiliationID": "60015879", "AffiliationName": "UCL\u2013Institute of Neurology, MRC Centre for Neuromuscular Diseases"}}}
