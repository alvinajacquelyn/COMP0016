In2O3 TFTs prepared on glass substrates exhibited low-voltage operation (\u22642 V) and a high electron mobility of \u223c6 cm2 V-1 s-1. By replacing the In2O3 layer with a photonically processed In2O3/ZnO heterojunction, we were able to increase the electron mobility to 36 cm2 V-1 s-1, while maintaining the low-voltage operation. Although the level of performance achieved in these devices is comparable to control TFTs fabricated via thermal annealing at 250 \u00b0C for 1 h, the photonic treatment approach adopted here is extremely rapid with a processing time of less than 18 s per layer. With the aid of a numerical model we were able to analyse the temperature profile within the metal oxide layer(s) upon flashing revealing a remarkable increase of the layer's surface temperature to \u223c1000 \u00b0C within \u223c1 ms. Despite this, the backside of the glass substrate remains unchanged and close to room temperature. Our results highlight the applicability of the method for the facile manufacturing of high performance metal oxide transistors on inexpensive large-area substrates.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["High electron mobility", "Large-area substrates", "Low voltage operation", "Metal oxide thin-film transistors", "Photonic processing", "Surface temperatures", "Temperature profiles", "Thin-film transistor (TFTs)"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85035048129", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Materials Chemistry", "MATE", "2505"]], "AuthorData": {"25930643500": {"Name": "Tetzner K.", "AuthorID": "25930643500", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Centre for Plastic Electronics, Blackett Laboratory, Imperial College London"}, "55336679600": {"Name": "Lin Y.H.", "AuthorID": "55336679600", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Centre for Plastic Electronics, Blackett Laboratory, Imperial College London"}, "6701337286": {"Name": "Anthopoulos T.D.", "AuthorID": "6701337286", "AffiliationID": "60092945", "AffiliationName": "Division of Physical Sciences and Engineering, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology"}, "54882406000": {"Name": "Regoutz A.", "AuthorID": "54882406000", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials, Royal School of Mines, Imperial College London"}, "56785104500": {"Name": "Payne D.J.", "AuthorID": "56785104500", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials, Royal School of Mines, Imperial College London"}, "57197817550": {"Name": "Seitkhan A.", "AuthorID": "57197817550", "AffiliationID": "60092945", "AffiliationName": "Division of Physical Sciences and Engineering, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology"}}}
