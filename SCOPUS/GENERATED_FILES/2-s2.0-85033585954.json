Important new insights have emerged regarding axonal degeneration and regeneration, glial responses and neuro inflammation, changes in the neurovascular unit, and, more recently, neural transplantations. Accompanying a 2017 SfN Mini-Symposium, here, we discuss selected recent advances in understanding the neuronal, glial, and other cellular responses to CNS injury and disease with in vivo imaging of the rodent brain or spinal cord. We anticipate that in vivo optical imaging will continue to be at the forefront of breakthrough discoveries of fundamental mechanisms and therapies for CNS injury and disease.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Blood-brain barrier", "IPSCs", "Microglia", "Retina", "Two-photon imaging"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Central Nervous System", "Central Nervous System Diseases", "Humans", "Mice", "Neuroimaging", "Rats"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85033585954", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"]], "AuthorData": {"6602192155": {"Name": "Akassoglou K.", "AuthorID": "6602192155", "AffiliationID": "60023691", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, University of California San Francisco"}, "40462055100": {"Name": "Merlini M.", "AuthorID": "40462055100", "AffiliationID": "60026791", "AffiliationName": "Gladstone Institutes"}, "8135349100": {"Name": "Rafalski V.A.", "AuthorID": "8135349100", "AffiliationID": "60026791", "AffiliationName": "Gladstone Institutes"}, "55218539800": {"Name": "Real R.", "AuthorID": "55218539800", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Clinical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London"}, "36878200000": {"Name": "De Paola V.", "AuthorID": "36878200000", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Clinical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London"}, "57220836311": {"Name": "Liang L.", "AuthorID": "57220836311", "AffiliationID": "60002746, 60030058", "AffiliationName": "Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, Department of Medicine, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School"}, "8110921200": {"Name": "Jin Y.", "AuthorID": "8110921200", "AffiliationID": "60104544", "AffiliationName": "Center for Cognition and Sociality, Institute for Basic Science"}, "55216381000": {"Name": "Dougherty S.E.", "AuthorID": "55216381000", "AffiliationID": "60001117, 60005248", "AffiliationName": "Solomon H.
