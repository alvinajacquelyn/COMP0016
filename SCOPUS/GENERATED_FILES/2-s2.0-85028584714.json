Antimicrobial surfaces significantly contribute toward reducing the incidence of infections as they prevent bacterial adhesion and cause bacterial cell death. Using a simple, easily upscalable swell-encapsulation-shrink method, novel antimicrobial surfaces have been developed by incorporating metal oxide nanoparticles (NPs) and crystal violet (CV) dye into medical-grade polyurethane sheets. This study compares the bactericidal effects of polyurethane incorporating ZnO, Mg-doped ZnO, and MgO. All metal oxide NPs are well defined, with average diameters ranging from 2 to 18 nm. These materials demonstrate potent bactericidal activity when tested against clinically relevant bacteria such as Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. Additionally, these composites are tested against an epidemic strain of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) that is rife in hospitals throughout the UK. Furthermore, we have tested these materials using a low light intensity (a500 lx), similar to that present in many clinical environments. The highest activity is achieved from polymer composites incorporating CV and a3 nm ZnO NPs, and the different performances of the metal oxides have been discussed.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85028584714", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"]], "AuthorData": {"56450900200": {"Name": "Sehmi S.K.", "AuthorID": "56450900200", "AffiliationID": "60013985, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Microbial Disease, UCL Eastman Dental Institute, University College London"}, "26643365600": {"Name": "MacRobert A.J.", "AuthorID": "26643365600", "AffiliationID": "60176023, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Division of Surgery and Interventional Science, University College London, Royal Free Campus"}, "51160971600": {"Name": "Bear J.C.", "AuthorID": "51160971600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Materials Chemistry Research Centre, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "55659162000": {"Name": "Peveler W.J.", "AuthorID": "55659162000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Materials Chemistry Research Centre, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "56217400400": {"Name": "Parkin I.P.", "AuthorID": "56217400400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Materials Chemistry Research Centre, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "35848365800": {"Name": "Allan E.", "AuthorID": "35848365800", "AffiliationID": "60013985, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Microbial Disease, UCL Eastman Dental Institute, University College London"}, "36448358200": {"Name": "Noimark S.", "AuthorID": "36448358200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "54785201100": {"Name": "Pike S.D.", "AuthorID": "54785201100", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Imperial College London, Imperial College Road"}, "55476614900": {"Name": "Williams C.K.", "AuthorID": "55476614900", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Imperial College London, Imperial College Road"}, "7103369266": {"Name": "Shaffer M.S.P.", "AuthorID": "7103369266", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Imperial College London, Imperial College Road"}}}
