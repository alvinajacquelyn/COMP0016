This article reports on the economic evaluation alongside this trial. Methods: Detailed resource use and quality of life over 12 months after randomization was obtained from the trial reported by Williams and colleagues. Outcomes were measured using the EQ-5D and quality-adjusted life years calculated. Results: Year 1 costs for surgery were significantly higher than in best medical therapy, at \u00a319,069 compared to \u00a39,813, a difference of \u00a39,256 (95% confidence interval [CI]: \u00a37,625, \u00a310,887). There was a small, significant gain in utility at 1 year but a statistically insignificant gain of 0.02 quality-adjusted life years (95% CI: \u22120.015, 0.05) in the surgical arm. The incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year of surgery at 1 year was \u00a3468,528. Extrapolation reveals that after 5 years, this ratio is likely to reduce to \u00a345,180, but subsequently rise to \u00a370,537 at 10 years owing to the increased probability of battery replacements (and re-replacements) beyond 5 years. Conclusion: In this patient group, DBS is not cost-effective at 1 year. Extrapolation, however, reveals an increasing likelihood of cost-effectiveness up to 5 years and reducing cost-effectiveness between 5 and 10 years. These models are sensitive to assumptions about future costs and quality-adjusted life years gained. \u00a9 2016 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.", "AuthorKeywords": ["deep brain stimulation", "economic evaluation", "Parkinson's", "PD SURG"], "IndexKeywords": ["Antiparkinson Agents", "Cost-Benefit Analysis", "Deep Brain Stimulation", "Drug Therapy, Combination", "Follow-Up Studies", "Humans", "Outcome Assessment (Health Care)", "Parkinson Disease"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84957651469", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"56397831200": {"Name": "McIntosh E.", "AuthorID": "56397831200", "AffiliationID": "60001490", "AffiliationName": "Health Economics and Health Technology Assessment, University of Glasgow, Institute of Health and Wellbeing"}, "55484828600": {"Name": "Gray A.", "AuthorID": "55484828600", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Health Economics Research Centre, University of Oxford"}, "57210456180": {"Name": "Daniels J.", "AuthorID": "57210456180", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "Birmingham Clinical Trials Unit, University of Birmingham"}, "7003439441": {"Name": "Ives N.", "AuthorID": "7003439441", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "Birmingham Clinical Trials Unit, University of Birmingham"}, "25947716300": {"Name": "Patel S.", "AuthorID": "25947716300", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "Birmingham Clinical Trials Unit, University of Birmingham"}, "7003534063": {"Name": "Rick C.", "AuthorID": "7003534063", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "Birmingham Clinical Trials Unit, University of Birmingham"}, "7202284713": {"Name": "Gill S.", "AuthorID": "7202284713", "AffiliationID": "60024581", "AffiliationName": "Frenchay Hospital"}, "36901023100": {"Name": "Jenkinson C.", "AuthorID": "36901023100", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Health Services Research Unit, Nuffield Department of Population Health, University of Oxford, Richard Doll Building, Old Road Campus"}, "8316473700": {"Name": "Mitchell R.", "AuthorID": "8316473700", "AffiliationID": "60012191", "AffiliationName": "Queen Elizabeth Hospital"}, "57213315379": {"Name": "Pall H.", "AuthorID": "57213315379", "AffiliationID": "60012191", "AffiliationName": "Queen Elizabeth Hospital"}, "56011809000": {"Name": "Williams A.", "AuthorID": "56011809000", "AffiliationID": "60012191", "AffiliationName": "Queen Elizabeth Hospital"}, "55586286900": {"Name": "Quinn N.", "AuthorID": "55586286900", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "55620170800": {"Name": "Wheatley K.", "AuthorID": "55620170800", "AffiliationID": "60019702, 60012754", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Research UK Clinical Trials Unit (CRCTU), Institute of Cancer and Genomic SciencesCollege of Medical and Dental Sciences, University of Birmingham"}, "null": {"Name": null, "AuthorID": null, "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
