Pomalidomide has shown improved survival and good tolerability in this patient cohort in clinical trials, but real world data are scarce. We retrospectively analysed all patients treated with pomalidomide at five UK centres between 2013 and 2016. Of 85 patients identified, 70 had sufficient information for response assessments. Median age was 66 years [40\u201389], 96\u00b75% were refractory to IMiDs, 72\u00b79% were refractory to both an IMiD and bortezomib and 92\u00b79% were refractory to their last treatment. Of 45 patients with fluorescence in situ hybridization results 64% had adverse risk, 19 patients (22\u00b74%) had an estimated glomerular filtration rate <45 ml/min. Grade \u22653 non-haematological toxicities occurred in 42\u00b74%, and grade \u22653 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia in 38% and 24% respectively, but only 18\u00b78% had dose reductions. The overall response rate was 52\u00b79%. At a median follow-up of 13\u00b72 months, median progression-free survival was 5\u00b72 months [95% confidence interval (CI) 4\u00b7150\u20136\u00b7238], and median overall survival was 13\u00b77 months (95% CI 11\u00b7775\u201315\u00b7707). No significant difference was seen in response, survival or tolerability by renal function, age or cytogenetic risk.
