Residual cationic vs. anionic surfactant induces a respective increase or decrease in the measured conductance across the SWCNT networks when exposed to water vapour. The magnitude of this effect was found to be dependent on the thickness of the deposited SWCNT films. Previously, chemical sensors, field effect transistors (FETs) and transparent conductive films (TCFs) have been fabricated from aqueous dispersions of surfactant functionalised SWCNTs. The results reported here confirm that the electrical properties of such components, based on randomly orientated SWCNT networks, can be significantly altered by the presence of surfactant in the SWCNT layer. A mechanism for the observed behaviour is proposed based on electrical measurements, Raman and UV-Vis-NIR spectroscopy. Additionally, the potential for manipulating the sensitivity of the surfactant functionalised SWCNTs to water vapour for atmospheric humidity sensing was evaluated. The study also presents a simple method to establish the effectiveness of surfactant removal techniques, and highlights the importance of characterising the electrical properties of SWCNT-based devices in both dry and humid operating environments for practical applications.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Aqueous dispersions", "Electrical measurement", "Field effect transistor (FETs)", "Operating environment", "Single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNTs)", "Single-walled carbon nanotube networks", "Transparent conductive films", "UV-vis-NIR spectroscopy"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85027416092", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"]], "AuthorData": {"56394959300": {"Name": "Evans G.P.", "AuthorID": "56394959300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "55225922100": {"Name": "Buckley D.J.", "AuthorID": "55225922100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "56217400400": {"Name": "Parkin I.P.", "AuthorID": "56217400400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "7003890182": {"Name": "Skipper N.T.", "AuthorID": "7003890182", "AffiliationID": "60175883", "AffiliationName": "London Centre for Nanotechnology"}}}
