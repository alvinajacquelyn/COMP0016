All rights reserved.Building Information Modeling (BIM) is the main standard for constructions in the Built Environment. However, the currently agreed BIM interchange standards (IFC, COBie) are not suited for much further extension, lacking features needed for the incorporation of IoT and security. In addition, these standards are used to describe buildings and other assets through files, where the different building assets are entities with a fixed data structure and no relations between them. That is, two assets represented in the file, even described with the same data structure, are treated as separated elements, so that changes in one element do not affect the data structure of the other one. This will cause functional problems in future Building Automation Systems, such as the lack of provision for handling all objects of a particular type at the same time when adding specific or general security features. To address these issues, we present here a novel approach, this was part of our research work in the EBIS project (Extending BIM Level 2 to support IoT & Security) and forms the basis of the PETRAS APBIM Project. The approach is based on the use of digital objects (DOs), instead of files, to represent built environments with IoT and security features. Also, these DOs could be used to define customised hierarchical structures to represent flexible data structures and relate built assets between them, what we called templates. These DOs to represent assets are supported by the Handle System, a Secure Identity Data Management System (SIDMS). This approach will allow the incorporation of generic and specific security features to all assets of a specific class. It will allow also the incorporation of assets defined generically in other domains to become templates, after appropriate processing, in the BIM databases. In order to validate our proposal, a Proof of Concept (PoC) is conducted in this research. We conclude with some comments on future work in the advertising of building features in a catalogue system \u2013 working in collaboration with our approach.", "AuthorKeywords": ["BIM", "Digital objects", "Handle system", "IoT", "Security"], "IndexKeywords": ["Building automation systems", "Building Information Model - BIM", "Data management system", "Digital Objects", "Handle system", "Hierarchical structures", "Interchange standard", "Security"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85048408295", "SubjectAreas": [["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"57207616175": {"Name": "Kirstein P.T.", "AuthorID": "57207616175", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "55835206800": {"Name": "Ruiz-Zafra A.", "AuthorID": "55835206800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
