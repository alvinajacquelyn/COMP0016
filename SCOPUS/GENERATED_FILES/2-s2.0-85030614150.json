However, whether or not the prediction error valence also affects counterfactual learning, that is, learning from forgone outcomes, is unknown. To address this question, we analysed the performance of two groups of participants on reinforcement learning tasks using a computational model that was adapted to test if prediction error valence influences learning. We carried out two experiments: in the factual learning experiment, participants learned from partial feedback (i.e., the outcome of the chosen option only); in the counterfactual learning experiment, participants learned from complete feedback information (i.e., the outcomes of both the chosen and unchosen option were displayed). In the factual learning experiment, we replicated previous findings of a valence-induced bias, whereby participants learned preferentially from positive, relative to negative, prediction errors. In contrast, for counterfactual learning, we found the opposite valence-induced bias: negative prediction errors were preferentially taken into account, relative to positive ones. When considering valence-induced bias in the context of both factual and counterfactual learning, it appears that people tend to preferentially take into account information that confirms their current choice.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Computational Biology", "Decision Making", "Feedback, Psychological", "Female", "Humans", "Learning", "Male", "Reinforcement (Psychology)", "Task Performance and Analysis", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85030614150", "SubjectAreas": [["Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics", "AGRI", "1105"], ["Modeling and Simulation", "MATH", "2611"], ["Ecology", "ENVI", "2303"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"], ["Computational Theory and Mathematics", "COMP", "1703"]], "AuthorData": {"24721734500": {"Name": "Palminteri S.", "AuthorID": "24721734500", "AffiliationID": "60018464", "AffiliationName": "Laboratoire d'\u00c9conomie Math\u00e9matique et de Micro\u00e9conomie Appliqu\u00e9e, Universit\u00e9 Panth\u00e9on-Assas, FR"}, "36659657000": {"Name": "Kilford E.J.", "AuthorID": "36659657000", "AffiliationID": "60018464", "AffiliationName": "Laboratoire d'\u00c9conomie Math\u00e9matique et de Micro\u00e9conomie Appliqu\u00e9e, Universit\u00e9 Panth\u00e9on-Assas, FR"}, "26643513600": {"Name": "Blakemore S.J.", "AuthorID": "26643513600", "AffiliationID": "60018464", "AffiliationName": "Laboratoire d'\u00c9conomie Math\u00e9matique et de Micro\u00e9conomie Appliqu\u00e9e, Universit\u00e9 Panth\u00e9on-Assas, FR"}, "57195969831": {"Name": "Lefebvre G.", "AuthorID": "57195969831", "AffiliationID": "60018464", "AffiliationName": "Laboratoire d'\u00c9conomie Math\u00e9matique et de Micro\u00e9conomie Appliqu\u00e9e, Universit\u00e9 Panth\u00e9on-Assas, FR"}}}
