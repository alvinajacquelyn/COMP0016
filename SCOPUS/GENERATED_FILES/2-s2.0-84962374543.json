Dust ejected with the gas in the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) phase is subject to the harsh environment of the planetary nebula (PN) while the star is evolving towards a white dwarf. Dust surviving the PN phase contributes to the dust content of the interstellar medium. Aims. The morphology of the internal dust extinction has been mapped for the first time in a PN, the bright nearby Galactic nebula NGC 7009. The morphologies of the gas, dust extinction and dust-to-gas ratio are compared to the structural features of the nebula. Methods. Emission line maps in H Balmer and Paschen lines were formed from analysis of MUSE cubes of NGC 7009 observed during science verification of the instrument. The measured electron temperature and density from the same cube were employed to predict the theoretical H line ratios and derive the extinction distribution across the nebula. After correction for the interstellar extinction to NGC 7009, the internal AV/NH has been mapped for the first time in a PN. Results. The extinction map of NGC 7009 has considerable structure, broadly corresponding to the morphological features of the nebula. The dust-to-gas ratio, AV/NH, increases from 0.7 times the interstellar value to > 5 times from the centre towards the periphery of the ionized nebula. The integrated AV/NH is about 2\u00d7 the mean ISM value. A large-scale feature in the extinction map is a wave, consisting of a crest and trough, at the rim of the inner shell. The nature of this feature is investigated and instrumental and physical causes considered; no convincing mechanisms were identified to produce this feature, other than AGB mass loss variations. Conclusions. Extinction mapping from H emission line imaging of PNe with MUSE provides a powerful tool for revealing the properties of internal dust and the dust-to-gas ratio.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Dust extinction", "Planetary nebulae: individual: NGC 7009", "Stars: AGB and post-AGB"], "IndexKeywords": ["Asymptotic giant branch", "Dust extinctions", "Interstellar extinction", "Interstellar mediums", "Morphological features", "Planetary nebulae", "Stars:AGB and post AGB", "Structural feature"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84962374543", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"7404417041": {"Name": "Walsh J.R.", "AuthorID": "7404417041", "AffiliationID": "60023599", "AffiliationName": "European Southern Observatory"}, "6602706480": {"Name": "Monreal-Ibero A.", "AuthorID": "6602706480", "AffiliationID": "60031186, 60123796, 60008134", "AffiliationName": "GEPI, CNRS, Universite Paris-Diderot"}, "18041819500": {"Name": "Barlow M.J.", "AuthorID": "18041819500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dept. of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "7005222326": {"Name": "Ueta T.", "AuthorID": "7005222326", "AffiliationID": "60015404", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Denver"}, "7003586236": {"Name": "Wesson R.", "AuthorID": "7003586236", "AffiliationID": "60013961", "AffiliationName": "European Southern Observatory"}, "7006787430": {"Name": "Zijlstra A.A.", "AuthorID": "7006787430", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics, University of Manchester"}}}
