We evaluated the field performance, feasibility, and acceptability of a dual rapid diagnostic test (RDT) for HIV and syphilis test in antenatal clinic settings in Nigeria. Methods and findings Participants were recruited at 12 antenatal clinic sites in three states of Nigeria. All consenting individuals were tested according to the national HIV testing algorithm, as well as a dual RDT, the SD BIOLINE HIV/Syphilis Duo Test (Alere, USA), in the clinic. To determine sensitivity, specificity and concordance, whole blood samples were obtained for repeat RDT performance in the laboratory, as well as reference tests for HIV and syphilis. Dual test acceptability and operational characteristics were assessed among participants and clinic staff. The prevalence of HIV among the 4,551 enrollees was 3.0% (138/4551) using the national clinic-based HIV testing algorithm. Positive and negative percent agreement of the HIV component of the dual RDT were 100.0% (95% CI 99.7\u2013100.0) and 99.9% (95% CI 99.7\u2013100.0) respectively, when compared with the national rapid testing algorithm. The prevalence of syphilis, using TPHA as the reference test, was low at 0.09% (4/4550). The sensitivity of the syphilis component of the dual RDT could not be calculated as no positive results were observed for patients that were positive for syphilis by TPHA. Each of the only four TPHA-positive specimens had RPR titers of 1:1 (neat), indicative of non-active syphilis. The specificity of the syphilis component of the dual RDT was 99.9% (95% CI 99.8\u2013100.0). The dual RDT received favorable feasibility ratings among antenatal care clinic staff. Acceptability among study participants was high with most women reporting preference for rapid dual HIV/syphilis testing. Conclusions The SD BIOLINE HIV/Syphilis Duo Test showed a high overall diagnostic accuracy for HIV and a high specificity for syphilis diagnosis in antenatal clinic settings. This study adds to a growing body of evidence that supports the clinic-based use of dual tests for HIV and syphilis among pregnant women.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "AIDS Serodiagnosis", "Ambulatory Care Facilities", "Antibodies, Bacterial", "Antibodies, Viral", "Female", "HIV", "HIV Infections", "Humans", "Immunoassay", "Infectious Disease Transmission, Vertical", "Mass Screening", "Nigeria", "Pregnancy", "Pregnancy Complications, Infectious", "Reagent Kits, Diagnostic", "Sensitivity and Specificity", "Syphilis", "Syphilis Serodiagnosis", "Treponema pallidum"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85049635555", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"57202867402": {"Name": "Olugbenga I.", "AuthorID": "57202867402", "AffiliationID": "112737069", "AffiliationName": "National AIDS and STIs Control Programme, Federal Ministry of Health Nigeria, FCT"}, "56578591700": {"Name": "Ngige E.", "AuthorID": "56578591700", "AffiliationID": "112737069", "AffiliationName": "National AIDS and STIs Control Programme, Federal Ministry of Health Nigeria, FCT"}, "56442717500": {"Name": "Anyaike C.", "AuthorID": "56442717500", "AffiliationID": "112737069", "AffiliationName": "National AIDS and STIs Control Programme, Federal Ministry of Health Nigeria, FCT"}, "57202868488": {"Name": "Taiwo O.", "AuthorID": "57202868488", "AffiliationID": "60072534", "AffiliationName": "WHO Regional Office for Africa"}, "57207604157": {"Name": "Laverty M.", "AuthorID": "57207604157", "AffiliationID": "60027142", "AffiliationName": "Department of Reproductive Health and Research, World Health Organization"}, "56311254000": {"Name": "Gliddon H.D.", "AuthorID": "56311254000", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "London Centre for Nanotechnology, University College London"}, "55959680400": {"Name": "Nurse-Findlay S.", "AuthorID": "55959680400", "AffiliationID": "60027142", "AffiliationName": "Department of Reproductive Health and Research, World Health Organization"}, "13606192700": {"Name": "Taylor M.M.", "AuthorID": "13606192700", "AffiliationID": "60000177, 60021658", "AffiliationName": "Division of STD Prevention, National Center for HIV, Viral Hepatitis, STD and TB Prevention, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"}, "6603784196": {"Name": "Bakare R.", "AuthorID": "6603784196", "AffiliationID": "60018680", "AffiliationName": "Department of Microbiology, University College Hospital Ibadan"}, "57205174484": {"Name": "Ogunleye V.", "AuthorID": "57205174484", "AffiliationID": "60018680", "AffiliationName": "Department of Microbiology, University College Hospital Ibadan"}, "57073889200": {"Name": "Peterson Maddox B.L.", "AuthorID": "57073889200", "AffiliationID": "60000177, 60021658", "AffiliationName": "Division of STD Prevention, National Center for HIV, Viral Hepatitis, STD and TB Prevention, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"}, "7402964831": {"Name": "Newman D.R.", "AuthorID": "7402964831", "AffiliationID": "60000177, 60021658", "AffiliationName": "Division of STD Prevention, National Center for HIV, Viral Hepatitis, STD and TB Prevention, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"}, "56120768000": {"Name": "Ofondu E.", "AuthorID": "56120768000", "AffiliationID": "114071772", "AffiliationName": "Dermatology and Venereology Department, Federal Medical Center Owerri"}}}
