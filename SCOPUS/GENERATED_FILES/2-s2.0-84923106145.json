Petrologic and geochemical analysis of these meteorites, combined with orbital remote sensing measurements, have enabled additional discoveries about the composition and age of the lunar surface on a global scale. However, the interpretation of these samples is limited by the fact that we do not know the source region of any individual lunar meteorite. Here, we investigate the link between meteorite and source region on the Moon using the Lunar Prospector gamma ray spectrometer remote sensing data set for the elements Fe, Ti, and Th. The approach has been validated using Apollo and Luna bulk regolith samples, and we have applied it to 48 meteorites excluding paired stones. Our approach is able broadly to differentiate the best compositional matches as potential regions of origin for the various classes of lunar meteorites. Basaltic and intermediate Fe regolith breccia meteorites are found to have the best constrained potential launch sites, with some impact breccias and pristine mare basalts also having reasonably well-defined potential source regions. Launch areas for highland feldspathic meteorites are much less well constrained and the addition of another element, such as Mg, will probably be required to identify potential source regions for these.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84923106145", "SubjectAreas": [["Geophysics", "EART", "1908"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"56453546500": {"Name": "Calzada-Diaz A.", "AuthorID": "56453546500", "AffiliationID": "60162133", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Planetary Sciences UCL/Birkbeck"}, "7103354128": {"Name": "Crawford I.A.", "AuthorID": "7103354128", "AffiliationID": "60162133", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Planetary Sciences UCL/Birkbeck"}, "25638594500": {"Name": "Nordheim T.A.", "AuthorID": "25638594500", "AffiliationID": "60084281, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Mullard Space Science Laboratory, University College London"}, "14064757000": {"Name": "Joy K.H.", "AuthorID": "14064757000", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "School of Earth, Atmospheric and Environmental Sciences, University of Manchester"}}}
