L. pneumophila utilizes a Type IVb secretion (T4bS) system termed \u201cdot/icm\u201d to secrete protein effectors to the host cytoplasm. The dot/icm system is powered at least in part by a functionally critical AAA+ ATPase, a protein called DotB, thought to belong to the VirB11 family of proteins. Here we present the crystal structure of DotB at 3.19 \u00c5 resolution, in its hexameric form. We observe that DotB is in fact a structural intermediate between VirB11 and PilT family proteins, with a PAS-like N-terminal domain coupled to a RecA-like C-terminal domain. It also shares critical structural elements only found in PilT. The structure also reveals two conformers, termed \u03b1 and \u03b2, with an \u03b1\u03b2\u03b1\u03b2\u03b1\u03b2 configuration. The existence of \u03b1 and \u03b2 conformers in this class of proteins was confirmed by solving the structure of DotB from another bacterial pathogen, Yersinia, where, intriguingly, we observed an \u03b1\u03b1\u03b2\u03b1\u03b1\u03b2 configuration. The two conformers co-exist regardless of the nucleotide-bound states of the proteins. Our investigation therefore reveals that these ATPases can adopt a wider range of conformational states than was known before, shedding new light on the extraordinary spectrum of conformations these ATPases can access to carry out their function. Overall, the structure of DotB provides a template for further rational drug design to develop more specific antibiotics to tackle Legionnaire's disease.
