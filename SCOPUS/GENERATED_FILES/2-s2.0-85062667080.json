All rights reserved.The data science technologies of artificial intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), big data and behavioral/predictive analytics, and blockchain are poised to revolutionize government and create a new generation of GovTech start-ups. The impact from the \u00e2\u20ac smartification' of public services and the national infrastructure will be much more significant in comparison to any other sector given government's function and importance to every institution and individual. Potential GovTech systems include Chatbots and intelligent assistants for public engagement, Robo-advisors to support civil servants, real-time management of the national infrastructure using IoT and blockchain, automated compliance/regulation, public records securely stored in blockchain distributed ledgers, online judicial and dispute resolution systems, and laws/statutes encoded as blockchain smart contracts. Government is potentially the major \u00e2\u20ac client' and also \u00e2\u20ac public champion' for these new data technologies. This review paper uses our simple taxonomy of government services to provide an overview of data science automation being deployed by governments world-wide. The goal of this review paper is to encourage the Computer Science community to engage with government to develop these new systems to transform public services and support the work of civil servants.", "AuthorKeywords": ["artificial intelligence", "big data", "blockchain", "data science", "government", "Internet of Things"], "IndexKeywords": ["Dispute resolution", "government", "Government services", "Intelligent assistants", "Internet of Things (IOT)", "National infrastructure", "Real-time management", "Science technologies"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85062667080", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"]], "AuthorData": {"24479357200": {"Name": "Engin Z.", "AuthorID": "24479357200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "7003613959": {"Name": "Treleaven P.", "AuthorID": "7003613959", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}}}
