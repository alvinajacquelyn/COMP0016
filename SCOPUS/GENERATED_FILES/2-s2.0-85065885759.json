This study evaluates whether EL merely represents the negative \u201cmood/affect\u201d component of ODD or forms a distinct dimension. Method: EL and ODD data from 1,317 ADHD participants were analyzed using exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) for binary data. Results: Within ADHD, 39.4% children had ODD and 42.6% had EL. A sizable proportion expressed only either ODD or EL: 16.6% had ODD-only, 19.7% had EL-only, and 22.9% expressed both. In both EFA and CFA, EL forms a separate dimension from ODD items and the \u201cmood/affect\u201d subdimensions (whether classified by Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders [5th ed.; DSM-5] or the Burke et al. models or the de novo ODD subdimensions derived from our data). This factorial structure remains invariant across gender. Conclusion: EL is distinct from ODD and its \u201cmood/affect\u201d subdimensions. In line with emerging evidence, our findings provide further evidence of factorial validity for EL as a separate construct from ODD.", "AuthorKeywords": ["ADHD", "emotional lability", "factor analyses", "ODD"], "IndexKeywords": ["Affective Symptoms", "Anger", "Attention Deficit and Disruptive Behavior Disorders", "Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity", "Child", "Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders", "Factor Analysis, Statistical", "Female", "Humans", "Irritable Mood", "Male", "Mood Disorders", "Personality Disorders"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85065885759", "SubjectAreas": [["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"], ["Clinical Psychology", "PSYC", "3203"]], "AuthorData": {"56997731800": {"Name": "Liu L.", "AuthorID": "56997731800", "AffiliationID": "60073471, 60014966", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of Mental Health, Ministry of Health (Peking University)"}, "55700857700": {"Name": "Sun L.", "AuthorID": "55700857700", "AffiliationID": "60073471, 60014966", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of Mental Health, Ministry of Health (Peking University)"}, "56978399100": {"Name": "Yu X.", "AuthorID": "56978399100", "AffiliationID": "60073471, 60014966", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of Mental Health, Ministry of Health (Peking University)"}, "56089255800": {"Name": "Wu Z.", "AuthorID": "56089255800", "AffiliationID": "60073471, 60014966", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of Mental Health, Ministry of Health (Peking University)"}, "57198987660": {"Name": "Yang L.", "AuthorID": "57198987660", "AffiliationID": "60073471, 60014966", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of Mental Health, Ministry of Health (Peking University)"}, "7102168580": {"Name": "Qian Q.", "AuthorID": "7102168580", "AffiliationID": "60073471, 60014966", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of Mental Health, Ministry of Health (Peking University)"}, "36104789200": {"Name": "Wang Y.", "AuthorID": "36104789200", "AffiliationID": "60073471, 60014966", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of Mental Health, Ministry of Health (Peking University)"}, "35975528400": {"Name": "Chen W.", "AuthorID": "35975528400", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Psychiatry, King\u2019s College London"}, "14520248500": {"Name": "Vitoratou S.", "AuthorID": "14520248500", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Psychiatry, King\u2019s College London"}, "12769074400": {"Name": "Hagger-Johnson G.", "AuthorID": "12769074400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}}}
