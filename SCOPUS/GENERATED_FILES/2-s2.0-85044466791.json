As such, these reforms have generated a portfolio for parents to exercise school choice. This article explores the discourses surrounding the liberalization of education provision and its implications for technical education, by adopting Hodgson and Spours\u2019 (2012) conceptualization of localism as a lens through which to empirically research one of the former government\u2019s flagship technical institutions \u2013 the University Technical College (UTC). Drawing on a series of interviews, the study examines and analyses the concept of localism within the context of a UTC and identifies emergent themes. Importantly, the study\u2019s findings challenge the assumption that institutions will, of their own volition, come together and put aside institutional self-interest for the greater good of the learner and the local and regional skills agenda. The study concludes with recommendations for further research to determine whether the tensions, competitive practices and competition identified at a single institution may be indicative of those experienced more widely across UTCs.", "AuthorKeywords": ["laissez-faire", "localism", "new provision", "technical education", "university technical colleges"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85044466791", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["Strategy and Management", "BUSI", "1408"]], "AuthorData": {"57201366800": {"Name": "Gomery D.", "AuthorID": "57201366800", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Education"}}}
