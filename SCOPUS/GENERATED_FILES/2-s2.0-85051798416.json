We aimed to investigate how affective problems across the life course relate to later-life cognitive state. Methods: Data from 1269 participants from the Medical Research Council National Survey of Health and Development (NSHD, the British 1946 birth cohort) were used. Prospectively-assessed measures of affective symptoms spanning ages 13\u201369 and categorised into case-level thresholds. Outcomes consisted of a comprehensive measure of cognitive state (Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination (ACE-III)), verbal memory, and letter search speed and accuracy at age 69. Results: Complementary life course models demonstrated that having 2 or more case-level problems across the life course was most strongly associated with poorer cognitive outcomes, before and after adjusting for sex, childhood cognition, childhood and midlife occupational position and education. Limitations: A disproportionate loss to follow-up of those who had lower childhood cognitive scores may have led to underestimation of the strength of associations. Discussion: Using a population-based prospective study we provide evidence that recurrent lifetime affective problems predicts poorer later-life cognitive state, and this risk can be already manifest in early old age (age 69). Our findings raise the possibility that effective management to minimise affective problems reoccurring across the life course may reduce the associated risk of cognitive impairment and decline.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Affective", "Anxiety", "Cognition", "Cognitive state", "Depression", "Life course"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Affective Symptoms", "Aged", "Child", "Cognition Disorders", "Cohort Studies", "Ethnic Groups", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Health Surveys", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Prospective Studies", "Psychiatric Status Rating Scales", "United Kingdom", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85051798416", "SubjectAreas": [["Clinical Psychology", "PSYC", "3203"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"57210000595": {"Name": "James S.N.", "AuthorID": "57210000595", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Unit for Lifelong Health and Aging at UCL"}, "55350725000": {"Name": "Davis D.", "AuthorID": "55350725000", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Unit for Lifelong Health and Aging at UCL"}, "56179132900": {"Name": "O'Hare C.", "AuthorID": "56179132900", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Unit for Lifelong Health and Aging at UCL"}, "35249133300": {"Name": "Sharma N.", "AuthorID": "35249133300", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Unit for Lifelong Health and Aging at UCL"}, "57204025615": {"Name": "Hardy R.", "AuthorID": "57204025615", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Unit for Lifelong Health and Aging at UCL"}, "8329745200": {"Name": "Kuh D.", "AuthorID": "8329745200", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Unit for Lifelong Health and Aging at UCL"}, "7402054647": {"Name": "Richards M.", "AuthorID": "7402054647", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Unit for Lifelong Health and Aging at UCL"}, "57203458348": {"Name": "John A.", "AuthorID": "57203458348", "AffiliationID": "60017317", "AffiliationName": "EDGE Lab, School of Psychology, University of Sussex"}, "24778218700": {"Name": "Gaysina D.", "AuthorID": "24778218700", "AffiliationID": "60017317", "AffiliationName": "EDGE Lab, School of Psychology, University of Sussex"}}}
