European Journal of Cancer Care Published by John Wiley & Sons LtdObjective: This study aimed to explore women's views about breast cancer risk and alcohol use, to inform the design of a prototype for an intervention in breast clinics about alcohol as a modifiable risk factor for breast cancer. Methods: Women recruited in NHS breast screening and symptomatic clinics in Southampton, UK, were invited to take part in semi-structured telephone interviews or a focus group to discuss their perspectives of breast cancer risk, alcohol consumption and their information needs about these topics. Data were analysed thematically. Twenty-eight women took part in telephone interviews, and 16 attended one of three focus groups. Results: While most women reported a personal responsibility for their health and were interested in advice about modifiable risk factors, few without (or prior to) experience of breast symptoms independently sought information. Many considered alcohol advice irrelevant as the association with breast cancer was largely unknown, and participants did not consider their drinking to be problematic. Women reported trusting information from health organisations like the NHS, but advice needs to be sensitive and non-blaming. Conclusion: NHS breast screening and symptomatic clinics offer a \u201cteachable moment\u201d to engage women with context-specific advice about alcohol and cancer risk that, if targeted correctly, may assist them in making informed lifestyle choices.", "AuthorKeywords": ["alcohol", "breast cancer", "intervention", "patient information", "prevention", "qualitative"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Alcohol Drinking", "Attitude to Health", "Breast Neoplasms", "Cancer Care Facilities", "England", "Female", "Humans", "Middle Aged", "Needs Assessment", "Patient Education as Topic", "Risk Factors", "Social Responsibility", "Telephone", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85065203313", "SubjectAreas": [["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"]], "AuthorData": {"57188680350": {"Name": "Chambers S.E.", "AuthorID": "57188680350", "AffiliationID": "60025287", "AffiliationName": "Clinical and Experimental Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton"}, "57160388900": {"Name": "Dutey-Magni P.F.", "AuthorID": "57160388900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Health Informatics, University College London"}, "57193086526": {"Name": "Priest C.", "AuthorID": "57193086526", "AffiliationID": "60025287", "AffiliationName": "Clinical and Experimental Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton"}, "7201944497": {"Name": "Sinclair J.M.A.", "AuthorID": "7201944497", "AffiliationID": "60025287", "AffiliationName": "Clinical and Experimental Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton"}, "6507235751": {"Name": "Copson E.R.", "AuthorID": "6507235751", "AffiliationID": "60025287, 60000703", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton and University Hospital Southampton"}, "57182480800": {"Name": "Anderson A.S.", "AuthorID": "57182480800", "AffiliationID": "60171138, 60008877", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Research into Cancer Prevention and Screening, Ninewells Hospital & Medical School, University of Dundee"}}}
