All rights reserved.Precise cleavage furrow positioning is required for faithful chromosome segregation and cell fate determinant distribution. In most metazoan cells, contractile ring placement is regulated by the mitotic spindle through the centralspindlin complex, and potentially also the chromosomal passenger complex (CPC). Drosophila neuroblasts, asymmetrically dividing neural stem cells, but also other cells utilize both spindle-dependent and spindle-independent cleavage furrow positioning pathways. However, the relative contribution of each pathway towards cytokinesis is currently unclear. Here we report that in Drosophila neuroblasts, the mitotic spindle, but not polarity cues, controls the localization of the CPC component Survivin. We also show that Survivin and the mitotic spindle are required to stabilize the position of the cleavage furrow in late anaphase and to complete furrow constriction. These results support the model that two spatially and temporally separate pathways control different key aspects during asymmetric cell division, ensuring correct cell fate determinant segregation and neuroblast self-renewal.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Anaphase", "Animals", "Asymmetric Cell Division", "Cell Polarity", "Chromosome Segregation", "Cytokinesis", "Drosophila", "Drosophila Proteins", "Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins", "Neural Stem Cells", "Spindle Apparatus"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84925250959", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"57202227041": {"Name": "Roth M.", "AuthorID": "57202227041", "AffiliationID": "60029170", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Science, Translational Neurology, Lund University"}, "36467062900": {"Name": "Roubinet C.", "AuthorID": "36467062900", "AffiliationID": "60015184, 60023588", "AffiliationName": "Biozentrum, University of Basel"}, "56563078500": {"Name": "Iffl\u00e4nder N.", "AuthorID": "56563078500", "AffiliationID": "60015184, 60023588", "AffiliationName": "Biozentrum, University of Basel"}, "56562751000": {"Name": "Ferrand A.", "AuthorID": "56562751000", "AffiliationID": "60015184, 60023588", "AffiliationName": "Imaging Core Facility (IMCF), Biozentrum, University of Basel"}, "13907504800": {"Name": "Cabernard C.", "AuthorID": "13907504800", "AffiliationID": "60015184, 60023588", "AffiliationName": "Biozentrum, University of Basel"}}}
