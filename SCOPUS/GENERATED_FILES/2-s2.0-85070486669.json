This corrects a previous statement by H. Lange in [9] that the holonomy group of a hyperelliptic threefold is necessarily abelian.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Complcx projective variety", "Flat manifold", "Holonomy group"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85070486669", "SubjectAreas": [["Mathematics (all)", "MATH", "2600"]], "AuthorData": {"7401522198": {"Name": "Johnson F.", "AuthorID": "7401522198", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University College London"}}}
