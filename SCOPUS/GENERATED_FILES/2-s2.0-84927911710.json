The review focuses on four model organisms: the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum, the roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans, the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster and the zebrafish Danio rerio. We consider recent discoveries made with each model organism and discuss the importance of these advances for the understanding and treatment of epilepsy in humans. The relative ease with which mutations in genes of interest can be produced and studied quickly and cheaply in these organisms, together with their anatomical and physiological simplicity in comparison to mammalian species, are major advantages when researchers are trying to unravel complex disease mechanisms. The short generation times of most of these model organisms also mean that they lend themselves particularly conveniently to the investigation of drug effects or epileptogenic processes across the lifecourse.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Animal research", "Anti epileptic drugs", "Epilepsy", "Epileptogenesis", "Ictogenesis", "Non-mammalian"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Biomedical Research", "Disease Models, Animal", "Epilepsy", "Humans"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84927911710", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"6603397477": {"Name": "Cunliffe V.T.", "AuthorID": "6603397477", "AffiliationID": "60001881", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomedical Science, Firth Court, University of Sheffield"}, "7004597786": {"Name": "Baines R.A.", "AuthorID": "7004597786", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Life Sciences, University of Manchester"}, "57192710236": {"Name": "Giachello C.N.G.", "AuthorID": "57192710236", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Life Sciences, University of Manchester"}, "55841246200": {"Name": "Lin W.H.", "AuthorID": "55841246200", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Life Sciences, University of Manchester"}, "35606776400": {"Name": "Morgan A.", "AuthorID": "35606776400", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular and Cellular Physiology, Institute of Translational Medicine, University of Liverpool"}, "7102183040": {"Name": "Reuber M.", "AuthorID": "7102183040", "AffiliationID": "60001881, 60006444", "AffiliationName": "Academic Neurology Unit, Royal Hallamshire Hospital, University of Sheffield"}, "7401530821": {"Name": "Russell C.", "AuthorID": "7401530821", "AffiliationID": "60026530", "AffiliationName": "Department of Comparative Biomedical Sciences, Royal Veterinary College"}, "35243898700": {"Name": "Walker M.C.", "AuthorID": "35243898700", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Experimental Epilepsy, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "57203074071": {"Name": "Williams R.S.B.", "AuthorID": "57203074071", "AffiliationID": "60020595", "AffiliationName": "Royal Holloway College, University of London"}}}
