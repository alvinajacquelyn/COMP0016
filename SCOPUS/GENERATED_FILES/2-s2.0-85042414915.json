Direct, noninvasive monitoring of inflammation in the human brain after ICH will facilitate early-phase development of anti-inflammatory treatments. We sought to investigate the feasibility of multimodality brain imaging in subacute ICH. METHODS: Acute ICH patients were recruited to undergo multiparametric MRI (including dynamic contrast-enhanced measurement of blood-brain barrier transfer constant (Ktrans) and PET with [11C]-(R)-PK11195). [11C]-(R)-PK11195 binds to the translocator protein 18 kDa (TSPO), which is rapidly upregulated in activated microglia. Circulating inflammatory markers were measured at the time of PET. RESULTS: Five patients were recruited to this feasibility study with imaging between 5 and 16 days after onset. Etiologies included hypertension-related small vessel disease, cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), cavernoma, and arteriovenous malformation (AVM). [11C]-(R)-PK11195 binding was low in all hematomas and 2 (patient 2 [probable CAA] and 4 [AVM]) cases showed widespread increase in binding in the perihematomal region versus contralateral. All had increased Ktrans in the perihematomal region (mean difference = 2.2 \u00d7 10\u22123 minute\u22121; SD = 1.6 \u00d7 10\u22123 minute\u22121) versus contralateral. Two cases (patients 1 [cavernoma] and 4 [AVM]) had delayed surgery (3 and 12 months post-onset, respectively) with biopsies showing intense microglial activation in perilesional tissue. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates for the first time the feasibility of performing complex multimodality brain imaging for noninvasive monitoring of neuroinflammation for this severe stroke subtype.", "AuthorKeywords": ["blood-brain barrier", "inflammation", "Intracerebral hemorrhage", "magnetic resonance imaging", "positron emission tomography"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged, 80 and over", "Brain", "Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy", "Cerebral Hemorrhage", "Female", "Humans", "Hypertension", "Inflammation", "Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations", "Isoquinolines", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Multimodal Imaging"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85042414915", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"12780524400": {"Name": "Abid K.A.", "AuthorID": "12780524400", "AffiliationID": "60008873", "AffiliationName": "Greater Manchester Neurosciences Centre, Salford Royal NHS Foundation Trust"}, "6603088302": {"Name": "Sobowale O.A.", "AuthorID": "6603088302", "AffiliationID": "60008873", "AffiliationName": "Greater Manchester Neurosciences Centre, Salford Royal NHS Foundation Trust"}, "6603675937": {"Name": "Parkes L.M.", "AuthorID": "6603675937", "AffiliationID": "60172345", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, The University of Manchester"}, "8408782400": {"Name": "Naish J.", "AuthorID": "8408782400", "AffiliationID": "60172345", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, The University of Manchester"}, "24766914700": {"Name": "Parker G.J.M.", "AuthorID": "24766914700", "AffiliationID": "60111966", "AffiliationName": "Bioxydyn Limited"}, "7006799289": {"Name": "Brough D.", "AuthorID": "7006799289", "AffiliationID": "60172345", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, The University of Manchester"}, "57193339420": {"Name": "Barrington J.", "AuthorID": "57193339420", "AffiliationID": "60172345", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, The University of Manchester"}, "7006687687": {"Name": "Allan S.M.", "AuthorID": "7006687687", "AffiliationID": "60172345", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, The University of Manchester"}, "16020732300": {"Name": "Hinz R.", "AuthorID": "16020732300", "AffiliationID": "60172345", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, The University of Manchester"}, "23989586200": {"Name": "Parry-Jones A.R.", "AuthorID": "23989586200", "AffiliationID": "60008873", "AffiliationName": "Greater Manchester Neurosciences Centre, Salford Royal NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7006472174": {"Name": "du Plessis D.", "AuthorID": "7006472174", "AffiliationID": "60008873", "AffiliationName": "Greater Manchester Neurosciences Centre, Salford Royal NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
