Informed by the fields of dance, symbolic interactionism and multimodal social semiotics, it introduces a conceptualisation of visitors\u2019 movement as choreography unfolding either in compliance with the museum \u2018script\u2019 (scripted choreographies), or in response to prompts from other visitors sharing the same space (improvised choreographies). Attending to visitors\u2019 positioning and alignment as key resources of movement, the analysis of video data from two London galleries illustrates how visitors oscillate between performing \u2018scripted choreographies\u2019 and \u2018improvised choreographies\u2019 through shifts in positioning and alignment, while being spectators of other visitors\u2019 choreographies. Both kinds of choreographies are continuously shaped in interaction with the \u2018scripted\u2019 museum stage and other visitors\u2019 \u2018scripted\u2019 and \u2018improvised choreographies\u2019.", "AuthorKeywords": ["choreography", "embodiment", "movement", "multimodality", "Museum", "space", "visitors"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85062511705", "SubjectAreas": [["Business and International Management", "BUSI", "1403"], ["Visual Arts and Performing Arts", "ARTS", "1213"], ["Tourism, Leisure and Hospitality Management", "BUSI", "1409"]], "AuthorData": {"57207451032": {"Name": "Diamantopoulou S.", "AuthorID": "57207451032", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Education"}, "56160227300": {"Name": "Christidou D.", "AuthorID": "56160227300", "AffiliationID": "60013141", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, NTNU\u2013Norwegian University of Science and Technology"}}}
