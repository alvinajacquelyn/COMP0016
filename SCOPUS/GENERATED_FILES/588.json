In particular, results of a sensitivity analysis allow, on one hand, to optimize the plan of investigations and tests, limiting it to what is really useful, and, on the other hand, to be aware of the propagation of uncertainties in the final outcome of the assessment. The paper proposes how to implement the sensitivity analysis in a systemic way, in order to define proper confidence factors, which are used within the semi-probabilistic approach of the performance-based assessment procedure. In relation to the procedures adopted by current standards, this method is aimed to overcome the following drawbacks: (1) the a priori definition of values for the confidence factor; (2) the a priori selection of parameters to which confidence factor has to be applied; (3) the weak connection between investigation and assessment. Despite the generality of most aspects of the proposed procedure, main attention is given in the paper to its application in the case of masonry existing buildings and, in particular, of those with a significant cultural value, where the minimization of invasiveness of investigations on the construction together with that of costs plays a crucial role for the aim of conservation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Confidence factors", "Investigation protocol", "Masonry buildings", "Sensitivity analysis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Confidence factors", "Epistemic uncertainties", "Existing structure", "Masonry building", "Performance-based assessment", "Probabilistic approaches", "Propagation of uncertainties", "Seismic assessment"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84940295178", "SubjectAreas": [["Civil and Structural Engineering", "ENGI", "2205"], ["Building and Construction", "ENGI", "2215"], ["Geotechnical Engineering and Engineering Geology", "EART", "1909"], ["Geophysics", "EART", "1908"]], "AuthorData": {"26634778700": {"Name": "Cattari S.", "AuthorID": "26634778700", "AffiliationID": "60025153", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil, Chemical and Environmental Engineering, University of Genoa"}, "7004350459": {"Name": "Lagomarsino S.", "AuthorID": "7004350459", "AffiliationID": "60025153", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil, Chemical and Environmental Engineering, University of Genoa"}, "14023951800": {"Name": "Bosiljkov V.", "AuthorID": "14023951800", "AffiliationID": "60031106", "AffiliationName": "University of Ljubljana"}, "57211644046": {"Name": "D\u2019Ayala D.", "AuthorID": "57211644046", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil Environmental and Geomatic Engineering, University College London"}}}
