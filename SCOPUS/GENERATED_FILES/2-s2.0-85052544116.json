Recent evidences suggest that these DNA structures exist in living cells and could be involved in several cancer-related processes, thus representing an attractive target for anticancer drug discovery. Efforts toward the development of G4 targeting compounds have led to a number of effective bioactive ligands. Herein, employing several biophysical methodologies, we studied the ability of some well-known G4 ligands to interact with iM-forming DNA. The data showed that the investigated compounds are actually able to interact with both DNA in vitro, thus acting de facto as multi-target-directed agents. Interestingly, while all the compounds stabilize the G4, some of them significantly reduce the stability of the iM. The present study highlights the importance, when studying G4-targeting compounds, of evaluating also their behavior toward the i-motif counterpart.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Berberine", "BRACO-19", "G-quadruplex", "I-motif", "Mitoxantrone", "Phen-DC3", "Pyridostatin", "RHPS4"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85052544116", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"]], "AuthorData": {"57189060233": {"Name": "Pagano A.", "AuthorID": "57189060233", "AffiliationID": "60017293", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacy, University of Naples Federico II"}, "56347359000": {"Name": "Iaccarino N.", "AuthorID": "56347359000", "AffiliationID": "60017293", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacy, University of Naples Federico II"}, "56879247400": {"Name": "Brancaccio D.", "AuthorID": "56879247400", "AffiliationID": "60017293", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacy, University of Naples Federico II"}, "57203642900": {"Name": "Garzarella E.U.", "AuthorID": "57203642900", "AffiliationID": "60017293", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacy, University of Naples Federico II"}, "57203642897": {"Name": "Di Porzio A.", "AuthorID": "57203642897", "AffiliationID": "60017293", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacy, University of Naples Federico II"}, "7005912361": {"Name": "Novellino E.", "AuthorID": "7005912361", "AffiliationID": "60017293", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacy, University of Naples Federico II"}, "9434649100": {"Name": "Pagano B.", "AuthorID": "9434649100", "AffiliationID": "60017293", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacy, University of Naples Federico II"}, "8918952000": {"Name": "Amato J.", "AuthorID": "8918952000", "AffiliationID": "60017293", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacy, University of Naples Federico II"}, "23036454300": {"Name": "Randazzo A.", "AuthorID": "23036454300", "AffiliationID": "60017293", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacy, University of Naples Federico II"}, "57203191820": {"Name": "Abdelhamid M.A.S.", "AuthorID": "57203191820", "AffiliationID": "60000112, 60176145", "AffiliationName": "School of Pharmacy, University of East Anglia, Norwich Research Park"}, "23974080500": {"Name": "Waller Z.A.E.", "AuthorID": "23974080500", "AffiliationID": "60000112, 60176145", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Molecular and Structural Biochemistry, University of East Anglia, Norwich Research Park"}}}
