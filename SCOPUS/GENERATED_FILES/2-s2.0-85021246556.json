Confirmation of monoclonal immunoglobulin light chain amyloidosis (AL), requiring cytotoxic chemotherapy, and avoidance of such treatment in non-AL amyloidosis, are particularly important. Proteomic analysis characterises amyloid proteins directly. It complements immunohistochemical staining of amyloid to identify fibril proteins and gene sequencing to identify mutations in the fibril precursors. However, proteomics sometimes detects more than one potentially amyloidogenic protein, especially immunoglobulins and transthyretin which are abundant plasma proteins. Ambiguous results are most challenging in the elderly as both AL and transthyretin (ATTR) amyloidosis are usually present in this group. We have lately described a procedure for tissue decellularisation which retains the structure, integrity and composition of amyloid but removes proteins that are not integrated within the deposits. Here we show that use of this procedure before proteomic analysis eliminates ambiguity and improves diagnostic accuracy. Significance Unequivocal identification of the protein causing amyloidosis disease is crucial for correct diagnosis and treatment. As a proof of principle, we selected a number of cardiac and fat tissue biopsies from patients with various types of amyloidosis and show that a classical procedure of decellularisation enhances the specificity of the identification of the culprit protein reducing ambiguity and the risk of misdiagnosis.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Amyloid typing", "Amyloidosis", "Decellularisation", "Proteomics"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adipose Tissue", "Amyloid", "Amyloidosis", "Biopsy", "Cell-Free System", "Humans", "Immunoglobulin Light Chains", "Myocardium", "Prealbumin", "Proteomics", "Sensitivity and Specificity"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85021246556", "SubjectAreas": [["Biophysics", "BIOC", "1304"], ["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"]], "AuthorData": {"7003800223": {"Name": "Mangione P.P.", "AuthorID": "7003800223", "AffiliationID": "60015197", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Medicine, Institute of Biochemistry, University of Pavia"}, "57218199523": {"Name": "Rendell N.B.", "AuthorID": "57218199523", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Wolfson Drug Discovery Unit, Centre for Amyloidosis and Acute Phase Proteins, University College London"}, "57202845706": {"Name": "Canetti D.", "AuthorID": "57202845706", "AffiliationID": "60017293, 60159407", "AffiliationName": "CEINGE and Department of Chemical Sciences, University of Naples"}, "56848974700": {"Name": "Pepys M.B.", "AuthorID": "56848974700", "AffiliationID": "60032819, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "National Amyloidosis Centre, University College London and Royal Free Hospital"}, "35493762000": {"Name": "Taylor G.W.", "AuthorID": "35493762000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Wolfson Drug Discovery Unit, Centre for Amyloidosis and Acute Phase Proteins, University College London"}, "7006438238": {"Name": "Bellotti V.", "AuthorID": "7006438238", "AffiliationID": "60015197", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Medicine, Institute of Biochemistry, University of Pavia"}, "6701844245": {"Name": "Giorgetti S.", "AuthorID": "6701844245", "AffiliationID": "60015197", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Medicine, Institute of Biochemistry, University of Pavia"}, "55335681200": {"Name": "Raimondi S.", "AuthorID": "55335681200", "AffiliationID": "60015197", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Medicine, Institute of Biochemistry, University of Pavia"}, "56672501300": {"Name": "Mazza G.", "AuthorID": "56672501300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Liver and Digestive Health, University College London"}, "57194616309": {"Name": "Frenguelli L.", "AuthorID": "57194616309", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Liver and Digestive Health, University College London"}, "57202133762": {"Name": "Curti M.", "AuthorID": "57202133762", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Liver and Digestive Health, University College London"}, "7005412715": {"Name": "Pinzani M.", "AuthorID": "7005412715", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Liver and Digestive Health, University College London"}, "7005657127": {"Name": "Gilbertson J.A.", "AuthorID": "7005657127", "AffiliationID": "60032819, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "National Amyloidosis Centre, University College London and Royal Free Hospital"}, "55985701600": {"Name": "Rezk T.", "AuthorID": "55985701600", "AffiliationID": "60032819, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "National Amyloidosis Centre, University College London and Royal Free Hospital"}, "35464959200": {"Name": "Hawkins P.N.", "AuthorID": "35464959200", "AffiliationID": "60032819, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "National Amyloidosis Centre, University College London and Royal Free Hospital"}, "7003539031": {"Name": "Gillmore J.D.", "AuthorID": "7003539031", "AffiliationID": "60032819, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "National Amyloidosis Centre, University College London and Royal Free Hospital"}}}
