It is less clear whether there is also an association with geriatric depression. We examined the relationship between APOE\u2217E4 and 5-year incidence of depression in a Swedish population-based sample of older adults without dementia and excluding older adults who developed dementia within 4 years after the diagnosis of depression. Methods In 2000-2001, 839 women and men (age range, 70-92 years; mean age, 73.8 years) free from dementia and depression underwent neuropsychiatric and neuropsychological examinations and genotyping of the APOE\u2217E4 allele. Follow-up evaluations were conducted in 2005 and 2009.The association between APOE\u2217E4 allele and 5-year incidence of depression was examined, while avoiding possible confounding effects of clinical or preclinical dementia by excluding participants who had dementia at study entry, subsequently developed dementia during the 9-year follow-up period, or had a decline in Mini-Mental State Examination score of \u22655 points. Results Among subjects without depression at study entry and without dementia or significant cognitive decline during the subsequent 9 years, APOE\u2217E4 was prospectively associated with more severe depressive symptoms (b = 1.56, p =.007), incident minor depression (odds ratio = 1.99 [confidence interval = 1.11-3.55], p =.020), and any depression (odds ratio = 1.75 [confidence interval = 1.01-3.03], p =.048). Conclusions The presence of the APOE\u2217E4 allele predicted future depression in this Swedish population study, even after excluding depressed individuals who later developed dementia, suggesting that the APOE\u2217E4 allele could potentially identify people at high risk for clinically significant depression.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Apolipoprotein E \u03b54 (APOE", "Dementia", "Depression", "E4) allele", "Older adults", "Population-based study", "Prospective"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Apolipoprotein E4", "Depressive Disorder", "Depressive Disorder, Major", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Humans", "Late Onset Disorders", "Male", "Prospective Studies", "Sweden"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84945128004", "SubjectAreas": [["Biological Psychiatry", "NEUR", "2803"]], "AuthorData": {"7005834411": {"Name": "Skoog I.", "AuthorID": "7005834411", "AffiliationID": "107130241", "AffiliationName": "Neuropsychiatric Epidemiology Unit"}, "6701797460": {"Name": "Waern M.", "AuthorID": "6701797460", "AffiliationID": "107130241", "AffiliationName": "Neuropsychiatric Epidemiology Unit"}, "16551657800": {"Name": "B\u00f6rjesson-Hanson A.", "AuthorID": "16551657800", "AffiliationID": "107130241", "AffiliationName": "Neuropsychiatric Epidemiology Unit"}, "6602243803": {"Name": "\u00d6stling S.", "AuthorID": "6602243803", "AffiliationID": "107130241", "AffiliationName": "Neuropsychiatric Epidemiology Unit"}, "7404331205": {"Name": "Guo X.", "AuthorID": "7404331205", "AffiliationID": "107130241", "AffiliationName": "Neuropsychiatric Epidemiology Unit"}, "55496658300": {"Name": "Kern J.", "AuthorID": "55496658300", "AffiliationID": "107130241", "AffiliationName": "Neuropsychiatric Epidemiology Unit"}, "7101609402": {"Name": "Gustafson D.", "AuthorID": "7101609402", "AffiliationID": "107130241", "AffiliationName": "Neuropsychiatric Epidemiology Unit"}, "23473089600": {"Name": "Gudmundsson P.", "AuthorID": "23473089600", "AffiliationID": "107130241", "AffiliationName": "Neuropsychiatric Epidemiology Unit"}, "37034544200": {"Name": "Marlow T.", "AuthorID": "37034544200", "AffiliationID": "107130241", "AffiliationName": "Neuropsychiatric Epidemiology Unit"}, "55496142200": {"Name": "Kern S.", "AuthorID": "55496142200", "AffiliationID": "60027675, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Neurochemistry Laboratory, Department of Psychiatry and Neurochemistry, Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg"}, "56415176000": {"Name": "Blennow K.", "AuthorID": "56415176000", "AffiliationID": "60027675, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Neurochemistry Laboratory, Department of Psychiatry and Neurochemistry, Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg"}, "6701454676": {"Name": "Zetterberg H.", "AuthorID": "6701454676", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "7003420853": {"Name": "Duberstein P.", "AuthorID": "7003420853", "AffiliationID": "60024746", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Psychiatry and Family Medicine, University of Rochester Medical Center"}}}
