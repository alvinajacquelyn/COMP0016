In urban simulations, the practical buildings are always approximated as perfect electric conductors (PECs). For this reason, the cell matrix of classic finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method is mostly filled with PEC full-fill cells. As electromagnetic fields are valueless in PEC full-fill cells, FDTD has been regarded as an extremely inefficient way in wireless predictions. To improve the efficiency and reduce the number of unknowns, these valueless elements are accurately recognized and eliminated by our new scheme. Meanwhile, a hybrid data container is presented to efficiently store the discontinuous valuable elements after eliminating. Moreover, a parallel technique is applied to further improve the simulation capability. Based on self-developed urban simulation tool, some important subjects in wireless communications have been discussed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Parallel technique", "time-domain finite-integral theory (TDFIT)", "urban simulation tool", "urban simulations", "Wireless propagation and fading"], "IndexKeywords": ["Integral theory", "Parallel techniques", "Perfect electric conductor", "Time-domain approach", "Urban simulations", "Wireless communications", "Wireless prediction", "Wireless propagation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84999673348", "SubjectAreas": [["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"55487309400": {"Name": "You J.", "AuthorID": "55487309400", "AffiliationID": "60005244", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Millimeter Waves, Southeast University"}, "55342807700": {"Name": "Cui T.", "AuthorID": "55342807700", "AffiliationID": "60005244", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Millimeter Waves, Southeast University"}}}
