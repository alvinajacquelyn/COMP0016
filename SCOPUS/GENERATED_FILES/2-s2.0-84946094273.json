Our EPR measurements indicate a successful incorporation of local Mn2+ probes into the structure allowing us to detect and investigate an order-disorder structural phase transition in the studied MOF. The temperature-dependent continuous wave (CW) X- and Q-band EPR measurements reveal a sudden change in the spectra at a phase transition temperature T0 = 163 K. Simulations were performed to determine the spin Hamiltonian parameters of the spectra which reflect the local symmetry of the Mn2+ probes in the disordered and ordered phases. The temperature dependence of the axial zero-field splitting parameter D demonstrates that the observed phase transition at T0 is discontinuous. Additionally, this dependence follows the prediction of the Landau theory. We also performed preliminary pulse EPR measurements which reveal a rather long phase memory time sufficient to detect a spin echo even in the high-temperature disordered phase. The modulation with the proton and nitrogen Larmor frequencies of the electron spin echo was observed as well.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Axial zero-field splitting parameter", "Electron paramagnetic resonances (EPR)", "Larmor frequencies", "Metal organic framework", "Spin Hamiltonian parameters", "Structural phase transition", "Temperature dependence", "Temperature dependent"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84946094273", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Energy (all)", "ENER", "2100"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"], ["Surfaces, Coatings and Films", "MATE", "2508"]], "AuthorData": {"55865561500": {"Name": "\u0160imenas M.", "AuthorID": "55865561500", "AffiliationID": "60059987", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Physics, Vilnius University"}, "7003687871": {"Name": "Banys J.", "AuthorID": "7003687871", "AffiliationID": "60059987", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Physics, Vilnius University"}, "56167731300": {"Name": "Ciupa A.", "AuthorID": "56167731300", "AffiliationID": "60089023, 60014383", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Low Temperature and Structure Research, Polish Academy of Sciences"}, "15725818100": {"Name": "Maczka M.", "AuthorID": "15725818100", "AffiliationID": "60089023, 60014383", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Low Temperature and Structure Research, Polish Academy of Sciences"}, "36875147700": {"Name": "P\u00f6ppl A.", "AuthorID": "36875147700", "AffiliationID": "60008042", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Physics and Earth Sciences, Universit\u00e4t Leipzig"}}}
