We report here on the method of synchrotron-based X-ray tomographic microscopy (SRXTM) to image 3D-CMs in native tissue probes. Material and methods: SRXTM of 3D-CMs (mucoderm\u00ae, mucograft\u00ae) was performed at the TOMCAT beamline of the Swiss Light Source (SLS) at the Paul Scherrer Institute (Villigen, Switzerland). Results: SRXTM combines the advantages of high-resolution scanning electron microscopy (SEM) imaging with the low-resolution reconstructions of micro-CT (\u03bcCT) imaging. It may be used to non-destructively visualize and analyze structures within the 3D-CMs without the need of serial sectioning and reconstruction. Conclusion: High-resolution SRXTM is a useful tool in analyzing the topology and morphometry of structures in 3D-CMs. The outcome justifies the efforts in sophisticated data processing. Clinical relevance: SRXTM may help to understand the clinical characteristics of 3D-CMs in more detail.", "AuthorKeywords": ["3D visualization", "Collagen matrix", "Morphometry", "Synchrotron radiation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Collagen", "Synchrotrons", "Tomography, X-Ray"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84923784332", "SubjectAreas": [["Dentistry (all)", "DENT", "3500"]], "AuthorData": {"26428344800": {"Name": "Pabst A.M.", "AuthorID": "26428344800", "AffiliationID": "60022135", "AffiliationName": "Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, University Medical Center Mainz"}, "56531407600": {"Name": "Wagner W.", "AuthorID": "56531407600", "AffiliationID": "60022135", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Functional and Clinical Anatomy, University Medical Center Mainz"}, "36909416000": {"Name": "Ackermann M.", "AuthorID": "36909416000", "AffiliationID": "60022135", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Functional and Clinical Anatomy, University Medical Center Mainz"}, "7003972743": {"Name": "Konerding M.A.", "AuthorID": "7003972743", "AffiliationID": "60022135", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Functional and Clinical Anatomy, University Medical Center Mainz"}, "55985279700": {"Name": "Astolfo A.", "AuthorID": "55985279700", "AffiliationID": "60020195", "AffiliationName": "Swiss Light Source, Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI)"}, "34570933400": {"Name": "Marone F.", "AuthorID": "34570933400", "AffiliationID": "60020195", "AffiliationName": "Swiss Light Source, Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI)"}, "25121174800": {"Name": "Haberth\u00fcr D.", "AuthorID": "25121174800", "AffiliationID": "60020195", "AffiliationName": "Swiss Light Source, Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI)"}, "35733632800": {"Name": "Enzmann F.", "AuthorID": "35733632800", "AffiliationID": "60031216", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Geosciences, Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz"}, "15762686700": {"Name": "Kasaj A.", "AuthorID": "15762686700", "AffiliationID": "60022135", "AffiliationName": "Department of Operative Dentistry, University Medical Center Mainz"}, "56531634100": {"Name": "Gebhardt S.", "AuthorID": "56531634100", "AffiliationID": "60031216", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Sport Sciences, Division for Rehabilitation and Sports Medicine, Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz"}}}
