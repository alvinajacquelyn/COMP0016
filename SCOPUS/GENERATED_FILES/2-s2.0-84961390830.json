The present study assessed whether blood pressure and patient characteristics from a single clinic visit can accurately predict the difference between ambulatory/home and clinic blood pressure readings (the home-clinic difference). A linear regression model predicting the home-clinic blood pressure difference was derived in 2 data sets measuring automated clinic and ambulatory/home blood pressure (n=991) using candidate predictors identified from a literature review. The model was validated in 4 further data sets (n=1172) using area under the receiver operator characteristic curve analysis. A masked effect was associated with male sex, a positive clinic blood pressure change (difference between consecutive measurements during a single visit), and a diagnosis of hypertension. Increasing age, clinic blood pressure level, and pulse pressure were associated with a white coat effect. The model showed good calibration across data sets (Pearson correlation, 0.48-0.80) and performed well-predicting ambulatory hypertension (area under the receiver operator characteristic curve, 0.75; 95% confidence interval, 0.72-0.79 [systolic]; 0.87; 0.85-0.89 [diastolic]). Used as a triaging tool for ambulatory monitoring, the model improved classification of a patient's blood pressure status compared with other guideline recommended approaches (93% [92% to 95%] classified correctly; United States, 73% [70% to 75%]; Canada, 74% [71% to 77%]; United Kingdom, 78% [76% to 81%]). This study demonstrates that patient characteristics from a single clinic visit can accurately predict a patient's ambulatory blood pressure. Usage of this prediction tool for triaging of ambulatory monitoring could result in more accurate diagnosis of hypertension and hence more appropriate treatment.", "AuthorKeywords": ["ambulatory blood pressure monitoring", "hypertension", "masked hypertension", "white coat hypertension"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Algorithms", "Blood Pressure Determination", "Blood Pressure Monitoring, Ambulatory", "Canada", "Circadian Rhythm", "Cohort Studies", "Databases, Factual", "Female", "Humans", "Linear Models", "Male", "Masked Hypertension", "Middle Aged", "Office Visits", "Predictive Value of Tests", "Risk Assessment", "ROC Curve", "Sensitivity and Specificity", "United Kingdom", "United States", "White Coat Hypertension"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84961390830", "SubjectAreas": [["Internal Medicine", "MEDI", "2724"]], "AuthorData": {"55308951100": {"Name": "Sheppard J.P.", "AuthorID": "55308951100", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Nuffield Department of Primary Care Health Sciences, University of Oxford"}, "35499658200": {"Name": "Stevens R.", "AuthorID": "35499658200", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Nuffield Department of Primary Care Health Sciences, University of Oxford"}, "15020768600": {"Name": "Heneghan C.", "AuthorID": "15020768600", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Nuffield Department of Primary Care Health Sciences, University of Oxford"}, "57193756967": {"Name": "Hobbs F.D.R.", "AuthorID": "57193756967", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Nuffield Department of Primary Care Health Sciences, University of Oxford"}, "23976859100": {"Name": "Nunan D.", "AuthorID": "23976859100", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Nuffield Department of Primary Care Health Sciences, University of Oxford"}, "7402090846": {"Name": "Ward A.", "AuthorID": "7402090846", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Nuffield Department of Primary Care Health Sciences, University of Oxford"}, "55815978400": {"Name": "McManus R.J.", "AuthorID": "55815978400", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Nuffield Department of Primary Care Health Sciences, University of Oxford"}, "7202766660": {"Name": "Gill P.", "AuthorID": "7202766660", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Applied Health Research, Institute of Clinical Sciences, University of Birmingham"}, "7102009205": {"Name": "Martin U.", "AuthorID": "7102009205", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Applied Health Research, Institute of Clinical Sciences, University of Birmingham"}, "35563672800": {"Name": "Godwin M.", "AuthorID": "35563672800", "AffiliationID": "60019000", "AffiliationName": "Family Practice Unit, Memorial University of Newfoundland"}, "7102697583": {"Name": "Hanley J.", "AuthorID": "7102697583", "AffiliationID": "60018186", "AffiliationName": "Health Services Research Unit, Edinburgh Napier University"}, "26643244100": {"Name": "Mant J.", "AuthorID": "26643244100", "AffiliationID": "60009587, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Cambridge Institute of Public Health, University of Cambridge"}, "7004456140": {"Name": "Mckinstry B.", "AuthorID": "7004456140", "AffiliationID": "60009587, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Cambridge Institute of Public Health, University of Cambridge"}, "17835462900": {"Name": "Myers M.", "AuthorID": "17835462900", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Population Health Sciences, University of Edinburgh"}, "7404503273": {"Name": "Williams B.", "AuthorID": "7404503273", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}}}
