Method: We used mother-reported data from sweep six (2010-2011) of the Growing Up in Scotland study (n= 3586 children aged 5.9. yrs) to examine associations between walking distance from home to green/open space and screen time (TV viewing time/computer use). Analyses were adjusted for age, sex and other pre-specified covariates, including sport/exercise participation, mental and general health, birth weight, parental socio-economic group (SEG) and smoking status. Results: Children living the furthest distance from green/open spaces (>. 20. minutes' walking distance) displayed over 2. h (95% CI, 0.65 to 3.51) more weekly TV time than the reference category (<. 5. minutes' walking distance). Compared to children in the reference category, those in the >. 20. minute category had worse mental health (mean SDQ [Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire] score \u00b1 SD, 7.0 \u00b1 4.6 vs. 8.7 \u00b1 6.2) and general health (% fair-poor, 4.6 vs. 8.6), and were more likely to come from lower SEG households. Conclusion: Mothers' perceived distance from home to green/open spaces was associated with child's TV time at age 5.9. years.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Environment", "Green exercise", "Physical activity", "Sedentary behaviour"], "IndexKeywords": ["Child Behavior", "Child Welfare", "Child, Preschool", "Computers", "Distance Perception", "Environment", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Mothers", "Plants", "Public Facilities", "Residence Characteristics", "Scotland", "Sedentary Lifestyle", "Television", "Time Factors", "Walking"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84949116478", "SubjectAreas": [["Epidemiology", "MEDI", "2713"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"55219956400": {"Name": "Aggio D.", "AuthorID": "55219956400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Physical Activity Research Group, Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "37117793800": {"Name": "Smith L.", "AuthorID": "37117793800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Physical Activity Research Group, Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "57198517077": {"Name": "Fisher A.", "AuthorID": "57198517077", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Physical Activity Research Group, Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "8502496600": {"Name": "Hamer M.", "AuthorID": "8502496600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Physical Activity Research Group, Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}}}
