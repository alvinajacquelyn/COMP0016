After modification, all surfaces were heated to 600 \u00b0C to extinguish traces of organic contamination. All surfaces supported cell attachment, proliferation and differentiation but the surfaces with grain boundary grooves or abraded grooves provided conditions for enhanced initial cell attachment. Nevertheless, overall cell proliferation and total DNA were highest on the polished surface. Zirconia sintered at a lower temperature (1300 \u00b0C vs. 1450 \u00b0C) had open porosity and presented reduced proliferation as assessed by alamarBlue\u2122 assay, possibly because the openness of the pores prevented cells developing a local microenvironment. All cells retained the typical polygonal morphology of osteoblast-like cells with variations attributable to the underlying surface notably alignment along the grooves of the abraded surface.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Biocompatibility", "Cell culture", "Osteoblast", "Topography", "Zirconia"], "IndexKeywords": ["Grain boundary grooves", "Lower temperatures", "Microenvironments", "Organic contamination", "Osteoblast response", "Osteoblast-like cells", "Polished surfaces", "Underlying surface", "Bone Substitutes", "Cell Adhesion", "Cell Differentiation", "Cell Line", "Cell Proliferation", "Coated Materials, Biocompatible", "Humans", "Materials Testing", "Osteoblasts", "Surface Properties", "Zirconium"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84940543014", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Mechanics of Materials", "ENGI", "2211"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"]], "AuthorData": {"10738921200": {"Name": "Herath H.M.T.U.", "AuthorID": "10738921200", "AffiliationID": "60071082", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Laboratory Science, Faculty of Allied Health Sciences, University of Peradeniya"}, "7003813975": {"Name": "Di Silvio L.", "AuthorID": "7003813975", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Guy's, King's and St Thomas' Medical and Dental Institute, King's College London"}, "7407665158": {"Name": "Evans J.R.G.", "AuthorID": "7407665158", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}}}
