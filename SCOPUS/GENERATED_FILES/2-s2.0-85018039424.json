In particular, a technology termed Spectrally Efficient Frequency Division Multiplexing (SEFDM) is described in detail outlining its benefits, challenges and trade-offs when compared to the current state-of-the-art. A decade of research has been devoted to examining SEFDM from different angles; mathematical modelling, algorithm optimisation, hardware implementation and system experimentation. The aim of this chapter is to therefore give a taste of this technology and in doing so, the chapter is organised as follows; first, it is explained how SEFDM fits within the remit of future 5th Generation (5G) communication systems; second, the design principles and implementation trade-offs associated with SEFDM systems are described; third, a number of linear and more sophisticated polynomial detection schemes are compared in terms of performance and complexity; finally, the chapter concludes by outlining a number of experimental testbeds which have been developed for the purpose of evaluating the performance of SEFDM in practical scenarios.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Communication techniques", "Design Principles", "Detection scheme", "Experimental testbed", "Hardware implementations", "Multi carrier", "Spectrum efficiency", "State of the art"], "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85018039424", "SubjectAreas": [["Engineering (all)", "ENGI", "2200"], ["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"]], "AuthorData": {"7003497031": {"Name": "Darwazeh I.", "AuthorID": "7003497031", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "36026724200": {"Name": "Grammenos R.C.", "AuthorID": "36026724200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "55846144300": {"Name": "Xu T.", "AuthorID": "55846144300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
