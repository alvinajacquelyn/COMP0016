Methods: Two hundred and thirty-one patients (70 TZ training-cohort; 76 PZ training-cohort; 85 TZ temporal validation-cohort) underwent mp-MRI and transperineal-template-prostate-mapping biopsy. PZ and TZ uni/multi-variate mp-MRI LR-models for classification of significant cancer (any cancer-core-length (CCL) with Gleason > 3 + 3 or any grade with CCL \u2265 4 mm) were derived from the respective cohorts and validated within the same zone by leave-one-out analysis. Inter-zonal performance was tested by applying TZ models to the PZ training-cohort and vice-versa. Classification performance of TZ models for TZ cancer was further assessed in the TZ validation-cohort. ROC area-under-curve (ROC-AUC) analysis was used to compare models. Results: The univariate parameters with the best classification performance were the normalised T2 signal (T2nSI) within the TZ (ROC-AUC = 0.77) and normalized early contrast-enhanced T1 signal (DCE-nSI) within the PZ (ROC-AUC = 0.79). Performance was not significantly improved by bi-variate/tri-variate modelling. PZ models that contained DCE-nSI performed poorly in classification of TZ cancer. The TZ model based solely on maximum-enhancement poorly classified PZ cancer. Conclusion: LR-models dependent on DCE-MRI parameters alone are not interchangable between prostatic zones; however, models based exclusively on T2 and/or ADC are more robust for inter-zonal application. Key points: \u2022 The ADC and T2-nSI of benign/cancer PZ are higher than benign/cancer TZ. \u2022 DCE parameters are significantly different between benign PZ and TZ, but not between cancerous PZ and TZ. \u2022 Diagnostic models containing contrast enhancement parameters have reduced performance when applied across zones.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Diagnosis, Computer Assisted", "Logistic Models", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Prostatic Neoplasms"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Area Under Curve", "Biopsy", "Humans", "Image Processing, Computer-Assisted", "Logistic Models", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Prostate", "Prostatic Neoplasms", "Reproducibility of Results", "Retrospective Studies", "ROC Curve", "Sensitivity and Specificity"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84938957416", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"15076612600": {"Name": "Dikaios N.", "AuthorID": "15076612600", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Radiology, University College London Hospital"}, "55912741400": {"Name": "Alkalbani J.", "AuthorID": "55912741400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Imaging, University College London"}, "57197258948": {"Name": "Sidhu H.S.", "AuthorID": "57197258948", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Imaging, University College London"}, "55642708000": {"Name": "Halligan S.", "AuthorID": "55642708000", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Radiology, University College London Hospital"}, "57203543924": {"Name": "Taylor S.", "AuthorID": "57203543924", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Radiology, University College London Hospital"}, "7202372276": {"Name": "Atkinson D.", "AuthorID": "7202372276", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Radiology, University College London Hospital"}, "17036141700": {"Name": "Punwani S.", "AuthorID": "17036141700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Imaging, University College London"}, "15053220400": {"Name": "Kirkham A.", "AuthorID": "15053220400", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Radiology, University College London Hospital"}, "55556214500": {"Name": "Abd-Alazeez M.", "AuthorID": "55556214500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Urology, Division of Surgery and Interventional Science, University College London"}, "8147855500": {"Name": "Ahmed H.U.", "AuthorID": "8147855500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Urology, Division of Surgery and Interventional Science, University College London"}, "7004667094": {"Name": "Emberton M.", "AuthorID": "7004667094", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Urology, Division of Surgery and Interventional Science, University College London"}, "8972541300": {"Name": "Freeman A.", "AuthorID": "8972541300", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Histopathology, University College London Hospital"}}}
