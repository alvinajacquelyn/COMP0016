This causes some divergence difficulties in the resulting Fourier series description of the current. Nevertheless, the Storer-Wu method generates a reasonably accurate modal function for the input impedance at the gap. From this function are derived all of the modal resonances, the fundamental loop resonances and the anti-resonances. The modal impedances have nearly the same form as series resonant circuits, and this insight is exploited to identify a circuit model for the loop where each mode is represented by an RLC circuit and the entire loop is represented by a combination of this infinite set of RLCs. This section also discusses the difficulties with this model while the rest of the volume relies on its accuracy. The chapter ends with a look at the sub-wavelength anti-resonance.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85064598730", "SubjectAreas": [["Control and Systems Engineering", "ENGI", "2207"], ["Signal Processing", "COMP", "1711"], ["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"42661869600": {"Name": "McKinley A.", "AuthorID": "42661869600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
