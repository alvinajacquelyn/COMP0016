All rights reserved.Background: Alcohol-related harm in young people is now a global health priority. We examined trends in hospital admissions for alcohol-related injuries for adolescents in Western Australia (WA) and in England, identified groups most at risk and determined causes of injuries. Methods: Annual incidence rates for alcohol-related injury rates were calculated using population-level hospital admissions data for WA and England. We compared trends in different types of alcohol-related injury by age and gender. Results: Despite a decrease in the overall rate of injury admissions for people aged 13-17 years in WA, alcohol-related injuries have increased significantly from 1990 to 2009 (from 8 to 12 per 10 000). Conversely, alcohol-related injury rates have declined in England since 2007. In England, self-harm is the most frequently recorded cause of alcohol-related injury. In WA, unintentional injury is most common; however, violence-related harm is increasing for boys and girls. Conclusion: Alcohol-related harm of sufficient severity to require hospital admission is increasing among adolescents in WA. Declining trends in England suggest that this trend is not inevitable or irreversible. More needs to be done to address alcohol-related harm, and on-going monitoring is required to assess the effectiveness of strategies.", "AuthorKeywords": ["adolescents", "alcohol", "Injury rates", "trends", "youth"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Age Distribution", "Cohort Studies", "Emergency Service, Hospital", "England", "Female", "Health Policy", "Humans", "Male", "Patient Admission", "Regression Analysis", "Sex Distribution", "Underage Drinking", "Western Australia", "Wounds and Injuries"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85019989352", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"24734145200": {"Name": "O'Donnell M.", "AuthorID": "24734145200", "AffiliationID": "60000096, 60031806", "AffiliationName": "Telethon Kids Institute, University of Western Australia"}, "56730164000": {"Name": "Sims S.", "AuthorID": "56730164000", "AffiliationID": "60000096, 60031806", "AffiliationName": "Telethon Kids Institute, University of Western Australia"}, "56702149800": {"Name": "MacLean M.", "AuthorID": "56702149800", "AffiliationID": "60000096, 60031806", "AffiliationName": "Telethon Kids Institute, University of Western Australia"}, "7102827019": {"Name": "Stanley F.", "AuthorID": "7102827019", "AffiliationID": "60000096, 60031806", "AffiliationName": "Telethon Kids Institute, University of Western Australia"}, "24066757700": {"Name": "Gonzalez-Izquierdo A.", "AuthorID": "24066757700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Farr Institute of Health Informatics Research, University College London"}, "7401932225": {"Name": "Gilbert R.", "AuthorID": "7401932225", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Child Health, University College London"}}}
