We aim to compare the accuracy of these biomarkers, individually and in combination, in predicting AD among mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients. Methods In 73 MCI patients, followed to ascertain AD progression, markers were measured. Sensitivity and specificity, positive (LR+) and negative (LR-) likelihood ratios, and crude and adjusted hazard ratios were computed. Results Twenty-nine MCI patients progressed and 44 remained stable. Positivity to any marker achieved the lowest LR- (0.0), whereas the combination A\u03b242 plus FDG-PET achieved the highest LR+ (6.45). In a survival analysis, positivity to any marker was associated with 100% conversion rate, whereas negativity to all markers was associated with 100% stability. Discussion The best criteria combined amyloidosis and neurodegeneration biomarkers, whereas the individual biomarker with the best performance was FDG-PET.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alzheimer's disease", "Diagnostic accuracy", "Diagnostic criteria", "MCI", "MRI", "PET"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Alzheimer Disease", "Amyloid beta-Peptides", "Amyloidosis", "Atrophy", "Biomarkers", "Disease Progression", "Fluorodeoxyglucose F18", "Hippocampus", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Positron-Emission Tomography", "Predictive Value of Tests", "Prognosis", "Sensitivity and Specificity", "tau Proteins"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84945449699", "SubjectAreas": [["Epidemiology", "MEDI", "2713"], ["Health Policy", "MEDI", "2719"], ["Developmental Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2806"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Geriatrics and Gerontology", "MEDI", "2717"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"]], "AuthorData": {"16744236000": {"Name": "Prestia A.", "AuthorID": "16744236000", "AffiliationID": "60084291", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Epidemiology and Neuroimaging, IRCCS Centro San Giovanni di Dio Fatebenefratelli"}, "56214208300": {"Name": "Frisoni G.B.", "AuthorID": "56214208300", "AffiliationID": "60004718, 60009963", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Internal Medicine and Psychiatry, University Hospitals and University of Geneva"}, "13908172500": {"Name": "Caroli A.", "AuthorID": "13908172500", "AffiliationID": "60029411", "AffiliationName": "Medical Imaging Unit, Biomedical Engineering Department, IRCCS Mario Negri Institute for Pharmacological Research"}, "54413119600": {"Name": "Wade S.K.", "AuthorID": "54413119600", "AffiliationID": "60021796", "AffiliationName": "Department of Decision Science, Bocconi University"}, "8548678900": {"Name": "Van Der Flier W.M.", "AuthorID": "8548678900", "AffiliationID": "60001997", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, VU University Medical Center"}, "40462134000": {"Name": "Ossenkoppele R.", "AuthorID": "40462134000", "AffiliationID": "60001997", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology and Nuclear Medicine, PET Research, VU University Medical Center"}, "7007073571": {"Name": "Scheltens P.", "AuthorID": "7007073571", "AffiliationID": "60013779, 60001997", "AffiliationName": "Alzheimer Center, Department of Neurology, VU University Medical Center"}, "6603412407": {"Name": "Van Berckel B.", "AuthorID": "6603412407", "AffiliationID": "60001997", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology and Nuclear Medicine, PET Research, VU University Medical Center"}, "7102989379": {"Name": "Barkhof F.", "AuthorID": "7102989379", "AffiliationID": "60001997", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology and Nuclear Medicine, PET Research, VU University Medical Center"}, "6701704380": {"Name": "Teunissen C.E.", "AuthorID": "6701704380", "AffiliationID": "60001997", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Chemistry, VU University Medical Center"}, "7102000770": {"Name": "Wall A.", "AuthorID": "7102000770", "AffiliationID": "60003858", "AffiliationName": "PET-Center, Section of Nuclear Medicine and PET, Department of Radiology, Oncology and Radiation Sciences, Uppsala University"}, "23007332900": {"Name": "Carter S.F.", "AuthorID": "23007332900", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Karolinska Institutet, Alzheimer Neurobiology Center"}, "35070295800": {"Name": "Sch\u00f6ll M.", "AuthorID": "35070295800", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Karolinska Institutet, Alzheimer Neurobiology Center"}, "12241666800": {"Name": "Choo I.H.", "AuthorID": "12241666800", "AffiliationID": "60009950", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuropsychiatry, School of Medicine, Chosun University"}, "7102413103": {"Name": "Nordberg A.", "AuthorID": "7102413103", "AffiliationID": "60019295", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geriatric Medicine, Karolinska University Hospital Huddinge"}}}
