Measurement of brachial blood pressure alone may exaggerate the true blood pressure elevation due to exercise-induced change to pressure amplification. Whether blood pressure-lowering treatment modulates pressure amplification during exercise is unknown. Methods: Thirty-two participants with stage 1-2 hypertension (mean age 59.2 years) received eight weeks' blood pressure lowering with either aliskiren (300mg, n=16) or valsartan (320mg, n=16). Brachial and central aortic pressure (CASP) were measured non-invasively during treadmill exercise (Bruce protocol) at baseline, after eight weeks' treatment and 48 hours following treatment withdrawal. Results: The rise in brachial blood pressure with exercise exceeded the rise in CASP, indicative of enhanced pressure amplification. Eight weeks' treatment elicited similar reductions in brachial blood pressure and CASP which did not differ between rest and peak exercise (p>0.05). The exercise-induced increase in systolic pressure amplification did not differ between baseline and following eight weeks' treatment (p>0.05). These effects remained unchanged following treatment withdrawal. Conclusion: Blood pressure lowering does not directly influence the relationship between aortic and brachial pressure either at rest or during exercise in patients with hypertension, other than through proportionate lowering of both pressures. These effects remained unchanged 48 hours after a simulated missed medication dose.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Angiotensin receptor blocker", "Central aortic blood pressure", "Direct renin inhibitor", "Exercise test", "Hypertension"], "IndexKeywords": ["Antihypertensive Agents", "Arterial Pressure", "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug", "Exercise", "Female", "Humans", "Hypertension", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Renin-Angiotensin System", "Rest", "Systole"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84952927356", "SubjectAreas": [["Internal Medicine", "MEDI", "2724"], ["Endocrinology", "BIOC", "1310"]], "AuthorData": {"7102763287": {"Name": "Lacy P.S.", "AuthorID": "7102763287", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60024544, 60172638", "AffiliationName": "University College London, National Institute for Health Research, University College London Hospitals Biomedical Research Centre"}, "7404503273": {"Name": "Williams B.", "AuthorID": "7404503273", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60024544, 60172638", "AffiliationName": "University College London, National Institute for Health Research, University College London Hospitals Biomedical Research Centre"}, "7006007656": {"Name": "Brunel P.", "AuthorID": "7006007656", "AffiliationID": "60009968", "AffiliationName": "Novartis Pharma AG"}, "6507629000": {"Name": "Baschiera F.", "AuthorID": "6507629000", "AffiliationID": "60009968", "AffiliationName": "Novartis Pharma AG"}, "24400913200": {"Name": "Botha J.", "AuthorID": "24400913200", "AffiliationID": "60009968", "AffiliationName": "Novartis Pharma AG"}}}
