Yet, in sub-Saharan Africa, where HIV rates are high, efforts to prevent or address violence against children and its long-lasting effects are hampered by a lack of evidence. We assessed the relationship between violence exposure and mental health among HIV-affected children attending community-based organisations in South Africa (n = 834) and Malawi (n = 155, total sample n = 989) at baseline and 12-15-month follow-up. Exposure to violence in the home and in the community was high. HIV-negative children who lived with an HIV-positive person experienced most violence overall, followed by HIV-positive children. Children unaffected by HIV experienced least violence (all p <.05). Interpersonal violence in the home predicted child depression (\u03b2 = 0.17, p <.001), trauma symptoms (\u03b2 = 0.17, p <.001), lower self-esteem (\u03b2 =-0.17, p <.001), and internalising and externalising behavioural problems (\u03b2 = 0.07, p <.05), while exposure to community violence predicted trauma symptoms (\u03b2 = 0.16, p <.001) and behavioural problems (\u03b2 = 0.07, p <.05). Harsh physical discipline predicted lower self-esteem (\u03b2 =-0.18, p <.001) and behavioural problems for children (\u03b2 = 0.24, p <.001). Exposure to home (OR: 1.89, 95% CI: 1.23-2.85) and community violence predicted risk behaviour (OR: 2.39, 95% CI: 1.57-3.62). Over time, there was a decrease in depressed mood and problem behaviours, and an increase in self-esteem for children experiencing different types of violence at baseline. This may have been due to ongoing participation in the community-based programme. These data highlight the burden of violence in these communities and possibilities for programmes to include violence prevention to improve psychosocial well-being in HIV-affected children.", "AuthorKeywords": ["children", "HIV", "mental health", "Violence"], "IndexKeywords": ["Child", "Child, Preschool", "Community-Based Participatory Research", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Depression", "Depressive Disorder", "Exposure to Violence", "Female", "HIV Infections", "Humans", "Logistic Models", "Longitudinal Studies", "Malawi", "Male", "Mental Health", "Risk Factors", "Risk-Taking", "South Africa", "Violence"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84961960764", "SubjectAreas": [["Social Psychology", "PSYC", "3207"], ["Health (social science)", "SOCI", "3306"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"36802889900": {"Name": "Skeen S.", "AuthorID": "36802889900", "AffiliationID": "60000356", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry and Mental Health, University of Cape Town"}, "7102083161": {"Name": "Tomlinson M.", "AuthorID": "7102083161", "AffiliationID": "60001565", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Stellenbosch University"}, "54788172900": {"Name": "Macedo A.", "AuthorID": "54788172900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infection and Population Health, University College London"}, "57079062500": {"Name": "Hensels I.S.", "AuthorID": "57079062500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infection and Population Health, University College London"}, "35847280700": {"Name": "Sherr L.", "AuthorID": "35847280700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infection and Population Health, University College London"}}}
