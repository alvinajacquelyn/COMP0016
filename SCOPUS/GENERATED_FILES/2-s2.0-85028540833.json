Nano-structured, mainly metallic copper was detected on the surface of the Cu/MgO catalyst. In contrast, the high energy of the main peak in the spectrum of CO adsorbed on reduced Cu/ZnO:Al (2125 cm\u22121) proves that metallic copper is largely absent on the surface of this catalyst. The band is assigned to Zn\u03b4+\u2013CO. The presence of not completely reduced Cu\u03b4+\u2013CO species cannot be excluded. The results are interpreted in terms of a partial coverage of the copper nano-particles in the Cu/ZnO:Al catalyst by a thin layer of metastable, defective zinc oxide. Minor contributions in the spectrum at 2090 and 2112 cm\u22121 due to nano-structured Cu0\u2013CO and CO adsorbed on highly defective Cu0, respectively, indicate that the coverage of metallic copper is not complete.", "AuthorKeywords": ["CO adsorption", "Cu", "DRIFTS", "Methanol synthesis catalyst"], "IndexKeywords": ["CO adsorption", "Copper nanoparticles", "Cu/MgO catalysts", "DRIFT spectroscopy", "DRIFTS", "Methanol synthesis", "Partial coverage", "Spectroscopic studies"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85028540833", "SubjectAreas": [["Catalysis", "CENG", "1503"], ["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"]], "AuthorData": {"55763214500": {"Name": "Schumann J.", "AuthorID": "55763214500", "AffiliationID": "60025590", "AffiliationName": "SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, SUNCAT Center for Interface Science and Catalysis"}, "6603651694": {"Name": "Kr\u00f6hnert J.", "AuthorID": "6603651694", "AffiliationID": "60008644", "AffiliationName": "Department of Inorganic Chemistry, Fritz-Haber-Institut der Max-Planck-Gesellschaft"}, "56040118000": {"Name": "Frei E.", "AuthorID": "56040118000", "AffiliationID": "60008644", "AffiliationName": "Department of Inorganic Chemistry, Fritz-Haber-Institut der Max-Planck-Gesellschaft"}, "57191773533": {"Name": "Schl\u00f6gl R.", "AuthorID": "57191773533", "AffiliationID": "60072285", "AffiliationName": "Max Planck Institute for Chemical Energy Conversion"}, "6603855901": {"Name": "Trunschke A.", "AuthorID": "6603855901", "AffiliationID": "60008644", "AffiliationName": "Department of Inorganic Chemistry, Fritz-Haber-Institut der Max-Planck-Gesellschaft"}}}
