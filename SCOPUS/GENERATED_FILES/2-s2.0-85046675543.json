The NMI is one of the eight most concerning industries in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report. In this study, we summarized policies that impact Chinese NMI's development and grouped them into three types: energy structure policies, energy efficiency improving policies and production-scale policies. Based on those quantitative policy goals, a bottom-up model has been developed to study the CO2 emissions of five NMI's major sub-sectors from 2010 to 2030. The results showed that if China's central government could stick to the CO2 reduction policy strength of 13th Five-Year Plan (2016\u20132020), then the copper, lead and zinc industries can reach their emissions peak before 2030. Furthermore, if the Chinese government restricts the production of primary aluminum of 46.2 million tons in 2025, then the CO2 emissions of China's non-ferrous industry could reach the peak in that year, when the CO2 emissions peak is 297 million tons. Having benefited from the effective CO2 reduction policies of NMI, China may reach its ambitious CO2 peaking goals more easily.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Carbon emissions", "Non-ferrous industry", "Peak", "Policy evaluation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Carbon emissions", "Central government", "Chinese Government", "Energy structures", "Intergovernmental panel on climate changes", "Non-ferrous metals industry", "Peak", "Policy evaluation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85046675543", "SubjectAreas": [["Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment", "ENER", "2105"], ["Environmental Science (all)", "ENVI", "2300"], ["Strategy and Management", "BUSI", "1408"], ["Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering", "ENGI", "2209"]], "AuthorData": {"57191951230": {"Name": "Li M.", "AuthorID": "57191951230", "AffiliationID": "60016835", "AffiliationName": "Beijing Key Laboratory of Energy Economics and Environmental Management"}, "13005705700": {"Name": "Wei Y.M.", "AuthorID": "13005705700", "AffiliationID": "60016835", "AffiliationName": "Sustainable Development Research Institute for Economy and Society of Beijing"}, "55272317400": {"Name": "Mi Z.", "AuthorID": "55272317400", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "The Bartlett School of Construction and Project Management, University College London"}, "56603101200": {"Name": "Coffman D.M.", "AuthorID": "56603101200", "AffiliationID": "60014402", "AffiliationName": "The School of Public Administration and Policy, Renmin University"}}}
