KGaA, WeinheimThere is an emerging topic in the science of perovskite materials: A-site columnar-ordered A2A\u2032A\u2032\u2032B4O12 quadruple perovskites, which have an intrinsic triple order at the A sites. However, in many examples reported so far, A\u2032 and A\u2032\u2032 cations are the same, and the intrinsic triple order is hidden. Here, we investigate structural properties of Dy2CuMnMn4O12 (1) and Ho2MnGaMn4O12 (2) by neutron and X-ray powder diffraction and prove the triple order at the A sites. The cation distributions determined are [Ho2]A[Mn]A\u2032[Ga0.66Mn0.34]A\u2032\u2032[Mn3.66Ga0.34]BO12 and [Dy2]A[Cu0.73Mn0.27]A\u2032[Mn0.80Dy0.20]A\u2032\u2032[Mn1.89Cu0.11]B1[Mn2]B2O12. There are clear signatures of Jahn-Teller distortions in 1 and 2, and the orbital pattern is combined with an original type of charge ordering in 1. Columnar-ordered quadruple perovskites represent a new playground to study complex interactions between different electronic degrees of freedom. No long-range magnetic order was found in 2 by neutron diffraction, and its magnetic properties in low fields are dominated by an impurity with negative magnetization or magnetization reversal. On the other hand, 1 shows three magnetic transitions at 21, 125, and 160 K.", "AuthorKeywords": ["high-pressure chemistry", "materials science", "perovskite phases"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85050821510", "SubjectAreas": [["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"]], "AuthorData": {"21638631900": {"Name": "Belik A.A.", "AuthorID": "21638631900", "AffiliationID": "60002414", "AffiliationName": "Research Center for Functional Materials, National Institute for Materials Science (NIMS)"}, "57192878593": {"Name": "Zhang L.", "AuthorID": "57192878593", "AffiliationID": "60014652", "AffiliationName": "Graduate School of Chemical Sciences and Engineering, Hokkaido University"}, "7004349948": {"Name": "Yamaura K.", "AuthorID": "7004349948", "AffiliationID": "60014652", "AffiliationName": "Graduate School of Chemical Sciences and Engineering, Hokkaido University"}, "7004869132": {"Name": "Khalyavin D.D.", "AuthorID": "7004869132", "AffiliationID": "60001724, 60023254", "AffiliationName": "ISIS Facility, Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, Harwell Oxford"}, "7202465830": {"Name": "Matsushita Y.", "AuthorID": "7202465830", "AffiliationID": "60002414", "AffiliationName": "Material Analysis Station, National Institute for Materials Science (NIMS)"}, "35481577800": {"Name": "Katsuya Y.", "AuthorID": "35481577800", "AffiliationID": "60002414", "AffiliationName": "Synchrotron X-ray Station at SPring-8, NIMS"}, "57205528002": {"Name": "Tanaka M.", "AuthorID": "57205528002", "AffiliationID": "60002414", "AffiliationName": "Synchrotron X-ray Station at SPring-8, NIMS"}, "55838510124": {"Name": "Johnson R.D.", "AuthorID": "55838510124", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of Oxford, Clarendon Laboratory"}}}
