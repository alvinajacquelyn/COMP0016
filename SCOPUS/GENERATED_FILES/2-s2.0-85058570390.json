We aimed to explore the burden of severe UTIs post renal transplant on both graft function and health care resources. Methods: We conducted a retrospective review of KTRs with severe UTI warranting hospital admission at our center between January 1, 2012, and December 31, 2015. Results: We identified 198 UTI-related hospital admissions in 83 KTRs representing 7.4% of transplant admissions; 44.6% were men and 45 (54.2%) had recurrent admissions. The most commonly isolated pathogens were E coli (47.5%) and Klebsiella (16.2%): extended-spectrum \u03b2-lactamase\u2013producing organisms were detected in 31.3% of Klebsiella and in 25.5% of E coli. During UTI, the median serum creatinine increased from 126 to 196.5 \u03bcmol/L, then decreased to 149 and 161 \u03bcmol/L 3 months and 1 year after UTI, respectively. Acute kidney injury complicated 40.9% of UTIs (23.7% stage 1, 12.1% stage 2, 5.1% stage 3), with no significant difference between single and recurrent admission groups (\u03c72 = 0.36, P =.5). The 1-year mortality and death-censored graft loss were 1.2% and 3.6%, respectively. The median length of hospital stay was 4 days (286 days per annum) and the estimated annual cost was \u00a387,665 ($117,347). Conclusions: UTI post renal transplant represents a substantial burden on health care resources and patient morbidity in terms of acute kidney injury and deterioration in graft function. Thus, applying proper preventative and management strategies is paramount.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Acute Kidney Injury", "Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Bacterial Infections", "Female", "Humans", "Kidney Transplantation", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Postoperative Complications", "Retrospective Studies", "Risk Factors", "Transplant Recipients", "Urinary Tract Infections", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85058570390", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Transplantation", "MEDI", "2747"]], "AuthorData": {"37005410500": {"Name": "Al Midani A.", "AuthorID": "37005410500", "AffiliationID": "60170516, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Centre for Nephrology, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57205093504": {"Name": "Elands S.", "AuthorID": "57205093504", "AffiliationID": "60170516, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Centre for Nephrology, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "6603918658": {"Name": "Harber M.", "AuthorID": "6603918658", "AffiliationID": "60170516, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Centre for Nephrology, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57200301890": {"Name": "Shendi A.M.", "AuthorID": "57200301890", "AffiliationID": "60003593", "AffiliationName": "Nephrology Unit, Internal Medicine Department, Faculty of Medicine, Zagazig University"}, "36764929200": {"Name": "Collier S.", "AuthorID": "36764929200", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Microbiology Department, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
