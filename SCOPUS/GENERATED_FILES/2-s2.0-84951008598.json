In a randomized placebo-controlled double-blind study, the effect of N-acetylcysteine on systemic inflammation and oxidative damage was examined in patients undergoing lung resection, a human model of acute lung injury. Methods Eligible adults were randomized to receive preoperative infusion of N-acetylcysteine (240 mg/kg over 12 h) or placebo. Plasma thiols, interleukin-6, 8-isoprostane, ischaemia-modified albumin, red blood cell glutathione and exhaled breath condensate pH were measured pre- and post-operatively as markers of local and systemic inflammation and oxidative stress. Results Patients undergoing lung resection and one-lung ventilation exhibited significant postoperative inflammation and oxidative damage. Postoperative plasma thiol concentration was significantly higher in the N-acetylcysteine-treated group. However, there was no significant difference in any of the measured biomarkers of inflammation or oxidative damage, or in clinical outcomes, between N-acetylcysteine and placebo groups. Conclusion Preoperative administration of N-acetylcysteine did not attenuate postoperative systemic or pulmonary inflammation or oxidative damage after lung resection. Clinical trial registration: NCT00655928 at ClinicalTrials.gov In a human model of lung injury and oxidative stress, preoperative administration of the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine augmented plasma thiols but did not attenuate postoperative systemic inflammation or oxidative stress associated with lung resection.", "AuthorKeywords": ["critical care medicine", "inflammation", "lung cancer", "lung injury", "thoracic surgery"], "IndexKeywords": ["Acetylcysteine", "Aged", "Antioxidants", "Biomarkers", "Breath Tests", "Dinoprost", "Double-Blind Method", "Female", "Glutathione", "Humans", "Interleukin-6", "Lung", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Oxidative Stress", "Pneumonectomy", "Pneumonia", "Postoperative Complications", "Preoperative Care", "Serum Albumin", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84951008598", "SubjectAreas": [["Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine", "MEDI", "2740"]], "AuthorData": {"15041706800": {"Name": "Bastin A.J.", "AuthorID": "15041706800", "AffiliationID": "60009009", "AffiliationName": "Adult Intensive Care Unit, Royal Brompton Hospital"}, "57203087605": {"Name": "Griffiths M.J.", "AuthorID": "57203087605", "AffiliationID": "60010719, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "Leukocyte Biology, National Heart and Lung Institute, Imperial College London"}, "7202610468": {"Name": "Davies N.", "AuthorID": "7202610468", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Liver Failure Group, UCL Institute for Liver and Digestive Health, Royal Free Hospital Campus, University College of London (UCL)"}, "57215380390": {"Name": "Lim E.", "AuthorID": "57215380390", "AffiliationID": "60022023, 60010719, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "Academic Division of Thoracic Surgery, Royal Brompton and Harefield NHS Foundation Trust, UK National Heart and Lung Division, Imperial College"}, "7006022655": {"Name": "Quinlan G.J.", "AuthorID": "7006022655", "AffiliationID": "60010719, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "Vascular Biology, National Heart and Lung Institute, Imperial College London"}}}
