These features are reflected in the AD cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) by increased concentrations of total tau (t-tau) and phosphorylated tau (p-tau), together with decreased concentrations of \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b242), respectively. In combination, A\u03b242, p-tau and t-tau are 85-95% sensitive and specific for AD in both prodromal and dementia stages of the disease and they are now included in the diagnostic research criteria for AD. However, to fully implement these biomarkers into clinical practice, harmonization of data is needed. This work is ongoing through the standardization of analytical procedures between clinical laboratories and the production of reference materials for CSF A\u03b242, p-tau and t-tau. To monitor other aspects of AD neuropathology, e.g., synaptic dysfunction and/or to develop markers of progression, identifying novel candidate biomarkers is of great importance. Based on knowledge from the established biomarkers, exemplified by A\u03b2 and its many variants, and emerging data on neurogranin fragments as biomarker candidate(s), a thorough protein characterization in order to fully understand the diagnostic value of a protein is a suggested approach for successful biomarker discovery.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alzheimer's disease", "Biomarker", "Cerebrospinal fluid", "Diagnosis", "Tau", "\u03b2-Amyloid"], "IndexKeywords": ["Alzheimer Disease", "Amyloid beta-Peptides", "Animals", "Biomarkers", "Humans", "Peptide Fragments", "tau Proteins"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84940435386", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Clinical Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1308"], ["Biochemistry (medical)", "MEDI", "2704"]], "AuthorData": {"55883397700": {"Name": "H\u00f6glund K.", "AuthorID": "55883397700", "AffiliationID": "60027675, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, Department of Psychiatry and Neurochemistry, The Sahlgrenska Academy at the University of Gothenburg"}, "6701454676": {"Name": "Zetterberg H.", "AuthorID": "6701454676", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "56415176000": {"Name": "Blennow K.", "AuthorID": "56415176000", "AffiliationID": "60027675, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, Department of Psychiatry and Neurochemistry, The Sahlgrenska Academy at the University of Gothenburg"}, "12806782700": {"Name": "Portelius E.", "AuthorID": "12806782700", "AffiliationID": "60027675, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, Department of Psychiatry and Neurochemistry, The Sahlgrenska Academy at the University of Gothenburg"}, "56521519700": {"Name": "Fourier A.", "AuthorID": "56521519700", "AffiliationID": "60108296, 60000905", "AffiliationName": "BIORAN team INSERM U1028, CNRS UMR5292, Lyon Neuroscience Research Center"}, "6603560410": {"Name": "Perret-Liaudet A.", "AuthorID": "6603560410", "AffiliationID": "60108296, 60000905", "AffiliationName": "BIORAN team INSERM U1028, CNRS UMR5292, Lyon Neuroscience Research Center"}}}
