It is defined as the dysregulated host response to infection resulting in organ dysfunction, and its incidence is increasing as the population ages. However, it is a treatable and potentially reversible condition, especially if identified and treated promptly. A sound understanding of sepsis is crucial for optimal care. Although general guidelines are available for management, here we provide a foundation of understanding to encourage thoughtful, personalised management of sepsis during the acute phase. We provide an overview of the epidemiology, the new Sepsis-3 definitions, pathophysiology, clinical presentations, and investigation and management of sepsis for the non-expert.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Acute medicine", "Infection", "Intensive care medicine", "Medical education", "Sepsis", "Septic shock"], "IndexKeywords": ["Early Medical Intervention", "Humans", "Multiple Organ Failure", "Patient Care Management", "Sepsis"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85042602743", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"54894622200": {"Name": "Tidswell R.", "AuthorID": "54894622200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Bloomsbury Institute of Intensive Care Medicine, University College London, Cruciform Building"}, "7401654716": {"Name": "Singer M.", "AuthorID": "7401654716", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Bloomsbury Institute of Intensive Care Medicine, University College London, Cruciform Building"}}}
