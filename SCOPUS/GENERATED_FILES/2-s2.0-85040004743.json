Even though a large number of genomes of this species have been sequenced, only a few plasmids have been described in the literature. Here, we use a combination of in silico analyses and laboratory experiments to show that plasmids are common in C. difficile. We focus on a group of plasmids that share similarity with the plasmid pCD630, from the reference strain 630. The family of pCD630-like plasmids is defined by the presence of a conserved putative helicase that is likely part of the plasmid replicon. This replicon is compatible with at least some other C. difficile replicons, as strains can carry pCD630-like plasmids in addition to other plasmids. We find two distinct sub-groups of pCD630-like plasmids that differ in size and accessory modules. This study is the first to describe a family of plasmids in C. difficile.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Helicase", "Plasmid", "Replication", "Replicon"], "IndexKeywords": ["Bacterial Proteins", "Clostridium difficile", "Clostridium Infections", "DNA Helicases", "Humans", "Plasmids", "Replicon"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85040004743", "SubjectAreas": [["Microbiology", "IMMU", "2404"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"6603759221": {"Name": "Smits W.", "AuthorID": "6603759221", "AffiliationID": "120021777", "AffiliationName": "Netherlands Centre for One Health"}, "23976318000": {"Name": "Harmanus C.", "AuthorID": "23976318000", "AffiliationID": "60015618", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Microbiology, Leiden University Medical Center"}, "56811023000": {"Name": "Hornung B.", "AuthorID": "56811023000", "AffiliationID": "60015618", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Microbiology, Leiden University Medical Center"}, "56702153300": {"Name": "Weese J.", "AuthorID": "56702153300", "AffiliationID": "60007606, 60015881", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathobiology, Ontario Veterinary College, University of Guelph"}, "55464768800": {"Name": "Roberts A.", "AuthorID": "55464768800", "AffiliationID": "60020934", "AffiliationName": "Research Centre for Drugs and Diagnostics, Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine"}}}
