This study systematically assessed uptake of 18F-florbetapir in patients with proven systemic amyloidosis at sites outside the heart. Methods: Seventeen patients with proven cardiac amyloidosis underwent 18F-florbetapir PET/CT imaging, 15 with AL and 2 with transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTR). Three patients had repeat scans. All patients had protocolized assessment at the UK National Amyloidosis Centre including imaging with 123I-serum amyloid P component (SAP). 18F-Florbetapir images were assessed for areas of increased tracer accumulation and time\u2013uptake curves in terms of standardized uptake values (SUVmean) were produced. Results: All 17 patients showed 18F-florbetapir uptake at one or more extracardiac sites. Uptake was seen in the spleen in 6 patients (35%; 6 of 9, 67%, with splenic involvement on 123I-SAP scintigraphy), in the fat in 11 (65%), in the tongue in 8 (47%), in the parotids in 8 (47%), in the masticatory muscles in 7 (41%), in the lungs in 3 (18%), and in the kidney in 2 (12%) on the late half-body images. The 18F-florbetapir spleen retention index (SRI) was calculated. SRI >0.045 had 100% sensitivity/sensitivity (in relation to 123I-SAP splenic uptake, the current standard) in detecting splenic amyloid on dynamic imaging and a sensitivity of 66.7% and a specificity of 100% on the late half-body images. Intense lung uptake was seen in three patients, one of whom had lung interstitial infiltration suggestive of amyloid deposition on previous high-resolution CT. Repeat imaging showed a stable appearance in all three patients suggesting no early impact of treatment response. Conclusion: 18F-Florbetapir PET/CT is a promising tool for the detection of extracardiac sites of amyloid deposition. The combination of uptake in the heart and uptake in the spleen on 18F-florbetapir PET/CT, a hallmark of AL, suggests that this tracer holds promise as a screening tool for AL.", "AuthorKeywords": ["AL", "Amyloid", "Cardiac amyloid", "Florbetapir", "PET", "TTR"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Amyloidosis", "Aniline Compounds", "Ethylene Glycols", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Positron Emission Tomography Computed Tomography", "Prospective Studies"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85045245650", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"57202782066": {"Name": "Wagner T.", "AuthorID": "57202782066", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nuclear Medicine, Royal Free Hospital"}, "55354235200": {"Name": "Skillen A.", "AuthorID": "55354235200", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nuclear Medicine, Royal Free Hospital"}, "25224922400": {"Name": "McCool D.", "AuthorID": "25224922400", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nuclear Medicine, Royal Free Hospital"}, "56701783400": {"Name": "Page J.", "AuthorID": "56701783400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "National Amyloidosis Centre, University College London (Royal Free Campus)"}, "57200181229": {"Name": "Ross J.C.", "AuthorID": "57200181229", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "National Amyloidosis Centre, University College London (Royal Free Campus)"}, "57196120999": {"Name": "Manwani R.", "AuthorID": "57196120999", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "National Amyloidosis Centre, University College London (Royal Free Campus)"}, "35464959200": {"Name": "Hawkins P.N.", "AuthorID": "35464959200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "National Amyloidosis Centre, University College London (Royal Free Campus)"}, "6506002568": {"Name": "Wechalekar A.D.", "AuthorID": "6506002568", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "National Amyloidosis Centre, University College London (Royal Free Campus)"}, "6602332136": {"Name": "Burniston M.", "AuthorID": "6602332136", "AffiliationID": "60004093, 60159931", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nuclear Medicine, St Bartholomew\u2019s Hospital, Barts Health NHS Trust"}}}
