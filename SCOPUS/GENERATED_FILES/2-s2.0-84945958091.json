We consider a coupling between the compressible Navier-Stokes system and the reaction diffusion equations for chemical species when the thermal effects are neglected. We first prove the existence of weak solutions to the semi-discretization in time. Based on this, the existence of solutions to the evolutionary system is proven.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Barotropic flows", "Chemically reacting gases", "Mixture models", "Time discretization", "Weak solutions to compressible flows"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84945958091", "SubjectAreas": [["Mathematics (all)", "MATH", "2600"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"36717202900": {"Name": "Zatorska E.", "AuthorID": "36717202900", "AffiliationID": "60086543", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Mathematics of Polish Academy of Sciences"}, "56239308700": {"Name": "Mucha P.", "AuthorID": "56239308700", "AffiliationID": "60110679, 60013756", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Applied Mathematics and Mechanics, University of Warsaw"}}}
