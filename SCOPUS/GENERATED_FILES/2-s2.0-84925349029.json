All rights reserved.Objective: To examine the temporal evolution of spinal cord (SC) atrophy in multiple sclerosis (MS), and its association with clinical progression in a large MS cohort. Methods: A total of 352 patients from two centres with MS (relapsing remitting MS (RRMS): 256, secondary progressive MS (SPMS): 73, primary progressive MS (PPMS): 23) were included. Clinical and MRI parameters were obtained at baseline, after 12 months and 24 months of follow-up. In addition to conventional brain and SC MRI parameters, the annualised percentage brain volume change and the annualised percentage upper cervical cord cross-sectional area change (aUCCA) were quantified. Main outcome measure was disease progression, defined by expanded disability status scale increase after 24 months. Results: UCCA was lower in SPMS and PPMS compared with RRMS for all time points. aUCCA over 24 months was highest in patients with SPMS (-2.2% per year) and was significantly higher in patients with disease progression (-2.3% per year) than in stable patients (-1.2% per year; p=0.003), while annualised percentage brain volume change did not differ between subtypes (RRMS: -0.42% per year; SPMS -0.6% per year; PPMS: -0.46% per year) nor between progressive and stable patients (p=0.055). Baseline UCCA and aUCCA over 24 months were found to be relevant contributors of expanded disability status scale at month-24, while baseline UCCA as well as number of SC segments involved by lesions at baseline but not aUCCA were relevant contributors of disease progression. Conclusions: SC MRI parameters including baseline UCCA and SC lesions were significant MRI predictors of disease progression. Progressive 24-month upper SC atrophy occurred in all MS subtypes, and was faster in patients exhibiting disease progression at month-24.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Atrophy", "Brain", "Cervical Vertebrae", "Cohort Studies", "Disability Evaluation", "Disease Progression", "Female", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Multiple Sclerosis", "Spinal Cord"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84925349029", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"57220182401": {"Name": "Lukas C.", "AuthorID": "57220182401", "AffiliationID": "60108391, 60005322", "AffiliationName": "Department of Diagnostic and Interventional Radiology and Nuclear Medicine, St. Josef Hospital, Ruhr University Bochum"}, "6507948464": {"Name": "Bellenberg B.", "AuthorID": "6507948464", "AffiliationID": "60108391, 60005322", "AffiliationName": "Department of Diagnostic and Interventional Radiology and Nuclear Medicine, St. Josef Hospital, Ruhr University Bochum"}, "6701756044": {"Name": "Knol D.L.", "AuthorID": "6701756044", "AffiliationID": "60001997", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, VU University Medical Center, Neuroscience Campus Amsterdam"}, "26024481200": {"Name": "Sombekke M.H.", "AuthorID": "26024481200", "AffiliationID": "60001997", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, VU University Medical Center, Neuroscience Campus Amsterdam"}, "7006076844": {"Name": "Uitdehaag B.M.J.", "AuthorID": "7006076844", "AffiliationID": "60001997", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, VU University Medical Center, Neuroscience Campus Amsterdam"}, "7402381436": {"Name": "Hahn H.K.", "AuthorID": "7402381436", "AffiliationID": "60107767", "AffiliationName": "Fraunhofer MEVIS, Institute for Medical Image Computing"}, "49663734500": {"Name": "Popescu V.", "AuthorID": "49663734500", "AffiliationID": "60001997", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, VU University Medical Center, Neuroscience Campus Amsterdam"}, "26643174700": {"Name": "Geurts J.J.G.", "AuthorID": "26643174700", "AffiliationID": "60001997", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anatomy and Neurosciences, Section of Clinical Neuroscience, VU University Medical Center and Neuroscience Campus Amsterdam"}, "7102989379": {"Name": "Barkhof F.", "AuthorID": "7102989379", "AffiliationID": "60001997", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, VU University Medical Center, Neuroscience Campus Amsterdam"}, "6506499076": {"Name": "Vrenken H.", "AuthorID": "6506499076", "AffiliationID": "60001997", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Medical Technology, MS Center Amsterdam, VU University Medical Center"}, "24463975100": {"Name": "Weier K.", "AuthorID": "24463975100", "AffiliationID": "60028287", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, University Hospital Basel"}, "7003664788": {"Name": "Radue E.W.", "AuthorID": "7003664788", "AffiliationID": "60028287", "AffiliationName": "Medical Image Analysis Center (MIAC), University Hospital Basel"}, "7006758232": {"Name": "Gass A.", "AuthorID": "7006758232", "AffiliationID": "60028287", "AffiliationName": "Medical Image Analysis Center (MIAC), University Hospital Basel"}, "7004559324": {"Name": "Kappos L.", "AuthorID": "7004559324", "AffiliationID": "60028287", "AffiliationName": "Medical Image Analysis Center (MIAC), University Hospital Basel"}, "12785348100": {"Name": "Naegelin Y.", "AuthorID": "12785348100", "AffiliationID": "60028287", "AffiliationName": "Medical Image Analysis Center (MIAC), University Hospital Basel"}}}
