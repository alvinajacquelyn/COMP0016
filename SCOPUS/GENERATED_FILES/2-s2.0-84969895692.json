For this purpose, we analyse the impacts of these two platforms based on the components of information adoption model (IAM) which are borrowed as information quality, information credibility, information usefulness and information adoption. We conduct a survey and find anonymous reviews as more influential on consumer\u2019 online purchase intentions than friends\u2019 recommendations on social media. However, as this result was contrary to that expected, we conduct another study through in-depth interviews in order to enlighten our results found in the first study. In Study 2, we find the reasons why consumers prefer anonymous reviews rather than friends\u2019 recommendations. Information quantity, information readiness, detailed information and dedicated information are factors which make shopping websites superior than social media in terms of the impact of electronic word of mouth (eWOM). Academic and managerial implications are discussed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Electronic word of mouth (eWOM)", "online purchase intention", "online reviews", "shopping websites", "social media"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84969895692", "SubjectAreas": [["Business and International Management", "BUSI", "1403"], ["Marketing", "BUSI", "1406"]], "AuthorData": {"56956895800": {"Name": "Erkan I.", "AuthorID": "56956895800", "AffiliationID": "60104498", "AffiliationName": "Department of Business Administration, Izmir Katip Celebi University"}, "57158262900": {"Name": "Evans C.", "AuthorID": "57158262900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London Interaction Centre (UCLIC), University College London"}}}
