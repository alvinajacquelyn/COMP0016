Parasympathetic (vagal) dysfunction may also promote (extra-cardiac) multi-organ dysfunction, although perioperative data are lacking. Assuming that cardiac vagal activity, and therefore heart rate recovery response, is a marker of brainstem parasympathetic dysfunction, we hypothesized that impaired HRR would be associated with a higher incidence of morbidity after noncardiac surgery. Methods In two prospective, blinded, observational cohort studies, we established the definition of impaired vagal function in terms of the HRR threshold that is associated with perioperative myocardial injury (HRR 12 beats min-1 (bpm), 60 seconds after cessation of cardiopulmonary exercise testing. The primary outcome of this secondary analysis was all-cause morbidity three and five days after surgery, defined using the Post-Operative Morbidity Survey. Secondary outcomes of this analysis were type of morbidity and time to become morbidity-free. Logistic regression and Cox regression tested for the association between HRR and morbidity. Results are presented as odds/hazard ratios [OR or HR; (95% confidence intervals). Results 882/1941 (45.4%) patients had HRR12bpm. All-cause morbidity within 5 days of surgery was more common in 585/822 (71.2%) patients with HRR12bpm, compared to 718/1119 (64.2%) patients with HRR>12bpm (OR:1.38 (1.14\u20131.67); p = 0.001). HRR12bpm was associated with more frequent episodes of pulmonary (OR:1.31 (1.05\u20131.62);p = 0.02)), infective (OR:1.38 (1.10\u20131.72); p = 0.006), renal (OR:1.91 (1.30\u20132.79); p = 0.02)), cardiovascular (OR:1.39 (1.15\u20131.69); p<0.001)), neurological (OR:1.73 (1.11\u20132.70); p = 0.02)) and pain morbidity (OR:1.38 (1.14\u20131.68); p = 0.001) within 5 days of surgery. Conclusions Multi-organ dysfunction is more common in surgical patients with cardiac vagal dysfunction, defined as HRR 12 bpm after preoperative cardiopulmonary exercise testing.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Exercise Test", "Female", "Heart Injuries", "Heart Rate", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Postoperative Complications", "Prospective Studies", "Vagus Nerve"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85070972271", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"8768192800": {"Name": "Ackland G.L.", "AuthorID": "8768192800", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "William Harvey Research Institute, Queen Mary University of London"}, "56684603900": {"Name": "Abbott T.E.F.", "AuthorID": "56684603900", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "William Harvey Research Institute, Queen Mary University of London"}, "57210569568": {"Name": "May S.M.", "AuthorID": "57210569568", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "William Harvey Research Institute, Queen Mary University of London"}, "57210577680": {"Name": "Reynolds J.A.", "AuthorID": "57210577680", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "William Harvey Research Institute, Queen Mary University of London"}, "7005083648": {"Name": "Pearse R.M.", "AuthorID": "7005083648", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "William Harvey Research Institute, Queen Mary University of London"}, "24725193900": {"Name": "Minto G.", "AuthorID": "24725193900", "AffiliationID": "60115301, 60005671, 60024779, 60029196", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anaesthesia, Derriford Hospital, Plymouth Hospitals NHS Trust, Peninsula Schools of Medicine and Dentistry, Plymouth University"}, "25936010800": {"Name": "Clark M.", "AuthorID": "25936010800", "AffiliationID": "60032889", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anaesthesia, Royal Bournemouth Hospital"}, "56763581800": {"Name": "Owen T.", "AuthorID": "56763581800", "AffiliationID": "60010985, 60022315", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anaesthesia, Royal Preston Hospital, Lancashire Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "56304754600": {"Name": "Prabhu P.", "AuthorID": "56304754600", "AffiliationID": "60028760", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anaesthesia, Royal Surrey County Hospital"}, "7003675957": {"Name": "Cuthbertson B.H.", "AuthorID": "7003675957", "AffiliationID": "60016849", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anesthesia, University of Toronto"}, "57210570903": {"Name": "Wijesundera D.", "AuthorID": "57210570903", "AffiliationID": "60023022", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anesthesia and Pain Management, Toronto General Hospital"}, "null": {"Name": null, "AuthorID": null, "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
