This trend has been derived so far from integrated spectra, and remains unexplained at present. To test whether such trend depends on the local properties within a galaxy, we have obtained new, extremely deep, spectroscopic data, for three nearby ETGs, two galaxies with high \u03c3 (\u223c 300 km s-1), and one lower mass system, with \u03c3 \u223c 100 km s-1. From the analysis of IMF-sensitive spectral features, we find that the IMF depends significantly on galactocentric distance in the massive ETGs, with the enhanced fraction of low-mass stars mostly confined to their central regions. In contrast, the low-\u03c3 galaxy does not show any significant radial gradient in the IMF, well described by a shallower distribution, relative to the innermost regions of massive galaxies, at all radii. Such a result indicates that the IMF should be regarded as a local (rather than global) property, and suggests a significant difference between the formation process of the core and the outer regions of massive ETGs.", "AuthorKeywords": ["CD- galaxies", "Elliptical and lenticular", "Evolution - galaxies", "Formation - galaxies", "Fundamental parameters", "Galaxies"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84922522658", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"55498121400": {"Name": "Mart\u00edn-Navarro I.", "AuthorID": "55498121400", "AffiliationID": "60003044", "AffiliationName": "Departamento de Astrof\u00edsica, Universidad de La Laguna"}, "55888603200": {"Name": "Vazdekis A.", "AuthorID": "55888603200", "AffiliationID": "60003044", "AffiliationName": "Departamento de Astrof\u00edsica, Universidad de La Laguna"}, "6602632408": {"Name": "Falc\u00f3n-Barroso J.", "AuthorID": "6602632408", "AffiliationID": "60003044", "AffiliationName": "Departamento de Astrof\u00edsica, Universidad de La Laguna"}, "6602863360": {"Name": "La Barbera F.", "AuthorID": "6602863360", "AffiliationID": "60007340", "AffiliationName": "INAF-Osservatorio Astronomico di Capodimonte"}, "7004053948": {"Name": "Ferreras I.", "AuthorID": "7004053948", "AffiliationID": "60084281, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Mullard Space Science Laboratory, University College London, Holmbury St Mary"}}}
