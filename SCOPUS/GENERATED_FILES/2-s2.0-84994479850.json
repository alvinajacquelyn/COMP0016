There is a theoretical basis for ameliorating the immune response with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), which is supported by empirical evidence of a beneficial response following its use in the treatment of viral and autoimmune encephalitis. In immune-mediated encephalitis, IVIG is often used after a delay (by weeks in some cases), while diagnosis is confirmed. Wider use of IVIG in infectious encephalitis and earlier use in immune-mediated encephalitis could improve outcomes for these conditions. We describe the protocol for the first ever randomised control trial of IVIG treatment for children with all-cause encephalitis. Methods and analysis 308 children (6 months to 16 years) with a diagnosis of acute/subacute encephalitis will be recruited in-430 UK hospitals and randomised to receive 2 doses (1 g/kg/dose) of either IVIG or matching placebo, in addition to standard treatment. Recruitment will be over a 42-month period and follow-up of each participant will be for 12 months post randomisation. The primary outcome is \u00e2 - good recovery' (score of 2 or lower on the Glasgow Outcome Score Extended-paediatric version), at 12 months after randomisation. Additional secondary neurological measures will be collected at 4-6 weeks after discharge from acute care and at 6 and 12 months after randomisation. Safety, radiological, other autoimmune and tertiary outcomes will also be assessed. Ethics and dissemination This trial has been approved by the UK National Research Ethics committee (South Central-Oxford A; REC 14/SC/1416). Current protocol: V4.0 (10/03/2016). The findings will be presented at national and international meetings and conferences and published in peer-reviewed journals.", "AuthorKeywords": ["ADEM", "autoimmune", "encephalitides", "GOSE-Peds", "immune-mediated"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Clinical Protocols", "Encephalitis", "Hashimoto Disease", "Humans", "Immunoglobulins, Intravenous", "Immunologic Factors", "Infant", "Infectious Encephalitis", "Pediatrics", "Research Design"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84994479850", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"55574161200": {"Name": "Iro M.A.", "AuthorID": "55574161200", "AffiliationID": "60002634", "AffiliationName": "Oxford Vaccine Group, Department of Paediatrics, University of Oxford"}, "26646972400": {"Name": "Sadarangani M.", "AuthorID": "26646972400", "AffiliationID": "60086967, 60010365", "AffiliationName": "Vaccine Evaluation Center, BC Children's Hospital Research Institute, University of British Columbia"}, "56526429300": {"Name": "Willis L.", "AuthorID": "56526429300", "AffiliationID": "60002634", "AffiliationName": "Oxford Vaccine Group, Department of Paediatrics, University of Oxford"}, "7103193821": {"Name": "Pollard A.J.", "AuthorID": "7103193821", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60170323", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatrics, Oxford University Hospitals, NHS Foundation Trust"}, "26430490900": {"Name": "Absoud M.", "AuthorID": "26430490900", "AffiliationID": "60107269, 60005518", "AffiliationName": "Department of Children's Neurosciences, Evelina London Children's Hospital at Guy's, St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust"}, "8762850900": {"Name": "Lim M.", "AuthorID": "8762850900", "AffiliationID": "60107269, 60005518", "AffiliationName": "Department of Children's Neurosciences, Evelina London Children's Hospital at Guy's, St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57203031127": {"Name": "Chong W.K.", "AuthorID": "57203031127", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children"}, "55290679000": {"Name": "Clark C.A.", "AuthorID": "55290679000", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "19933378400": {"Name": "Easton A.", "AuthorID": "19933378400", "AffiliationID": "118747790", "AffiliationName": "Encephalitis Society"}, "57220438310": {"Name": "Gray V.", "AuthorID": "57220438310", "AffiliationID": "60024857", "AffiliationName": "Psychological Services (Paediatrics), Alder Hey Children's NHS Foundation Trust"}, "6603954227": {"Name": "Kneen R.", "AuthorID": "6603954227", "AffiliationID": "60024857", "AffiliationName": "Littlewoods Neuroscience Foundation, Department of Neurology, Alder Hey Children's NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7102024641": {"Name": "Solomon T.", "AuthorID": "7102024641", "AffiliationID": "60160417", "AffiliationName": "Walton Centre NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7103159685": {"Name": "Pike M.", "AuthorID": "7103159685", "AffiliationID": "60170323", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Neurology, Oxford University Hospitals NHS Trust"}, "55853794100": {"Name": "Vincent A.", "AuthorID": "55853794100", "AffiliationID": "60001633, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Neurosciences, Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Oxford"}, "7404164174": {"Name": "Yu L.M.", "AuthorID": "7404164174", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Nuffield Department of Primary Care Health Sciences, University of Oxford"}}}
