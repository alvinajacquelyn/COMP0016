In this paper we provide lower and upper bounds on the minimum number of open sets, not containing a pair of antipodal points, needed to cover the d-dimensional sphere n times, with the additional property that the northern hemisphere is covered m > n times. We prove that if the open northern hemisphere is to be covered m times, then at least \u2308(d \u2212 1)/2\u2309 + n + m and at most d + n + m sets are needed. For the case of n = 1 and d \u2265 2, this number is equal to d + 2 if m \u2264 \u230ad/2\u230b + 1 and equal to \u230a(d \u2212 1)/2\u230b + 2 + m if m > \u230ad/2\u230b + 1. If the closed northern hemisphere is to be covered m times, then d + 2m \u2212 1 sets are needed; this number is also sufficient. We also present results on a related problem of independent interest. We prove that if S<sup>d</sup> is covered n times with open sets not containing a pair of antipodal points, then there exists a point that is covered at least \u2308d/2\u2309 + n times. Furthermore, we show that there are covers in which no point is covered more than n + d times.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84928742486", "SubjectAreas": [["Mathematics (miscellaneous)", "MATH", "2601"]], "AuthorData": {"7005223038": {"Name": "B\u00e1r\u00e1ny I.", "AuthorID": "7005223038", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University College London"}, "56013555800": {"Name": "Fabila-Monroy R.", "AuthorID": "56013555800", "AffiliationID": "60017323, 60019176", "AffiliationName": "Departamento de Matem\u00e1ticas, Centro de Investigaci\u00f3n y de Estudios Avanzados del Instituto Polit\u00e9cnico Nacional (CINVESTAV)"}, "55918277800": {"Name": "Vogtenhuber B.", "AuthorID": "55918277800", "AffiliationID": "60110567, 60019663", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Software Technology, Graz University of Technology"}}}
