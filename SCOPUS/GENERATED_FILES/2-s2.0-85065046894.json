A statistical design of experiment with online monitoring of voltage, current, temperature, resistance, duty cycle, and frequency is used to identify relay failure precursors. Examples of detected precursors include abnormal spikes in resistance and extension of the average closing time of the relay within the final 1.5 million actuations prior to failure. A detailed post-failure analysis utilising white light interferometry and energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis reveals the relay failure modes associated with erosion, pit and crater formation, and material transfer. The results demonstrate that low resolution data can detect signatures of impending failure modes such as stuck open and closed failures as well as unacceptable long opening times. The findings within this paper demonstrate remote monitoring of the near real-time health of electromagnetic relays with low resolution data analysis.", "AuthorKeywords": ["diagnostics", "electromagnetic relays", "embedded health monitoring", "FMMEA", "RUL"], "IndexKeywords": ["Electromagnetic relays", "Energy dispersive x-ray", "FMMEA", "Health monitoring", "Material transfers", "Remaining useful lives", "Statistical design of experiments", "White-light interferometry"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85065046894", "SubjectAreas": [["Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality", "ENGI", "2213"], ["Control and Optimization", "MATH", "2606"], ["Modeling and Simulation", "MATH", "2611"]], "AuthorData": {"57208529236": {"Name": "Kirschbaum L.", "AuthorID": "57208529236", "AffiliationID": "60019656", "AffiliationName": "Smart Systems Group (SSG), School of Engineering and Physical Sciences, Heriot-Watt University"}, "56001555100": {"Name": "Dinmohammadi F.", "AuthorID": "56001555100", "AffiliationID": "60019656", "AffiliationName": "Smart Systems Group (SSG), School of Engineering and Physical Sciences, Heriot-Watt University"}, "56015681900": {"Name": "Flynn D.", "AuthorID": "56015681900", "AffiliationID": "60019656", "AffiliationName": "Smart Systems Group (SSG), School of Engineering and Physical Sciences, Heriot-Watt University"}, "7801673281": {"Name": "Robu V.", "AuthorID": "7801673281", "AffiliationID": "60019656", "AffiliationName": "Smart Systems Group (SSG), School of Engineering and Physical Sciences, Heriot-Watt University"}, "7102777145": {"Name": "Pecht M.", "AuthorID": "7102777145", "AffiliationID": "60020304", "AffiliationName": "University of Maryland, Centre for Advanced Lifecycle Testing"}}}
