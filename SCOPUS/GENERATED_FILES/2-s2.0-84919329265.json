Bland-Altman plots were generated to assess the level of agreement between the two techniques.Results The three most common diagnoses were iris naevi (62 (49.2%)), iris pigment epithelial cysts (23 (18.3%)) and iris melanoma (11 (8.7%)). Image feature comparison for USB was better than AS-OCT in visualising all tumour margins (81 (64.3%) vs 59 (46.8%)), posterior tumour margin (54 (42.9%) vs 16 (12.7%)) and producing less posterior shadowing (121 (96%) vs 43 (34.1%)). Image resolution comparison revealed USB to be slightly better for resolving the overall tumour (45 (35.7%) vs 43 (34.1%)) and posterior tumour surface (70 (55.6%) vs 32 (25.4%)) but AS-OCT was better for resolving the anterior (62 (49.2%) vs 4 (3.2%)) and lateral tumour surface (62 (49.2%) vs 31 (24.6%)). Comparing the three most common diagnoses, USB was better for visualising iris pigment epithelial cysts (12 (52.2%) vs 2 (8.7%)) and iris melanoma (7 (63.6%) vs 1 (9.1%)) but AS-OCT was better (28 (45.2%) vs 15 (24.2%)) for visualising iris naevi. Bland-Altman plots showed good agreement between the two techniques for lesions smaller than 3 mm in base and 2 mm in elevation.Conclusions AS-OCT is superior to USB for imaging small lesions pertaining to the anterior iris but USB is better for imaging larger iris lesions with posterior or ciliary body extension.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Anterior Eye Segment", "Ciliary Body", "Cysts", "Diagnostic Techniques, Ophthalmological", "Female", "Humans", "Iris Neoplasms", "Male", "Melanoma", "Middle Aged", "Nevus, Pigmented", "Retrospective Studies", "Tomography, Optical Coherence", "Ultrasonography", "Uveal Neoplasms", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84919329265", "SubjectAreas": [["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"], ["Sensory Systems", "NEUR", "2809"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"]], "AuthorData": {"9635133900": {"Name": "Hau S.C.", "AuthorID": "9635133900", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre in Ophthalmology, Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "36841094900": {"Name": "Papastefanou V.", "AuthorID": "36841094900", "AffiliationID": "60004093", "AffiliationName": "Ocular Oncology Service, St. Bartholomew's Hospital"}, "42062330600": {"Name": "Shah S.", "AuthorID": "42062330600", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre in Ophthalmology, Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57203054292": {"Name": "Sagoo M.S.", "AuthorID": "57203054292", "AffiliationID": "60013148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "6701811432": {"Name": "Restori M.", "AuthorID": "6701811432", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre in Ophthalmology, Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "54790539900": {"Name": "Cohen V.", "AuthorID": "54790539900", "AffiliationID": "60004093", "AffiliationName": "Ocular Oncology Service, St. Bartholomew's Hospital"}}}
