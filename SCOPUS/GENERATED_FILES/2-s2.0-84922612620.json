Each sample was produced in series from the mixing of an aqueous stream of basic zinc nitrate (and dopant ion or modifier) solution with a flow of superheated water (at 450 \u00b0C and 24.1 MPa), whereupon a crystalline nanoparticle slurry was rapidly formed. Each composition was collected in series, cleaned, freeze-dried, and then characterized using analytical methods, including powder X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area measurement, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and UV-vis spectrophotometry. Photocatalytic activity of the samples toward the decolorization of methylene blue dye was assessed, and the results revealed that transition metal dopants tended to reduce the photoactivity while rare earth ions, in general, increased the photocatalytic activity. In general, low dopant concentrations were more beneficial to having greater photodecolorization in all cases.", "AuthorKeywords": ["continuous hydrothermal", "doping", "photocatalytic activity", "UV attenuator", "zinc oxide"], "IndexKeywords": ["Catalysis", "Metals, Rare Earth", "Molecular Structure", "Nanostructures", "Particle Size", "Photochemical Processes", "Surface Properties", "Zinc Oxide"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84922612620", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"]], "AuthorData": {"25626260700": {"Name": "Goodall J.B.M.", "AuthorID": "25626260700", "AffiliationID": "60023254, 60170248", "AffiliationName": "UK Catalysis Hub, Research Complex at Harwell, Rutherford Appleton Laboratory"}, "55652047200": {"Name": "Makwana N.M.", "AuthorID": "55652047200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Christopher Ingold Laboratories, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "6603926697": {"Name": "Darr J.A.", "AuthorID": "6603926697", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Christopher Ingold Laboratories, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "16197461500": {"Name": "Illsley D.", "AuthorID": "16197461500", "AffiliationID": "60032665", "AffiliationName": "Sun Chemical"}, "23067554900": {"Name": "Lines R.", "AuthorID": "23067554900", "AffiliationID": "60032665", "AffiliationName": "Sun Chemical"}}}
