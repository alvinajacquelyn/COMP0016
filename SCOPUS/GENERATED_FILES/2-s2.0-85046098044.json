Can we learn the wrong lesson? And why do so many attempts to learn what works often fail? In this article, we provide three lessons. First, there are four different modes in which constellations of actors learn. Hence our propositions about learning are conditional on which of the four contexts we refer to. Second, policy learning does not just happen; there are specific hindrances and triggers. Thus, learning can be facilitated by knowing the mechanisms to activate and the likely obstacles. Third, learning itself is a conditional final aim: although the official aspiration of public organisations and politicians is to improve on public policy, policy learning can also be dysfunctional - for an organisation, a policy, a constellation of actors or even democracy.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Policy context", "Policy failure", "Policy learning", "Policy transfer", "translational reach"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85046098044", "SubjectAreas": [["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"], ["Public Administration", "SOCI", "3321"], ["Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law", "ENVI", "2308"]], "AuthorData": {"15925222700": {"Name": "Dunlop C.A.", "AuthorID": "15925222700", "AffiliationID": "60026479", "AffiliationName": "University of Exeter"}, "6701387604": {"Name": "Radaelli C.M.", "AuthorID": "6701387604", "AffiliationID": "60026479", "AffiliationName": "University of Exeter"}}}
