Alkylations use NaH in THF followed by addition of the ester of 6-bromohexanoic acid; no protection of the amidic NH group is necessary. By this means, carboxylic acid, ester, amide, hydroxymethyl and 2-benzimidazolyl branching units have been appended to the SAHA backbone. Routes to vary one of the branching units at a time have been developed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alkylation", "Histone deacetylase inhibitors", "Malonamic esters", "Suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid", "Trifunctional compounds"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85000692256", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Drug Discovery", "PHAR", "3002"], ["Organic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1605"]], "AuthorData": {"15750333700": {"Name": "Dines J.", "AuthorID": "15750333700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London, Christopher Ingold Laboratories"}, "7007056698": {"Name": "Marson C.", "AuthorID": "7007056698", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London, Christopher Ingold Laboratories"}}}
