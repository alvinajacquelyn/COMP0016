We define the relation \u221e=, a notion of infinitary equational reasoning, and \u2192\u221e, the standard notion of infinitary rewriting as follows: \u221e=:= \u03bdR. (=R \u224a R)\u2192\u221e := \u03bcR. \u03bdS.(\u2192R \u224a R)o S where \u03bc and \u03bd are the least and greatest fixed-point operators, respectively, and where R := {f(s1, . . . , sn), f(t1, . . . , tn) f\u2208\u2211 s1 R t1, . . . , snR tn } \u224a Id . The setup captures rewrite sequences of arbitrary ordinal length, but it has neither the need for ordinals nor for metric convergence. This makes the framework especially suitable for formalizations in theorem provers.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Coinduction", "Infinitary rewriting"], "IndexKeywords": ["Coinduction", "Equational reasoning", "Greatest fixed points", "Infinitary", "Infinitary rewriting", "Theorem provers"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": null, "EID": "2-s2.0-84958958809", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"]], "AuthorData": {"14831171200": {"Name": "Endrullis J.", "AuthorID": "14831171200", "AffiliationID": "60008734", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, VU University Amsterdam"}, "16444186700": {"Name": "Hendriks D.", "AuthorID": "16444186700", "AffiliationID": "60008734", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, VU University Amsterdam"}, "8367117800": {"Name": "Hansen H.", "AuthorID": "8367117800", "AffiliationID": "60006288", "AffiliationName": "Department of Engineering Systems and Services, Delft University of Technology"}, "55794626600": {"Name": "Polonsky A.", "AuthorID": "55794626600", "AffiliationID": "60008433, 60009647", "AffiliationName": "Institut Galil\u00e9e, Universit\u00e9 Paris 13"}, "23398564400": {"Name": "Silva A.", "AuthorID": "23398564400", "AffiliationID": "60016529", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, Radboud University Nijmegen"}}}
