This review summarizes the pharmacological and behavioral options for managing constipation and details the management of refractory constipation. Refractory constipation is defined as an inadequate improvement in constipation symptoms evaluated with an objective scale despite adequate therapy (ie, pharmacological and/or behavioral) that is based on the underlying pathophysiology of constipation. Minimally invasive (ie, rectal irrigation and percutaneous endoscopic colostomy) and surgical therapies are used to manage refractory constipation. This review appraises these options, and in particular, percutaneous endoscopic colostomy, which as detailed by an article in this issue, is a less invasive option for managing refractory constipation than surgery. While these options benefit some patients, the evidence of the risk: benefit profile for these therapies is limited.", "AuthorKeywords": ["PEC", "rectal irrigation", "refractory constipation", "surgery"], "IndexKeywords": ["Colostomy", "Constipation", "Endoscopy", "Humans", "Therapeutic Irrigation", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85046005571", "SubjectAreas": [["Physiology", "BIOC", "1314"], ["Endocrine and Autonomic Systems", "NEUR", "2807"], ["Gastroenterology", "MEDI", "2715"]], "AuthorData": {"55928951300": {"Name": "Wilkinson-Smith V.", "AuthorID": "55928951300", "AffiliationID": "60025016, 60172935, 60015138, 60172638", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health Research, Nottingham Digestive Diseases Biomedical Research Centre, Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust, University of Nottingham"}, "6701559226": {"Name": "Corsetti M.", "AuthorID": "6701559226", "AffiliationID": "60025016, 60172935, 60015138, 60172638", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health Research, Nottingham Digestive Diseases Biomedical Research Centre, Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust, University of Nottingham"}, "7004518505": {"Name": "Bharucha A.E.", "AuthorID": "7004518505", "AffiliationID": "60005558", "AffiliationName": "Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Mayo Clinic"}, "7003781894": {"Name": "Emmanuel A.", "AuthorID": "7003781894", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "GI Physiology Unit, University College London Hospital"}, "26643431700": {"Name": "Knowles C.", "AuthorID": "26643431700", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Blizard Institute, Barts & the London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London"}, "8913055900": {"Name": "Yiannakou Y.", "AuthorID": "8913055900", "AffiliationID": "60015208", "AffiliationName": "University Hospital of North Durham"}}}
