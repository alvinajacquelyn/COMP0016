TheWYLLoT line list spans two electronic states X 1\u03a3 + and A1\u03a0. A diabatic model is used to model the shallow potential energy curve of the A1\u03a0 state, which has a strong pre-dissociative character with only two bound vibrational states. Both potential energy curves are empirical and were obtained by fitting to experimentally derived energies of the X 1\u03a3 + and A1\u03a0 electronic states using the diatomic nuclear motion codes DPOTFIT and DUO. High-temperature line lists plus partition functions and lifetimes for three isotopologues 27AlH, 27AlD, and 26AlH were generated using ab initio dipole moments. The line lists cover both the X-X and A-X systems and are made available in electronic form at the CDS and EXOMOL data bases.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Astronomical data bases: miscellaneous", "Molecular data", "Opacity", "Planets and satellites: atmospheres", "Stars: low-mass"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85055169974", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"35605893200": {"Name": "Yurchenko S.N.", "AuthorID": "35605893200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "55113290800": {"Name": "Williams H.", "AuthorID": "55113290800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "57205632204": {"Name": "Leyland P.C.", "AuthorID": "57205632204", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "23486133800": {"Name": "Lodi L.", "AuthorID": "23486133800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "7101645601": {"Name": "Tennyson J.", "AuthorID": "7101645601", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}}}
