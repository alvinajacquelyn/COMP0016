Relatively high maternal mortality in developing countries has been linked to high HIV prevalence rates in these countries. Several studies have shown that women living with HIV are more vulnerable and are thus more likely to die during maternity than those who are not. Although there has been increased focus on this subject in contemporary research, the relationship between HIV status and maternal-care-utilization is not very well understood. It is not clear whether factors associated with professional maternal care utilization during antenatal, delivery and postnatal periods are similar for HIV positive and HIV negative women. It is also not known whether being HIV positive has an impact on the choice of care (professional care or traditional birth attendants). Thus the aim of this study is to investigate the differences in factors affecting choice of care during antenatal, delivery and postnatal periods between HIV positive and HIV negative women. We also investigate the effect of HIV positive status on choice of care. Methods: By using the 2013-2014 Zambia Demographic Health Survey Data (ZDHS), we performed two different quantitative analyses. a) Regression analysis: to identify and compare factors associated with the likelihood of utilizing professional care during antenatal, at birth and postnatal periods between HIV positive and HIV negative women. b) Propensity score matching: to investigate the effect of being HIV positive on the choice of care (Professional care or TBAs). Results: Our results show that reasons for choosing professional care during antenatal, at birth, and postnatal periods are the same for both HIV positive and HIV negative women. Further, we also showed that although the probability of utilizing professional care is slightly higher for HIV positive women, the difference is negligible. Conclusion: We demonstrated that in Zambia, utilization of professional care among HIV positive women is not particularly high. We also demonstrate that although institutional care is desirable and an ideal solution for HIV positive women, insisting on institutional care when the health facilities lack adequate trained personnel, drugs, and equipment is counterproductive.", "AuthorKeywords": ["HIV", "Maternal health", "Skilled attendants", "Traditional birth attendants"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Choice Behavior", "Delivery, Obstetric", "Demography", "Female", "HIV", "HIV Infections", "Humans", "Maternal Health Services", "Midwifery", "Patient Acceptance of Health Care", "Postnatal Care", "Pregnancy", "Pregnancy Complications, Infectious", "Prenatal Care", "Regression Analysis", "Young Adult", "Zambia"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85064382834", "SubjectAreas": [["Obstetrics and Gynecology", "MEDI", "2729"]], "AuthorData": {"56884699800": {"Name": "Muzyamba C.", "AuthorID": "56884699800", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "39962954400": {"Name": "Tomini S.M.", "AuthorID": "39962954400", "AffiliationID": "60000964", "AffiliationName": "Department of Economics, University of Liege"}, "54907416400": {"Name": "Groot W.", "AuthorID": "54907416400", "AffiliationID": "60018869", "AffiliationName": "Top Institute for Evidence-Based Education Research (TIER), Maastricht University"}, "7102023269": {"Name": "Pavlova M.", "AuthorID": "7102023269", "AffiliationID": "60007895, 60018869", "AffiliationName": "Department of Health Services Research, CAPHRI, Maastricht University Medical Center, Faculty of Health, Medicine and Life Sciences, Maastricht University"}}}
