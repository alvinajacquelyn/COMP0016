In Montreal in the late 1950s, a team of physicians led by J.A.P. Par\u00e9 investigated this family for inherited cardiovascular disease. Their efforts resulted in an extensive and now classic description of familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. A quarter of a century later, the same family was the subject of linkage analysis and direct sequencing, culminating in the isolation of a mutation in the gene encoding the \u03b2 myosin heavy chain. MYH7 was the first gene implicated in a cardiovascular disease, which paved the way for identification of mutations in other heritable disorders, mechanistic studies, and clinical applications, such as predictive testing. The present era of cardiovascular genomics arguably had its inception in the clinical observations of Dr Par\u00e9 and his colleagues more than 50 years ago.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Cardiovascular Diseases", "Genetics, Medical", "History, 20th Century", "History, 21st Century", "Humans", "Quebec"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84945297322", "SubjectAreas": [["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"9234388900": {"Name": "Sen-Chowdhry S.", "AuthorID": "9234388900", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology, Imperial College"}, "56672467900": {"Name": "McKenna W.", "AuthorID": "56672467900", "AffiliationID": "60072743", "AffiliationName": "Heart Hospital, Hamad Medical Corporation"}}}
