We used a conductive atomic force microscope to etch through devices while measuring current, allowing us to produce tomograms of conductive filaments. To our knowledge this is the first report of such measurements in an intrinsic resistance switching material.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Conductive atomic force microscopes", "Conductive filaments", "Filamentary conduction", "Intrinsic resistance", "Resistive rams", "Silicon rich", "Silicon sub oxides"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84946142349", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"]], "AuthorData": {"56500553700": {"Name": "Buckwell M.", "AuthorID": "56500553700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "56500320100": {"Name": "Montesi L.", "AuthorID": "56500320100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "55390092200": {"Name": "Hudziak S.", "AuthorID": "55390092200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "55236732600": {"Name": "Mehonic A.", "AuthorID": "55236732600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "7005715736": {"Name": "Kenyon A.J.", "AuthorID": "7005715736", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}}}
