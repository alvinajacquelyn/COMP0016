The survey was conducted in two stages; initially online, advertised via social media, and then repeated via face-to-face interviews with runners registered for the 2015 London Marathon. 789 participants responded to the online survey, and 1073 completed the survey at the marathon. HMB was reported by half of those online (54%), and by more than a third of the marathon runners (36%). Surprisingly, HMB was also prevalent amongst elite athletes (37%). Overall, 32% of exercising females reported a history of anemia, and 50% had previously supplemented with iron. Only a minority (22%) had sought medical advice. HMB is highly prevalent in exercising females, associated with self-reported anemia, increased use of iron supplementation and a perceived negative impact on performance. Further research is needed to investigate the impact of HMB, iron deficiency and anemia in exercising females.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Anemia", "Athletes", "Female", "Humans", "Iron", "Menorrhagia", "Prevalence", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84960539378", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"57164808300": {"Name": "Bruinvels G.", "AuthorID": "57164808300", "AffiliationID": "60026186", "AffiliationName": "Orreco Ltd, Institute of Technology"}, "56427569500": {"Name": "Richards T.", "AuthorID": "56427569500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Surgery and Interventional Science, University College London"}, "55953414200": {"Name": "Burden R.", "AuthorID": "55953414200", "AffiliationID": "60107252", "AffiliationName": "English Institute of Sport"}, "55700961400": {"Name": "Brown N.", "AuthorID": "55700961400", "AffiliationID": "60108766", "AffiliationName": "School of Sport, Health and Applied Science, St Mary's University"}, "8502823700": {"Name": "Pedlar C.", "AuthorID": "8502823700", "AffiliationID": "60026186", "AffiliationName": "Orreco Ltd, Institute of Technology"}}}
