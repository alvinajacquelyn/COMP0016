We examined whether chronic diseases and social risk factors (poverty, divorce, and perceived lack of emotional support) are differently associated with somatic and cognitive/affective symptoms of depression. Methods: Cross-sectional analyses were based on individual-level data from the 31,191 participants of six cross-sectional U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) carried out between 2005 and 2016. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire. Information on chronic diseases and social risk factors was self-reported by participants. Results: After adjustment for sex, age, race/ethnicity, and all the of other symptoms besides the outcome symptom, higher number of chronic diseases was independently related to fatigue, psychomotor retardation/agitation, and sleep problems in a dose-response pattern (range of odds ratios: 1.21 to 2.59). Except for concentration problems, social risk factors were associated with almost all of the cognitive/affective symptoms (range of odds ratios: 1.02 to 2.09) but only sporadically with somatic symptoms. Limitations: All measures were self-reported by the participants, which may have introduced bias to the associations. Cross-sectional data did not allow us to study temporal dynamics. Conclusions: Specific symptoms of depression may be useful in characterizing the heterogeneous etiology of depression with respect to somatic versus social risk factors.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Depressive symptoms", "Disease", "Heterogeneity", "Network", "Risk factors", "Symptomics"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Chronic Disease", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Depression", "Depressive Disorder", "Fatigue", "Female", "Humans", "Logistic Models", "Male", "Nutrition Surveys", "Patient Health Questionnaire", "Risk Factors", "Self Report", "Sleep Wake Disorders", "Social Support", "Sociological Factors", "United States"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85063500211", "SubjectAreas": [["Clinical Psychology", "PSYC", "3203"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"16030844400": {"Name": "Jokela M.", "AuthorID": "16030844400", "AffiliationID": "60029080, 60002952", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology and Logopedics, Faculty of Medicine, University of Helsinki"}, "57191631137": {"Name": "Garc\u00eda-Vel\u00e1zquez R.", "AuthorID": "57191631137", "AffiliationID": "60029080, 60002952", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology and Logopedics, Faculty of Medicine, University of Helsinki"}, "56638061400": {"Name": "Airaksinen J.", "AuthorID": "56638061400", "AffiliationID": "60029080, 60002952", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology and Logopedics, Faculty of Medicine, University of Helsinki"}, "57191978592": {"Name": "Gluschkoff K.", "AuthorID": "57191978592", "AffiliationID": "60029080, 60002952", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology and Logopedics, Faculty of Medicine, University of Helsinki"}, "35811217200": {"Name": "Rosenstr\u00f6m T.", "AuthorID": "35811217200", "AffiliationID": "60011916", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mental Disorders, Norwegian Institute of Public Health"}, "7004391239": {"Name": "Kivim\u00e4ki M.", "AuthorID": "7004391239", "AffiliationID": "60029080, 60002952", "AffiliationName": "Clinicum, Faculty of Medicine, University of Helsinki"}}}
