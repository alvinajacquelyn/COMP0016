A few studies have suggested that deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN-DBS) could improve olfactory function. Our aim was to evaluate the acute effect of bilateral STN-DBS on a commonly used smell test in PD patients. Methods: Fifteen PD patients who underwent bilateral STN-DBS and 15 controls were recruited. Patients and controls were tested for odor identification. Results: No statistical differences were documented between ON and OFF STN-DBS acute stimulation concerning olfaction. Controls presented a better performance for olfactory identification than patients. Conclusions: Our exploratory study did not support that bilateral STN-DBS could have an acute effect on olfactory function in PD patients.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Deep brain stimulation", "Odor identification", "Parkinson's disease"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Deep Brain Stimulation", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Odors", "Olfactory Perception", "Parkinson Disease", "Subthalamic Nucleus", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84923082024", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"26649410400": {"Name": "Fabbri M.", "AuthorID": "26649410400", "AffiliationID": "60021283, 60106051", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Pharmacology Unit, Faculty of Medicine, Instituto de Medicina Molecular, University of Lisbon"}, "16636262200": {"Name": "Guedes L.C.", "AuthorID": "16636262200", "AffiliationID": "60021283, 60106051", "AffiliationName": "Neurological Clinic Research Unit, Faculty of Medicine, Instituto de Medicina Molecular, University of Lisbon"}, "7101666975": {"Name": "Coelho M.", "AuthorID": "7101666975", "AffiliationID": "60021283, 60106051", "AffiliationName": "Neurological Clinic Research Unit, Faculty of Medicine, Instituto de Medicina Molecular, University of Lisbon"}, "57078733000": {"Name": "Sim\u00e3o D.", "AuthorID": "57078733000", "AffiliationID": "60021283, 60106051", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Pharmacology Unit, Faculty of Medicine, Instituto de Medicina Molecular, University of Lisbon"}, "56054811100": {"Name": "Abreu D.", "AuthorID": "56054811100", "AffiliationID": "60021283, 60106051", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Pharmacology Unit, Faculty of Medicine, Instituto de Medicina Molecular, University of Lisbon"}, "17136311500": {"Name": "Rosa M.M.", "AuthorID": "17136311500", "AffiliationID": "60021696, 60106051", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Faculty of Medicine, University of Lisbon"}, "7403252466": {"Name": "Ferreira J.J.", "AuthorID": "7403252466", "AffiliationID": "60021696, 60106051", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Faculty of Medicine, University of Lisbon"}, "24345092400": {"Name": "Silveira-Moriyama L.", "AuthorID": "24345092400", "AffiliationID": "60115564, 60019953", "AffiliationName": "Reta Lila Weston Institute of Neurological Studies, UCL Institute of Neurology"}}}
