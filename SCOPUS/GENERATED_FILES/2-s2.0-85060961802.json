Little is known about the neural and behavioral presentations of theory-of-mind deficits in schizophrenia, shortly after the first episode of psychosis. Methods We investigated social cognition in 17 recently diagnosed first-episode schizophrenia (FES) patients with little or no exposure to antipsychotic medication and 1:1 matched healthy controls. We recorded behavioral and neural responses to the Animated Triangles Task (ATT), which is a nonverbal validated mentalizing task that measures the ascription of intentionality to the movements of objects. Results FES patients under-interpreted social cues and over-interpreted nonsocial cues. These effects were influenced by current intelligence (IQ). Control group and FES neural responses replicated earlier findings in healthy adults. However, a region of anterior medial prefrontal cortex (amPFC) of FES patients showed a different response pattern to that of controls. Unlike healthy controls, patients increased activity in this social cognition region while studying \"random\" movements of shapes, as compared to the study of movements normally interpreted as \"intentional\". Conclusions Mentalizing deficits in FES consists of hypo- and hypermentalizing. The neural pattern of FES patients is consistent with deficits in the ability to switch off mentalizing processes in potentially social contexts, instead increasing them when intentionality is not forthcoming. Overall, results demonstrate complexities of theory of mind deficits in schizophrenia that should be considered when offering social cognitive training programs.", "AuthorKeywords": ["first-episode schizophrenia", "fMRI", "hypermentalizing", "hypomentalizing", "social cognition", "theory of mind"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Brain Mapping", "Female", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Motion Perception", "Pattern Recognition, Visual", "Prefrontal Cortex", "Schizophrenia", "Social Perception", "Theory of Mind", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85060961802", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"56009044400": {"Name": "Bliksted V.", "AuthorID": "56009044400", "AffiliationID": "60029616", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Medicine, Aarhus University"}, "7004340416": {"Name": "Emborg C.", "AuthorID": "7004340416", "AffiliationID": "60023882", "AffiliationName": "Psychosis Research Unit, Aarhus University Hospital, Risskov"}, "7005652976": {"Name": "Simonsen A.", "AuthorID": "7005652976", "AffiliationID": "60029616", "AffiliationName": "Interacting Minds Centre, Aarhus University"}, "7005312471": {"Name": "Roepstorff A.", "AuthorID": "7005312471", "AffiliationID": "60029616", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Medicine, Aarhus University"}, "36051252900": {"Name": "Frith C.", "AuthorID": "36051252900", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60084279", "AffiliationName": "Leopold M\u00fcller Functional Imaging Laboratory, Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, University College London"}, "7004524964": {"Name": "Videbech P.", "AuthorID": "7004524964", "AffiliationID": "117789084", "AffiliationName": "Mental Health Centre Glostrup"}, "6603414112": {"Name": "Fagerlund B.", "AuthorID": "6603414112", "AffiliationID": "114153605", "AffiliationName": "Lundbeck Foundation Centre for Clinical Intervention and Neuropsychiatric Schizophrenia Research, Mental Health Centre Glostrup"}, "6503964713": {"Name": "Campbell-Meiklejohn D.", "AuthorID": "6503964713", "AffiliationID": "60017317", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, University of Sussex"}}}
