The instability of elliptical bubbles and their evolution toward a stable circular boundary, with speed twice that of the fluid speed at infinity, is studied numerically and by stability analysis. Numerical simulations of bubbles demonstrate that the important role played by singularities of the Schwarz function of the bubble boundary in determining the evolution of the bubble. When the singularity lies close to the initial bubble, two types of topological change are observed: (i) bubble splitting into multiple bubbles and (ii) a finite fluid blob pinching off inside the bubble region.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["A-stable", "Circular boundaries", "Finite fluid", "Fluid speed", "Hele-Shaw cells", "Stability analysis", "Topological changes"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84923827968", "SubjectAreas": [["Computational Mechanics", "ENGI", "2206"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Mechanics of Materials", "ENGI", "2211"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"], ["Fluid Flow and Transfer Processes", "CENG", "1507"]], "AuthorData": {"57214987902": {"Name": "Khalid A.H.", "AuthorID": "57214987902", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University College London"}, "56846884500": {"Name": "McDonald N.R.", "AuthorID": "56846884500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University College London"}, "7005594518": {"Name": "Vanden-Broeck J.M.", "AuthorID": "7005594518", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University College London"}}}
