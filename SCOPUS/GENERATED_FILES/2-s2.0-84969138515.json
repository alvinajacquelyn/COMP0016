Methods: This is a population-based cross-sectional study among adults in 24 communities from Zambia and the Western Cape (WC) province of South Africa. Diabetes is defined as a random blood glucose concentration (RBG) \u2265 11.1 mmol/L, or RBG < 11.1 mmol/L but with a self-reported prior diabetes diagnosis. For individuals with a prior diagnosis of diabetes, RBG < 7.8 mmol/L was considered to be an acceptable level of glycaemia. Results: Among 45,767 Zambian and 12,496 WC participants the age-standardised prevalence of diabetes was 3.5% and 7.2% respectively. The highest risk groups identified were those of older age and those with obesity. Of those identified to have diabetes, 34.5% in Zambia and 12.7% in WC were previously unaware of their diagnosis. Among Zambian participants with diabetes, this proportion was lower among individuals with better education or with higher household socio-economic position. Of all those with previously diagnosed diabetes, 66.0% in Zambia and 59.4% in WC were not on any diabetes treatment, and 34.4% in Zambia and 32.7% in WC had a RBG concentration beyond the recommended level, \u22657.8 mmol/L. Conclusions: The diabetes risk factor profile for our study communities is similar to that seen in high-income populations. A high proportion of individuals with diabetes are not on diabetes treatment and of those on treatment a high proportion have high glycaemic concentrations. Such data may assist in healthcare planning to ensure timely diagnosis and management of diabetes.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cross-sectional study", "Epidemiology", "Southern Africa"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Blood Glucose", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Diabetes Mellitus", "Disease Management", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Prevalence", "Risk Assessment", "Risk Factors", "South Africa", "Young Adult", "Zambia"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84969138515", "SubjectAreas": [["Internal Medicine", "MEDI", "2724"], ["Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism", "MEDI", "2712"], ["Endocrinology", "BIOC", "1310"]], "AuthorData": {"36727094700": {"Name": "Bailey S.L.", "AuthorID": "36727094700", "AffiliationID": "60001565", "AffiliationName": "Desmond Tutu TB Centre, Department of Paediatrics and Child Health, Stellenbosch University"}, "6601965064": {"Name": "Ayles H.", "AuthorID": "6601965064", "AffiliationID": "60138864", "AffiliationName": "Zambart"}, "7006557168": {"Name": "Godfrey-Faussett P.", "AuthorID": "7006557168", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "LSHTM TB Centre and Department of Clinical Research, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "13003225800": {"Name": "Muyoyeta M.", "AuthorID": "13003225800", "AffiliationID": "60138864", "AffiliationName": "Zambart"}, "7005690052": {"Name": "Beyers N.", "AuthorID": "7005690052", "AffiliationID": "60001565", "AffiliationName": "Desmond Tutu TB Centre, Department of Paediatrics and Child Health, Stellenbosch University"}, "49461182300": {"Name": "du Toit E.", "AuthorID": "49461182300", "AffiliationID": "60001565", "AffiliationName": "Desmond Tutu TB Centre, Department of Paediatrics and Child Health, Stellenbosch University"}, "24728579800": {"Name": "Yudkin J.S.", "AuthorID": "24728579800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "7005201405": {"Name": "Floyd S.", "AuthorID": "7005201405", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "LSHTM TB Centre and Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}}}
