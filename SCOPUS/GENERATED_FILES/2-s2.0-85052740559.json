Studying the dynamical organization of macroscopic variability in terms of geomagnetic activity index data by means of complexity measures provides a promising approach for identifying the underlying processes and associated time scales. Here, we apply a suite of characteristics from recurrence quantification analysis (RQA) and recurrence network analysis (RNA) in order to unveil some key nonlinear features of the hourly Disturbance storm-time (Dst) index during periods with magnetic storms and such of normal variability. Our results demonstrate that recurrence-based measures can serve as excellent tracers for changes in the dynamical complexity along non-stationary records of geomagnetic activity. In particular, trapping time (characterizing the typical length of \"laminar phases\" in the observed dynamics) and recurrence network transitivity (associated with the number of the system's effective dynamical degrees of freedom) allow for a very good discrimination between magnetic storm and quiescence phases. In general, some RQA and RNA characteristics distinguish between storm and non-storm times equally well or even better than other previously considered nonlinear characteristics like Hurst exponent or symbolic dynamics based entropy concepts. Our results point to future potentials of recurrence characteristics for unveiling temporal changes in the dynamical complexity of the magnetosphere.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85052740559", "SubjectAreas": [["Statistical and Nonlinear Physics", "PHYS", "3109"], ["Mathematical Physics", "MATH", "2610"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"23396313000": {"Name": "Donner R.V.", "AuthorID": "23396313000", "AffiliationID": "60025182", "AffiliationName": "Research Domain IV - Transdisciplinary Concepts and Methods, Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research"}, "56252491400": {"Name": "Stolbova V.", "AuthorID": "56252491400", "AffiliationID": "60025858", "AffiliationName": "Center of Economic Research, ETH Zurich"}, "35317963900": {"Name": "Kurths J.", "AuthorID": "35317963900", "AffiliationID": "60015875, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Complex Systems and Mathematical Biology, University of Aberdeen, King's College"}, "6506101367": {"Name": "Balasis G.", "AuthorID": "6506101367", "AffiliationID": "60011619", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Astronomy, Astrophysics, Space Applications and Remote Sensing, National Observatory of Athens"}, "55542290900": {"Name": "Georgiou M.", "AuthorID": "55542290900", "AffiliationID": "60084281, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Mullard Space Science Laboratory, Department of Space and Climate Physics, University College London"}, "30867559100": {"Name": "Donges J.F.", "AuthorID": "30867559100", "AffiliationID": "60028378", "AffiliationName": "Stockholm Resilience Centre, Stockholm University"}, "6508301983": {"Name": "Potirakis S.M.", "AuthorID": "6508301983", "AffiliationID": "60110806", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, University of West Attica, Campus 2"}}}
