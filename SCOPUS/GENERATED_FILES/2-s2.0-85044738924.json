In this Brief Communication, we present the effects of internal dynamics of one n-heptane molecule which are controlling chemical kinetics of hydrogen abstraction reactions through multi-pathway reaction dynamics. It is established that the slope of Arrhenius plots dramatically changes in comparison with the harmonic single static pathway approach in the temperature range of 200\u20133000 K. We apply a combination of the multiple conformation statistical thermodynamic approach and variational transition-state theory (VTST) to obtain dynamic multi-path rate coefficients (kMP-T-VTST and kMP-LH-VTST). Compared with single-path VTST (kSP-H-VTST) results, the thermal reaction rate coefficients obtained from our MP-VTST calculations differ considerably due to the fact that tunnelling and cross-conformational effects in the reactions, and the anharmonic and quasi-harmonic contributions in multiple conformer molecules cannot be ignored or simplified.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Conformational changes", "Multi-pathway reactions", "Multi-structural statistical thermodynamics theory", "Reaction rate coefficients", "Transition state theory"], "IndexKeywords": ["Conformational change", "Multi-pathway reactions", "Multi-structural statistical thermodynamics theory", "Reaction rate coefficients", "Transition state theories"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85044738924", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"], ["Fuel Technology", "ENER", "2103"], ["Energy Engineering and Power Technology", "ENER", "2102"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"57195972735": {"Name": "Nasiri R.", "AuthorID": "57195972735", "AffiliationID": "60003215", "AffiliationName": "Gas Purification Technology Group, Gas Research Division, Research Institute of Petroleum Industry (RIPI)"}, "7102436109": {"Name": "Luo K.H.", "AuthorID": "7102436109", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}}}
