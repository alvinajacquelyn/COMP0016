Animal and human challenge studies and observational studies suggest T cells protect against disease among those infected, but the impact of T-cell immunity at the population level is unknown. Objectives: To investigate whether naturally preexisting T-cell responses targeting highly conserved internal influenza proteins could provide cross-protective immunity against pandemic and seasonal influenza. Methods: We quantified influenza A(H3N2) virus-specific T cells in a population cohort during seasonal and pandemic periods between 2006 and 2010. Follow-up included paired serology, symptom reporting, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) investigation of symptomatic cases. Measurements and Main Results: A total of 1,414 unvaccinated individuals had baseline T-cell measurements (1,703 participant observation sets). T-cell responses to A(H3N2) virus nucleoprotein (NP) dominated and strongly cross-reacted with A(H1N1)pdm09 NP (P < 0.001) in participants lacking antibody to A(H1N1)pdm09. Comparison of paired preseason and postseason sera (1,431 sets) showed 205 (14%) had evidence of infection based on fourfold influenza antibody titer rises. The presence of NP-specific T cells before exposure to virus correlated with less symptomatic, PCR-positive influenza A (overall adjusted odds ratio, 0.27; 95% confidence interval, 0.11-0.68; P = 0.005,during pandemic [P = 0.047] and seasonal [P = 0.049] periods). Protection was independent of baseline antibodies. Influenza-specific T-cell responses were detected in 43%, indicating a substantial population impact. Conclusions: Naturally occurring cross-protective T-cell immunity protects against symptomatic PCR-confirmed disease in those with evidence of infection and helps to explain why many infections do not cause symptoms. Vaccines stimulating T cells may provide important cross-protective immunity.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cellular immunity", "Cohort studies", "T lymphocytes"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Cohort Studies", "England", "Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay", "Female", "Flow Cytometry", "Follow-Up Studies", "Humans", "Influenza A Virus, H3N2 Subtype", "Influenza, Human", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Pandemics", "Polymerase Chain Reaction", "Seasons", "T-Lymphocytes", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84938498248", "SubjectAreas": [["Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine", "MEDI", "2740"], ["Critical Care and Intensive Care Medicine", "MEDI", "2706"]], "AuthorData": {"35944648500": {"Name": "Hayward A.C.", "AuthorID": "35944648500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infectious Disease Informatics, Farr Institute of Health Informatics Research, University College London"}, "57199426537": {"Name": "Fragaszy E.B.", "AuthorID": "57199426537", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "57217890130": {"Name": "Dukes O.", "AuthorID": "57217890130", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infectious Disease Informatics, Farr Institute of Health Informatics Research, University College London"}, "57204001775": {"Name": "Wang L.", "AuthorID": "57204001775", "AffiliationID": "60001633, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Oxford"}, "6506006823": {"Name": "Goonetilleke N.", "AuthorID": "6506006823", "AffiliationID": "60025111", "AffiliationName": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"}, "35393992100": {"Name": "McMichael A.J.", "AuthorID": "35393992100", "AffiliationID": "60001633, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Oxford"}, "55670555700": {"Name": "Millett E.R.C.", "AuthorID": "55670555700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Infection and Population Health, University College London"}, "6603224221": {"Name": "Bermingham A.", "AuthorID": "6603224221", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "Respiratory Virus Unit, Centre for Infections, Public Health England"}, "7006818684": {"Name": "Zambon M.", "AuthorID": "7006818684", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "Respiratory Virus Unit, Centre for Infections, Public Health England"}, "7003490365": {"Name": "Copas A.", "AuthorID": "7003490365", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Infection and Population Health, University College London"}, "55617668400": {"Name": "Johnson A.M.", "AuthorID": "55617668400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Infection and Population Health, University College London"}, "55334594200": {"Name": "Nazareth I.", "AuthorID": "55334594200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Primary Care and Population Health, University College London"}, "7003371567": {"Name": "Nguyen-Van-Tam J.S.", "AuthorID": "7003371567", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "Health Protection and Influenza Research Group, Division of Epidemiology and Public Health, University of Nottingham"}, "35398561000": {"Name": "Watson J.M.", "AuthorID": "35398561000", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Department of Health"}, "null": {"Name": null, "AuthorID": null, "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
