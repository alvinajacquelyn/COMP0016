Employing single-genome amplification as well as bulk PCR, cloning and sequencing strategies, we evaluated the genetic properties of HIV-1 subtype C env in 16 antiretroviral therapy-naive study participants with CM. Eleven of the 16 participants had matched blood plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) evaluated, with the rest having either a plasma or CSF sample evaluated. Before antiretroviral therapy initiation, matched plasma and CSF-derived env sequences of all 11 participants displayed genetic intermixing between the two compartments. Overall, 7 of the 16 (\u223c43.8%) participants harbored CXCR4-using variants in plasma and/or CSF, according to coreceptor usage prediction algorithms. This study suggests that HIV-1 subtype C genetic intermixing between peripheral blood and the central nervous system is common in individuals presenting with CM, and that CXCR4 usage is present in one or both compartments in approximately 44% of individuals.", "AuthorKeywords": ["cerebrospinal fluid", "cryptococcal meningitis", "HIV-1", "plasma"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Cerebrospinal Fluid", "Cloning, Molecular", "env Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus", "Female", "Genetic Variation", "Genotype", "HIV Infections", "HIV-1", "Humans", "Male", "Meningitis, Cryptococcal", "Middle Aged", "Plasma", "Polymerase Chain Reaction", "Prevalence", "Prospective Studies", "Receptors, CXCR4", "Sequence Analysis, DNA", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85049410292", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"], ["Virology", "IMMU", "2406"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"57195664398": {"Name": "Sojane K.", "AuthorID": "57195664398", "AffiliationID": "60017135, 60010499", "AffiliationName": "HIV Pathogenesis Programme, Doris Duke Medical Research Institute, Nelson R Mandela School of Medicine, University of KwaZulu-Natal"}, "6507350225": {"Name": "Kangethe R.T.", "AuthorID": "6507350225", "AffiliationID": "60017135, 60010499", "AffiliationName": "HIV Pathogenesis Programme, Doris Duke Medical Research Institute, Nelson R Mandela School of Medicine, University of KwaZulu-Natal"}, "6507164421": {"Name": "Ndung'U T.", "AuthorID": "6507164421", "AffiliationID": "60022344", "AffiliationName": "Max Planck Institute for Infection Biology"}, "56437792900": {"Name": "Chang C.C.", "AuthorID": "56437792900", "AffiliationID": "60019578, 60008014", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infectious Diseases, Alfred Hospital, Monash University"}, "15737239300": {"Name": "Lewin S.R.", "AuthorID": "15737239300", "AffiliationID": "60026553, 60117340, 60005245", "AffiliationName": "Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity, University of Melbourne, Royal Melbourne Hospital"}, "22954256100": {"Name": "Moosa M.Y.S.", "AuthorID": "22954256100", "AffiliationID": "60010499, 60003547", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infectious Diseases, King Edward VIII Hospital, University of KwaZulu-Natal"}, "7202594947": {"Name": "French M.A.", "AuthorID": "7202594947", "AffiliationID": "60030929, 60084490", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Immunology, Royal Perth Hospital, PathWest Laboratory Medicine"}}}
