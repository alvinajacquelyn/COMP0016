The new infrastructure supports daily data updates as well as fast, efficient querying and smoother navigation within and between pages. New pages for publications and genotypes provide routes to all data curated from a single source and to all phenotypes associated with a specific genotype, respectively. For ontology-based annotations, improved displays balance comprehensive data coverage with ease of use. The default view now uses ontology structure to provide a concise, non-redundant summary that can be expanded to reveal underlying details and metadata. The phenotype annotation display also offers filtering options to allow users to focus on specific areas of interest. An instance of the JBrowse genome browser has been integrated, facilitating loading of and intuitive access to, genomescale datasets. Taken together, the new data and pages, along with improvements in annotation display and querying, allow users to probe connections among different types of data to form a comprehensive view of fission yeast biology. The new PomBase implementation also provides a rich set of modular, reusable tools that can be deployed to create new, or enhance existing, organism-specific databases.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Databases, Genetic", "Genome, Fungal", "Internet", "Schizosaccharomyces", "Software", "User-Computer Interface"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85059798437", "SubjectAreas": [["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"]], "AuthorData": {"55250729700": {"Name": "Lock A.", "AuthorID": "55250729700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genetics, Evolution and Environment, University College London"}, "6603788294": {"Name": "B\u00e4hler J.", "AuthorID": "6603788294", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genetics, Evolution and Environment, University College London"}, "7007171631": {"Name": "Rutherford K.", "AuthorID": "7007171631", "AffiliationID": "60119931, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Cambridge Systems Biology Centre, Department of Biochemistry, University of Cambridge"}, "7404205832": {"Name": "Harris M.A.", "AuthorID": "7404205832", "AffiliationID": "60119931, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Cambridge Systems Biology Centre, Department of Biochemistry, University of Cambridge"}, "7202287996": {"Name": "Oliver S.G.", "AuthorID": "7202287996", "AffiliationID": "60119931, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Cambridge Systems Biology Centre, Department of Biochemistry, University of Cambridge"}, "7102296936": {"Name": "Wood V.", "AuthorID": "7102296936", "AffiliationID": "60119931, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Cambridge Systems Biology Centre, Department of Biochemistry, University of Cambridge"}, "6603666923": {"Name": "Hayles J.", "AuthorID": "6603666923", "AffiliationID": "60107285", "AffiliationName": "Cell Cycle Laboratory, Francis Crick Institute"}}}
