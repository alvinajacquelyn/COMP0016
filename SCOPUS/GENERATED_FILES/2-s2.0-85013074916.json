Special focus is put on the competing structural driving forces arising from the hydrophilic, lipophilic and fluorophilic side chains and the aromatic backbone of the polyphile. We observe a significant difference between the lipophilic and the fluorophilic side chains regarding their intramembrane distribution. While the lipophilic groups remain membrane-centered, the fluorophilic parts tend to orient toward the phosphate headgroups. This trend is important for understanding the influence of polyphile agents on the properties of phospholipid membranes. From a fundamental point of view, our computed distribution functions of the side chains are related to the interplay of sterical, enthalpic and entropic driving forces. Our findings illustrate the potential of rationally designed membrane additives which can be exploited to tune the properties of phospholipid membranes. \u00a9 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.", "AuthorKeywords": ["DPPC", "molecular dynamics", "perflourinated side chain", "polyphilic molecule", "transmembrane"], "IndexKeywords": ["Conformational space", "Dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine bilayers", "DPPC", "Driving forces", "Molecular dynamics simulations", "Phospholipid membrane", "Side-chains", "Transmembranes", "1,2-Dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine", "Alkanes", "Computer Simulation", "Fluorocarbons", "Hydrophobic and Hydrophilic Interactions", "Lipid Bilayers", "Molecular Conformation", "Molecular Dynamics Simulation", "Thermodynamics"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85013074916", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Computational Mathematics", "MATH", "2605"]], "AuthorData": {"56078941700": {"Name": "von Rudorff G.", "AuthorID": "56078941700", "AffiliationID": "60014059", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Chemistry, Martin-Luther-Universit\u00e4t Halle-Wittenberg"}, "37108661100": {"Name": "Watermann T.", "AuthorID": "37108661100", "AffiliationID": "60014059", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Chemistry, Martin-Luther-Universit\u00e4t Halle-Wittenberg"}, "55542294400": {"Name": "Guo X.", "AuthorID": "55542294400", "AffiliationID": "60014059", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Chemistry, Martin-Luther-Universit\u00e4t Halle-Wittenberg"}, "6603350206": {"Name": "Sebastiani D.", "AuthorID": "6603350206", "AffiliationID": "60014059", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Chemistry, Martin-Luther-Universit\u00e4t Halle-Wittenberg"}}}
