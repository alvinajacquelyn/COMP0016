In many empirical situations, however, modeling simultaneously two or more responses conditional on some covariates can be of considerable relevance. The scope of GAMLSS is extended by introducing bivariate copula models with continuous margins for the GAMLSS class. The proposed computational tool permits the copula dependence and marginal distribution parameters to be estimated simultaneously, and each parameter to be modeled using an additive predictor. Simultaneous parameter estimation is achieved within a penalized likelihood framework using a trust region algorithm with integrated automatic multiple smoothing parameter selection. The introduced approach allows for straightforward inclusion of potentially any parametric marginal distribution and copula function. The models can be easily used via the copulaReg() function in the R package SemiParBIVProbit. The proposal is illustrated through two case studies and simulated data.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Additive predictor", "Copula", "Marginal distribution", "Simultaneous parameter estimation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Computational tools", "Copula", "Generalized additive model", "Marginal distribution", "Penalized likelihood", "Response distribution", "Smoothing parameter", "Trust region algorithms"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85016506760", "SubjectAreas": [["Statistics and Probability", "MATH", "2613"], ["Computational Mathematics", "MATH", "2605"], ["Computational Theory and Mathematics", "COMP", "1703"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"36005147900": {"Name": "Marra G.", "AuthorID": "36005147900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Statistical Science, University College London"}, "23985987100": {"Name": "Radice R.", "AuthorID": "23985987100", "AffiliationID": "60009016, 60162130", "AffiliationName": "Department of Economics, Mathematics and Statistics, Birkbeck, University of London"}}}
