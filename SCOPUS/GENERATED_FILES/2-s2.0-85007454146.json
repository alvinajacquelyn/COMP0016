However, lack of controlled, scalable and directed assembly techniques for these hybrid systems, particularly the accurate assembly of nanoparticles (NPs) on nanowires (NWs), has resulted in their limited applications. In the present work, a development has been reported using dielectrophoresis (DEP) technique through which a controlled assembly of palladium (Pd) NPs on VO2 NWs has been deposited. Furthermore, modulation in conductivity of VO2 NWs as a function of the NPs density is electrically measured and interpreted through work-function dependent surface doping effect of the Pd NPs on VO2 NWs. This well-controlled and scalable approach to functionalize VO2 NWs by assembling Pd NPs is significant in the view of a huge potential of Pd NPs like sensor applications thus adding functionalities to VO2 NWs. Our approach can be generalized for the large-scale assembly of a variety of NP-NW combination to fabricate advanced functional hybrid devices.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Dielectrophoresis", "Hybrid devices", "Palladium nanoparticles", "Vanadium dioxide nanowires"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adding functionality", "Conductance control", "Controlled assembly", "Dielectrophoretic assembly", "Hybrid devices", "Palladium nanoparticles", "Sensor applications", "Vanadium dioxide"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85007454146", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"36838604200": {"Name": "Rathi S.", "AuthorID": "36838604200", "AffiliationID": "60007511", "AffiliationName": "School of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, Sungkyunkwan Advanced Institute of Nanotechnology (SAINT), Sungkyunkwan University"}, "54385413700": {"Name": "Kwak Y.", "AuthorID": "54385413700", "AffiliationID": "60007511", "AffiliationName": "School of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, Sungkyunkwan Advanced Institute of Nanotechnology (SAINT), Sungkyunkwan University"}, "57192702364": {"Name": "Jing L.", "AuthorID": "57192702364", "AffiliationID": "113880802", "AffiliationName": "Yanching Institute of Technology"}, "57210288630": {"Name": "Kim G.", "AuthorID": "57210288630", "AffiliationID": "60007511", "AffiliationName": "School of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, Sungkyunkwan Advanced Institute of Nanotechnology (SAINT), Sungkyunkwan University"}, "7102676898": {"Name": "Yi K.", "AuthorID": "7102676898", "AffiliationID": "60008783", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Pusan National University"}, "7006635116": {"Name": "Baik J.", "AuthorID": "7006635116", "AffiliationID": "60103153", "AffiliationName": "School of Mechanical and Advanced Materials Engineering, Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology (UNIST)"}}}
