The updated database includes additional structures that were contributed by CoRE MOF users, obtained from updates of the Cambridge Structural Database and a Web of Science search, and derived through semiautomated reconstruction of disordered structures using a topology-based crystal generator. In addition, value is added to the CoRE MOF database through new analyses that can speed up future nanoporous materials discovery activities, including open metal site detection and duplicate searches. Crystal structures (only for the subset that underwent significant changes during curation), pore analytics, and physical property data are included with the publicly available CoRE MOF 2019 database.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Additional structures", "Cambridge Structural Databases", "Curation", "Disordered structures", "Metal organic framework", "Metal sites", "Nano-porous materials", "Web of Science"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85063167547", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"]], "AuthorData": {"56508753200": {"Name": "Chung Y.G.", "AuthorID": "56508753200", "AffiliationID": "60008783", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, Pusan National University"}, "57209471700": {"Name": "Lee S.", "AuthorID": "57209471700", "AffiliationID": "60008783", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, Pusan National University"}, "36084467000": {"Name": "Haldoupis E.", "AuthorID": "36084467000", "AffiliationID": "60029445", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Chemical Theory Center, University of Minnesota"}, "55933504000": {"Name": "Vogiatzis K.D.", "AuthorID": "55933504000", "AffiliationID": "60015574", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Tennessee"}, "35458526300": {"Name": "Siepmann J.I.", "AuthorID": "35458526300", "AffiliationID": "60029445", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering and Materials Science, University of Minnesota"}, "54382924800": {"Name": "Bucior B.J.", "AuthorID": "54382924800", "AffiliationID": "60007363", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering, Northwestern University"}, "57192483317": {"Name": "Zhang H.", "AuthorID": "57192483317", "AffiliationID": "60007363", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering, Northwestern University"}, "7004265176": {"Name": "Snurr R.Q.", "AuthorID": "7004265176", "AffiliationID": "60007363", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering, Northwestern University"}, "7801540952": {"Name": "Haranczyk M.", "AuthorID": "7801540952", "AffiliationID": "60113856", "AffiliationName": "IMDEA Materials Institute"}, "57211641122": {"Name": "Milisavljevic M.", "AuthorID": "57211641122", "AffiliationID": "60019647", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology"}, "56509098000": {"Name": "Camp J.S.", "AuthorID": "56509098000", "AffiliationID": "60019647", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology"}, "7006706654": {"Name": "Sholl D.S.", "AuthorID": "7006706654", "AffiliationID": "60019647", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology"}, "15073064200": {"Name": "Ling S.", "AuthorID": "15073064200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "54785285800": {"Name": "Slater B.", "AuthorID": "54785285800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}}}
