However, the nature of this influence remains unclear, and we evaluate two contrasting hypotheses formalized as mathematical models: the label special-mechanism hypothesis and the label super-salience hypothesis. The special-mechanism hypothesis is that category labels, unlike other features, trigger inference decision making in reference to the category prototypes. This results in a tendency for prototype-compatible inferences because the labels trigger a special mechanism rather than because of any influences they have on similarity evaluation. The super-salience hypothesis assumes that the large label influence is due to their high salience and corresponding impact on similarity without any need for a special mechanism. Application of the two models to a feature inference task based on a family resemblance category structure yields strong support for the label super-salience hypothesis and in particular does not support the need for a special mechanism based on prototypes.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Classification", "Concepts", "Decision making", "Feature inference"], "IndexKeywords": ["Attention", "Classification", "Concept Formation", "Decision Making", "Humans"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84941585462", "SubjectAreas": [["Experimental and Cognitive Psychology", "PSYC", "3205"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"], ["Artificial Intelligence", "COMP", "1702"]], "AuthorData": {"7005967395": {"Name": "Johansen M.K.", "AuthorID": "7005967395", "AffiliationID": "60170432, 60023998", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, Cardiff University"}, "7201665830": {"Name": "Savage J.", "AuthorID": "7201665830", "AffiliationID": "60170432, 60023998", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, Cardiff University"}, "6507701727": {"Name": "Fouquet N.", "AuthorID": "6507701727", "AffiliationID": "60004572", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Swansea University"}, "7005569087": {"Name": "Shanks D.R.", "AuthorID": "7005569087", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Psychology and Language Sciences, University College London"}}}
