We compare users' perceptions of various wine types and regional styles across both New and Old World wines, examining them across price ranges, vintages, regions, varietals, and blends. We find that ratings provided by Vivino users are not biased by cost; then, we study how wine characteristics, language in wine reviews, and the distribution of wine ratings can be combined to develop prediction models. More specifically, we model user behavior to develop a regression model for predicting wine ratings, and a classifier for determining user review preferences.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Old worlds", "Prediction model", "Regression model", "Through the lens", "User behaviors", "User reviews", "Users' perception"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85057310153", "SubjectAreas": [["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"], ["Communication", "SOCI", "3315"], ["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"], ["Information Systems and Management", "DECI", "1802"]], "AuthorData": {"57204815485": {"Name": "Kotonya N.", "AuthorID": "57204815485", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "17433897300": {"Name": "De Cristofaro E.", "AuthorID": "17433897300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "57217918184": {"Name": "De Cristofaro P.", "AuthorID": "57217918184", "AffiliationID": "121690013", "AffiliationName": "Tipicamente Wine Blog"}}}
