Developmental Science Published by John Wiley & Sons LtdSocial influence occurs when an individual's thoughts or behaviours are affected by other people. There are significant age effects on susceptibility to social influence, typically a decline from childhood to adulthood. Most research has focused on negative aspects of social influence, such as peer influence on risky behaviour, particularly in adolescence. The current study investigated the impact of social influence on the reporting of prosocial behaviour (any act intended to help another person). In this study, 755 participants aged 8\u201359 completed a computerized task in which they rated how likely they would be to engage in a prosocial behaviour. Afterwards, they were told the average rating (in fact fictitious) that other participants had given to the same question, and then were asked to rate the same behaviour again. We found that participants' age affected the extent to which they were influenced by other people: children (8\u201311 years), young adolescents (12\u201314 years) and mid-adolescents (15\u201318 years) all significantly changed their ratings, while young adults (19\u201325 years) and adults (26\u201359 years) did not. Across the three youngest age groups, children showed the most susceptibility to prosocial influence, changing their reporting of prosocial behaviour the most. The study provides evidence that younger people's increased susceptibility to social influence can have positive outcomes.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Age Factors", "Child", "Evaluation Studies as Topic", "Humans", "Middle Aged", "Peer Influence", "Social Behavior", "Task Performance and Analysis", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85045397034", "SubjectAreas": [["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"]], "AuthorData": {"55846111000": {"Name": "Foulkes L.", "AuthorID": "55846111000", "AffiliationID": "60016418", "AffiliationName": "Department of Education, University of York"}, "57195136369": {"Name": "Leung J.T.", "AuthorID": "57195136369", "AffiliationID": "60109771", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience"}, "56672552400": {"Name": "Knoll L.J.", "AuthorID": "56672552400", "AffiliationID": "60109771", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience"}, "26643513600": {"Name": "Blakemore S.J.", "AuthorID": "26643513600", "AffiliationID": "60109771", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience"}, "56205456800": {"Name": "Fuhrmann D.", "AuthorID": "56205456800", "AffiliationID": "60029069", "AffiliationName": "MRC Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit"}}}
