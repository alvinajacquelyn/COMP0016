All rights reserved.Background: Exertional myalgia and cramps of the limb and trunk muscles are typical in McArdle disease, but mastication and oral motor limitations have not been systematically investigated before. Objective: Determine the reported prevalence and characteristics of limitations on oral motor activities, mastication, swallowing, and other oral motor activities in patients with McArdle disease. Methods: An observational study was carried out in 28 patients using a standardised questionnaire on mastication and oral motor function. Results: 57% of the participants reported difficulties with mastication. Muscle cramps during mastication occurred in 57% of the patients. A feeling that food remains in the throat occurred in 32%. Adaptations during mastication were needed in 42% of the patients. Mastication difficulties, muscle cramps during mastication and mastication adjustments were inversely correlated with age (r2 = - 0.445, p < 0.05; r2 = - 0.509, p < 0.01; r2 = - 0.456, p < 0.05). Feeling of food remaining in throat, cramps during mastication and during other oral motor muscle activities, were correlated with disease severity (r2 = 0.476, p < 0.01; r2 = 0.463, p < 0.01; r2 = 0.461, p < 0.01; r2 = 0.432, p < 0.05). Conclusions: In short, reported mastication difficulties are prevalent in people with McArdle disease, most frequently in younger people. Therefore, awareness of mastication and oral motor problems is required.", "AuthorKeywords": ["glycogen storage disease type V", "mastication", "McArdle disease", "oral motor function"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aging", "Deglutition Disorders", "Female", "Glycogen Storage Disease Type V", "Humans", "Male", "Mastication", "Middle Aged", "Mouth", "Muscle Cramp", "Surveys and Questionnaires"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85051329794", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"57192430203": {"Name": "Kouwenberg C.", "AuthorID": "57192430203", "AffiliationID": "60002573", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition, and Behaviour, Radboud University Medical Centre"}, "57203226094": {"Name": "Voermans N.", "AuthorID": "57203226094", "AffiliationID": "60002573", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition, and Behaviour, Radboud University Medical Centre"}, "57208851936": {"Name": "Quinlivan R.", "AuthorID": "57208851936", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Neuromuscular Diseases, Department of Molecular Neuroscience, University College London Institute of Neurology, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "32967532400": {"Name": "Van Den Engel-Hoek L.", "AuthorID": "32967532400", "AffiliationID": "60002573", "AffiliationName": "Department of Rehabilitation, Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour, Radboud University Medical Centre"}}}
