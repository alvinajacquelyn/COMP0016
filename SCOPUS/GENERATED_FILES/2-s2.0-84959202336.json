One hundred and sixty-five women requesting intrapartum epidural analgesia were randomised to receive different fixation devices to secure their epidural catheter. The amount of epidural catheter migration (measured to the nearest 0.5 cm) was analysed for three devices: Epi-Fix (n = 55); LockIt Plus (n = 54); and Tegaderm dressing (n = 51). Median (IQR [range]) catheter migration for Epi-Fix was 1.0 cm (0.0-2.0 [-2.0 to 9.5]), vs 0.0 cm (0.0-0.5 [-1.0 to 5.5]) for LockIt Plus and 0.5 cm (0.0-1.8 [-1.5 to 8.0]) for Tegaderm (p = 0.003). Thirty-eight (69.1%) epidural catheters secured with Epi-Fix migrated < 2.0 cm, compared with 49 (90.7%) with LockIt Plus and 40 (78.4%) with Tegaderm. Sixteen epidural catheters required resiting due to failure of analgesia of which 12 (75.0%) occurred in patients with epidural catheters that had migrated \u2265 2.0 cm. This study shows that intrapartum epidural catheters secured with the LockIt Plus device exhibit less catheter migration compared with fixation with Epi-Fix and Tegaderm.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Analgesia, Epidural", "Analgesia, Obstetrical", "Epidural Space", "Equipment Design", "Female", "Great Britain", "Humans", "Pregnancy", "Prospective Studies", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84959202336", "SubjectAreas": [["Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine", "MEDI", "2703"]], "AuthorData": {"57031975800": {"Name": "Odor P.M.", "AuthorID": "57031975800", "AffiliationID": "60032542", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anaesthesia, St. George's University Hospital"}, "56957168700": {"Name": "Bampoe S.", "AuthorID": "56957168700", "AffiliationID": "60032542", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anaesthesia, St. George's University Hospital"}, "57031410300": {"Name": "Hayward J.", "AuthorID": "57031410300", "AffiliationID": "60032542", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anaesthesia, St. George's University Hospital"}, "7401611546": {"Name": "Evans E.", "AuthorID": "7401611546", "AffiliationID": "60032542", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anaesthesia, St. George's University Hospital"}, "21233450500": {"Name": "Chis Ster I.", "AuthorID": "21233450500", "AffiliationID": "60029329", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Infection and Immunity, St. George's University of London"}}}
