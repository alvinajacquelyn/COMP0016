Methods: All participants who participated in the first health check (N = 25,639) of the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer (EPIC) Norfolk cohort (1993\u20132013) were included in this prospective cohort study, with a median follow-up of 17.0 years. We determined use of topical beta-blockers at baseline through a self-reported questionnaire and prescription check at the first clinical visit. Cardiovascular mortality was ascertained through data linkage with the Office for National Statistics mortality database. Hazard ratios (HRs) were estimated using multivariable Cox regression models. Meta-analysis of the present study\u2019s results together with other identified literature was performed using a random effects model. Results: We did not find an association between the use of topical beta-blockers and cardiovascular mortality (HR 0.93, 95% confidence interval, CI, 0.67\u20131.30). In the 514 participants with self-reported glaucoma, no association was found between the use of topical beta-blockers and cardiovascular mortality (HR 0.89, 95% CI 0.56\u20131.40). In the primary meta-analysis of four publications, there was no evidence of an association between the use of topical beta-blockers and cardiovascular mortality (pooled HR estimate 1.10, 95% CI 0.84\u20131.36). Conclusion: Topical beta-blockers do not appear to be associated with excess cardiovascular mortality. This evidence does not indicate that a change in current practice is warranted, although clinicians should continue to assess individual patients and their cardiovascular risk prior to commencing topical beta-blockers.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Beta-blockers", "cardiovascular", "epidemiology", "mortality", "topical"], "IndexKeywords": ["Administration, Topical", "Adrenergic beta-Antagonists", "Cardiovascular Diseases", "Glaucoma", "Humans", "Proportional Hazards Models", "Prospective Studies", "Risk Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84983335789", "SubjectAreas": [["Epidemiology", "MEDI", "2713"], ["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"]], "AuthorData": {"57190815767": {"Name": "Pinnock C.", "AuthorID": "57190815767", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Public Health and Primary Care, University of Cambridge"}, "8561665000": {"Name": "Yip J.L.Y.", "AuthorID": "8561665000", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60016691", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre for Ophthalmology, Moorfields Eye Hospital and UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "55195093800": {"Name": "Khawaja A.P.", "AuthorID": "55195093800", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60016691", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre for Ophthalmology, Moorfields Eye Hospital and UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "57204537801": {"Name": "Luben R.", "AuthorID": "57204537801", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Public Health and Primary Care, University of Cambridge"}, "36339661000": {"Name": "Hayat S.", "AuthorID": "36339661000", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Public Health and Primary Care, University of Cambridge"}, "57202570778": {"Name": "Khaw K.T.", "AuthorID": "57202570778", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Public Health and Primary Care, University of Cambridge"}, "7201517537": {"Name": "Foster P.J.", "AuthorID": "7201517537", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60016691", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre for Ophthalmology, Moorfields Eye Hospital and UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "7003899659": {"Name": "Broadway D.C.", "AuthorID": "7003899659", "AffiliationID": "60017129", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital"}, "34668706300": {"Name": "Wareham N.", "AuthorID": "34668706300", "AffiliationID": "60025649, 60009969", "AffiliationName": "MRC Epidemiology Unit, University of Cambridge School of Clinical Medicine"}}}
