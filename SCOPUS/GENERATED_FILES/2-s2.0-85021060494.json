Compared with other donor sources, relapse is similar or even reduced after UCBT despite less graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). We performed a retrospective analysis to identify risk factors associated with the 5-year cumulative incidence of relapse after UCBT. In this retrospective, registry-based study, we examined the outcomes of 640 children (<18 years) with ALL in first complete remission (CR1; n = 257, 40%) or second complete remission (CR2; n = 383, 60%) who received myeloablative conditioning followed by a single-unit UCBT from 2000 to 2012. Most received antithymocyte globulin (88%) or total body irradiation (TBI; 69%), and cord blood grafts were primarily mismatched at 1 (50%) or 2+ (34%) HLA loci. Considering patients in CR1, the rates of 5-year overall survival (OS), leukemia-free survival (LFS), and relapse were 59%, 52%, and 23%, respectively. In multivariate analysis (MVA), acute GVHD (grades II to IV) and TBI protected against relapse. In patients in CR2, rates of 5-year OS, LFS, and the cumulative incidence of relapse were 46%, 44%, and 28%, respectively. In MVA, longer duration from diagnosis to UCBT (\u226530 months) and TBI were associated with decreased relapse risk. Importantly, receiving a fully HLA matched graft was a strong risk factor for increased relapse in MVA. An exploratory analysis of all 640 patients supported the important association between the presence of acute GVHD and less relapse but also demonstrated an increased risk of nonrelapse mortality. In conclusion, the impact of GVHD as a graft-versus-leukemia marker is evident in pediatric ALL after UCBT. Strategies that promote graft-versus-leukemia while harnessing GVHD should be further investigated.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Acute lymphoblastic leukemia", "Cord blood", "Pediatric", "Relapse", "Transplantation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Allografts", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Cord Blood Stem Cell Transplantation", "Disease-Free Survival", "Female", "Humans", "Infant", "Male", "Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma", "Recurrence", "Risk Factors", "Survival Rate", "Time Factors", "Transplantation Conditioning", "Unrelated Donors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85021060494", "SubjectAreas": [["Hematology", "MEDI", "2720"], ["Transplantation", "MEDI", "2747"]], "AuthorData": {"24781161300": {"Name": "Page K.M.", "AuthorID": "24781161300", "AffiliationID": "60113147", "AffiliationName": "Division of Pediatric Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Duke University Medical Center"}, "36157488400": {"Name": "Troy J.", "AuthorID": "36157488400", "AffiliationID": "60113147", "AffiliationName": "Division of Pediatric Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Duke University Medical Center"}, "26643296400": {"Name": "Kurtzberg J.", "AuthorID": "26643296400", "AffiliationID": "60113147", "AffiliationName": "Division of Pediatric Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Duke University Medical Center"}, "7003561891": {"Name": "Labopin M.", "AuthorID": "7003561891", "AffiliationID": "60009907", "AffiliationName": "EBMT, Acute Leukemia Working Party, Service d'hematologie et therapie cellulaire, H\u00f4pital Saint Antoine"}, "8603207300": {"Name": "Ruggeri A.", "AuthorID": "8603207300", "AffiliationID": "60072608", "AffiliationName": "Monacord, Centre Scientifique de Monaco"}, "42062460900": {"Name": "Volt F.", "AuthorID": "42062460900", "AffiliationID": "60072608", "AffiliationName": "Monacord, Centre Scientifique de Monaco"}, "7202422456": {"Name": "Gluckman E.", "AuthorID": "7202422456", "AffiliationID": "60072608", "AffiliationName": "Monacord, Centre Scientifique de Monaco"}, "57205234374": {"Name": "Rocha V.", "AuthorID": "57205234374", "AffiliationID": "60026851, 60021328", "AffiliationName": "Churchill Hospital, Oxford University"}, "7202942933": {"Name": "Michel G.", "AuthorID": "7202942933", "AffiliationID": "60102127, 60024144", "AffiliationName": "Timone Enfants Hospital and Aix-Marseille University, Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology"}, "6602397674": {"Name": "Diaz de Heredia C.", "AuthorID": "6602397674", "AffiliationID": "60012486, 60030315", "AffiliationName": "Servicio de Hematologia y Oncologia Pediatrica, Hospital Vall d'Hebron"}, "12773443900": {"Name": "O'Brien T.", "AuthorID": "12773443900", "AffiliationID": "60015296", "AffiliationName": "Blood and Marrow Transplant Program, Sydney Children's Hospital"}, "55137272800": {"Name": "Picardi A.", "AuthorID": "55137272800", "AffiliationID": "60027509", "AffiliationName": "University of Tor Vergata, Rome Transplant Network"}, "6602776762": {"Name": "Ayas M.", "AuthorID": "6602776762", "AffiliationID": "60016332", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, King Faisal Specialist Hospital & Research Center"}, "6603074916": {"Name": "Bittencourt H.", "AuthorID": "6603074916", "AffiliationID": "60005610", "AffiliationName": "Hematology/Bone Marrow Transplantation, Hopital Saint Justine"}, "35430808700": {"Name": "Vora A.J.", "AuthorID": "35430808700", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology and Oncology, Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "8504188600": {"Name": "Bonfim C.", "AuthorID": "8504188600", "AffiliationID": "60015043, 60008088", "AffiliationName": "Hospital Das Clinicas, Universidade Federal do Parana"}, "7007082638": {"Name": "Bader P.", "AuthorID": "7007082638", "AffiliationID": "60009308, 60007762", "AffiliationName": "Division for Stem Cell Transplantation and Immunology, Hospital for Children and Adolescents, University Hospital Frankfurt, Goethe University"}, "null": {"Name": null, "AuthorID": null, "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
