SCD individuals with normal cognition may already have significant medial temporal lobe atrophy. However, few studies have been devoted to exploring the alteration of left-right asymmetry with hippocampus and amygdala in SCD. The aim of this study was to compare SCD individuals with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients and the normal population for volume and asymmetry of hippocampus, amygdala and temporal horn, and to assess their relationship with cognitive function in elderly population living in China. Methods: 111 SCD, 30 MCI, and 67 healthy controls (HC) underwent a standard T1-weighted MRI, from which the volumes of the hippocampus and amygdala were calculated and compared. Then we evaluated the pattern and extent of asymmetry in hippocampus and amygdala of these samples. Furthermore, we also investigated the relationship between the altered brain regions and cognitive function. Results: Among the three groups, SCD showed more depressive symptoms (p < 0.001) and higher percentage of heart disease (16.4% vs. 35.1%, p = 0.007) than controls. In terms of brain data, significant differences were found in the volume and asymmetry of both hippocampus and amygdala among the three groups (P < 0.05). In logistic analysis controlled by age, gender, education level, depression symptoms, anxiety symptom, somatic disease and lifestyle in terms of smoking, both SCD and MCI individuals showed significant decreased right hippocampal and amygdala volume than controls. For asymmetry pattern, a ladder-shaped difference of left-larger-than-right asymmetry was found in amygdala with MCI > SCD > HC, and an opposite asymmetry of left-less-than-right pattern was found with HC > SCD > MCI in hippocampus. Furthermore, correlation was shown between the volume of right hippocampus and right amygdala with MMSE and MoCA in SCD group. Conclusion: Our results supported that SCD individuals are biologically distinguishable from HC, and this may relate to cognitive impairment, although more longitudinal studies are need to investigate this further. Moreover, different levels of asymmetry in hippocampus and amygdala might be a potential dividing factor to differentiate clinical diagnosis.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alzheimer's disease", "Amygdala", "Asymmetry", "Hippocampus", "Mild cognitive impairment", "Subjective cognitive decline"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85048276817", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"55634279800": {"Name": "Yue L.", "AuthorID": "55634279800", "AffiliationID": "60025084", "AffiliationName": "Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University"}, "56442845300": {"Name": "Wang T.", "AuthorID": "56442845300", "AffiliationID": "60025084", "AffiliationName": "Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University"}, "55818424200": {"Name": "Li G.", "AuthorID": "55818424200", "AffiliationID": "60025084", "AffiliationName": "Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University"}, "57218486151": {"Name": "Wang J.", "AuthorID": "57218486151", "AffiliationID": "60025084", "AffiliationName": "Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University"}, "43561619700": {"Name": "Li X.", "AuthorID": "43561619700", "AffiliationID": "60025084", "AffiliationName": "Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University"}, "56201166400": {"Name": "Li W.", "AuthorID": "56201166400", "AffiliationID": "60025084", "AffiliationName": "Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University"}, "7402022817": {"Name": "Xiao S.", "AuthorID": "7402022817", "AffiliationID": "60025084", "AffiliationName": "Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University"}, "57194288913": {"Name": "Wang J.", "AuthorID": "57194288913", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, University of College London"}, "7402639569": {"Name": "Hu M.", "AuthorID": "7402639569", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University of College London"}}}
