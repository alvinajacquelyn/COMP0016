However, simulation capabilities developed at the Centre for Electronic Imaging, which includes direct input of electron density simulations, have made it possible to investigate this assumption further. As part of the radiation testing campaign of the Euclid CCD273 devices, data have been obtained using the trap pumping method, a method that can be used to identify and characterize single defects within CCDs. Combining these data with simulations, we find that trapping during the transfer of charge among phases is indeed necessary to explain the results of the data analysis. This result could influence not only trap pumping theory and how trap pumping should be performed but also how a radiation-damaged CCD is readout in the most optimal way.", "AuthorKeywords": ["charge-coupled devices", "image reconstruction", "radiation", "simulations"], "IndexKeywords": ["Charge-transfer dynamics", "Electronic imaging", "Interphase regions", "Pumping methods", "Radiation testing", "simulations", "Single defect", "Transfer of charges"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85044728427", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Control and Systems Engineering", "ENGI", "2207"], ["Instrumentation", "PHYS", "3105"], ["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"35100980600": {"Name": "Skottfelt J.", "AuthorID": "35100980600", "AffiliationID": "60012113", "AffiliationName": "Open University, Centre for Electronic Imaging"}, "57214169439": {"Name": "Hall D.", "AuthorID": "57214169439", "AffiliationID": "60012113", "AffiliationName": "Open University, Centre for Electronic Imaging"}, "36454630800": {"Name": "Dryer B.", "AuthorID": "36454630800", "AffiliationID": "60012113", "AffiliationName": "Open University, Centre for Electronic Imaging"}, "57008838100": {"Name": "Bush N.", "AuthorID": "57008838100", "AffiliationID": "60012113", "AffiliationName": "Open University, Centre for Electronic Imaging"}, "22984865200": {"Name": "Gow J.", "AuthorID": "22984865200", "AffiliationID": "60012113", "AffiliationName": "Open University, Centre for Electronic Imaging"}, "7202996580": {"Name": "Holland A.", "AuthorID": "7202996580", "AffiliationID": "60012113", "AffiliationName": "Open University, Centre for Electronic Imaging"}}}
