The method allows the prediction of the depth of a single, chemically distinct layer within a turbid matrix by performing two measurements, with and without a beam enhancing element, or \u201cphoton diode.\u201d The samples employed consisted of two different polymers, of total thickness 3.6 mm, whose optical properties are loosely relevant to pharmaceutical applications. A polymer layer of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) was placed at different positions within multiple layers of the polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) matrix and Raman spectra were recorded in each case. Both univariate and multivariate analyses were utilized to determine whether the depth of the LDPE layer could be predicted using the obtained data. The best-achieved RMSE of prediction was 4.2% of the total sample size (i.e., +/\u2212 0.15 mm) with the multivariate approach.", "AuthorKeywords": ["depth prediction", "pharmaceutical tablets", "photon diode", "Raman spectroscopy", "transmission raman spectroscopy", "turbid media"], "IndexKeywords": ["Low density polyethylene(LDPE)", "Multi variate analysis", "Multivariate approach", "Pharmaceutical applications", "Pharmaceutical tablets", "Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE)", "Transmission raman spectroscopies", "Turbid media"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85026731744", "SubjectAreas": [["Instrumentation", "PHYS", "3105"], ["Spectroscopy", "CHEM", "1607"]], "AuthorData": {"55511532400": {"Name": "Vardaki M.Z.", "AuthorID": "55511532400", "AffiliationID": "60026479", "AffiliationName": "School of Physics and Astronomy, College of Engineering, Mathematics and Physical Sciences, University of Exeter"}, "7202511172": {"Name": "Stone N.", "AuthorID": "7202511172", "AffiliationID": "60026479", "AffiliationName": "School of Physics and Astronomy, College of Engineering, Mathematics and Physical Sciences, University of Exeter"}, "57195284364": {"Name": "Sheridan H.", "AuthorID": "57195284364", "AffiliationID": "60026479", "AffiliationName": "Natural Sciences, College of Engineering, Mathematics and Physical Sciences, University of Exeter"}, "7005659005": {"Name": "Matousek P.", "AuthorID": "7005659005", "AffiliationID": "60023254, 60009523", "AffiliationName": "Central Laser Facility, Research Complex at Harwell, STFC Rutherford Appleton Laboratory"}}}
