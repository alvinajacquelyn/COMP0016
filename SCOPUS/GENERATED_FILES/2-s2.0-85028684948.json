Background: Although most children admitted to a paediatric intensive care unit will survive, 2\u20135% will die during their stay. The parents of these children interact and form relationships with numerous healthcare staff during their child's illness and death. Although previous studies have explored the parental experience of child death in intensive care generally, the nature of their relationships with healthcare providers during this time remains unknown. Design: This study used a constructivist grounded theory approach. Methods: Data were collected via semi-structured, audio-recorded interviews with 26 bereaved parents from four paediatric intensive care units over 18 months in 2015\u20132016. Constant comparative analysis and theoretical memos were used to analyse the data. Findings: The theory \u201cTransitional togetherness\u201d demonstrates the changing nature of the parent\u2013healthcare provider relationship across three key phases of the parents\u2019 journey. Phase one, \u201cWelcoming expertise,\u201d focuses on the child's medical needs, with the healthcare provider dominant in the relationship. Phase two, \u201cBecoming a team,\u201d centres around the parents\u2019 need to recreate a parental role and work collaboratively with healthcare providers. Finally, \u201cGradually disengaging\u201d describes the parents\u2019 desire for the relationship to continue after the child's death as a source of support until no longer needed. Conclusions: Findings from this study offer valuable insights into the changing nature of the parent\u2013healthcare provider relationship and highlight the key foci of the relationship at each stage of the parental journey.", "AuthorKeywords": ["bereaved parent", "end-of-life", "grounded theory", "healthcare provider", "interaction", "nurse", "paediatric intensive care unit", "relationship"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Australia", "Bereavement", "Child", "Child, Hospitalized", "Child, Preschool", "Death", "Female", "Grounded Theory", "Humans", "Infant", "Intensive Care Units, Pediatric", "Interviews as Topic", "Male", "Parents", "Personnel, Hospital", "Professional-Family Relations"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85028684948", "SubjectAreas": [["Nursing (all)", "NURS", "2900"]], "AuthorData": {"56274310900": {"Name": "Butler A.", "AuthorID": "56274310900", "AffiliationID": "60019578", "AffiliationName": "School of Nursing and Midwifery, Monash University"}, "36240708500": {"Name": "Hall H.", "AuthorID": "36240708500", "AffiliationID": "60019578", "AffiliationName": "School of Nursing and Midwifery, Monash University"}, "6603356377": {"Name": "Copnell B.", "AuthorID": "6603356377", "AffiliationID": "60019578", "AffiliationName": "School of Nursing and Midwifery, Monash University"}}}
