A variety of algorithms to tackle them have been studied in the last 45 years, many of them based on dynamic programming. A limit of SCSPs is its lack of compositionality and, consequently, it is not possible to represent problem decompositions in the formalism itself. In this paper we introduce Soft Constraint Evaluation Problems (SCEPs), an algebraic framework, generalizing SCSPs, which allows for the compositional specification and resolution of (soft) constraint-based problems. This enables the systematic derivation of efficient dynamic programming algorithms for any such problem.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Algebraic approaches", "Algebraic framework", "Compositional specifications", "Constraint Satisfaction", "Decomposition structures", "Dynamic programming algorithm", "Optimization problems", "Problem decomposition"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85041836471", "SubjectAreas": [["Theoretical Computer Science", "MATH", "2614"], ["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"]], "AuthorData": {"7004968272": {"Name": "Montanari U.", "AuthorID": "7004968272", "AffiliationID": "60028868", "AffiliationName": "University of Pisa"}, "55770025200": {"Name": "Sammartino M.", "AuthorID": "55770025200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "57189361432": {"Name": "Tcheukam A.", "AuthorID": "57189361432", "AffiliationID": "60104576", "AffiliationName": "New York University"}}}
