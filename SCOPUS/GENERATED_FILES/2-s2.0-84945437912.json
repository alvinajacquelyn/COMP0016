The growing skeleton is particularly vulnerable to the effects of CKD, and bone pain, fractures and deformities are common in children on dialysis. Defective bone mineralisation has been linked with ectopic calcification, which in turn leads to significant morbidity and mortality. Despite national and international guidelines for the management of CKD-MBD, the management of mineral dysregulation in CKD can be extremely challenging, and a significant proportion of patients have calcium, phosphate or parathyroid hormone levels outside the normal ranges. Clinical and experimental studies have shown that, in the setting of CKD, low serum calcium levels are associated with poor bone mineralisation, whereas high serum calcium levels can lead to arterial calcification, even in children. The role of calcium in CKD-MBD is the focus of this review.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bone mineral density", "Calcium balance", "Children", "Chronic kidney disease", "Mineral bone disorder", "Phosphate binders", "Vascular calcification"], "IndexKeywords": ["Bone Density", "Bone Diseases, Metabolic", "Calcification, Physiologic", "Calcium", "Calcium Phosphates", "Child", "Humans", "Renal Dialysis", "Renal Insufficiency, Chronic", "Vascular Calcification"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84945437912", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Nephrology", "MEDI", "2727"]], "AuthorData": {"16146771300": {"Name": "Rees L.", "AuthorID": "16146771300", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Paediatric Nephrology, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children"}, "22956754100": {"Name": "Shroff R.", "AuthorID": "22956754100", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Paediatric Nephrology, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children"}}}
