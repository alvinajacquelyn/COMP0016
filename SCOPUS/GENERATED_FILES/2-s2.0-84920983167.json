Experimental Design: AT9283 was administered as a 72-hour continuous intravenous infusion every 3 weeks. A rolling-six design, explored six dose levels (7, 9, 11.5, 14.5, 18.5, and 23 mg/m2/d). Pharmacokinetic and PD assessments, included inhibition of phospho-histone 3 (pHH3) in paired skin punch biopsies. Results: Thirty-three patients were evaluable for toxicity. There were six dose-limiting toxicities and the MTD was 18.5 mg/m2/d. Most common drug-related toxicities were hematologic (neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia in 36.4%, 18.2%, and 21.2% of patients), which were grade \u22653 in 30.3%, 6.1%, and 3%of patients. Nonhematologic toxicities included fatigue, infections, febrile neutropenia and ALT elevation. One patient with central nervous system-primitive neuroectodermal tumor (CNS-PNET) achieved a partial response after 16 cycles and 3 cases were stable for four or more cycles. Plasma concentrations were comparable with those in adults at the same dose level, clearance was similar although half-life was shorter (4.9 \u00b1 1.5 hours, compared with 8.4 \u00b1 3.7 hours in adults). Inhibition of Aurora kinase B was shown by reduction in pHH3 in 17 of 18 patients treated at \u226511.5 mg/m2/d. Conclusion: AT9283 was well tolerated in children and adolescents with solid tumors with manageable hematologic toxicity. Target inhibition was demonstrated. Disease stabilization was documented in intracranial and extracranial pediatric solid tumors and a phase II dose determined.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Antineoplastic Agents", "Aurora Kinases", "Benzimidazoles", "Central Nervous System Neoplasms", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Maximum Tolerated Dose", "Neutropenia", "Treatment Outcome", "Urea"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84920983167", "SubjectAreas": [["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Cancer Research", "BIOC", "1306"]], "AuthorData": {"31367505400": {"Name": "Moreno L.", "AuthorID": "31367505400", "AffiliationID": "60008948", "AffiliationName": "CNIO"}, "16744335600": {"Name": "Marshall L.V.", "AuthorID": "16744335600", "AffiliationID": "60010337", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cancer Research"}, "7401994312": {"Name": "Pearson A.D.J.", "AuthorID": "7401994312", "AffiliationID": "60010337", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cancer Research"}, "57202953721": {"Name": "Morland B.", "AuthorID": "57202953721", "AffiliationID": "60022357", "AffiliationName": "Birmingham Children's Hospital"}, "36628194700": {"Name": "Elliott M.", "AuthorID": "36628194700", "AffiliationID": "60006866", "AffiliationName": "Leeds General Infirmary"}, "8568431400": {"Name": "Campbell-Hewson Q.", "AuthorID": "8568431400", "AffiliationID": "109666601", "AffiliationName": "Great North Children's Hospital"}, "7005498718": {"Name": "Makin G.", "AuthorID": "7005498718", "AffiliationID": "60003771, 60120601", "AffiliationName": "Manchester Cancer Research Centre, Institute of Cancer Sciences, University of Manchester"}, "57026400300": {"Name": "Halford S.E.R.", "AuthorID": "57026400300", "AffiliationID": "60012754", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Research United Kingdom, Drug Development Office"}, "56481303200": {"Name": "Acton G.", "AuthorID": "56481303200", "AffiliationID": "60012754", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Research United Kingdom, Drug Development Office"}, "57197393192": {"Name": "Ross P.", "AuthorID": "57197393192", "AffiliationID": "60012754", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Research United Kingdom, Drug Development Office"}, "56481580800": {"Name": "Kazmi-Stokes S.", "AuthorID": "56481580800", "AffiliationID": "60012754", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Research United Kingdom, Drug Development Office"}, "35976432200": {"Name": "Lock V.", "AuthorID": "35976432200", "AffiliationID": "60111951", "AffiliationName": "Astex Therapeutics Ltd."}, "56291065300": {"Name": "Rodriguez A.", "AuthorID": "56291065300", "AffiliationID": "60111951", "AffiliationName": "Astex Therapeutics Ltd."}, "7202033279": {"Name": "Lyons J.F.", "AuthorID": "7202033279", "AffiliationID": "60111951", "AffiliationName": "Astex Therapeutics Ltd."}, "6506077268": {"Name": "Yule M.", "AuthorID": "6506077268", "AffiliationID": "60111951", "AffiliationName": "Astex Therapeutics Ltd."}, "7006184991": {"Name": "Boddy A.V.", "AuthorID": "7006184991", "AffiliationID": "60006222", "AffiliationName": "Northern Institute for Cancer Research"}, "7403310439": {"Name": "Griffin M.J.", "AuthorID": "7403310439", "AffiliationID": "60006222", "AffiliationName": "Northern Institute for Cancer Research"}, "57210349888": {"Name": "Hargrave D.", "AuthorID": "57210349888", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust, Consultant Paediatric Oncologist Neuro-oncology and Experimental Therapeutics"}}}
