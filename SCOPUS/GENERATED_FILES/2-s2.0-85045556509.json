The SPRC is the main region of interest for this investigation, because of the unique CO2 ice sublimation features that cover the surface. These flat floored, circular depressions are highly dynamic, and we infer frequently expose dust particles previously trapped within the ice during the wintertime. Here we identify suitable regions for potential dust exposure on the SPRC, and utilise data from the Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars (CRISM) on board NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) satellite to examine infrared spectra of dark regions assumed to be composed mainly of dust particles to establish their mineral composition, to eliminate the effects of ices on sub-pixel dusty features, and to look for signatures indicative of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs). Spectral mapping has identified compositional differences between depression rims and the majority of the SPRC and CRISM spectra have been corrected to minimise the influence of CO2 ice. Whilst no conclusive evidence for PAHs has been found within the detectability limits of the CRISM instrument, depression rims are shown to have higher water content than regions of featureless ice, and there are possible indications of magnesium carbonate within the dark, dusty regions.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85045556509", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"57190375056": {"Name": "Campbell J.D.", "AuthorID": "57190375056", "AffiliationID": "60084281, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Imaging Group, Mullard Space Science Laboratory, University College London"}, "16246477000": {"Name": "Sidiropoulos P.", "AuthorID": "16246477000", "AffiliationID": "60084281, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Imaging Group, Mullard Space Science Laboratory, University College London"}, "7404871794": {"Name": "Muller J.P.", "AuthorID": "7404871794", "AffiliationID": "60084281, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Imaging Group, Mullard Space Science Laboratory, University College London"}}}
