However, the mechanisms of enhancement of the bacteriophage killing effect are not specifically understood. This work focuses on the investigation of the possible interactions between emulsion droplets and bacterial cells, between emulsion droplets and bacteriophages, and finally interactions between all three components: nano-emulsion droplets, bacteria, and bacteriophages. The first approach consists of simple calculations to determine the spatial distribution of the components, based on measurements of particle size. It was found that nano-emulsion droplets are much more numerous than bacteria or bacteriophage, and due to their size and surface area they must be covering the surface of both cells and bacteriophage particles. Stabilisation of bacteriophages due to electrostatic forces and interaction with nano-emulsion droplets is suspected, since bacteriophages may be protected against inactivation due to 'charge shielding'. Zeta potential was measured for the individual components in the system, and for all of them combined. It was concluded that the presence of nano-emulsions could be reducing electrostatic repulsion between bacterial cells and bacteriophage, both of which are very negatively 'charged'. Moreover, nano-emulsions lead to more favourable interaction between bacteriophages and bacteria, enhancing the anti-microbial or killing effect. These findings are relevant since the physicochemical properties of nano-emulsions (i.e. particle size distribution and zeta potential) are key in determining the efficacy of the formulation against infection in the context of responsive burn wound dressings-which is the main target for this work.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Anti-microbial formulations", "Bacteriophage K", "Electrostatic interactions", "Enhanced phage infectivity", "Nano-emulsions", "S. aureus infections", "Wound dressings", "Zeta potential"], "IndexKeywords": ["Anti-microbial", "Enhanced phage infectivity", "Nano-emulsions", "S. aureus", "Wound dressings", "Bacteriophages", "Emulsions", "Nanostructures", "Particle Size", "Plankton", "Staphylococcus aureus", "Static Electricity"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84949643372", "SubjectAreas": [["Biotechnology", "BIOC", "1305"], ["Surfaces and Interfaces", "PHYS", "3110"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"], ["Colloid and Surface Chemistry", "CENG", "1505"]], "AuthorData": {"56125027800": {"Name": "Esteban P.", "AuthorID": "56125027800", "AffiliationID": "60030480", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Bath"}, "6602071317": {"Name": "Arnot T.", "AuthorID": "6602071317", "AffiliationID": "60030480", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University of Bath"}, "7202458121": {"Name": "Jenkins A.", "AuthorID": "7202458121", "AffiliationID": "60030480", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Bath"}}}
