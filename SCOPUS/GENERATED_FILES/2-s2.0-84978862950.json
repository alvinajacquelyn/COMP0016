It brings together the capabilities of the industry, academics, hospitals, and regulators within a common platform in order to scope the solid understanding of the major issues, which will underpin the progress towards the future of paediatric medicines we want.The EuPFI was formed in parallel to the adoption of regulations within the EU and USA and has served as a community that drives research and dissemination through publications and the organisation of annual conferences. The membership and reach of this group have grown since its inception in 2007 and continue to develop and evolve to meet the continuing needs and ambitions of research into and development of age appropriate medicines. Five diverse workstreams (age-appropriate medicines, Biopharmaceutics, Administration Devices, Excipients and Taste Assessment & Taste Masking (TATM)) direct specific workpackages on behalf of the EuPFI. Furthermore, EuPFI interacts with multiple diverse professional groups across the globe to ensure efficient working in the area of paediatric medicines. Strong commitment and active involvement of all EuPFI stakeholders have proved to be vital to effectively address knowledge gaps related to paediatric medicines, discuss potential areas for further research and identify issues that need more attention and analysis in the future.", "AuthorKeywords": ["administration devices", "age appropriate", "biopharm", "EuPFI", "excipients", "formulation", "paediatric", "taste assessment", "taste masking"], "IndexKeywords": ["Chemistry, Pharmaceutical", "Child", "Europe", "Excipients", "Humans", "Pediatrics", "Pharmaceutical Preparations"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84978862950", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmaceutical Science", "PHAR", "3003"]], "AuthorData": {"45861750300": {"Name": "Salunke S.", "AuthorID": "45861750300", "AffiliationID": "60016379", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmaceutics & Centre for Paediatric Pharmacy Research, UCL School of Pharmacy"}, "8446290500": {"Name": "Tuleu C.", "AuthorID": "8446290500", "AffiliationID": "60016379", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmaceutics & Centre for Paediatric Pharmacy Research, UCL School of Pharmacy"}, "57203362872": {"Name": "Liu F.", "AuthorID": "57203362872", "AffiliationID": "60032760", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacy, School of Life and Medical Sciences, University of Hertfordshire"}, "6602643941": {"Name": "Batchelor H.", "AuthorID": "6602643941", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "School of Pharmacy, Institute of Clinical Sciences, University of Birmingham"}, "7404416719": {"Name": "Walsh J.", "AuthorID": "7404416719", "AffiliationID": "112876997", "AffiliationName": "Jenny Walsh Consulting Ltd., BioCity Nottingham"}, "56072279500": {"Name": "Turner R.", "AuthorID": "56072279500", "AffiliationID": "60009968", "AffiliationName": "Novartis Pharma AG"}, "57190275769": {"Name": "Ju T.R.", "AuthorID": "57190275769", "AffiliationID": "60105169", "AffiliationName": "AbbVie"}, "null": {"Name": null, "AuthorID": null, "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
