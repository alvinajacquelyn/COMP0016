In vitro and in vivo studies show that GBA1 mutations reduce glucocerebrosidase (GCase) activity and are associated with increased \u03b1-synuclein levels, reflecting similar changes seen in idiopathic PD brain. We have developed a neural crest stem cell-derived dopaminergic neuronal model that recapitulates biochemical abnormalities in GBA1 mutation-associated PD. Cells showed reduced GCase protein and activity, impaired macroautophagy, and increased \u03b1-synuclein levels. Advantages of this approach include easy access to stem cells, no requirement to reprogram, and retention of the intact host genome. Treatment with a GCase chaperone increased GCase protein levels and activity, rescued the autophagic defects, and decreased \u03b1-synuclein levels. These results provide the basis for further investigation of GCase chaperones or similar drugs to slow the progression of PD.", "AuthorKeywords": ["ambroxol", "chaperone", "dopaminergic neurons", "GBA1 mutation", "GBA1-associated PD", "glucocerebrosidase", "neural crest stem cells", "Parkinson disease", "PD modeling", "\u03b1-synuclein"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adipose Tissue", "alpha-Synuclein", "Ambroxol", "Animals", "Autophagy", "Cell Differentiation", "Dopaminergic Neurons", "Enzyme Activation", "Glucosylceramidase", "Heterozygote", "Humans", "Lysosomal-Associated Membrane Protein 1", "Lysosomal-Associated Membrane Protein 2", "Mice", "Mutation", "Neural Crest", "Neural Stem Cells", "Parkinson Disease"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85012881393", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Developmental Biology", "BIOC", "1309"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"57193318195": {"Name": "Yang S.Y.", "AuthorID": "57193318195", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Neurosciences, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "54970568600": {"Name": "Beavan M.", "AuthorID": "54970568600", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Neurosciences, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "7202674646": {"Name": "Chau K.Y.", "AuthorID": "7202674646", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Neurosciences, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "7004248673": {"Name": "Taanman J.W.", "AuthorID": "7004248673", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Neurosciences, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "7102634392": {"Name": "Schapira A.H.V.", "AuthorID": "7102634392", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Neurosciences, UCL Institute of Neurology"}}}
