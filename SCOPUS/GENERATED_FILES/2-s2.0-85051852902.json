We consider the case of non compact Shimura varieties completing the proof of the result for all Shimura varieties. The statement which we consider here was first formulated and proven by Ullmo and Yafaev for compact Shimura varieties.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bloch\u2013Ochiai", "Holomorphic curve", "O-minimality", "Pila\u2013Wilkie", "Shimura varieties"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85051852902", "SubjectAreas": [["Mathematics (all)", "MATH", "2600"]], "AuthorData": {"57203483326": {"Name": "Giacomini M.", "AuthorID": "57203483326", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
