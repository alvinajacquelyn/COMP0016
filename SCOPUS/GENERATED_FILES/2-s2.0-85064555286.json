In Ecuador, mental health literature addressing this crucial issue is scarce and little debated. In contrast, local psychiatrists and psychologists within the country face contemporary challenges that are deeply rooted in a violent colonial past and the perpetuation of its fundamental ethos. This paper critically reviews relevant literature on collective memory and historical trauma, and focuses on Ecuador as a case study on how to incorporate history into modern mental health challenges. The discussion poses key questions and outlines possible ways for Ecuador to address the link between history and mental health, including insights from countries that have struggled with their violent pasts. This paper contributes to ongoing international debate on the role of cultural history in mental health with implications for social scientists and practising clinicians in former colonised nations.", "AuthorKeywords": ["collective memory", "Ecuador", "local mental health", "post colonial", "trauma", "violence"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85064555286", "SubjectAreas": [["Health (social science)", "SOCI", "3306"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"57208345056": {"Name": "Capella M.", "AuthorID": "57208345056", "AffiliationID": "60072042", "AffiliationName": "University of Guayaquil"}, "57203069546": {"Name": "Jadhav S.", "AuthorID": "57203069546", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "57207838002": {"Name": "Moncrieff J.", "AuthorID": "57207838002", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
