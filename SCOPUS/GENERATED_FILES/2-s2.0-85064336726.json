Components that make up the existing building stock must be better characterised to prevent them becoming waste. The first record of materials in an existing building is often the waste report, which classifies materials for waste management and gathers information after the opportunity for higher-value reuse of components has passed. Policy at various levels aims to increase reuse, but an understanding of 'existing buildings as material banks' (E-BAMB) is a necessary precursor to overcoming other barriers. This paper reviews the current means of understanding E-BAMB and identifies its shortfalls. This analysis leads to the conception of a strategy in which the various approaches are organised as an information system. The future role of technology and mandatory provision of E-BAMB information at the planning stage are explored. The proposed system would enable specifiers, manufacturers and academics to assess the wealth of materials that can be reused, repurposed or upcycled in new projects or businesses. This does not guarantee that actual reuse will occur, as financial, technical and legal barriers may remain. However, it creates the context for assessing secondary components against their virgin equivalents and the enabling conditions for new circular business models.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Building stocks", "Business models", "Component reuse", "New projects", "Planning stages", "Role of technologies", "Secondary components"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85064336726", "SubjectAreas": [["Civil and Structural Engineering", "ENGI", "2205"]], "AuthorData": {"57200320205": {"Name": "Rose C.M.", "AuthorID": "57200320205", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Urban Sustainability and Resilience, Department of Civil, Environmental and Geomatic Engineering, University College London"}, "7005025101": {"Name": "Stegemann J.A.", "AuthorID": "7005025101", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Resource Efficiency and the Environment, Department of Civil, Environmental and Geomatic Engineering, University College London"}}}
