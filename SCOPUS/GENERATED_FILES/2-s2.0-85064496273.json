Using five control induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines and seven iPSC lines generated from fAD patients, we investigated the effects of mutations on the A\u03b2 secretome in human neurons generated in 2D and 3D. We also analysed matched CSF, post-mortem brain tissue, and iPSCs from the same participant with the APP V717I mutation. All fAD mutation lines demonstrated an increased A\u03b242:40 ratio relative to controls, yet displayed varied signatures for A\u03b243, A\u03b238, and short A\u03b2 fragments. We propose four qualitatively distinct mechanisms behind raised A\u03b242:40. (1) APP V717I mutations alter \u03b3-secretase cleavage site preference. Whereas, distinct presenilin 1 (PSEN1) mutations lead to either (2) reduced \u03b3-secretase activity, (3) altered protein stability or (4) reduced PSEN1 maturation, all culminating in reduced \u03b3-secretase carboxypeptidase-like activity. These data support A\u03b2 mechanistic tenets in a human physiological model and substantiate iPSC-neurons for modelling fAD.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85064496273", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"]], "AuthorData": {"53163080800": {"Name": "Arber C.", "AuthorID": "53163080800", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology"}, "14029427000": {"Name": "Toombs J.", "AuthorID": "14029427000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UK Dementia Research Institute at UCL"}, "57194546145": {"Name": "Lovejoy C.", "AuthorID": "57194546145", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology"}, "57204294516": {"Name": "Willumsen N.", "AuthorID": "57204294516", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Queen Square Brain Bank for Neurological Disorders, Department of Clinical and Movement Neuroscience, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology"}, "36463576300": {"Name": "Heslegrave A.", "AuthorID": "36463576300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UK Dementia Research Institute at UCL"}, "56210513900": {"Name": "Hardy J.", "AuthorID": "56210513900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UK Dementia Research Institute at UCL"}, "6602721075": {"Name": "Lashley T.", "AuthorID": "6602721075", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Queen Square Brain Bank for Neurological Disorders, Department of Clinical and Movement Neuroscience, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology"}, "6701454676": {"Name": "Zetterberg H.", "AuthorID": "6701454676", "AffiliationID": "60031699", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Neurochemistry Laboratory, Sahlgrenska University Hospital"}, "19934657400": {"Name": "Wray S.", "AuthorID": "19934657400", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology"}, "7201444328": {"Name": "Fox N.C.", "AuthorID": "7201444328", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dementia Research Centre, Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology"}, "33467902600": {"Name": "Ryan N.S.", "AuthorID": "33467902600", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dementia Research Centre, Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology"}, "55799312800": {"Name": "Paterson R.W.", "AuthorID": "55799312800", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dementia Research Centre, Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology"}, "7103177641": {"Name": "Schott J.M.", "AuthorID": "7103177641", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dementia Research Centre, Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology"}, "57193355048": {"Name": "Gkanatsiou E.", "AuthorID": "57193355048", "AffiliationID": "60027675, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry and Neurochemistry, Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, the Sahlgrenska Academy at the University of Gothenburg"}, "12806782700": {"Name": "Portelius E.", "AuthorID": "12806782700", "AffiliationID": "60031699", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Neurochemistry Laboratory, Sahlgrenska University Hospital"}, "56415176000": {"Name": "Blennow K.", "AuthorID": "56415176000", "AffiliationID": "60031699", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Neurochemistry Laboratory, Sahlgrenska University Hospital"}}}
