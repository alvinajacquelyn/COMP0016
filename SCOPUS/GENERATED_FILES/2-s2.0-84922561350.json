The aim of this feasibility and pilot study was to investigate the effects of NACRT and a 6 week structured responsive exercise training programme (SRETP) on oxygen uptake (VO2) at lactate threshold (\u03b8L) in such patients. Methods We prospectively studied 39 consecutive subjects (27 males) with T3-4/N+ resection margin threatened rectal cancer who completed standardized NACRT. Subjects underwent cardiopulmonary exercise testing at baseline (pre-NACRT), at week 0 (post-NACRT), and week 6 (post-SRETP). Twenty-two subjects undertook a 6 week SRETP on a training bike (three sessions per week) between week 0 and week 6 (exercise group). These were compared with 17 contemporaneous non-randomized subjects (control group). Changes in VO2 at \u03b8L over time and between the groups were compared using a compound symmetry covariance linear mixed model. Results Of 39 recruited subjects, 22 out of 22 (exercise) and 13 out of 17 (control) completed the study. There were differences between the exercise and control groups at baseline [age, ASA score physical status, World Health Organisation performance status, and Colorectal Physiologic and Operative Severity Score for the Enumeration of Mortality and Morbidity (CR-POSSUM) predicted mortality]. In all subjects, VO2 at \u03b8L significantly reduced between baseline and week 0 [-1.9 ml kg-1 min-1; 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.3, -2.6; P<0.0001]. In the exercise group, VO2 at \u03b8L significantly improved between week 0 and week 6 (+2.1 ml kg-1 min-1; 95% CI +1.3, +2.9; P<0.0001), whereas the control group values were unchanged (-0.7 ml kg-1 min-1; 95% CI -1.66, +0.37; P=0.204). Conclusions NACRT before rectal cancer surgery reduces physical fitness. A structured exercise intervention is feasible post-NACRT and returns fitness to baseline levels within 6 weeks.
