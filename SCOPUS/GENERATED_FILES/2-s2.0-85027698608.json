(Multiscale Model Simul, 2017, to appear) derived from an agent-based model for a system of particles interacting through a dynamical network of links. Assuming that the network remodeling process is very fast, the macroscopic model takes the form of a single aggregation\u2013diffusion equation for the density of particles. The theoretical study of the macroscopic model gives precise criteria for the phase transitions of the steady states, and in the one-dimensional case, we show numerically that the stationary solutions of the microscopic model undergo the same phase transitions and bifurcation types as the macroscopic model. In the two-dimensional case, we show that the numerical simulations of the macroscopic model are in excellent agreement with the predicted theoretical values. This study provides a partial validation of the formal derivation of the macroscopic model from a microscopic formulation and shows that the former is a consistent approximation of an underlying particle dynamics, making it a powerful tool for the modeling of dynamical networks at a large scale.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Aggregation\u2013diffusion equation", "Bifurcations", "Cross-links", "Diffusion approximation", "Dynamical networks", "Fourier analysis", "Kinetic equation", "Mean-field limit", "Microscopic model", "Phase transitions"], "IndexKeywords": ["Diffusion approximations", "Diffusion equations", "Dynamical networks", "Kinetic equations", "Mean field limits", "Microscopic modeling"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85027698608", "SubjectAreas": [["Modeling and Simulation", "MATH", "2611"], ["Engineering (all)", "ENGI", "2200"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"57191842530": {"Name": "Barr\u00e9 J.", "AuthorID": "57191842530", "AffiliationID": "60029631", "AffiliationName": "Institut Universitaire de France"}, "7101679756": {"Name": "Carrillo J.A.", "AuthorID": "7101679756", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, Imperial College London"}, "7005668908": {"Name": "Degond P.", "AuthorID": "7005668908", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, Imperial College London"}, "36717202900": {"Name": "Zatorska E.", "AuthorID": "36717202900", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, Imperial College London"}, "56955729600": {"Name": "Peurichard D.", "AuthorID": "56955729600", "AffiliationID": "60025988", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Mathematics, University of Vienna"}}}
