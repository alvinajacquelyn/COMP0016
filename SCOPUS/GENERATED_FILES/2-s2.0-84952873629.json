Acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) is a prevalent immune-mediated complication following HSCT. Current diagnostic biomarkers that correlate with aGVHD severity, progression, and therapy response in graft recipients are insufficient. Here, we investigated whether epigenetic marks measured in peripheral blood of healthy graft donors stratify aGVHD severity in human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched sibling recipients prior to T cell-depleted HSCT. Methods: We measured DNA methylation levels genome-wide at single-nucleotide resolution in peripheral blood of 85 HSCT donors, matched to recipients with various transplant outcomes, with Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChips. Results: Using genome-wide DNA methylation profiling, we showed that epigenetic signatures underlying aGVHD severity in recipients correspond to immune pathways relevant to aGVHD etiology. We discovered 31 DNA methylation marks in donors that associated with aGVHD severity status in recipients, and demonstrated strong predictive performance of these markers in internal cross-validation experiments (AUC = 0.98, 95 % CI = 0.96-0.99). We replicated the top-ranked CpG classifier using an alternative, clinical DNA methylation assay (P = 0.039). In an independent cohort of 32 HSCT donors, we demonstrated the utility of the epigenetic classifier in the context of a T cell-replete conditioning regimen (P = 0.050). Conclusions: Our findings suggest that epigenetic typing of HSCT donors in a clinical setting may be used in conjunction with HLA genotyping to inform both donor selection and transplantation strategy, with the ultimate aim of improving patient outcome.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "DNA Methylation", "Epigenomics", "Female", "Genotype", "Graft vs Host Disease", "Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation", "HLA Antigens", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Siblings", "T-Lymphocytes", "Tissue Donors", "Transplantation Conditioning", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84952873629", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Medicine", "BIOC", "1313"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Genetics (clinical)", "MEDI", "2716"]], "AuthorData": {"42062149600": {"Name": "Paul D.S.", "AuthorID": "42062149600", "AffiliationID": "60109234, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Cancer Institute, University College London"}, "35757123400": {"Name": "Sellar R.S.", "AuthorID": "35757123400", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, University College London, University College London Hospital"}, "6603144775": {"Name": "Mayor N.P.", "AuthorID": "6603144775", "AffiliationID": "60032819, 60020641", "AffiliationName": "Anthony Nolan Research Institute, Royal Free Hospital"}, "6506954566": {"Name": "Feber A.", "AuthorID": "6506954566", "AffiliationID": "60109234, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Cancer Institute, University College London"}, "56689271800": {"Name": "Webster A.P.", "AuthorID": "56689271800", "AffiliationID": "60109234, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Cancer Institute, University College London"}, "7202865272": {"Name": "Mackinnon S.", "AuthorID": "7202865272", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60032819", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, University College London, Royal Free Hospital"}, "55942654100": {"Name": "Marsh S.G.E.", "AuthorID": "55942654100", "AffiliationID": "60032819, 60020641", "AffiliationName": "Anthony Nolan Research Institute, Royal Free Hospital"}, "7007032979": {"Name": "Madrigal J.A.", "AuthorID": "7007032979", "AffiliationID": "60032819, 60020641", "AffiliationName": "Anthony Nolan Research Institute, Royal Free Hospital"}, "35416735200": {"Name": "Peggs K.S.", "AuthorID": "35416735200", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, University College London, University College London Hospital"}, "57193033325": {"Name": "Beck S.", "AuthorID": "57193033325", "AffiliationID": "60109234, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Cancer Institute, University College London"}, "57207018800": {"Name": "Jones A.", "AuthorID": "57207018800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Women's Cancer, UCL Elizabeth Garrett Anderson Institute for Women's Health, University College London"}, "7006520678": {"Name": "Widschwendter M.", "AuthorID": "7006520678", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Women's Cancer, UCL Elizabeth Garrett Anderson Institute for Women's Health, University College London"}, "57003115600": {"Name": "Afonso N.", "AuthorID": "57003115600", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60032819", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, University College London, Royal Free Hospital"}, "22981799500": {"Name": "Sergeant R.", "AuthorID": "22981799500", "AffiliationID": "60111785, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Immunology, Imperial NHS Trust Hammersmith Hospital"}, "7003798294": {"Name": "Szydlo R.M.", "AuthorID": "7003798294", "AffiliationID": "60020416, 60111785", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Haematology, Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, Hammersmith Hospital"}, "7005558171": {"Name": "Apperley J.F.", "AuthorID": "7005558171", "AffiliationID": "60020416, 60111785", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Haematology, Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, Hammersmith Hospital"}, "57203406919": {"Name": "Rakyan V.K.", "AuthorID": "57203406919", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Blizard Institute, Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London"}}}
