A definition for RSS is urgently needed to facilitate earlier identification and treatment. We aim to establish a European society of paediatric and neonatal intensive care (ESPNIC) experts\u2019 definition of paediatric RSS. Methods: We conducted a two-round Delphi study followed by an observational multicentre retrospective study. One hundred and fourteen paediatric intensivists answered a clinical case-based, two-round Delphi survey, identifying clinical items consistent with RSS. Multivariate analysis of these items in a development single-centre cohort (70 patients, 30 % mortality) facilitated development of RSS definitions based on either a bedside or computed severity score. Both scores were subsequently tested in a validation cohort (six centres, 424 patients, 11.6 % mortality). Results: From the Delphi process, the draft definition included evidence of myocardial dysfunction and high blood lactate levels despite high vasopressor treatment. When assessed in the development population, each item was independently associated with the need for extracorporeal life support (ECLS) or death. Resultant bedside and computed septic shock scores had high discriminative power against the need for ECLS or death, with areas under the receiver operating characteristics curve of 0.920 (95 % CI 0.89\u20130.94), and 0.956 (95 % CI 0.93\u20130.97), respectively. RSS defined by a bedside score equal to or higher than 2 and a computed score equal to or higher than 3.5 was associated with a significant increase in mortality. Conclusions: This ESPNIC definition of RSS accurately identifies children with the most severe form of septic shock.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Acidosis", "Cardiac", "Failure", "Lactic", "Paediatrics", "Resuscitation", "Septic", "Shock"], "IndexKeywords": ["Child", "Child, Preschool", "Consensus", "Delphi Technique", "Europe", "Female", "Humans", "Infant", "Intensive Care Units, Pediatric", "Lactic Acid", "Male", "Retrospective Studies", "ROC Curve", "Severity of Illness Index", "Shock, Septic", "Statistics, Nonparametric", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "Terminology as Topic", "Vasoconstrictor Agents"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84990860383", "SubjectAreas": [["Critical Care and Intensive Care Medicine", "MEDI", "2706"]], "AuthorData": {"55799039700": {"Name": "Morin L.", "AuthorID": "55799039700", "AffiliationID": "60021567", "AffiliationName": "Paediatric Intensive Care Unit, Paris South University Hospitals"}, "57205005510": {"Name": "Benissa M.R.", "AuthorID": "57205005510", "AffiliationID": "60021567", "AffiliationName": "Paediatric Intensive Care Unit, Paris South University Hospitals"}, "6603576086": {"Name": "Tissieres P.", "AuthorID": "6603576086", "AffiliationID": "60106017", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Integrative Biology of the Cell, Paris Saclay University"}, "56801266700": {"Name": "Ray S.", "AuthorID": "56801266700", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Paediatric Intensive Care Unit, Great Ormond Street Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7402415882": {"Name": "Peters M.J.", "AuthorID": "7402415882", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Paediatric Intensive Care Unit, Great Ormond Street Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "56710814300": {"Name": "Wilson C.", "AuthorID": "56710814300", "AffiliationID": "60022871", "AffiliationName": "Paediatric Intensive Care Unit, Saint-Mary\u2019s Hospital"}, "7006732624": {"Name": "Nadel S.", "AuthorID": "7006732624", "AffiliationID": "60022871", "AffiliationName": "Paediatric Intensive Care Unit, Saint-Mary\u2019s Hospital"}, "57191471848": {"Name": "Remy S.", "AuthorID": "57191471848", "AffiliationID": "112471520", "AffiliationName": "Paediatric Intensive Care Unit, Lyon University Hospitals"}, "12804572600": {"Name": "Javouhey E.", "AuthorID": "12804572600", "AffiliationID": "112471520", "AffiliationName": "Paediatric Intensive Care Unit, Lyon University Hospitals"}, "7005946881": {"Name": "Jansen N.J.G.", "AuthorID": "7005946881", "AffiliationID": "60070170, 60032724", "AffiliationName": "Paediatric Intensive Care Unit, Wilhelmina Children\u2019s Hospital, University Medical Center Utrecht"}, "6602619640": {"Name": "Kneyber M.", "AuthorID": "6602619640", "AffiliationID": "60010023", "AffiliationName": "Critical care, Anesthesiology, Peri-operative and Emergency medicine (CAPE), The University of Groningen"}, "26643168100": {"Name": "De Luca D.", "AuthorID": "26643168100", "AffiliationID": "60021567", "AffiliationName": "Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, Paris South University Hospitals"}, "16417696600": {"Name": "Schlapbach L.J.", "AuthorID": "16417696600", "AffiliationID": "60010987, 60020486", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatrics, Inselspital, Bern University Hospital, University of Bern"}, "16309857700": {"Name": "Maclaren G.", "AuthorID": "16309857700", "AffiliationID": "60106366", "AffiliationName": "Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit, National University Health System"}, "null": {"Name": null, "AuthorID": null, "AffiliationID": "113315143", "AffiliationName": "European Society of Paediatric and Neonatal Intensive Care"}}}
