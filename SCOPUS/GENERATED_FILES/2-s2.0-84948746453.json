However, adoption has been limited and uncertainty remains over its clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness. Objectives: The primary objective was to estimate the effect of EGDT compared with usual resuscitation on mortality at 90 days following randomisation and on incremental cost-effectiveness at 1 year. The secondary objectives were to compare EGDT with usual resuscitation for requirement for, and duration of, critical care unit organ support; length of stay in the emergency department (ED), critical care unit and acute hospital; health-related quality of life, resource use and costs at 90 days and at 1 ear; all-cause mortality at 28 days, at acute hospital discharge and at 1 year; and estimated lifetime incremental cost-effectiveness. Design: A pragmatic, open, multicentre, parallel-group randomised controlled trial with an integrated economic evaluation. Setting: Fifty-six NHS hospitals in England. Participants: A total of 1260 patients who presented at EDs with septic shock. Interventions: EGDT (n = 630) or usual resuscitation (n = 630). Patients were randomly allocated 1 : 1. Main outcome measures: All-cause mortality at 90 days after randomisation and incremental net benefit (at \u00a320,000 per quality-adjusted life-year) at 1 year. Results: Following withdrawals, data on 1243 (EGDT, n = 623; usual resuscitation, n = 620) patients were included in the nalysis. By 90 days, 184 (29.5%) in the EGDT and 181 (29.2%) patients in the usual-resuscitation group had died [p = 0.90; absolute risk reduction \u22120.3%, 95% confidence interval (CI) \u22125.4 to 4.7; relative risk 1.01, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.20]. Treatment intensity was greater for the EGDT group, indicated by the increased use of intravenous fluids, vasoactive drugs and red blood cell transfusions. Increased treatment intensity was reflected by significantly higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores and more advanced cardiovascular support days in critical care for the EGDT group. At 1 year, the incremental net benefit for EGDT versus usual resuscitation was negative at \u2212\u00a3725 (95% CI \u2212\u00a33000 to \u00a31550). The probability that EGDT was more cost-effective than usual resuscitation was below 30%. There were no significant differences in any other secondary outcomes, including health-related quality of life, or adverse events. Limitations: Recruitment was lower at weekends and out of hours. The intervention could not be blinded. Conclusions: There was no significant difference in all-cause mortality at 90 days for EGDT compared with usual resuscitation among adults identified with early septic shock presenting to EDs in England. On average, costs were higher in the EGDT group than in the usual-resuscitation group while quality-adjusted life-years were similar in both groups; the probability that it is cost-effective is < 30%.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Cost-Benefit Analysis", "Disease Management", "Emergency Service, Hospital", "England", "Guideline Adherence", "Humans", "Resuscitation", "Shock, Septic", "Technology Assessment, Biomedical", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84948746453", "SubjectAreas": [["Health Policy", "MEDI", "2719"]], "AuthorData": {"12795667000": {"Name": "Mouncey P.R.", "AuthorID": "12795667000", "AffiliationID": "100315961", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Trials Unit, Intensive Care National Audit and Research Centre"}, "56333792500": {"Name": "Power G.S.", "AuthorID": "56333792500", "AffiliationID": "100315961", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Trials Unit, Intensive Care National Audit and Research Centre"}, "35279884900": {"Name": "Harrison D.A.", "AuthorID": "35279884900", "AffiliationID": "100315961", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Trials Unit, Intensive Care National Audit and Research Centre"}, "36089874000": {"Name": "Jahan R.", "AuthorID": "36089874000", "AffiliationID": "100315961", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Trials Unit, Intensive Care National Audit and Research Centre"}, "57204025559": {"Name": "Tan J.C.K.", "AuthorID": "57204025559", "AffiliationID": "100315961", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Trials Unit, Intensive Care National Audit and Research Centre"}, "56227356600": {"Name": "Harvey S.E.", "AuthorID": "56227356600", "AffiliationID": "100315961", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Trials Unit, Intensive Care National Audit and Research Centre"}, "7007048381": {"Name": "Rowan K.M.", "AuthorID": "7007048381", "AffiliationID": "100315961", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Trials Unit, Intensive Care National Audit and Research Centre"}, "7103034024": {"Name": "Osborn T.M.", "AuthorID": "7103034024", "AffiliationID": "60010261", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Surgery and Emergency Medicine, Washington University"}, "24179094000": {"Name": "Sadique M.Z.", "AuthorID": "24179094000", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Health Services Research and Policy, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "56363807800": {"Name": "Grieve R.D.", "AuthorID": "56363807800", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Health Services Research and Policy, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "57203518317": {"Name": "Bell D.", "AuthorID": "57203518317", "AffiliationID": "60032993", "AffiliationName": "Department of Acute Medicine, Chelsea and Westminster Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7004435976": {"Name": "Bion J.F.", "AuthorID": "7004435976", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "Department of Intensive Care Medicine, University of Birmingham"}, "7005056660": {"Name": "Coats T.J.", "AuthorID": "7005056660", "AffiliationID": "60033125", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiovascular Sciences, University of Leicester"}, "7401654716": {"Name": "Singer M.", "AuthorID": "7401654716", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Bloomsbury Institute of Intensive Care Medicine, University College London"}, "57212075705": {"Name": "Duncan Young J.", "AuthorID": "57212075705", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Nuffield Division of Anaesthetics, University of Oxford"}}}
