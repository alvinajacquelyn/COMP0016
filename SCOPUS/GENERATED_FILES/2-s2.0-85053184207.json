Our model extends the applicability of an internal-flow multi-scale method by providing a framework to couple the internal (small scale) flow regions to the external (large scale) flow regions. We demonstrate the application of both the original methodology and the new hybrid approach to model the flow field in the vicinity of the head-disk interface gap of a hard disk drive enclosure. The internal flow regions within the gap are modelled by an extended internal-flow multi-scale method that utilises a finite-difference scheme for non-uniform grids. Our proposed hybrid multi-scale method is then employed to couple the internal micro-flow region to the flow external to the gap, to capture entrance/exit effects. We also demonstrate the successful application of the method in capturing other localised phenomena (e.g. those due to localised wall heating).", "AuthorKeywords": ["Direct simulation Monte Carlo", "Head-disk interface gap", "Hybrid methods", "Multiscale simulations", "Scale separation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Direct simulation Monte Carlo", "Head disk interface", "Hybrid method", "Multi-scale simulation", "Scale separation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85053184207", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Materials Chemistry", "MATE", "2505"]], "AuthorData": {"35146094300": {"Name": "John B.", "AuthorID": "35146094300", "AffiliationID": "60004762", "AffiliationName": "Scientific Computing Department, Daresbury Laboratory"}, "7102272761": {"Name": "Emerson D.", "AuthorID": "7102272761", "AffiliationID": "60004762", "AffiliationName": "Scientific Computing Department, Daresbury Laboratory"}, "57207556189": {"Name": "Lockerby D.", "AuthorID": "57207556189", "AffiliationID": "60022020", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering, University of Warwick"}, "55855397100": {"Name": "Patronis A.", "AuthorID": "55855397100", "AffiliationID": "60022020", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering, University of Warwick"}}}
