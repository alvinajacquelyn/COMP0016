Anchoring many depictions of their circumstances past and present, emotional and narrative structures of decline and nostalgia pervaded interviews, interactions, and the research experience here. While discourses of loss and longing pose certain methodological quandaries for attempts to reconstruct processes of change in a volatile environment, I propose that they do communicate true and valuable information for understanding the social experience of violence in Guatemala City\u2019s gang territories. I also argue for understanding nostalgia as a resource \u2013 for inhabitants and for ethnographers alike \u2013 in the face of \u2018ontological insecurity\u2019 in violent fields. Providing reassuring narratives and tools for articulating normative claims for our informants, nostalgia also holds a strong appeal for ethnographers, presenting both dilemmas and possibilities in researching and representing contemporary insecurity.", "AuthorKeywords": ["barrios", "ethnography", "gangs", "Guatemala City", "nostalgia", "ontological insecurity", "violence"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85053433187", "SubjectAreas": [["Cultural Studies", "SOCI", "3316"], ["Anthropology", "SOCI", "3314"], ["Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)", "ARTS", "1201"]], "AuthorData": {"57204221281": {"Name": "Saunders-Hastings K.", "AuthorID": "57204221281", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
