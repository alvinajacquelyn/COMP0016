A countrywide cluster-randomized cross-sectional study was performed in May 2014. At least 25 schools were sampled from each of five eco-epidemiological risk zones for schistosomiasis. Fifty randomly selected children 13-14 years of age per school were included for a single urine-circulating cathodic antigen (CCA) rapid test and, in a subset of schools, for duplicate Kato-Katz slide preparation from a single stool sample. A total of 17,331 children from 347 schools were tested using CCA. The overall prevalence of S. mansoni infection, when CCA trace results were considered negative, was 13.5% (zone range [zr] = 4.6-17.8%), and when CCA trace results were considered positive, it was 42.8% (zr = 34.3-49.9%). In 170 schools, prevalence of this infection determined using Kato-Katz method was 1.5% (zr ==0-2.7%). The overall mean intensity of S. mansoni infection determined using Kato-Katz was 0.85 eggs per gram (standard deviation = 10.86). A majority of schools (84%) were classified as non-endemic (prevalence = 0) using Kato-Katz; however, a similar proportion of schools were classified as endemic when CCA trace results were considered negative (85%) and nearly all (98%) were endemic when CCA trace results were considered positive. The findings of this nationwide reassessment using a CCA rapid test indicate that Schistosoma infection is still widespread in Burundi, although its average intensity is probably low. Further evidence is now needed to determine the association between CCA rapid test positivity and low-intensity disease transmission.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Animals", "Antigens, Helminth", "Burundi", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Feasibility Studies", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Prevalence", "Risk Factors", "Schistosoma mansoni", "Schistosomiasis mansoni", "Sensitivity and Specificity"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85016128761", "SubjectAreas": [["Parasitology", "IMMU", "2405"], ["Virology", "IMMU", "2406"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"36840156900": {"Name": "Ortu G.", "AuthorID": "36840156900", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Schistosomiasis Control Initiative (SCI), Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, Imperial College London"}, "57191919450": {"Name": "Clements M.", "AuthorID": "57191919450", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Schistosomiasis Control Initiative (SCI), Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, Imperial College London"}, "57193795493": {"Name": "Zivieri A.", "AuthorID": "57193795493", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Schistosomiasis Control Initiative (SCI), Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, Imperial College London"}, "7004545601": {"Name": "Fenwick A.", "AuthorID": "7004545601", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Schistosomiasis Control Initiative (SCI), Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, Imperial College London"}, "8917779000": {"Name": "Jourdan P.M.", "AuthorID": "8917779000", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Schistosomiasis Control Initiative (SCI), Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, Imperial College London"}, "30967620000": {"Name": "Ndayishimiye O.", "AuthorID": "30967620000", "AffiliationID": "114437172", "AffiliationName": "Programme National Int\u00e9gr\u00e9 de Lutte Contre les Maladies Tropicales N\u00e9glig\u00e9es et la C\u00e9cit\u00e9 (PNIMTNC), Minist\u00e8re de la Sant\u00e9 Publique et de la Lutte Contre le SIDA"}, "57193793354": {"Name": "Kayugi D.", "AuthorID": "57193793354", "AffiliationID": "114437172", "AffiliationName": "Programme National Int\u00e9gr\u00e9 de Lutte Contre les Maladies Tropicales N\u00e9glig\u00e9es et la C\u00e9cit\u00e9 (PNIMTNC), Minist\u00e8re de la Sant\u00e9 Publique et de la Lutte Contre le SIDA"}, "57210925939": {"Name": "Campbell C.H.", "AuthorID": "57210925939", "AffiliationID": "60029747", "AffiliationName": "Schistosomiasis Consortium for Operational Research and Evaluation (SCORE), Department of Microbiology, Center for Tropical and Emerging Global Diseases (CTEGD), University of Georgia"}, "57196589520": {"Name": "Binder S.", "AuthorID": "57196589520", "AffiliationID": "60029747", "AffiliationName": "Schistosomiasis Consortium for Operational Research and Evaluation (SCORE), Department of Microbiology, Center for Tropical and Emerging Global Diseases (CTEGD), University of Georgia"}, "7401525576": {"Name": "King C.H.", "AuthorID": "7401525576", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "7102634065": {"Name": "Colley D.G.", "AuthorID": "7102634065", "AffiliationID": "60029747", "AffiliationName": "Schistosomiasis Consortium for Operational Research and Evaluation (SCORE), Department of Microbiology, Center for Tropical and Emerging Global Diseases (CTEGD), University of Georgia"}, "36519097100": {"Name": "Lamine M.S.", "AuthorID": "36519097100", "AffiliationID": "60027142", "AffiliationName": "World Health Organization (WHO)"}, "57159188400": {"Name": "Magalhaes R.S.", "AuthorID": "57159188400", "AffiliationID": "60031004", "AffiliationName": "Children's Health Research Centre, University of Queensland"}}}
