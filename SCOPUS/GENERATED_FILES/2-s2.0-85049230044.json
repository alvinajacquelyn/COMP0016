The American Astronomical Society..The X1 flare and associated filament eruption occurring in NOAA Active Region 12017 on SOL2014-03-29 has been a source of intense study. In this work, we analyze the results of a series of nonlinear force-free field extrapolations of the flare's pre- and post-flare periods. In combination with observational data provided by the IRIS, Hinode, and Solar Dynamics Observatory missions, we have confirmed the existence of two flux ropes present within the active region prior to flaring. Of these two flux ropes, we find that intriguingly only one erupts during the X1 flare. We propose that the reason for this is due to tether cutting reconnection allowing one of the flux ropes to rise to a torus unstable region prior to flaring, thus allowing it to erupt during the subsequent flare.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Sun: activity", "Sun: filaments, prominences", "Sun: flares", "Sun: magnetic fields"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85049230044", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"57189994055": {"Name": "Woods M.M.", "AuthorID": "57189994055", "AffiliationID": "60084281, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Mullard Space Science Laboratory, University College London"}, "7004033067": {"Name": "Harra L.K.", "AuthorID": "7004033067", "AffiliationID": "60084281, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Mullard Space Science Laboratory, University College London"}, "7201477393": {"Name": "Matthews S.A.", "AuthorID": "7201477393", "AffiliationID": "60084281, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Mullard Space Science Laboratory, University College London"}, "56146292000": {"Name": "Kalmoni N.M.E.", "AuthorID": "56146292000", "AffiliationID": "60084281, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Mullard Space Science Laboratory, University College London"}, "57200712528": {"Name": "Inoue S.", "AuthorID": "57200712528", "AffiliationID": "60000264", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Space-Earth Environmental Research (ISEE), Nagoya University"}, "55441321700": {"Name": "Kusano K.", "AuthorID": "55441321700", "AffiliationID": "60000264", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Space-Earth Environmental Research (ISEE), Nagoya University"}}}
