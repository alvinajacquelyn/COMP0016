In this paper, we use this inequality to study the stability of the unique continuation in the case of the wave equation with coefficients independent of time. We prove a logarithmic estimate in a ball whose radius has an explicit dependence on the C1-norm of the coefficients and on the other geometric properties of the operator.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85042905417", "SubjectAreas": [["Analysis", "MATH", "2603"], ["Mathematics (all)", "MATH", "2600"]], "AuthorData": {"24069827900": {"Name": "Bosi R.", "AuthorID": "24069827900", "AffiliationID": "60002952", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics and Statistics, University of Helsinki"}, "6604064173": {"Name": "Lassas M.", "AuthorID": "6604064173", "AffiliationID": "60002952", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics and Statistics, University of Helsinki"}, "6602606312": {"Name": "Kurylev Y.", "AuthorID": "6602606312", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University College London"}}}
