Materials and Methods: The sequence was based on an efficient uniform density spiral acquisition, combined with data acceleration. A novel acquisition and reconstruction strategy enabled combination of UNFOLD (2\u00d7) and SENSE (3\u00d7): UNFOLD-ed SENSE. The sequence was retrospectively cardiac-gated, and a graphics processing unit (GPU) was used for rapid \u201conline\u201d reconstruction. The optimal UNFOLD parameters for the data were calculated using an in silico model. The technique was validated on a 1.5T MR scanner in 15 patients with known aortic valve disease, against a respiratory self-navigated free-breathing TPM technique. Quantitative image quality measures (velocity-to-noise and edge sharpness) were made as well as calculation of longitudinal, radial, and tangential myocardial velocities in the left ventricle. Results: The proposed breath-hold TPM data took eight heartbeats to acquire. The breath-hold TPM images had significantly higher edge sharpness (P = 0.0014) than the self-navigated TPM images, but with significantly lower velocity-to-noise ratio (P < 0.0001). There was excellent agreement (r > 0.94) in the longitudinal, radial, and tangential velocities between the self-navigated data and the proposed breath-hold TPM sequence. Conclusion: We demonstrate the feasibility of using spiral UNFOLD-ed SENSE to measure myocardial velocities using a rapid breath-hold spiral TPM sequence. This novel technique might enable accurate measurement of myocardial velocities, in a short scan time, which is especially important in a busy clinical workflow. J. MAGN. RESON.
