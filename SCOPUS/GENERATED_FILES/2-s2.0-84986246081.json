A natural consequence is a desire to secure systems containing these nodes. Unfortunately, proving that systems are secure is beyond the current state of the art, and testing for security is problematic: test cases often miss attacks that have never previously been seen. In this paper, we use Genetic Programming (GP) to create attacks against Internet of Things devices, to help identify vulnerabilities before systems are attacked for real. To assess the effectiveness of each attacker, we used it against a wireless sensor network (WSN) with publish-subscribe communications, protected by a literature artificial immune intrusion detection system (IDS). The GP attackers succeeded in suppressing significantly more legitimate messages than a hand-coded attacker, whilst decreasing the likelihood of detection. As a consequence, it was possible to tune the IDS, improving its performance. Whilst these results are preliminary, they demonstrate GP holds significant potential for improving the protection of systems with large attack spaces.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Evolutionary computation", "Routing protocols", "Wireless network attacks"], "IndexKeywords": ["Artificial immune", "Intrusion Detection Systems", "Legitimate messages", "Natural consequences", "Publish-subscribe", "Technological improvements", "Wireless communications", "Wireless sensor node"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84986246081", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Computational Theory and Mathematics", "COMP", "1703"]], "AuthorData": {"57191069294": {"Name": "Mrugala K.", "AuthorID": "57191069294", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "14632806300": {"Name": "Tuptuk N.", "AuthorID": "14632806300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "6602657397": {"Name": "Hailes S.", "AuthorID": "6602657397", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}}}
