Those wishing to set up a multisite study must undergo local Research & Development review, in addition to ethical review by a Research Ethics Committee. However, both the documentation required for multisite review and the length of time it takes to complete such a review can cause significant difficulty to researchers and add to research delays. This short article will examine the process of confirming multisite studies and the implications of current practice.", "AuthorKeywords": ["integrated research application system", "Multisite studies", "Research & Development approval"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85071160868", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["Philosophy", "ARTS", "1211"]], "AuthorData": {"56008635900": {"Name": "Ranieri V.", "AuthorID": "56008635900", "AffiliationID": "60020150", "AffiliationName": "Research Development Unit, Tavistock Centre, Tavistock Portman NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57204124031": {"Name": "Stynes H.", "AuthorID": "57204124031", "AffiliationID": "60020150", "AffiliationName": "Research Development Unit, Tavistock Centre, Tavistock Portman NHS Foundation Trust"}, "16030968700": {"Name": "Kennedy E.", "AuthorID": "16030968700", "AffiliationID": "60020150", "AffiliationName": "Research Development Unit, Tavistock Centre, Tavistock Portman NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
