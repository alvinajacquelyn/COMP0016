A two-dimensional flow model is presented which is based on mass flux, momentum, a stream-wise pressure jump across the leading edge of the body and an equi-pressure condition at the trailing edge. Linearised and numerical analyses are performed over a wide range of model parameters; the conditions under which a body is able to either emerge from or sink deeper into water are examined, with particular respect to the body\u2019s incident angle, rotation, scaled gravity and buoyancy. The findings here enlarge the existing skimming theory and give a first mathematical account of the complete life cycle of a skimming or sinking body.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Body", "Computation", "Flooding", "Fluid", "Interaction", "Mathematical modelling", "Sinking", "Skimming"], "IndexKeywords": ["Body", "Incident angles", "Interaction", "Model parameters", "Pressure conditions", "Sinking", "Skimming", "Two-dimensional flow"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85026774232", "SubjectAreas": [["Mathematics (all)", "MATH", "2600"], ["Engineering (all)", "ENGI", "2200"]], "AuthorData": {"55248576300": {"Name": "Smith F.", "AuthorID": "55248576300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "55927772100": {"Name": "Liu K.", "AuthorID": "55927772100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
