This bacterial pathogen is responsible for a variety of mild and life-threatening infections and the triggering of chronic autoimmune sequelae. Pharyngitis caused by group A Streptococcus (GAS), but not asymptomatic GAS carriage, is a prerequisite for acute rheumatic fever (ARF). Repeated bouts of ARF may trigger rheumatic heart disease (RHD), a major cause of heart failure and stroke accounting for 275,000 deaths annually. A vaccine that prevents pharyngitis would markedly reduce morbidity and mortality from ARF and RHD. Nonhuman primates (NHPs) have been utilized to model GAS diseases, and experimentally infected rhesus macaques develop pharyngitis. Here we use an NHP model of GAS pharyngitis to evaluate the efficacy of an experimental vaccine, Combo5 (arginine deiminase [ADI], C5a peptidase [SCPA], streptolysin O [SLO], interleukin-8 [IL-8] protease [SpyCEP], and trigger factor [TF]), specifically designed to exclude GAS components potentially linked to autoimmune complications. Antibody responses against all Combo5 antigens were detected in NHP serum, and immunized NHPs showed a reduction in pharyngitis and tonsillitis compared to controls. Our work establishes the NHP model as a gold standard for the assessment of GAS vaccines. IMPORTANCE GAS-related diseases disproportionally affect disadvantaged populations (e.g., indigenous populations), and development of a vaccine has been neglected. A recent strong advocacy campaign driven by the World Health Organization and the International Vaccine Institute has highlighted the urgent need for a GAS vaccine. One significant obstacle in GAS vaccine development is the lack of a widely used animal model to assess vaccine efficacy. Researchers in the field use a wide range of murine models of infection and in vitro assays, sometimes yielding conflicting results. Here we present the nonhuman primate pharyngeal infection model as a tool to assess vaccine-induced protection against colonization and clinical symptoms of pharyngitis and tonsillitis. We have tested the efficacy of an experimental vaccine candidate with promising results. We believe that the utilization of this valuable tool by the GAS vaccine research community could significantly accelerate the realization of a safe and effective GAS vaccine for humans.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Group A Streptococcus", "Immunization", "Nonhuman primates", "Streptococcus pyogenes"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Antibodies, Bacterial", "Disease Models, Animal", "Female", "Macaca mulatta", "Male", "Pharyngitis", "Streptococcal Infections", "Streptococcal Vaccines", "Streptococcus pyogenes", "Tonsillitis", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85065488944", "SubjectAreas": [["Microbiology", "IMMU", "2404"], ["Virology", "IMMU", "2406"]], "AuthorData": {"39962426000": {"Name": "Rivera-Hernandez T.", "AuthorID": "39962426000", "AffiliationID": "60031004", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry and Molecular Biosciences, The University of Queensland"}, "14824736500": {"Name": "Cork A.J.", "AuthorID": "14824736500", "AffiliationID": "60031004", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry and Molecular Biosciences, The University of Queensland"}, "55708710800": {"Name": "Davies M.R.", "AuthorID": "55708710800", "AffiliationID": "60026553, 60117340", "AffiliationName": "Peter Doherty Institute, University of Melbourne"}, "8280977800": {"Name": "Moyle P.M.", "AuthorID": "8280977800", "AffiliationID": "60031004", "AffiliationName": "School of Pharmacy, The University of Queensland"}, "57203775458": {"Name": "Toth I.", "AuthorID": "57203775458", "AffiliationID": "60031004", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry and Molecular Biosciences, The University of Queensland"}, "34974875300": {"Name": "Walker M.J.", "AuthorID": "34974875300", "AffiliationID": "60031004", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry and Molecular Biosciences, The University of Queensland"}, "35075670600": {"Name": "Carnathan D.G.", "AuthorID": "35075670600", "AffiliationID": "60000928", "AffiliationName": "Yerkes National Primate Research Center, Emory University"}, "7102565280": {"Name": "Silvestri G.", "AuthorID": "7102565280", "AffiliationID": "60000928", "AffiliationName": "Yerkes National Primate Research Center, Emory University"}, "57210246470": {"Name": "Jones S.", "AuthorID": "57210246470", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "7102190212": {"Name": "Goldblatt D.", "AuthorID": "7102190212", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "6602552086": {"Name": "Batzloff M.R.", "AuthorID": "6602552086", "AffiliationID": "60032987", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Glycomics, Griffith University"}, "55649177700": {"Name": "McCarthy J.", "AuthorID": "55649177700", "AffiliationID": "60025029, 60160422", "AffiliationName": "Australian Infectious Diseases Research Centre, QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute"}, "7003353710": {"Name": "Nizet V.", "AuthorID": "7003353710", "AffiliationID": "60030612", "AffiliationName": "Division of Host-Microbe Systems and Therapeutics, Department of Pediatrics, University of California-San Diego"}}}
