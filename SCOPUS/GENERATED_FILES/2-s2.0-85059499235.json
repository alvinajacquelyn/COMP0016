All rights reserved.Commentators have been unkind to Aristotle's account of transparency-unnecessarily so, as it turns out. I argue that that account is best understood as part of a reaction to Empedoclean puzzlement about perception at a distance. When understood in this way, Aristotle's account is both phenomenologically apt and a reasonable approximation of the truth. The first section elaborates this Empedoclean puzzlement through a brief discussion of its lingering effects. The aim is to make the difficulty vivid for modern readers. The remainder of the essay details Aristotle's discussion of the transparent in De Anima and De Sensu. Many of the misgivings of commentators are due to an uncharitable interpretation of these texts.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Aristotle", "Colour", "Empedocles", "Transparency", "Vision"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85059499235", "SubjectAreas": [["Arts and Humanities (all)", "ARTS", "1200"]], "AuthorData": {"16458840200": {"Name": "Kalderon M.E.", "AuthorID": "16458840200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL"}}}
