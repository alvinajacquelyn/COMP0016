Much of our understanding of the anisotropic swelling behavior of anode materials is based on electron microscopy and macroscopic structural analysis techniques, which are insufficient to elucidate the atomistic origin of the anisotropic swelling behavior. In this study, we perform in situ sodiation experiments with single-crystalline Sb anodes followed by atomic simulations to determine the diffusion kinetics governing the sodiation of Sb and its associated swelling behavior. In situ sodiation experiments demonstrate that the rate of diffusion of Na into single-crystalline Sb anodes differs by more than a factor of 2 depending on the orientation of the Sb crystal, causing the crystal to swell anisotropically. This observed anisotropic diffusion is explained here by determining the orientation-dependent diffusion kinetics, while the associated structural origins are clarified by studying the interfacial Na diffusion in the atomically thin layer preceding the advancing interface.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Anisotropic Diffusion", "Anisotropic swelling", "Anisotropic volume expansions", "Atomic simulations", "Diffusion kinetics", "Orientation dependent", "Single-crystalline", "Swelling behavior"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85062816606", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"], ["Materials Chemistry", "MATE", "2505"]], "AuthorData": {"57220741435": {"Name": "Choi Y.S.", "AuthorID": "57220741435", "AffiliationID": "60005273", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Korea University"}, "57077138300": {"Name": "Park J.H.", "AuthorID": "57077138300", "AffiliationID": "60005273", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Korea University"}, "13008893000": {"Name": "Lee J.C.", "AuthorID": "13008893000", "AffiliationID": "60005273", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Korea University"}, "7403019705": {"Name": "Ahn J.P.", "AuthorID": "7403019705", "AffiliationID": "60025960", "AffiliationName": "Advanced Analysis Center, Korea Institute of Science and Technology"}}}
