Ecology and Evolution published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.Mating causes many changes in physiology, behavior, and gene expression in a wide range of organisms. These changes are predicted to be sex specific, influenced by the divergent reproductive roles of the sexes. In female insects, mating is associated with an increase in egg production which requires high levels of nutritional input with direct consequences for the physiological needs of individual females. Consequently, females alter their nutritional acquisition in line with the physiological demands imposed by mating. Although much is known about the female mating-induced nutritional response, far less is known about changes in males. In addition, it is unknown whether variation between genotypes translates into variation in dietary behavioral responses. Here we examine mating-induced shifts in male and female dietary preferences across genotypes of Drosophila melanogaster. We find sex- and genotype-specific effects on both the quantity and quality of the chosen diet. These results contribute to our understanding of sex-specific metabolism and reveal genotypic variation that influences responses to physiological demands.", "AuthorKeywords": ["dietary choices", "Drosophila melanogaster", "nutrition", "sex differences"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85046348638", "SubjectAreas": [["Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics", "AGRI", "1105"], ["Ecology", "ENVI", "2303"], ["Nature and Landscape Conservation", "ENVI", "2309"]], "AuthorData": {"56251719100": {"Name": "Camus M.", "AuthorID": "56251719100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Genetics, Evolution and Environment, University College London"}, "57201879356": {"Name": "Huang C.", "AuthorID": "57201879356", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Genetics, Evolution and Environment, University College London"}, "7202271993": {"Name": "Reuter M.", "AuthorID": "7202271993", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Genetics, Evolution and Environment, University College London"}, "7103024394": {"Name": "Fowler K.", "AuthorID": "7103024394", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Genetics, Evolution and Environment, University College London"}}}
