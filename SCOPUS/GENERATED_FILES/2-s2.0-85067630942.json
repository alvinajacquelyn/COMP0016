Some studies have reported an increase in myocardial coronary blood flow in severe IUGR fetuses which has been directly associated to the dilatation of the coronary arteries. However, a direct measurement of the coronaries\u2019 lumen diameter in IUGR has not been reported before. The aim of this paper is to perform, for the first time, a quantitative analysis of the effects of IUGR in cardiac geometry and coronary vessel size in a well-known rabbit model of IUGR using synchrotron-based X-ray Phase Contrast Tomography Imaging (X-PCI). Eight rabbit fetal hearts were imaged non-destructively with X-PCI. 3D reconstructions of the coronary arterial tree were obtained after semi-automatic image segmentation. Different morphometric features including vessel lumen diameter of the three main coronaries were automatically quantified. IUGR fetuses had more globular hearts and dilated coronary arteries as compared to controls. We have quantitatively shown that IUGR leads to structural coronary vascular tree remodelling and enlargement as an adaptation mechanism in response to an adverse environment of restricted oxygen and nutrients and increased perfusion pressure.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Coronary Vessels", "Disease Models, Animal", "Female", "Fetal Growth Retardation", "Fetus", "Pregnancy", "Rabbits", "Tomography, X-Ray Computed", "Vascular Remodeling"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85067630942", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"54388912000": {"Name": "Garcia-Canadilla P.", "AuthorID": "54388912000", "AffiliationID": "60032942", "AffiliationName": "Department of Information and Communication Technologies, Universitat Pompeu Fabra"}, "7005275311": {"Name": "Bijnens B.", "AuthorID": "7005275311", "AffiliationID": "60032907", "AffiliationName": "Instituci\u00f3n Catalana de Investigaci\u00f3n y Estudios Avanzados (ICREA)"}, "55853348100": {"Name": "Zhang C.", "AuthorID": "55853348100", "AffiliationID": "60032942", "AffiliationName": "Department of Information and Communication Technologies, Universitat Pompeu Fabra"}, "57209393394": {"Name": "de Vries T.", "AuthorID": "57209393394", "AffiliationID": "60032882", "AffiliationName": "Medical Image Analysis, Technische Universiteit Eindhoven"}, "54389026500": {"Name": "Gonzalez-Tendero A.", "AuthorID": "54389026500", "AffiliationID": "60010814", "AffiliationName": "Institut d\u2019Investigacions Biom\u00e8diques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS)"}, "7005090944": {"Name": "Gratacos E.", "AuthorID": "7005090944", "AffiliationID": "122692255", "AffiliationName": "Institut de Recerca Sant Joan de D\u00e9u"}, "8923628700": {"Name": "Crispi F.", "AuthorID": "8923628700", "AffiliationID": "113034439", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Biomedical Research on Rare Diseases (CIBER-ER)"}, "52463234100": {"Name": "Bonnin A.", "AuthorID": "52463234100", "AffiliationID": "60020195", "AffiliationName": "Paul Scherrer Institute"}}}
