PROBAST (Prediction model Risk Of Bias ASsessment Tool), a tool for assessing the risk of bias (ROB) and applicability of diagnostic and prognostic prediction model studies, was developed by a steering group that considered existing ROB tools and reporting guidelines. The tool was informed by a Delphi procedure involving 38 experts and was refined through piloting. PROBAST is organized into the following 4 domains: participants, predictors, outcome, and analysis. These domains contain a total of 20 signaling questions to facilitate structured judgment of ROB, which was defined to occur when shortcomings in study design, conduct, or analysis lead to systematically distorted estimates of model predictive performance. PROBAST enables a focused and transparent approach to assessing the ROB and applicability of studies that develop, validate, or update prediction models for individualized predictions. Although PROBAST was designed for systematic reviews, it can be used more generally in critical appraisal of prediction model studies. Potential users include organizations supporting decision making, researchers and clinicians who are interested in evidence-based medicine or involved in guideline development, journal editors, and manuscript reviewers.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Bias", "Decision Support Techniques", "Delphi Technique", "Diagnosis", "Humans", "Models, Statistical", "Prognosis", "Research Design", "Systematic Reviews as Topic"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85059267182", "SubjectAreas": [["Internal Medicine", "MEDI", "2724"]], "AuthorData": {"35559911800": {"Name": "Wolff R.F.", "AuthorID": "35559911800", "AffiliationID": "60114468", "AffiliationName": "Kleijnen Systematic Reviews Ltd."}, "8954444300": {"Name": "Westwood M.", "AuthorID": "8954444300", "AffiliationID": "60114468", "AffiliationName": "Kleijnen Systematic Reviews Ltd."}, "24344322300": {"Name": "Kleijnen J.", "AuthorID": "24344322300", "AffiliationID": "60114468", "AffiliationName": "Kleijnen Systematic Reviews Ltd."}, "7004546169": {"Name": "Moons K.G.M.", "AuthorID": "7004546169", "AffiliationID": "60032724, 60007989", "AffiliationName": "Julius Centre for Health Sciences and Primary Care, UMC Utrecht, Utrecht University"}, "7004204084": {"Name": "Reitsma J.B.", "AuthorID": "7004204084", "AffiliationID": "60032724, 60007989", "AffiliationName": "Julius Centre for Health Sciences and Primary Care, UMC Utrecht, Utrecht University"}, "57202407113": {"Name": "Riley R.D.", "AuthorID": "57202407113", "AffiliationID": "60030210", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Prognosis Research, Research Institute for Primary Care and Health Sciences, Keele University"}, "7202412864": {"Name": "Whiting P.F.", "AuthorID": "7202412864", "AffiliationID": "60170515, 60020650", "AffiliationName": "NIHR CLAHRC West, University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust, School of Social and Community Medicine, University of Bristol"}, "36097775400": {"Name": "Collins G.S.", "AuthorID": "36097775400", "AffiliationID": "60002634", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Statistics in Medicine, NDORMS, University of Oxford, Botnar Research Centre"}, "57189234864": {"Name": "Mallett S.", "AuthorID": "57189234864", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Applied Health Sciences, University of Birmingham"}}}
