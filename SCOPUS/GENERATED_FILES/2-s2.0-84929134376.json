Objective: Despite CD4 + count restoration and viral load suppression with antiretroviral therapy (ART), HIV-infected children remain at increased risk of life-threatening infections including invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD). We therefore investigated whether persistent susceptibility to IPD following ART is associated with incomplete recovery of B-cell function. Methods: 41 HIV-infected Malawian children commencing ART were followed-up for a 1 year period during which time blood samples were collected at 0, 3, 6 and 12 months for comprehensive immunophenotyping and pneumomococcal-specific Memory B-cell Enzyme-Linked Immunospot assays. In addition, nasopharyngeal swab samples were cultured to determine pneumococcal carriage rates. Results: Normalization of major lymphocyte subsets such as CD4 + percentages was evident following 3 months of ART. The proportions of mature na\u00efve B cells (CD19 + CD10 - CD27 - CD21 hi ) and resting memory B cells (CD19 + CD27 + CD21 hi ) increased and apoptosis-prone mature activated B cells (CD19 + CD21 lo CD10 - ) decreased markedly by 12 months. However, in the context of high nasopharyngeal pneumococcal carriage rates (83%), restoration of pneumococcal protein antigen-specific B-cell memory was more delayed. Conclusions: These data show that, in chronically HIV-infected children receiving ART, improvement in B-cell memory profiles and function is slower than CD4 + T-cells. This supports early initiation of ART and informs research into optimal timing of immunization with pneumococcal vaccines.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Antiretroviral therapy", "Children", "ELISPOT", "HIV", "Malawi", "Memory B cells", "Pneumococcal infection"], "IndexKeywords": ["Antiretroviral Therapy, Highly Active", "B-Lymphocytes", "CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Enzyme-Linked Immunospot Assay", "HIV Infections", "Humans", "Immunophenotyping", "Lymphocyte Count", "Malawi", "Male", "Pneumococcal Infections", "Streptococcus pneumoniae", "Viral Load"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84929134376", "SubjectAreas": [["Microbiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2726"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"51665414200": {"Name": "Iwajomo O.", "AuthorID": "51665414200", "AffiliationID": "60072664, 60072678", "AffiliationName": "Malawi Liverpool Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Programme, University of Malawi College of Medicine"}, "55434886300": {"Name": "Williams N.", "AuthorID": "55434886300", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "School of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, University of Bristol"}, "7005251165": {"Name": "Heyderman R.", "AuthorID": "7005251165", "AffiliationID": "60072664, 60072678", "AffiliationName": "Malawi Liverpool Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Programme, University of Malawi College of Medicine"}, "7102196207": {"Name": "Finn A.", "AuthorID": "7102196207", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "School of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, University of Bristol"}, "44661289000": {"Name": "Nkhata R.", "AuthorID": "44661289000", "AffiliationID": "60072664, 60072678", "AffiliationName": "Malawi Liverpool Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Programme, University of Malawi College of Medicine"}, "36993247500": {"Name": "Mzinza D.", "AuthorID": "36993247500", "AffiliationID": "60072664, 60072678", "AffiliationName": "Malawi Liverpool Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Programme, University of Malawi College of Medicine"}, "24077141400": {"Name": "Moons P.", "AuthorID": "24077141400", "AffiliationID": "60072664", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatrics, University of Malawi College of Medicine"}, "7006518285": {"Name": "Ogunniyi A.", "AuthorID": "7006518285", "AffiliationID": "60009512", "AffiliationName": "Research Centre for Infectious Diseases, School of Molecular and Biomedical Science, The University of Adelaide"}}}
