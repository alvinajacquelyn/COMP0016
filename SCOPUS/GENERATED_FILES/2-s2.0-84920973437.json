With this integrated stress framework, they hypothesized that couple-level minority stressors may be experienced by individual partners and jointly by couples as a result of the stigmatized status of their same-sex relationship-a novel concept. They also consider dyadic minority stress processes, which result from the relational experience of individual-level minority stressors between partners. Because this framework includes stressors emanating from both status-based (e.g., sexual minority) and role-based (e.g., partner) stress domains, it facilitates the study of stress proliferation linking minority stress (e.g., discrimination), more commonly experienced relational stress (e.g., conflict), and mental health. This framework can be applied to the study of stress and health among other marginalized couples, such as interracial/ethnic, interfaith, and age-discrepant couples.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Dyadic/couple data", "Gay, lesbian, bisexual mental health", "Stress coping and/or resiliency", "Theory construction"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84920973437", "SubjectAreas": [["Anthropology", "SOCI", "3314"], ["Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)", "ARTS", "1201"], ["Social Sciences (miscellaneous)", "SOCI", "3301"]], "AuthorData": {"7103232966": {"Name": "Leblanc A.", "AuthorID": "7103232966", "AffiliationID": "60027627", "AffiliationName": "Sociology/Health Equity Institute, San Francisco State University"}, "12807081700": {"Name": "Frost D.", "AuthorID": "12807081700", "AffiliationID": "60027565, 60030162", "AffiliationName": "Columbia University, Mailman School of Public Health, Department of Population and Family Health"}, "57206335399": {"Name": "Wight R.", "AuthorID": "57206335399", "AffiliationID": "60029270", "AffiliationName": "UCLA Fielding School of Public Health, Department of Community Health Sciences"}}}
