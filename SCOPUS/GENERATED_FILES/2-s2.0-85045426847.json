Co-registration of an EUS device and a pre-procedure 3D image can enhance the ability to navigate. However, the fidelity of this contextual information depends on the accuracy of registration. The purpose of this study was to develop and test the feasibility of a simulation-based planning method for pre-selecting patient-specific EUS-visible anatomical landmark locations to maximise the accuracy and robustness of a feature-based multimodality registration method. Methods: A registration approach was adopted in which landmarks are registered to anatomical structures segmented from the pre-procedure volume. The predicted target registration errors (TREs) of EUS-CT registration were estimated using simulated visible anatomical landmarks and a Monte Carlo simulation of landmark localisation error. The optimal planes were selected based on the 90th percentile of TREs, which provide a robust and more accurate EUS-CT registration initialisation. The method was evaluated by comparing the accuracy and robustness of registrations initialised using optimised planes versus non-optimised planes using manually segmented CT images and simulated (n= 9) or retrospective clinical (n= 1) EUS landmarks. Results: The results show a lower 90th percentile TRE when registration is initialised using the optimised planes compared with a non-optimised initialisation approach (p value < 0.01). Conclusions: The proposed simulation-based method to find optimised EUS planes and landmarks for EUS-guided procedures may have the potential to improve registration accuracy. Further work will investigate applying the technique in a clinical setting.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Computer-assisted interventions", "EUS", "Image registration", "Pancreatic cancer", "Planning"], "IndexKeywords": ["Endosonography", "Humans", "Imaging, Three-Dimensional", "Pancreas", "Pancreatectomy", "Pancreatic Neoplasms", "Retrospective Studies", "Surgery, Computer-Assisted", "Tomography, X-Ray Computed"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85045426847", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"], ["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"], ["Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition", "COMP", "1707"], ["Health Informatics", "MEDI", "2718"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Computer Graphics and Computer-Aided Design", "COMP", "1704"]], "AuthorData": {"56578552900": {"Name": "Bonmati E.", "AuthorID": "56578552900", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60020649", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome/EPSRC Centre for Interventional and Surgical Science, University College London"}, "24512208500": {"Name": "Hu Y.", "AuthorID": "24512208500", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60020649", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome/EPSRC Centre for Interventional and Surgical Science, University College London"}, "36026807300": {"Name": "Gibson E.", "AuthorID": "36026807300", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60020649", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome/EPSRC Centre for Interventional and Surgical Science, University College London"}, "7006920406": {"Name": "Clarkson M.J.", "AuthorID": "7006920406", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60020649", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome/EPSRC Centre for Interventional and Surgical Science, University College London"}, "7005201740": {"Name": "Barratt D.C.", "AuthorID": "7005201740", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60020649", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome/EPSRC Centre for Interventional and Surgical Science, University College London"}, "57188840486": {"Name": "Uribarri L.", "AuthorID": "57188840486", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Liver and Digestive Health, University College London"}, "57201640981": {"Name": "Keane G.", "AuthorID": "57201640981", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Liver and Digestive Health, University College London"}, "55944100900": {"Name": "Pereira S.P.", "AuthorID": "55944100900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Liver and Digestive Health, University College London"}, "57201638801": {"Name": "Gurusami K.", "AuthorID": "57201638801", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Surgery and Interventional Science, University College London"}, "7402965763": {"Name": "Davidson B.", "AuthorID": "7402965763", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Surgery and Interventional Science, University College London"}}}
