Taking an experimental approach, we systematically explore the dynamics of user engagement with a smartphone through three different studies. Specifically, to understand the feasibility of detecting user engagement from mobile context, we first assess an EEG artifact with 10 users and observe a strong correlation between automatically detected engagement scores and user's subjective perception of engagement. Grounded on this result, we model a set of application level features derived from smartphone usage of 10 users to detect engagement of a usage session using a Random Forest classifier. Finally, we apply this model to train a variety of contextual factors acquired from smartphone usage logs of 130 users to predict user engagement using an SVM classifier with a F1-Score of 0.82. Our experimental results highlight the potential of mobile contexts in designing engagement-aware applications and provide guidance to future explorations.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Behaviour modelling", "EEG", "Engagement", "Mobile sensing"], "IndexKeywords": ["Behaviour modelling", "Contextual factors", "Engagement", "Experimental approaches", "Mobile sensing", "Random forest classifier", "Strong correlation", "Subjective perceptions"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84991497871", "SubjectAreas": [["Information Systems", "COMP", "1710"], ["Hardware and Architecture", "COMP", "1708"], ["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"], ["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Human-Computer Interaction", "COMP", "1709"]], "AuthorData": {"25923502200": {"Name": "Mathur A.", "AuthorID": "25923502200", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60021378", "AffiliationName": "Nokia Bell Labs, University College London"}, "23135333200": {"Name": "Lane N.D.", "AuthorID": "23135333200", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60021378", "AffiliationName": "Nokia Bell Labs, University College London"}, "8927207400": {"Name": "Kawsar F.", "AuthorID": "8927207400", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60021378", "AffiliationName": "Nokia Bell Labs, University College London"}}}
