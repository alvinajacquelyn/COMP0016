Our aim was to examine the relative lifetime prevalence of migraine in people with epilepsy (PWE) as well that of epilepsy in migraineurs. We carried out a systematic review, searching five electronic databases, specified bibliographies and conference abstracts in order to identify population-based studies that measured the lifetime co-prevalence of migraine and epilepsy. Two reviewers independently screened all titles and abstracts, carried out a risk of bias assessment and extracted the data. Meta-analyses were carried out using random effects models. Of the 3640 abstracts and titles screened, we identified 10 eligible studies encompassing a total of 1 548 967 subjects. Few of the studies used validated case ascertainment tools and there were inconsistent attempts to control for confounding. There was an overall 52% increase in the prevalence of migraine among PWE versus those without epilepsy [PR: 1.52 (95% CI: 1.29, 1.79)]. There was an overall 79% increase in the prevalence of epilepsy among migraineurs versus those without migraine [PR: 1.79 (95% CI: 1.43, 2.25)]. Subgroup analyses revealed that the method of ascertaining the epilepsy or migraine status of subjects was an important source of inter-study heterogeneity. Additional high quality primary studies are required, ones that use validated and accurate methods of case ascertainment as well as control for potential confounders.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Comorbidity", "Epidemiology", "Epilepsy", "Migraine", "Prevalence study"], "IndexKeywords": ["Comorbidity", "Epilepsy", "Humans", "Migraine Disorders"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84930759058", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"18437280500": {"Name": "Keezer M.R.", "AuthorID": "18437280500", "AffiliationID": "60024544, 60019953", "AffiliationName": "NIHR University College London Hospitals Biomedical Research Centre, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "57188659835": {"Name": "Sander J.W.", "AuthorID": "57188659835", "AffiliationID": "60030943", "AffiliationName": "Epilepsy Society"}, "55576958900": {"Name": "Bauer P.R.", "AuthorID": "55576958900", "AffiliationID": "60027759", "AffiliationName": "Stichting Epilepsie Instellingen Nederland (SEIN)"}, "55349930200": {"Name": "Ferrari M.D.", "AuthorID": "55349930200", "AffiliationID": "60015618", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Leiden University Medical Centre"}}}
