All rights reserved.Background: Clinical practice guidelines for dementia highlight the importance of providing patient-centered care. This can be achieved by improving health professionals' attitudes and knowledge toward people with dementia. Objective: Quantitatively evaluate the impact of a virtual dementia experience on medical and pharmacy students' knowledge and attitudes toward people with dementia. Methods: A non-randomized controlled study from September-October 2016. The intervention group received a 1.5-hour multisensory, virtual simulation of light, sound, color, and visual content to experience the cognitive and perceptual difficulties faced by people with dementia. Controls participated in the standard curriculum only. All students were invited to complete the 20-item Dementia Attitudes Scale (DAS) pre- and post-intervention. Results: A total of 278 students (n = 64 medical, n = 214 pharmacy) were analyzed (n = 80 intervention, n = 198 control). The majority of students were female (n = 184, 66.2%), with an average age of 22.5 years. The intervention improved the DAS total score and subdomains of comfort and knowledge (p < 0.001). Conclusion: The intervention had a positive impact on medical and pharmacy students' knowledge and attitudes toward people with dementia.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alzheimer's disease", "dementia", "education", "medicine", "pharmacy"], "IndexKeywords": ["Australia", "Curriculum", "Dementia", "Female", "Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice", "Humans", "Male", "Students, Medical", "Students, Pharmacy", "Virtual Reality", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85043590026", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Clinical Psychology", "PSYC", "3203"], ["Geriatrics and Gerontology", "MEDI", "2717"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"55621888000": {"Name": "Gilmartin-Thomas J.F.M.", "AuthorID": "55621888000", "AffiliationID": "60016379", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Practice and Policy, University College London School of Pharmacy"}, "55623402100": {"Name": "McNeil J.", "AuthorID": "55623402100", "AffiliationID": "60019578, 60012932", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine, School of Public Health and Preventive Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences, Monash University"}, "7402000381": {"Name": "Wolfe R.", "AuthorID": "7402000381", "AffiliationID": "60019578, 60012932", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine, School of Public Health and Preventive Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences, Monash University"}, "35508107000": {"Name": "Bell J.S.", "AuthorID": "35508107000", "AffiliationID": "60019578", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medicine Use and Safety, Faculty of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Monash University"}, "57201152537": {"Name": "Powell A.", "AuthorID": "57201152537", "AffiliationID": "60012932, 60019578", "AffiliationName": "Central Clinical School, Faculty of Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences, Monash University"}, "6507509776": {"Name": "Kipen E.", "AuthorID": "6507509776", "AffiliationID": "60189664", "AffiliationName": "Aged Care Service, Caulfield Hospital, Alfred Health"}, "7102595901": {"Name": "Malone D.T.", "AuthorID": "7102595901", "AffiliationID": "60134796, 60019578", "AffiliationName": "Monash Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Faculty of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Monash University"}, "6603971855": {"Name": "Larson I.C.", "AuthorID": "6603971855", "AffiliationID": "60134796, 60019578", "AffiliationName": "Monash Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Faculty of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Monash University"}, "22935322700": {"Name": "O'Reilly C.L.", "AuthorID": "22935322700", "AffiliationID": "60025709", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Sydney"}, "15925293100": {"Name": "Kirkpatrick C.M.", "AuthorID": "15925293100", "AffiliationID": "60019578", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medicine Use and Safety, Faculty of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Monash University"}, "57201157545": {"Name": "Petrovich T.", "AuthorID": "57201157545", "AffiliationID": "60189137", "AffiliationName": "Dementia Australia VIC"}}}
