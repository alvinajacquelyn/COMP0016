Financial incentives and quasi-mandatory policies (restricting access to child care or educational settings to fully vaccinated children) have been used to increase uptake internationally, but not in the UK. Objective: To provide evidence on the effectiveness, acceptability and economic costs and consequences of parental financial incentives and quasi-mandatory schemes for increasing the uptake of preschool vaccinations. Design: Systematic review, qualitative study and discrete choice experiment (DCE) with questionnaire. Setting: Community, health and education settings in England. Participants: Qualitative study \u2013 parents and carers of preschool children, health and educational professionals. DCE \u2013 parents and carers of preschool children identified as \u2018at high risk\u2019 and \u2018not at high risk\u2019 of incompletely vaccinating their children. Data sources: Qualitative study \u2013 focus groups and individual interviews. DCE \u2013 online questionnaire. Review methods: The review included studies exploring the effectiveness, acceptability or economic costs and consequences of interventions that offered contingent rewards or penalties with real material value for preschool vaccinations, or quasi-mandatory schemes that restricted access to \u2018universal\u2019 services, compared with usual care or no intervention. Electronic database, reference and citation searches were conducted. Results: Systematic review \u2013 there was insufficient evidence to conclude that the interventions considered are effective. There was some evidence that the quasi-mandatory interventions were acceptable. There was insufficient evidence to draw conclusions on economic costs and consequences. Qualitative study \u2013 there was little appetite for parental financial incentives. Quasi-mandatory schemes were more acceptable. Optimising current services was consistently preferred to the interventions proposed. DCE and questionnaire \u2013 universal parental financial incentives were preferred to quasi-mandatory interventions, which were preferred to targeted incentives. Those reporting that they would need an incentive to vaccinate their children completely required around \u00a3110. Those who did not felt that the maximum acceptable incentive was around \u00a370. Limitations: Systematic review \u2013 a number of relevant studies were excluded as they did not meet the study design inclusion criteria. Qualitative study \u2013 few partially and non-vaccinating parents were recruited. DCE and questionnaire \u2013 data were from a convenience sample. Conclusions: There is little current evidence on the effectiveness or economic costs and consequences of parental financial incentives and quasi-mandatory interventions for preschool vaccinations. Universal incentives are likely to be more acceptable than targeted ones. Preferences concerning incentives versus quasi-mandatory interventions may depend on the context in which these are elicited.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Child, Preschool", "Humans", "Motivation", "Parents", "Patient Acceptance of Health Care", "Qualitative Research", "Reward", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "United Kingdom", "Vaccination"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84947275876", "SubjectAreas": [["Health Policy", "MEDI", "2719"]], "AuthorData": {"7404784266": {"Name": "Adams J.", "AuthorID": "7404784266", "AffiliationID": "60031101, 60009969", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Diet and Activity Research, Medical Research Council Epidemiology Unit, University of Cambridge"}, "7006113823": {"Name": "Bateman B.", "AuthorID": "7006113823", "AffiliationID": "60014645", "AffiliationName": "Department of Child Health, Northumbria Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust"}, "56974626000": {"Name": "Becker F.", "AuthorID": "56974626000", "AffiliationID": "60026712, 60006222", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Health and Society, Newcastle University"}, "8047765300": {"Name": "Flynn D.", "AuthorID": "8047765300", "AffiliationID": "60026712, 60006222", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Health and Society, Newcastle University"}, "24759085200": {"Name": "Oluboyede Y.", "AuthorID": "24759085200", "AffiliationID": "60026712, 60006222", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Health and Society, Newcastle University"}, "55650755000": {"Name": "Robalino S.", "AuthorID": "55650755000", "AffiliationID": "60026712, 60006222", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Health and Society, Newcastle University"}, "24367538900": {"Name": "Ternent L.", "AuthorID": "24367538900", "AffiliationID": "60026712, 60006222", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Health and Society, Newcastle University"}, "8550046900": {"Name": "Sniehotta F.F.", "AuthorID": "8550046900", "AffiliationID": "60186277", "AffiliationName": "Fuse (The Centre for Translational Research in Public Health)"}, "24781303100": {"Name": "Wigham S.", "AuthorID": "24781303100", "AffiliationID": "60026712, 60006222", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Health and Society, Newcastle University"}, "56963775900": {"Name": "Cresswell T.", "AuthorID": "56963775900", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "Health Protection, North East Public Health England Centre"}, "52464271500": {"Name": "McNaughton R.", "AuthorID": "52464271500", "AffiliationID": "60186277", "AffiliationName": "Fuse (The Centre for Translational Research in Public Health)"}, "6507687054": {"Name": "Shucksmith J.", "AuthorID": "6507687054", "AffiliationID": "60186277", "AffiliationName": "Fuse (The Centre for Translational Research in Public Health)"}, "56963672200": {"Name": "Sood B.G.", "AuthorID": "56963672200", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King\u2019s College London"}, "7004779970": {"Name": "Michie S.", "AuthorID": "7004779970", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Behaviour Change, University College London"}}}
