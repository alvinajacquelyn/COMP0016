In particular, acquiring ground truth 3D shapes of objects pictured in 2D images remains a challenging feat and this has hampered progress in recognition-based object reconstruction from a single image. Here we propose to bypass previous solutions such as 3D scanning or manual design, that scale poorly, and instead populate object category detection datasets semi-automatically with dense, per-object 3D reconstructions, bootstrapped from:(i) class labels, (ii) ground truth figure-ground segmentations and (iii) a small set of keypoint annotations. Our proposed algorithm first estimates camera viewpoint using rigid structure-from-motion and then reconstructs object shapes by optimizing over visual hull proposals guided by loose within-class shape similarity assumptions. The visual hull sampling process attempts to intersect an object's projection cone with the cones of minimal subsets of other similar objects among those pictured from certain vantage points. We show that our method is able to produce convincing per-object 3D reconstructions and to accurately estimate cameras viewpoints on one of the most challenging existing object-category detection datasets, PASCAL VOC. We hope that our results will re-stimulate interest on joint object recognition and 3D reconstruction from a single image.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Object reconstruction", "structure-from-motion", "viewpoint estimation", "Visual hulls"], "IndexKeywords": ["3D reconstruction", "Figure-ground segmentations", "Object category detection", "Object reconstruction", "Sampling process", "Shape similarity", "Structure from motion", "Visual hulls"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84976340358", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition", "COMP", "1707"], ["Computational Theory and Mathematics", "COMP", "1703"], ["Artificial Intelligence", "COMP", "1702"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"7006788380": {"Name": "Carreira J.", "AuthorID": "7006788380", "AffiliationID": "60106429, 60020985", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Systems and Robotics, University of Coimbra"}, "24829674800": {"Name": "Vicente S.", "AuthorID": "24829674800", "AffiliationID": "60121112", "AffiliationName": "Anthropics Technology Ltd."}, "12752515600": {"Name": "Agapito L.", "AuthorID": "12752515600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "7005814266": {"Name": "Batista J.", "AuthorID": "7005814266", "AffiliationID": "60106429, 60020985", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Systems and Robotics, Department of Electrical Engineering and Computers, University of Coimbra"}}}
