Diagnostic principles are aimed at excluding MM requiring therapy, other conditions associated with paraproteins that may require different management, and risk stratifying patients for the purposes of tailored follow-up and investigation. The International Myeloma Working Group have recently published a revised definition of MM, which singles out a small group of patients with smoldering multiple myeloma who are at very high risk of progression and organ damage; such patients are now included under the definition of MM and recommended to start anti-myeloma treatment. Furthermore, the recently published National Institute of Health and Care Excellence guideline recommends cross-sectional imaging techniques in place of skeletal survey. These recent recommendations are discussed, and practical guidance for investigation and management are presented.", "AuthorKeywords": ["gammopathy", "myeloma", "paraprotein", "plasma cells", "smoldering"], "IndexKeywords": ["Disease Progression", "Humans", "Monoclonal Gammopathy of Undetermined Significance", "Prognosis", "Risk Factors", "Smoldering Multiple Myeloma"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84996549024", "SubjectAreas": [["Hematology", "MEDI", "2720"], ["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Cancer Research", "BIOC", "1306"]], "AuthorData": {"57191750104": {"Name": "Maciocia N.", "AuthorID": "57191750104", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, University College London Hospitals"}, "6506002568": {"Name": "Wechalekar A.", "AuthorID": "6506002568", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "National Amyloidosis Centre, University College London"}, "7102064249": {"Name": "Yong K.", "AuthorID": "7102064249", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, Cancer Institute, University College London"}}}
