Methods: Use of literature around empathy, consultation and pharmacy practice to develop a case for greater clinical empathy in pharmacy consultations. Key findings: Clinical empathy is defined from the literature and applied to pharmacy consultations, with a comparison to empathy in other clinical professions. Historical barriers to the embedding of clinical empathy into pharmacy consultations are also explored. Conclusions: We challenge the pharmacy profession to consider how clinical empathy should underpin consultations with a series of introspective questions and provide some sample questions to support pharmacy consultations. We also make the case for appropriate education and professional development of consultation skills at undergraduate and postgraduate level. We contend that patients\u2019 relationships with practitioners are critical, and a lack of empathy can impact the effectiveness of care.", "AuthorKeywords": ["clinical empathy", "patient experience", "pharmacists"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84987722744", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmacy", "HEAL", "3611"], ["Pharmaceutical Science", "PHAR", "3003"], ["Health Policy", "MEDI", "2719"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"56009117500": {"Name": "Jubraj B.", "AuthorID": "56009117500", "AffiliationID": "60177635", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Pharmaceutical Science, King's College"}, "26038916800": {"Name": "Auyeung V.", "AuthorID": "26038916800", "AffiliationID": "60177635", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Pharmaceutical Science, King's College"}, "7102019280": {"Name": "Barnett N.L.", "AuthorID": "7102019280", "AffiliationID": "60031535", "AffiliationName": "Medicines Use and Safety Division, NHS Specialist Pharmacy Service, Pharmacy Department, Northwick Park Hospital"}, "55861835800": {"Name": "Grimes L.", "AuthorID": "55861835800", "AffiliationID": "60172345, 60003771", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Pharmacy Postgraduate Education, Manchester Pharmacy School, University of Manchester"}, "14029404500": {"Name": "Varia S.", "AuthorID": "14029404500", "AffiliationID": "101032751", "AffiliationName": "London Pharmacy Education and Training"}, "54408176900": {"Name": "Chater A.", "AuthorID": "54408176900", "AffiliationID": "60016379", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy, Centre for Behavioural Medicine, Department of Practice and Policy"}}}
