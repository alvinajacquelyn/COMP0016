We present a radiative transfer simulation of cosmic reionization driven by galaxies that reproduces this large scatter and the rapid evolution of the Ly \u03b1 opacity distribution at 5 < z < 6. The simulation also reproduces the low Thomson scattering optical depth reported by the latest cosmic microwave background (CMB) measurement and is consistent with the observed short near-zones and strong red damping wings in the highest redshift QSOs. It also matches the rapid disappearance of observed Ly \u03b1 emission by galaxies at z \u2265 6. Reionization is complete at z = 5.3 in our model, and 50 per cent of the volume of the Universe is ionized at z = 7. Agreement with the Ly \u03b1 forest data in such a late reionization model requires a rapid evolution of the ionizing emissivity of galaxies that peaks at z \u223c6.8. The late end of reionization results in a large scatter in the photoionization rate and the neutral hydrogen fraction at redshifts as low as z \u2264 5.5 with large residual neutral 'islands' that can produce very long Gunn-Peterson troughs resembling those seen in the data.", "AuthorKeywords": ["dark ages, reionization, first stars", "galaxies: high-redshift", "intergalactic medium", "quasars: absorption lines", "radiative transfer"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85065088015", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"28367768500": {"Name": "Kulkarni G.", "AuthorID": "28367768500", "AffiliationID": "60031855", "AffiliationName": "Department of Theoretical Physics, Tata Institute of Fundamental Research"}, "7003612136": {"Name": "Haehnelt M.G.", "AuthorID": "7003612136", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Kavli Institute of Cosmology, University of Cambridge"}, "57203392175": {"Name": "Puchwein E.", "AuthorID": "57203392175", "AffiliationID": "60000677", "AffiliationName": "Leibniz-Institut f\u00fcr Astrophysik Potsdam (AIP)"}, "56023917900": {"Name": "Keating L.C.", "AuthorID": "56023917900", "AffiliationID": "60017159, 60016849", "AffiliationName": "Canadian Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics, University of Toronto"}, "56801633200": {"Name": "Bosman S.E.I.", "AuthorID": "56801633200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "55339082000": {"Name": "Chardin J.", "AuthorID": "55339082000", "AffiliationID": "60000108", "AffiliationName": "Observatoire Astronomique de Strasbourg"}, "57189940659": {"Name": "Aubert D.", "AuthorID": "57189940659", "AffiliationID": "60000108", "AffiliationName": "Observatoire Astronomique de Strasbourg"}}}
