To achieve this, we design a type system for implementing apluggable checker on the Java's compiler and find at compile timeinsufficient checking bugs that can lead to application crashesdue to malformed inputs. Our goal is to wrap methods whenthey receive external inputs so that the former generate checkedinstead of unchecked exceptions. We believe that our approachcan improve Java developers' productivity, by using exceptionhandling only when it is required, and ensure client applications'stability. We want to evaluate our checker by using it to verifythe source code of Java projects from the Apache ecosystem. Also, we want to analyze stack traces to validate the identifiedfailures by our checker.", "AuthorKeywords": ["application programming interfaces", "exceptions", "type systems"], "IndexKeywords": ["Application execution", "Client applications", "Erroneous users", "exceptions", "External input", "Java developers", "Source codes", "Type systems"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85026740228", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"]], "AuthorData": {"36634273100": {"Name": "Kechagia M.", "AuthorID": "36634273100", "AffiliationID": "60019507", "AffiliationName": "Department of Management Science and Technology, Athens University of Economics and Business"}, "35566637400": {"Name": "Spinellis D.", "AuthorID": "35566637400", "AffiliationID": "60019507", "AffiliationName": "Department of Management Science and Technology, Athens University of Economics and Business"}}}
