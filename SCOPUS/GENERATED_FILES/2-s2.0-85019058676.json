In this study, six multilingual Singaporean raters judged the accentedness and comprehensibility of 50 unfamiliar accented speech samples produced by Japanese learners of English with different proficiency levels. In order to investigate rater judgement, the rating scores were subjected to a multifaceted Rasch analysis. A questionnaire and an interview elicited the raters\u2019 retrospective reports on their language backgrounds at three time points in their life (when they were 5, 11, and 21 years old). The results suggested that the raters\u2019 language backgrounds, notably the proficiency balance between multiple languages in early childhood, are related to their rating judgement.", "AuthorKeywords": ["foreign accent", "Multilingualism", "rater severity", "second language pronunciation", "speech perception"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85019058676", "SubjectAreas": [["Language and Linguistics", "ARTS", "1203"], ["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["Linguistics and Language", "SOCI", "3310"]], "AuthorData": {"36989820600": {"Name": "Shintani N.", "AuthorID": "36989820600", "AffiliationID": "60005686", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Education, University of Auckland"}, "36515364100": {"Name": "Saito K.", "AuthorID": "36515364100", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Department of Applied Linguistics and Communication, Birkbeck, University of London"}, "30467835800": {"Name": "Koizumi R.", "AuthorID": "30467835800", "AffiliationID": "60032116", "AffiliationName": "School of Medicine, Juntendo University"}}}
