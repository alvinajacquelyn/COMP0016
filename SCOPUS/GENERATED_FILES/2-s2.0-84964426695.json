Now a hitherto unstudied letter from the author suggests that it should also be read as a 'counter-travelogue', a polemical reply to a foreign account of Ragusa. This study sets Ferrich's Periegesis in context, examining its relationship to Francesco Maria Appendini's Notizie (1802-03); the different models Ferrich may have drawn upon in framing his text; and the insights into particular images provided by a polemical reply to Ferrich composed by Marin Zlatarich. Ferrich's Periegesis emerges as a 'discreet' polemic, with different messages addressed to its domestic readers on the one hand and its foreign audience on the other.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Counter-travelogue", "Duro Feri\u0107", "Marin Zlatari\u0107", "Transnational cultural exchange", "Travel polemics"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84964426695", "SubjectAreas": [["History", "ARTS", "1202"]], "AuthorData": {"6506637921": {"Name": "Bracewell W.", "AuthorID": "6506637921", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of South East European History, School of Slavonic and East European Studies, University College London UCL"}}}
