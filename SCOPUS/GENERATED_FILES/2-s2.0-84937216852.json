Aims To investigate the relationship between specific parasomnias (nightmares, night terrors and sleepwalking) in childhood and later adolescent psychotic experiences. Method The sample comprised 4720 individuals from a UK birth cohort. Mothers reported on children's experience of regular nightmares at several time points between 2 and 9 years. Experience of nightmares, night terrors and sleepwalking was assessed using a semi-structured interview at age 12. Psychotic experiences were assessed at ages 12 and 18 using a semi-structured clinical interview. Results There was a significant association between the presence of nightmares at 12 and psychotic experiences at 18 when adjusted for possible confounders and psychotic experiences at 12 (OR = 1.62, 95% CI 1.19-2.20). The odds ratios were larger for those who reported persistent psychotic experiences. Conclusions The presence of nightmares might be an early risk indicator for psychosis.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Child", "Cohort Studies", "Dreams", "Female", "Humans", "Interviews as Topic", "Male", "Mothers", "Parasomnias", "Psychotic Disorders", "Risk Factors", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84937216852", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"35747569500": {"Name": "Thompson A.", "AuthorID": "35747569500", "AffiliationID": "60000064, 60022020", "AffiliationName": "Division of Mental Health and Wellbeing, Warwick Medical School, University of Warwick"}, "55660295300": {"Name": "Lereya S.T.", "AuthorID": "55660295300", "AffiliationID": "60022020", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, University of Warwick"}, "7402636617": {"Name": "Lewis G.", "AuthorID": "7402636617", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, University College London"}, "6603745740": {"Name": "Zammit S.", "AuthorID": "6603745740", "AffiliationID": "60023998, 60170145, 60020650", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Neuropsychiatric Genetics and Genomics, Cardiff University, University of Bristol"}, "9235818300": {"Name": "Fisher H.L.", "AuthorID": "9235818300", "AffiliationID": "60015879, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "MRC Social, Genetic and Developmental Psychiatry Centre, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London"}, "7003469597": {"Name": "Wolke D.", "AuthorID": "7003469597", "AffiliationID": "60022020", "AffiliationName": "Division of Mental Health and Wellbeing, Department of Psychology, University of Warwick"}}}
