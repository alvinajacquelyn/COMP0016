Perakis and P. Hamm, Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 14, 6250 (2012); L. Shi et al., ibid. 18, 3772 (2016)]. Ice II, ice V, and ice XIII have been chosen for this study, since this selection covers many aspects of the polymorphism of ice. That is, ice II is a hydrogen-ordered phase of ice, in contrast to ice Ih, while ice V and ice XIII are a hydrogen-disordered/ordered couple that shares essentially the same oxygen structure and hydrogen-bonded network. For the transmission 2D IR spectroscopy, a novel method had to be developed for the preparation of ultrathin films (1-2 \u03bcm) of high-pressure ices with good optical quality. We also simulated 2D IR spectra based on molecular dynamics simulations connected to a vibrational exciton picture. These simulations agree with the experimental results in a semi-quantitative manner for ice II, while the same approach failed for ice V and ice XIII. From the perspective of 2D IR spectroscopy, ice II appears to be more inhomogeneously broadened than ice Ih, despite its hydrogen-order, which we attribute to the fact that ice II is structurally more complex with four distinguishable hydrogen bonds that mix due to exciton coupling. Ice V and ice XIII, on the other hand, behave as expected with the hydrogen-disordered case (ice V) being more inhomogenously broadened. Furthermore, in all hydrogen-ordered forms (ice II and ice XIII), cross peaks could be identified in the anisotropic 2D IR spectrum, whose signs reveal the relative direction of the corresponding excitonic states.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Exciton coupling", "Good optical quality", "High-pressure form", "High-pressure phasis", "Hydrogen bonded network", "Molecular dynamics simulations", "Oxygen structures", "Vibrational excitons"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85031295762", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"]], "AuthorData": {"57189084337": {"Name": "Tran H.", "AuthorID": "57189084337", "AffiliationID": "60012614", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Z\u00fcrich"}, "23098422900": {"Name": "Shalit A.", "AuthorID": "23098422900", "AffiliationID": "60012614", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Z\u00fcrich"}, "7006380522": {"Name": "Hamm P.", "AuthorID": "7006380522", "AffiliationID": "60012614", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Z\u00fcrich"}, "56340889000": {"Name": "Cunha A.", "AuthorID": "56340889000", "AffiliationID": "60010023", "AffiliationName": "Zernike Institute for Advanced Materials, University of Groningen"}, "8898603700": {"Name": "Jansen T.", "AuthorID": "8898603700", "AffiliationID": "60010023", "AffiliationName": "Zernike Institute for Advanced Materials, University of Groningen"}, "25643782300": {"Name": "Shephard J.", "AuthorID": "25643782300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "7004272333": {"Name": "Salzmann C.", "AuthorID": "7004272333", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}}}
