The challenge is that nanofibre productions rely on bench-top apparatuses, and the delicate product integrity is hard to preserve before reaching the point of need. Timing is critically important to wound healing. The purpose of this investigation is to produce novel nanofibrous scaffolds using a portable, hand-held \u201cgun\u201d, which enables production at the wound site in a time-dependent fashion, thereby preserving product integrity. We select bacterial cellulose, a natural hydrophilic biopolymer, and polycaprolactone, a synthetic hydrophobic polymer, to generate composite nanofibres that can tune the scaffold hydrophilicity, which strongly affects cell proliferation. Composite scaffolds made of 8 different ratios of bacterial cellulose and polycaprolactone were successfully electrospun. The morphological features and cell\u2013scaffold interactions were analysed using scanning electron microscopy. The biocompatibility was studied using Saos-2 cell viability test. The scaffolds were found to show good biocompatibility and allow different proliferation rates that varied with the composition of the scaffolds. A nanofibrous dressing that can be accurately moulded and standardised via the portable technique is advantageous for wound healing in practicality and in its consistency through mass production.", "AuthorKeywords": ["bacterial cellulose", "electrohydrodynamic", "electrospinning", "polycaprolactone", "wound dressing"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Bandages", "Cell Proliferation", "Cell Survival", "Cellulose", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Nanofibers", "Polyesters", "Tissue Engineering", "Tissue Scaffolds", "Wound Healing"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85047667568", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Dermatology", "MEDI", "2708"]], "AuthorData": {"57190281775": {"Name": "Aydogdu M.O.", "AuthorID": "57190281775", "AffiliationID": "60027981", "AffiliationName": "Department of Metallurgical and Materials Engineering, Marmara University"}, "57200305151": {"Name": "Altun E.", "AuthorID": "57200305151", "AffiliationID": "60027981", "AffiliationName": "Department of Metallurgical and Materials Engineering, Marmara University"}, "12797373800": {"Name": "Gunduz O.", "AuthorID": "12797373800", "AffiliationID": "60027981", "AffiliationName": "Department of Metallurgical and Materials Engineering, Marmara University"}, "57200310263": {"Name": "Crabbe-Mann M.", "AuthorID": "57200310263", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London (UCL)"}, "56725728500": {"Name": "Brako F.", "AuthorID": "56725728500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London (UCL)"}, "36523535000": {"Name": "Luo C.J.", "AuthorID": "36523535000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London (UCL)"}, "7006247915": {"Name": "Edirisinghe M.", "AuthorID": "7006247915", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London (UCL)"}, "57200305892": {"Name": "Koc F.", "AuthorID": "57200305892", "AffiliationID": "60104488", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Microbiology, Medipol University"}, "57200306375": {"Name": "Ozen G.", "AuthorID": "57200306375", "AffiliationID": "60028502", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Medicine, Istanbul University"}, "6504454495": {"Name": "Kuruca S.E.", "AuthorID": "6504454495", "AffiliationID": "60028502", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physiology, Istanbul University"}, "57200301632": {"Name": "Edirisinghe U.", "AuthorID": "57200301632", "AffiliationID": "60022871", "AffiliationName": "Accident and Emergency Department, St Mary's Hospital"}}}
