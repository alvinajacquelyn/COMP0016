The iron and steel industry is energy intensive and contributes significantly to PM2.5 pollution in China. The simultaneous reduction of CO2 emissions and PM2.5 pollution while minimizing the total mitigation costs remains a crucial issue that must be resolved. Using a multi-objective analysis, we compared potential technology combinations based on various policy preferences and targets. Our results showed that policies designed to mitigate PM2.5 pollution have substantial co-benefits for CO2 emissions reductions. However, policies focused solely on reducing CO2 emissions fail to effectively reduce PM2.5. Furthermore, CO2 emissions reductions correspond to large financial costs, whereas PM2.5 pollution reductions are less expensive. Our results suggest that under limited budgets, decision makers should prioritize PM2.5 reductions because CO2 reductions may be simultaneously achieved. Achieving large decreases in CO2 emissions will require further technological innovations to reduce the cost threshold. Thus, China should focus on reducing PM pollution in the short term and prepare for the expected challenges associated with CO2 reductions in the future.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Abatement cost", "CO2 emission reduction", "Emission control", "Iron and steel", "Multi-objective", "PM2.5"], "IndexKeywords": ["Abatement costs", "CO2 emission reduction", "Iron and steel", "Multi objective", "PM2.5"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85044871610", "SubjectAreas": [["Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment", "ENER", "2105"], ["Environmental Science (all)", "ENVI", "2300"], ["Strategy and Management", "BUSI", "1408"], ["Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering", "ENGI", "2209"]], "AuthorData": {"57193515399": {"Name": "Yang H.", "AuthorID": "57193515399", "AffiliationID": "60014966", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory for Earth Surface Processes, College of Urban and Environmental Sciences, Peking University"}, "55705948900": {"Name": "Liu J.", "AuthorID": "55705948900", "AffiliationID": "60014966", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory for Earth Surface Processes, College of Urban and Environmental Sciences, Peking University"}, "55975044300": {"Name": "Meng J.", "AuthorID": "55975044300", "AffiliationID": "60000112", "AffiliationName": "School of Environmental Sciences, University of East Anglia"}, "7202041928": {"Name": "Tao S.", "AuthorID": "7202041928", "AffiliationID": "60014966", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory for Earth Surface Processes, College of Urban and Environmental Sciences, Peking University"}, "15720847500": {"Name": "Jiang K.", "AuthorID": "15720847500", "AffiliationID": "101747297", "AffiliationName": "Energy Research Institute, Guohong Mansion"}, "15839411900": {"Name": "Guan D.", "AuthorID": "15839411900", "AffiliationID": "60000112", "AffiliationName": "School of International Development, University of East Anglia"}, "36109765600": {"Name": "Xu Y.", "AuthorID": "36109765600", "AffiliationID": "60002798", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography and Resource Management, Institute of Environment, Energy and Sustainability, The Chinese University of Hong Kong"}}}
