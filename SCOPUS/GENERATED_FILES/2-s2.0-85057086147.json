The new model predicts the dominance of Frenkel-type disorder in SnO2 and In2O3, in good agreement with ab initio defect calculations. The model is extended to include free electron and hole polarons, which compete with charged point defects to maintain charge neutrality in a defective crystal. The stability of electrons and instability of holes with respect to point defect formation rationalises the efficacy of n-type doping in tin doped indium oxide (ITO), a widely employed transparent conducting oxide in optoelectronic applications. We investigate the clustering of Sn substitutional and oxygen interstitial sites in ITO, finding that the dopants substitute preferentially on the cation crystallographic d site in the bixbyite unit cell, in agreement with experiment. The force field described here provides a useful avenue for the investigation of the defect properties of extended transparent conducting oxide systems, including solid solutions.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Atomistic approach", "Charge neutrality", "Defect calculations", "Interatomic forces", "Interstitial sites", "Optoelectronic applications", "Oxygen vacancy formation energies", "Tin doped indium oxide"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85057086147", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Materials Chemistry", "MATE", "2505"]], "AuthorData": {"55259797000": {"Name": "Hou Q.", "AuthorID": "55259797000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Kathleen Lonsdale Materials Chemistry, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "56736199700": {"Name": "Buckeridge J.", "AuthorID": "56736199700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Kathleen Lonsdale Materials Chemistry, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "55633182900": {"Name": "Lazauskas T.", "AuthorID": "55633182900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Kathleen Lonsdale Materials Chemistry, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "7005172169": {"Name": "Sokol A.", "AuthorID": "7005172169", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Kathleen Lonsdale Materials Chemistry, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "7003322273": {"Name": "Woodley S.", "AuthorID": "7003322273", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Kathleen Lonsdale Materials Chemistry, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "56488383400": {"Name": "Catlow C.", "AuthorID": "56488383400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Kathleen Lonsdale Materials Chemistry, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "56674573200": {"Name": "Mora-Fonz D.", "AuthorID": "56674573200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}}}
