We suggest that efforts to develop more holistic energy pathways, going beyond post hoc analysis of environmental and social implications, can usefully draw on environmental scenarios. A detailed content analysis of UK energy and environmental scenarios was therefore undertaken, with energy scenarios selected on the basis that they were recent, had a direct link to energy policy, and covered a range of scenario types. The energy scenarios rarely considered societal drivers beyond decarbonisation and focused on quantifiable parameters such as GDP, while the environmental scenarios provided a richer narrative on human behaviour and social change. As socio-economic issues remain fundamental to the success of energy policies, this is a key area which should be better addressed within energy scenarios. The environmental impacts of energy scenarios were rarely considered, but could have a significant bearing on the likelihood of pathway outcomes being realised. Fuller evaluation of the environmental interactions of energy systems is therefore required. Although the analysis focuses on the UK, some international scenarios show similar limitations, suggesting that the conclusions are more widely applicable.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Energy", "Environment", "Policy", "Scenarios", "UK"], "IndexKeywords": ["Content analysis", "Energy", "Environment", "Environmental interactions", "Human behaviours", "Scenario development", "Scenarios", "Social implication"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85044678506", "SubjectAreas": [["Energy (all)", "ENER", "2100"], ["Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law", "ENVI", "2308"]], "AuthorData": {"55638339200": {"Name": "Hooper T.", "AuthorID": "55638339200", "AffiliationID": "105293263", "AffiliationName": "UK Energy Research Centre"}, "7003999607": {"Name": "Austen M.", "AuthorID": "7003999607", "AffiliationID": "105293263", "AffiliationName": "UK Energy Research Centre"}, "7004752608": {"Name": "Beaumont N.", "AuthorID": "7004752608", "AffiliationID": "105293263", "AffiliationName": "UK Energy Research Centre"}, "23090718100": {"Name": "Heptonstall P.", "AuthorID": "23090718100", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Environmental Policy, Imperial College London"}, "56613650100": {"Name": "Holland R.", "AuthorID": "56613650100", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "Biological Sciences, University of Southampton, Life Sciences Building (B85), Highfield Campus"}, "56538721300": {"Name": "Ketsopoulou I.", "AuthorID": "56538721300", "AffiliationID": "105293263", "AffiliationName": "UK Energy Research Centre"}, "7404202442": {"Name": "Taylor G.", "AuthorID": "7404202442", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "Biological Sciences, University of Southampton, Life Sciences Building (B85), Highfield Campus"}, "57209845046": {"Name": "Watson J.", "AuthorID": "57209845046", "AffiliationID": "105293263", "AffiliationName": "UK Energy Research Centre"}, "57203668596": {"Name": "Winskel M.", "AuthorID": "57203668596", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "School of Social and Political Science, University of Edinburgh"}}}
