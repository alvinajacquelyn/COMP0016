A better understanding of this interplay may help to improve patient-centred communication. To predict adherence, this study used the Beliefs about Medicines Questionnaire and indications of the quality of the nurse's communication in terms of patient satisfaction. Patient satisfaction with the information provided and the degree to which the information was tailored to them were related to adherence via the patient's beliefs. This study supports the argument that tailoring is an effective strategy for improving adherence via beliefs and can contribute to medical education and to adherence interventions.", "AuthorKeywords": ["adherence", "beliefs", "chronic illness", "communication", "patient satisfaction"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Communication", "Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice", "Humans", "Male", "Medication Adherence", "Middle Aged", "Netherlands", "Nurse-Patient Relations", "Patient Satisfaction", "Self Report", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84966639535", "SubjectAreas": [["Applied Psychology", "PSYC", "3202"]], "AuthorData": {"55191352500": {"Name": "Linn A.J.", "AuthorID": "55191352500", "AffiliationID": "60029019, 60002483", "AffiliationName": "University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam School of Communication Research (ASCoR)"}, "8716453800": {"Name": "Van Weert J.C.M.", "AuthorID": "8716453800", "AffiliationID": "60029019, 60002483", "AffiliationName": "University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam School of Communication Research (ASCoR)"}, "14069091300": {"Name": "Smit E.G.", "AuthorID": "14069091300", "AffiliationID": "60029019, 60002483", "AffiliationName": "University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam School of Communication Research (ASCoR)"}, "7006852525": {"Name": "Van Dijk L.", "AuthorID": "7006852525", "AffiliationID": "60008216", "AffiliationName": "NIVEL"}, "23012144600": {"Name": "Horne R.", "AuthorID": "23012144600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
