Problematically, the visual indicators of ROP are not well understood and neonatal fundus images are usually of poor quality and resolution. We investigate two ways to aid clinicians in ROP detection using convolutional neural networks (CNN): (1) We fine-tune a pretrained GoogLeNet as a ROP detector and with small modifications also return an approximate Bayesian posterior over disease presence. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first completely automated ROP detection system. (2) To further aid grading, we train a second CNN to return novel feature map visualizations of pathologies, learned directly from the data. These feature maps highlight discriminative information, which we believe may be used by clinicians with our classifier to aid in screening.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Approximate Bayesian", "Convolutional neural network", "Detection system", "Fundus image", "Ocular disease", "Premature baby", "Retinopathy of prematurity", "Visual indicators"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84992507355", "SubjectAreas": [["Theoretical Computer Science", "MATH", "2614"], ["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"]], "AuthorData": {"57191706633": {"Name": "Worrall D.", "AuthorID": "57191706633", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "55477608200": {"Name": "Wilson C.", "AuthorID": "55477608200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "15135206900": {"Name": "Brostow G.", "AuthorID": "15135206900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}}}
