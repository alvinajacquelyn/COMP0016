Centralising Palestinians\u2019 conceptualisations in this manner \u2013 including accounts which directly challenge academics\u2019 and policy-makers\u2019 definitions of the problem of, and solution to, statelessness \u2013 is particularly important given that statelessness emerges as both a condition and a label that erase the ability to speak, and be heard. The article starts by examining perceptions of statelessness as a marker of rightlessess, home(land)lessness and voicelessness. It then explores statelessness through the paradigm of the \u2018threshold\u2019, reflecting both on interviewees\u2019 ambiguity towards this label, status, and condition, and the extent to which even Palestinians who hold citizenship remain \u2018on the threshold of statelessness\u2019. It concludes by reflecting on interviewees\u2019 rejection of a label that is imposed upon them \u2018from a distance\u2019 via bureaucratic processes in Europe.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Displacement", "homeland", "labelling", "place", "refugee", "voice"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84948744208", "SubjectAreas": [["Cultural Studies", "SOCI", "3316"], ["Anthropology", "SOCI", "3314"], ["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"]], "AuthorData": {"34979810900": {"Name": "Fiddian-Qasmiyeh E.", "AuthorID": "34979810900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography, University College London"}}}
