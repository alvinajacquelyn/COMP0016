To study the function of TGF-\u03b2 signaling in the adult nigrostriatal system, we generated transgenic mice with reduced TGF-\u03b2 signaling in mature neurons. These mice display age-related motor deficits and degeneration of the nigrostriatal system. Increasing TGF-\u03b2 signaling in the substantia nigra through adeno-associated virus expressing a constitutively active type I receptor significantly reduces 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine-induced dopaminergic neurodegeneration and motor deficits. These results suggest that TGF-\u03b2 signaling is critical for adult DA neuron survival and that modulating this signaling pathway has therapeutic potential in Parkinson disease.", "AuthorKeywords": ["AAV", "MPTP", "Parkinson\u2019s disease", "TGF-\u03b2"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Cell Survival", "Gait Disorders, Neurologic", "Maze Learning", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Mice, Transgenic", "MPTP Poisoning", "Neostriatum", "Neurodegenerative Diseases", "Postural Balance", "Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases", "Receptors, Transforming Growth Factor beta", "Signal Transduction", "Substantia Nigra", "Transforming Growth Factor beta"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85019087973", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"]], "AuthorData": {"6603483033": {"Name": "Tesseur I.", "AuthorID": "6603483033", "AffiliationID": "60072269, 60068574", "AffiliationName": "Janssen Research and Development, Division of Janssen Pharmaceutica N.V."}, "36794919900": {"Name": "Woodling N.", "AuthorID": "36794919900", "AffiliationID": "60032838", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology and Neurological Sciences, Stanford University School of Medicine"}, "7004490711": {"Name": "Wyss-Coray T.", "AuthorID": "7004490711", "AffiliationID": "60028084", "AffiliationName": "Center for Tissue Regeneration, Repair and Restoration, VA Palo Alto Health Care System"}, "55254323800": {"Name": "Luo J.", "AuthorID": "55254323800", "AffiliationID": "60032838", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology and Neurological Sciences, Stanford University School of Medicine"}, "36741158100": {"Name": "Nguyen A.", "AuthorID": "36741158100", "AffiliationID": "60028084", "AffiliationName": "Palo Alto Veterans Institute for Research, Center for Tissue Regeneration, Repair and Restoration, VA Palo Alto Health Care System"}, "57194189289": {"Name": "Chang B.", "AuthorID": "57194189289", "AffiliationID": "60028084", "AffiliationName": "Palo Alto Veterans Institute for Research, Center for Tissue Regeneration, Repair and Restoration, VA Palo Alto Health Care System"}, "57189526041": {"Name": "Li L.", "AuthorID": "57189526041", "AffiliationID": "60028084", "AffiliationName": "Palo Alto Veterans Institute for Research, Center for Tissue Regeneration, Repair and Restoration, VA Palo Alto Health Care System"}}}
