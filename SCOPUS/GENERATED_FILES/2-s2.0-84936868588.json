Here, we discuss the potential of homo-FRET based biosensors to facilitate multiplexed imaging. We demonstrate that the homo-FRET between pleckstrin homology domains of Akt (Akt-PH) labelled with mCherry may be used to monitor 3\u2032-phosphoinositide accumulation in live cells and show how global analysis of time resolved fluorescence anisotropy measurements can be used to quantify this accumulation. We further present multiplexed imaging readouts of calcium concentration, using fluorescence lifetime measurements of TN-L15-a CFP/YFP based hetero-FRET calcium biosensor-with 3\u2032-phosphoinositide accumulation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["FRET", "Homo-FRET", "Multiplexed imaging", "Time resolved fluorescence anisotropy imaging (TR-FAIM)"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Anisotropy", "Biosensing Techniques", "Calcium", "Cell Line", "Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer", "Green Fluorescent Proteins", "Mice", "Phosphatidylinositols", "Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt", "Signal Transduction"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84936868588", "SubjectAreas": [["Catalysis", "CENG", "1503"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Spectroscopy", "CHEM", "1607"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"], ["Organic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1605"], ["Inorganic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1604"]], "AuthorData": {"55481468100": {"Name": "Warren S.", "AuthorID": "55481468100", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Photonics Group, Department of Physics, Imperial College London"}, "6506148040": {"Name": "Margineanu A.", "AuthorID": "6506148040", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Photonics Group, Department of Physics, Imperial College London"}, "57191168594": {"Name": "Dunsby C.", "AuthorID": "57191168594", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Photonics Group, Department of Physics, Imperial College London"}, "57203031993": {"Name": "French P.", "AuthorID": "57203031993", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Photonics Group, Department of Physics, Imperial College London"}, "7102317240": {"Name": "Katan M.", "AuthorID": "7102317240", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London"}}}
