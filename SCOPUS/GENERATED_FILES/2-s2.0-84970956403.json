Although many protein components required for WPB formation and function have been identified, the role of lipids is almost unknown. We examined two key phosphatidylinositol kinases that control phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate levels at the trans-Golgi network, the site of WPB biogenesis. RNA interference of the type II phosphatidylinositol 4-kinases PI4KII\u03b1 and PI4KII\u03b2 in primary human endothelial cells leads to formation of an increased proportion of short WPB with perturbed packing of VWF, as exemplified by increased exposure of antibody-binding sites. When stimulated with histamine, these cells release normal levels of VWF yet, under flow, form very few plateletcatching VWF strings. In PI4KII\u03b1-deficient mice, immuno-microscopy revealed that VWF packaging is also perturbed and these mice exhibit increased blood loss after tail cut compared to controls. This is the first demonstration that lipid kinases can control the biosynthesis of VWF and the formation of WPBs that are capable of full haemostatic function.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase alpha", "Phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase beta", "Von Willebrand factor", "Weibel-Palade body"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Endothelial Cells", "Exocytosis", "Gene Expression Regulation", "Histamine", "Humans", "Inflammation", "Lipids", "Mice", "Minor Histocompatibility Antigens", "Neovascularization, Pathologic", "Phosphatidylinositol Phosphates", "Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor)", "RNA Interference", "Thrombosis", "trans-Golgi Network", "von Willebrand Factor", "Weibel-Palade Bodies"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84970956403", "SubjectAreas": [["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"55989459700": {"Name": "da Silva M.", "AuthorID": "55989459700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Endothelial Cell Biology Laboratory, University College London"}, "57197607183": {"Name": "O'Connor M.", "AuthorID": "57197607183", "AffiliationID": "60013148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell Biology, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "7102733325": {"Name": "Cutler D.", "AuthorID": "7102733325", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Endothelial Cell Biology Laboratory, University College London"}, "27567808900": {"Name": "Kriston-Vizi J.", "AuthorID": "27567808900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Bioinformatics Image Core, University College London"}, "7402165340": {"Name": "White I.", "AuthorID": "7402165340", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60010269", "AffiliationName": "Electron Microscopy Core, MRC Laboratory of Molecular Cell Biology, University College London"}, "6602411357": {"Name": "Al-Shawi R.", "AuthorID": "6602411357", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Royal Free Centre for Biomedical Science, Wolfson Drug Discovery Unit, Centre for Amyloidosis and Acute Phase Proteins, Division of Medicine, University College London"}, "57210462155": {"Name": "Simons J.", "AuthorID": "57210462155", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Royal Free Centre for Biomedical Science, Wolfson Drug Discovery Unit, Centre for Amyloidosis and Acute Phase Proteins, Division of Medicine, University College London"}, "55455217600": {"Name": "M\u00f6ssinger J.", "AuthorID": "55455217600", "AffiliationID": "60030718", "AffiliationName": "Fachbereich Biologie, Chemie, Pharmazie, Freie Universit\u00e4t Berlin"}, "55764846800": {"Name": "Haucke V.", "AuthorID": "55764846800", "AffiliationID": "60030718", "AffiliationName": "Fachbereich Biologie, Chemie, Pharmazie, Freie Universit\u00e4t Berlin"}}}
