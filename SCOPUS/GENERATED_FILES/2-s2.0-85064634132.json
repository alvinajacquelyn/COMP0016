In other words for symmetric current, the Fourier coefficients (Formula presented), while for asymmetric current, this is not the case. Characterising this asymmetry is a recent advance in the theory. We set up this study in symmetry in this chapter and give the analytical formulae for the radiation from a closed loop. The radiation patterns at the fundamental resonance radiates directly along the (Formula presented) axis; the second harmonic shows an expected quadrupole behaviour. \u201cSmall\u201d loops are defined as those with circumference less than (Formula presented), for decidedly good reasons and the radiation patterns for such loops are strongly azimuthal.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85064634132", "SubjectAreas": [["Control and Systems Engineering", "ENGI", "2207"], ["Signal Processing", "COMP", "1711"], ["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"42661869600": {"Name": "McKinley A.", "AuthorID": "42661869600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
