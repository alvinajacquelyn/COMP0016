We use a stationary 16-antenna pRES array on Store Glacier in West Greenland to measure the three-dimensional orientation of dipping internal reflectors, extending the capabilities of pRES beyond conventional depth sounding. This novel technique portrays the effectiveness of pRES in deriving the orientation of dipping internal layers that may complement profiles obtained through other geophysical surveying methods. Deriving ice vertical strain rates from changes in layer depth as measured by a sequence of pRES observations assumes that the internal reflections come from vertically beneath the antenna. By revealing the orientation of internal reflectors and the potential deviation from nadir of their associated reflections, the use of an antenna array can correct this assumption. While the array configuration was able to resolve the geometry of englacial layers, the same configuration could not be used to accurately image the glacier bed. Here, we use simulations of the performance of different array geometries to identify configurations that can be tailored to study different types of basal geometry for future deployments.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Arctic glaciology", "glaciological instruments and methods", "ground-penetrating radar", "radio-echo sounding"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85051071908", "SubjectAreas": [["Earth-Surface Processes", "EART", "1904"]], "AuthorData": {"57200792598": {"Name": "Young T.", "AuthorID": "57200792598", "AffiliationID": "60025990, 60007317", "AffiliationName": "British Antarctic Survey, National Environmental Research Council"}, "8688065800": {"Name": "Christoffersen P.", "AuthorID": "8688065800", "AffiliationID": "60101625, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Scott Polar Research Institute, University of Cambridge"}, "7006627466": {"Name": "Nicholls K.", "AuthorID": "7006627466", "AffiliationID": "60025990, 60007317", "AffiliationName": "British Antarctic Survey, National Environmental Research Council"}, "54279389300": {"Name": "Schroeder D.", "AuthorID": "54279389300", "AffiliationID": "60012708", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geophysics, Stanford University"}, "57198996462": {"Name": "Lok L.", "AuthorID": "57198996462", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "35087329300": {"Name": "Brennan P.", "AuthorID": "35087329300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "55341628800": {"Name": "Doyle S.", "AuthorID": "55341628800", "AffiliationID": "60030514", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Glaciology, Department of Geography and Earth Sciences, Aberystwyth University"}, "7006784679": {"Name": "Hubbard B.", "AuthorID": "7006784679", "AffiliationID": "60030514", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Glaciology, Department of Geography and Earth Sciences, Aberystwyth University"}, "7202634102": {"Name": "Hubbard A.", "AuthorID": "7202634102", "AffiliationID": "60021255", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Arctic Gas Hydrate, Environment and Climate, Department of Geology, Arctic University of Norway"}}}
