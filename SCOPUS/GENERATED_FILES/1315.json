However, the true value of such data for trading is unclear due to a lack of consensus on which instruments can be predicted and how. Current approaches are based on the evaluation of message volumes and are typically assessed via retrospective (ex-post facto) evaluation of trading strategy returns. In this paper, we present instead a sentiment analysis methodology to quantify and statistically validate which assets could qualify for trading from social media analytics in an ex-ante configuration. We use sentiment analysis techniques and Information Theory measures to demonstrate that social media message sentiment can contain statistically-significant ex-ante information on the future prices of the S&P500 index and a limited set of stocks, in excess of what is achievable using solely message volumes.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84922286895", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"56584270700": {"Name": "Zheludev I.", "AuthorID": "56584270700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "55727407500": {"Name": "Smith R.", "AuthorID": "55727407500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "7003460450": {"Name": "Aste T.", "AuthorID": "7003460450", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}}}
