However, the extent of the clearing is dependent on the technique that is used. There is therefore a need for methods to quantify the quality of the clearing process and thereby to compare clearing techniques. In this study, we developed such a method using a custom spectroscopy system and applied it to compare three techniques that were applied to mouse brain: BABB (Murray\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s clear), pBABB (a modification of BABB which includes the use of hydrogen peroxide), and passive CLARITY.", "AuthorKeywords": ["BABB", "CLARITY", "mouse brain", "Optical clearing", "optical imaging", "refractive index", "spectroscopy"], "IndexKeywords": ["BABB", "CLARITY", "Mouse brain", "Optical clearing", "Optical imaging"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84930423460", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Biomaterials", "MATE", "2502"], ["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"], ["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"56669804500": {"Name": "D'Esposito A.", "AuthorID": "56669804500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Advanced Biomedical Imaging, Division of Medicine, University College London"}, "57203674289": {"Name": "Walker-Samuel S.", "AuthorID": "57203674289", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Advanced Biomedical Imaging, Division of Medicine, University College London"}, "7004107686": {"Name": "Lythgoe M.", "AuthorID": "7004107686", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Advanced Biomedical Imaging, Division of Medicine, University College London"}, "57188642825": {"Name": "Nikitichev D.", "AuthorID": "57188642825", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "55840844300": {"Name": "Desjardins A.", "AuthorID": "55840844300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}}}
