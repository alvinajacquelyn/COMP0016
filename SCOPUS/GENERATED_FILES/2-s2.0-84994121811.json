Imaging", "Volume": "9", "Issue": 10, "Art.No": null, "PageStart": null, "PageEnd": null, "CitedBy": 60, "DOI": "10.1161/CIRCIMAGING.116.004940", "Link": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84994121811&origin=inward", "Abstract": "\u00a9 2016 The Authors.Background - The presence of intramyocardial hemorrhage (IMH) in ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction patients reperfused by primary percutaneous coronary intervention has been associated with residual myocardial iron at follow-up, and its impact on adverse left ventricular (LV) remodeling is incompletely understood and is investigated here. Methods and Results - Forty-eight ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction patients underwent cardiovascular magnetic resonance at 4\u00b12 days post primary percutaneous coronary intervention, of whom 40 had a follow-up scan at 5\u00b12 months. Native T1, T2, and T2\u2217 maps were acquired. Eight out of 40 (20%) patients developed adverse LV remodeling. A subset of 28 patients had matching T2\u2217 maps, of which 15/28 patients (54%) had IMH. Eighteen of 28 (64%) patients had microvascular obstruction on the acute scan, of whom 15/18 (83%) patients had microvascular obstruction with IMH. On the follow-up scan, 13/15 patients (87%) had evidence of residual iron within the infarct zone. Patients with residual iron had higher T2 in the infarct zone surrounding the residual iron when compared with those without. In patients with adverse LV remodeling, T2 in the infarct zone surrounding the residual iron was also higher than in those without (60 [54-64] ms versus 53 [51-56] ms; P=0.025). Acute myocardial infarct size, extent of microvascular obstruction, and IMH correlated with the change in LV end-diastolic volume (Pearson's rho of 0.64, 0.59, and 0.66, respectively; P=0.18 and 0.62, respectively, for correlation coefficient comparison) and performed equally well on receiver operating characteristic curve for predicting adverse LV remodeling (area under the curve: 0.99, 0.94, and 0.95, respectively; P=0.19 for receiver operating characteristic curve comparison). Conclusions - The majority of ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction patients with IMH had residual myocardial iron at follow-up. This was associated with persistently elevated T2 values in the surrounding infarct tissue and adverse LV remodeling. IMH and residual myocardial iron may be potential therapeutic targets for preventing adverse LV remodeling in reperfused ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction patients.", "AuthorKeywords": ["intramyocardial hemorrhage", "residual myocardial iron", "ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction", "T2 mapping", "T2\u2217 mapping"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Area Under Curve", "Coronary Circulation", "Female", "Hemorrhage", "Humans", "Iron", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Microcirculation", "Middle Aged", "Myocardium", "Percutaneous Coronary Intervention", "Predictive Value of Tests", "Prospective Studies", "ROC Curve", "ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction", "Time Factors", "Treatment Outcome", "Ventricular Function, Left", "Ventricular Remodeling"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84994121811", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"], ["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"53981151600": {"Name": "Bulluck H.", "AuthorID": "53981151600", "AffiliationID": "60004093", "AffiliationName": "Barts Heart Centre, St Bartholomew's Hospital"}, "55083542800": {"Name": "White S.K.", "AuthorID": "55083542800", "AffiliationID": "60004093", "AffiliationName": "Barts Heart Centre, St Bartholomew's Hospital"}, "56786381300": {"Name": "Ramlall M.", "AuthorID": "56786381300", "AffiliationID": "60004093", "AffiliationName": "Barts Heart Centre, St Bartholomew's Hospital"}, "56916019200": {"Name": "Hamarneh A.", "AuthorID": "56916019200", "AffiliationID": "60004093", "AffiliationName": "Barts Heart Centre, St Bartholomew's Hospital"}, "7103223278": {"Name": "Yellon D.M.", "AuthorID": "7103223278", "AffiliationID": "60024544, 60172638", "AffiliationName": "National Institute of Health Research, University College London Hospitals Biomedical Research Centre"}, "6602976997": {"Name": "Hausenloy D.J.", "AuthorID": "6602976997", "AffiliationID": "60004409", "AffiliationName": "National Heart Research Institute Singapore, National Heart Centre Singapore"}, "7403231345": {"Name": "Moon J.C.", "AuthorID": "7403231345", "AffiliationID": "60004093", "AffiliationName": "Barts Heart Centre, St Bartholomew's Hospital"}, "35620856500": {"Name": "Rosmini S.", "AuthorID": "35620856500", "AffiliationID": "60004093", "AffiliationName": "Barts Heart Centre, St Bartholomew's Hospital"}, "56528300800": {"Name": "Abdel-Gadir A.", "AuthorID": "56528300800", "AffiliationID": "60004093", "AffiliationName": "Barts Heart Centre, St Bartholomew's Hospital"}, "34970790200": {"Name": "Bhuva A.N.", "AuthorID": "34970790200", "AffiliationID": "60004093", "AffiliationName": "Barts Heart Centre, St Bartholomew's Hospital"}, "15754511800": {"Name": "Treibel T.A.", "AuthorID": "15754511800", "AffiliationID": "60004093", "AffiliationName": "Barts Heart Centre, St Bartholomew's Hospital"}, "16306839900": {"Name": "Fontana M.", "AuthorID": "16306839900", "AffiliationID": "60004093", "AffiliationName": "Barts Heart Centre, St Bartholomew's Hospital"}, "24077375900": {"Name": "Sirker A.", "AuthorID": "24077375900", "AffiliationID": "60004093", "AffiliationName": "Barts Heart Centre, St Bartholomew's Hospital"}, "26534328000": {"Name": "Herrey A.S.", "AuthorID": "26534328000", "AffiliationID": "60004093", "AffiliationName": "Barts Heart Centre, St Bartholomew's Hospital"}, "6504025861": {"Name": "Manisty C.", "AuthorID": "6504025861", "AffiliationID": "60004093", "AffiliationName": "Barts Heart Centre, St Bartholomew's Hospital"}, "7004851504": {"Name": "Kellman P.", "AuthorID": "7004851504", "AffiliationID": "60005281, 60006577", "AffiliationName": "National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health"}}}
