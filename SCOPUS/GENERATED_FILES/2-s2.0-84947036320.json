All rights reserved.Background: Patients presenting with parkinsonian syndromes share many clinical features, which can make diagnosis difficult. This is important as atypical parkinsonian syndromes (APSs) such as progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), multiple system atrophy (MSA) and corticobasal syndrome (CBS) carry a poor prognosis, compared with patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). In addition, there is overlap between APS and dementia diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Objective: To use a panel of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers to differentiate patients with APS from PD and dementia. Methods: A prospective cohort of 160 patients and 30 control participants were recruited from a single specialist centre. Patients were clinically diagnosed according to current consensus criteria. CSF samples were obtained from patients with clinical diagnoses of PD (n=31), PSP (n=33), CBS (n=14), MSA (n=31), AD (n=26) and FTD (n=16). Healthy, elderly participants (n=30) were included as controls. Total \u03c4 (t-\u03c4), phosphorylated \u03c4 (p-\u03c4), \u03b2-amyloid 1-42 (A\u03b242), neurofilament light chain (NFL), \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1-syn), amyloid precursor protein soluble metabolites \u03b1 and \u03b2 (soluble amyloid precursor protein (sAPP)\u03b1, sAPP\u03b2) and two neuroinflammatory markers (monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and YKL-40) were measured in CSF. A reverse stepwise regression analysis and the false discovery rate procedure were used. Results: CSF NFL (p<0.001), sAPP\u03b1 (p<0.001) and a-syn (p=0.003) independently predicted diagnosis of PD versus APS. Together, these nine biomarkers could differentiate patients with PD from APS with an area under the curve of 0.95 and subtypes of APS from one another. There was good discriminatory power between parkinsonian groups, dementia disorders and healthy controls. Conclusions: A panel of nine CSF biomarkers was able to differentiate APS from patients with PD and dementia. This may have important clinical utility in improving diagnostic accuracy, allowing better prognostication and earlier access to potential disease-modifying therapies.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Biomarkers", "Cohort Studies", "Dementia", "Diagnosis, Differential", "Female", "Humans", "Longitudinal Studies", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Multiple System Atrophy", "Nerve Tissue Proteins", "Parkinson Disease", "Parkinsonian Disorders", "Prospective Studies", "Supranuclear Palsy, Progressive"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84947036320", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"55347741900": {"Name": "Magdalinou N.K.", "AuthorID": "55347741900", "AffiliationID": "60115564, 60019953", "AffiliationName": "Reta Lila Weston Institute of Neurological Studies, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "7201772450": {"Name": "Warner T.T.", "AuthorID": "7201772450", "AffiliationID": "60115564, 60019953", "AffiliationName": "Reta Lila Weston Institute of Neurological Studies, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "56230728900": {"Name": "De Silva R.", "AuthorID": "56230728900", "AffiliationID": "60115564, 60019953", "AffiliationName": "Reta Lila Weston Institute of Neurological Studies, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "57208252964": {"Name": "Lees A.J.", "AuthorID": "57208252964", "AffiliationID": "60115564, 60019953", "AffiliationName": "Reta Lila Weston Institute of Neurological Studies, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "55799312800": {"Name": "Paterson R.W.", "AuthorID": "55799312800", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurodegeneration, Dementia Research Centre, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "7103177641": {"Name": "Schott J.M.", "AuthorID": "7103177641", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurodegeneration, Dementia Research Centre, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "7201444328": {"Name": "Fox N.C.", "AuthorID": "7201444328", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurodegeneration, Dementia Research Centre, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "7006655431": {"Name": "Mummery C.", "AuthorID": "7006655431", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurodegeneration, Dementia Research Centre, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "56415176000": {"Name": "Blennow K.", "AuthorID": "56415176000", "AffiliationID": "60027675, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Neurochemistry Laboratory, Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg"}, "25958636400": {"Name": "Bhatia K.", "AuthorID": "25958636400", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Sobell Department of Motor Neuroscience and Movement Disorders, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "6701454676": {"Name": "Zetterberg H.", "AuthorID": "6701454676", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "7401534782": {"Name": "Morris H.R.", "AuthorID": "7401534782", "AffiliationID": "60032819, 60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology, Royal Free Hospital"}, "6603845190": {"Name": "Giunti P.", "AuthorID": "6603845190", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology"}}}
