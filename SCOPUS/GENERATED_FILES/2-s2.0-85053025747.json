This study assessed our SLNB program against 11 published quality indicators (QIs). All breast cancer patients who underwent SLNB in our centre from June 2013\u2013Dec 2015 were included. Clinical, pathological and follow-up data were extracted from the institutional REDCap data system. Analysis was done with SPSS 23. Following validation, 234 patients had SLNB, always performed along with primary surgery. Identification rate was 95.3% and > 1 SLN was identified in 72% of patients. SLNB positivity was 33%, of these, 100% underwent ALND. Overall 91% of QI eligible patients underwent SLNB. No ineligible patients (T4) underwent SLNB. For the patients who had radio colloid, injection criteria were met for 100%. Pathological evaluation and reporting criteria were met for 100% of patients. There were no axillary recurrences in a median follow-up of 2 years. 7.6% patients had SLN negative on frozen section but positive on final histology. 7.2% of patients with clinical negative nodes had pN2 disease in final histopathology report after surgery. Sixty percent of patients who had completion ALND had only positive SLN. This study supports the applicability of published QI of SLNB in a non-screened cohort of early breast cancer patients. Although QI were useful, modification based on patient characteristics and resource availability may be needed. These indicators can be used as audit tools to improve the overall accuracy of the procedure.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Breast cancer", "Quality indicators", "Sentinel lymph node biopsy"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85053025747", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"]], "AuthorData": {"57002179900": {"Name": "Agrawal S.", "AuthorID": "57002179900", "AffiliationID": "115493728", "AffiliationName": "Department of Breast Oncosurgery, Tata Medical Center"}, "57203815858": {"Name": "Shenoy S.", "AuthorID": "57203815858", "AffiliationID": "115493728", "AffiliationName": "Department of Breast Oncosurgery, Tata Medical Center"}, "55851098600": {"Name": "Nalawade N.", "AuthorID": "55851098600", "AffiliationID": "115493728", "AffiliationName": "Department of Breast Oncosurgery, Tata Medical Center"}, "56597485700": {"Name": "Ahmed R.", "AuthorID": "56597485700", "AffiliationID": "115493728", "AffiliationName": "Department of Breast Oncosurgery, Tata Medical Center"}, "57211566199": {"Name": "Datta S.", "AuthorID": "57211566199", "AffiliationID": "115493728", "AffiliationName": "Department of Palliative Care and Psycho-oncology, Tata Medical Center"}, "57203820229": {"Name": "Roy S.", "AuthorID": "57203820229", "AffiliationID": "115493728", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nuclear Medicine, Tata Medical Center"}, "36125880700": {"Name": "Chatterjee S.", "AuthorID": "36125880700", "AffiliationID": "115493728", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Oncology, Tata Medical Center"}, "36645541100": {"Name": "Arun I.", "AuthorID": "36645541100", "AffiliationID": "115493728", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, Tata Medical Center"}}}
