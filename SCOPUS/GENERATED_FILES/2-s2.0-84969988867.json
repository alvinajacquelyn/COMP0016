Here, we review the current state of knowledge of epigenetic drift and its potential role in cancer etiology. We propose a new terminology to help distinguish the different components of epigenetic drift, with the aim of clarifying the role of the epigenetic clock, mitotic clocks and active changes, which accumulate in response to environmental disease risk factors. We further highlight the growing evidence that epigenetic changes associated with cancer risk factors may play an important causal role in cancer development, and that monitoring these molecular changes in normal cells may offer novel risk prediction and disease prevention strategies.", "AuthorKeywords": ["aging", "cancer", "cancer risk", "DNA methylation", "epigenetic", "epigenetic clock"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "DNA Methylation", "Epigenesis, Genetic", "Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic", "Humans", "Neoplasms", "Risk Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84969988867", "SubjectAreas": [["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Cancer Research", "BIOC", "1306"]], "AuthorData": {"57189374745": {"Name": "Zheng S.", "AuthorID": "57189374745", "AffiliationID": "60019499", "AffiliationName": "University of Chinese, Academy of Sciences"}, "8528968400": {"Name": "Teschendorff A.", "AuthorID": "8528968400", "AffiliationID": "60109234, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Statistical Cancer Genomics, UCL Cancer Institute, University College London"}, "7006520678": {"Name": "Widschwendter M.", "AuthorID": "7006520678", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Women's Cancer, University College London"}}}
