Methods: 24 patients were identified at median 6-year (minimum 2 year, maximum 10 years) follow-up. 1 patient was converted to excision arthroplasty for infection. A further 3 patients required revision for instability but the cup-cage construct was not revised. results: We noted encouraging pain relief (mean WOMAC pain 85.6) and good functional outcome (mean WOMAC function 78.2, mean UCLA 5, mean OHS 78.6). Patient satisfaction with regards pain relief, function and return to recreational activities were noted to be good. Conclusions: The cup-cage construct is a viable method of dealing with complex pelvic discontinuity. However, the failure rate due to loosening (4 cases) in this and other reports does prompt the need for further refinement of the technique and technology in this very challenging group of patients, as well as continued evaluation at the mid- and long-term so as to confirm the ongoing success of this method of reconstruction.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cupcage reconstruction", "Pelvic discontinuity", "Revision THA"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Arthroplasty, Replacement, Hip", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Forecasting", "Hip Joint", "Hip Prosthesis", "Humans", "Joint Diseases", "Male", "Patient Satisfaction", "Pelvic Bones", "Prosthesis Failure", "Reoperation", "Retrospective Studies"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85029841571", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Orthopedics and Sports Medicine", "MEDI", "2732"]], "AuthorData": {"24466324900": {"Name": "Konan S.", "AuthorID": "24466324900", "AffiliationID": "60010365, 60027009", "AffiliationName": "Department of Orthopaedics, Vancouver General Hospital, University of British Columbia"}, "7202997070": {"Name": "Duncan C.P.", "AuthorID": "7202997070", "AffiliationID": "60010365, 60027009", "AffiliationName": "Department of Orthopaedics, Vancouver General Hospital, University of British Columbia"}, "7006635203": {"Name": "Masri B.A.", "AuthorID": "7006635203", "AffiliationID": "60010365, 60027009", "AffiliationName": "Department of Orthopaedics, Vancouver General Hospital, University of British Columbia"}, "7003707651": {"Name": "Garbuz D.S.", "AuthorID": "7003707651", "AffiliationID": "60010365, 60027009", "AffiliationName": "Department of Orthopaedics, Vancouver General Hospital, University of British Columbia"}}}
