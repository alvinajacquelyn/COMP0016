To achieve these expectations, contactless techniques are used and have not only been proven well-suitable but have also brought optical methods to the forefront. Over recent years white light scanning interferometry has been increasingly used for studying and characterizing transparent materials with thicknesses ranging from a few hundred nanometers to several micrometers. Then, multiple techniques have been developed to retrieve the transparent layer properties from interferometric data. The more recent techniques, based on the use of an error function which defines the best fit between the experimental and theoretical data, allow the determination of the thickness of very thin films (<1 \u03bcm). We show here that a method based on this principle can be applied to thicker layers (>1 \u03bcm) for simultaneously measuring their optical and morphological properties, provided that a crucial step is carefully considered during the data acquisition process. This enables the simultaneous measurements of both the thickness and the refractive index (dispersion) without any prior assumptions about one of the two parameters. We demonstrate the proposed method by accurate measurements on a few micrometers thick PMMA layer as well as on a SnO2 layer, which is a much more dispersive sample.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Fringe analysis", "Interference microscopy", "Reflectance spectrum", "Refractive index", "Thickness", "Transparent material"], "IndexKeywords": ["Fringe analysis", "Interference microscopy", "Reflectance spectrum", "Thickness", "Transparent material"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85054212591", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"], ["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"], ["Spectroscopy", "CHEM", "1607"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"], ["Organic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1605"], ["Inorganic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1604"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"57053381800": {"Name": "Claveau R.", "AuthorID": "57053381800", "AffiliationID": "60003535", "AffiliationName": "Institut National des Sciences Appliqu\u00e9es de Strasbourg (INSA Strasbourg)"}, "7101943091": {"Name": "Montgomery P.", "AuthorID": "7101943091", "AffiliationID": "60008134", "AffiliationName": "Laboratoire des Sciences de l'Ing\u00e9nieur, de l'Information et de l'Imagerie (ICube), UDS-CNRS UMR 7357"}, "7006290504": {"Name": "Flury M.", "AuthorID": "7006290504", "AffiliationID": "60003535", "AffiliationName": "Institut National des Sciences Appliqu\u00e9es de Strasbourg (INSA Strasbourg)"}, "7801427656": {"Name": "Ferblantier G.", "AuthorID": "7801427656", "AffiliationID": "60008134", "AffiliationName": "Laboratoire des Sciences de l'Ing\u00e9nieur, de l'Information et de l'Imagerie (ICube), UDS-CNRS UMR 7357"}}}
