Despite the fact that Borges (1899\u20131986) assigned his reading of The Divine Comedy to a rather late period in his life, this study argues that he was acquainted with the work of the Italian poet (or at least part of it) at a much earlier date\u2014as can be perceived in the poem \u2018Llamarada\u2019, published in 1920. It also shows that Borges\u2019s intention in dealing with Dante was not in itself parodical. On the contrary, it reveals his concern about the human condition and the ways in which literature can manifest man\u2019s being in the world.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Borges", "Dante", "Determinism", "Free will", "Literary influence", "Parody"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84930377311", "SubjectAreas": [["Linguistics and Language", "SOCI", "3310"], ["Literature and Literary Theory", "ARTS", "1208"]], "AuthorData": {"25026239500": {"Name": "N\u00fa\u00f1ez Faraco H.", "AuthorID": "25026239500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Spanish, Portuguese and Latin American Studies, University College London"}}}
