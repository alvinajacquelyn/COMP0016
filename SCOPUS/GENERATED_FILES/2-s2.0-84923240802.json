Previous studies and patient reports have listed extrinsic and intrinsic triggers, albeit their multifactorial and dynamic nature is poorly understood. This paper aims to review literature on extrinsic and intrinsic seizure triggers and to discuss common mechanisms among them. Among self-reported seizure triggers, emotional stress is most frequently named. Reflex seizures are typically associated with extrinsic sensory triggers; however, intrinsic cognitive or proprioceptive triggers have also been assessed. The identification of a trigger underlying a seizure may be more difficult if it is intrinsic and complex, and if triggering mechanisms are multifactorial. Therefore, since observability of triggers varies and triggers are also found in non-reflex seizures, the present concept of reflex seizures may be questioned. We suggest the possibility of a conceptual continuum between reflex and spontaneous seizures rather than a dichotomy and discuss evidence to the notion that to some extent most seizures might be triggered.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Provoked", "Reflex", "Seizures", "Spontaneous", "Trigger"], "IndexKeywords": ["Brain", "Epilepsy, Reflex", "Humans", "Seizures"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84923240802", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"56524667000": {"Name": "Irmen F.", "AuthorID": "56524667000", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Experimental Epilepsy, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "55913795300": {"Name": "Wehner T.", "AuthorID": "55913795300", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7005729118": {"Name": "Lemieux L.", "AuthorID": "7005729118", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Experimental Epilepsy, UCL Institute of Neurology"}}}
