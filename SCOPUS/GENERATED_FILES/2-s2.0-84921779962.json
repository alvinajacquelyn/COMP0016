The aims of the project are threefold: to build a coherent cryoEM community which will provide support for individual scientists and will act as a focal point for liaising with other communities, to support practising scientists in their use of cryoEM software and finally to support software developers in producing and disseminating robust and user-friendly programs. The project is closely modelled on CCP4 for macromolecular crystallography, and areas of common interest such as model fitting, underlying software libraries and tools for building program packages are being exploited. Nevertheless, cryoEM includes a number of techniques covering a large range of resolutions and a distinct project is required. In this article, progress so far is reported and future plans are discussed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["CCP-EM", "Collaborative Computational Project for Electron cryo-Microscopy Crystallography and complementary methods"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cooperative Behavior", "Cryoelectron Microscopy"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84921779962", "SubjectAreas": [["Structural Biology", "BIOC", "1315"]], "AuthorData": {"55897573900": {"Name": "Wood C.", "AuthorID": "55897573900", "AffiliationID": "60009523", "AffiliationName": "Scientific Computing Department, Science and Technology Facilities Council, Research Complex at Harwell"}, "56495311500": {"Name": "Burnley T.", "AuthorID": "56495311500", "AffiliationID": "60009523", "AffiliationName": "Scientific Computing Department, Science and Technology Facilities Council, Research Complex at Harwell"}, "8940119400": {"Name": "Patwardhan A.", "AuthorID": "8940119400", "AffiliationID": "60026124, 60008380", "AffiliationName": "European Bioinformatics Institute, European Molecular Biology Laboratory, Wellcome Trust Genome Campus"}, "6506374764": {"Name": "Scheres S.", "AuthorID": "6506374764", "AffiliationID": "60010269", "AffiliationName": "MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Francis Crick Avenue, Cambridge Biomedical Campus"}, "7006421825": {"Name": "Topf M.", "AuthorID": "7006421825", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Biological Sciences at Birkbeck, University of London"}, "6602578184": {"Name": "Roseman A.", "AuthorID": "6602578184", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Life Sciences, University of Manchester"}, "57203031960": {"Name": "Winn M.", "AuthorID": "57203031960", "AffiliationID": "60004762, 60009523", "AffiliationName": "Scientific Computing Department, Science and Technology Facilities Council, Daresbury Laboratory"}}}
