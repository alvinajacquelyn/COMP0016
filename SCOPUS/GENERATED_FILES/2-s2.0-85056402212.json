The CXCL12-CXCR4 pathway has crucial roles in stem cell homing and maintenance, neuronal guidance, cancer progression, inflammation, remote-conditioning, cell migration and development. Recently, work in chick suggested that signalling via CXCR4 in neural crest cells (NCCs) has a role in the 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2DS), a disorder where haploinsufficiency of the transcription factor TBX1 is responsible for the major structural defects. We tested this idea in mouse models. Our analysis of genes with altered expression in Tbx1 mutant mouse models showed down-regulation of Cxcl12 in pharyngeal surface ectoderm and rostral mesoderm, both tissues with the potential to signal to migrating NCCs. Conditional mutagenesis of Tbx1 in the pharyngeal surface ectoderm is associated with hypo/aplasia of the 4 th pharyngeal arch artery (PAA) and interruption of the aortic arch type B (IAA-B), the cardiovascular defect most typical of 22q11.2DS. We therefore analysed constitutive mouse mutants of the ligand (CXCL12) and receptor (CXCR4) components of the pathway, in addition to ectodermal conditionals of Cxcl12 and NCC conditionals of Cxcr4. However, none of these typical 22q11.2DS features were detected in constitutively or conditionally mutant embryos. Instead, duplicated carotid arteries were observed, a phenotype recapitulated in Tie-2Cre (endothelial) conditional knock outs of Cxcr4. Previous studies have demonstrated genetic interaction between signalling pathways and Tbx1 haploinsufficiency e.g. FGF, WNT, SMAD-dependent. We therefore tested for possible epistasis between Tbx1 and the CXCL12 signalling axis by examining Tbx1 and Cxcl12 double heterozygotes as well as Tbx1/Cxcl12/Cxcr4 triple heterozygotes, but failed to identify any exacerbation of the Tbx1 haploinsufficient arch artery phenotype. We conclude that CXCL12 signalling via NCC/CXCR4 has no major role in the genesis of the Tbx1 loss of function phenotype. Instead, the pathway has a distinct effect on remodelling of head vessels and interventricular septation mediated via CXCL12 signalling from the pharyngeal surface ectoderm and second heart field to endothelial cells.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Aorta, Thoracic", "Cardiovascular Abnormalities", "Cardiovascular System", "Chemokine CXCL12", "DiGeorge Syndrome", "Disease Models, Animal", "Epistasis, Genetic", "Female", "Haploinsufficiency", "Humans", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Mice, Knockout", "Mutation", "Neural Crest", "Pregnancy", "Receptors, CXCR4", "Signal Transduction", "T-Box Domain Proteins"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85056402212", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"57213631103": {"Name": "Page M.", "AuthorID": "57213631103", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Developmental Biology of Birth Defects, UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "55552848100": {"Name": "Ridge L.", "AuthorID": "55552848100", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Developmental Biology of Birth Defects, UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "57195258087": {"Name": "Diaz D.G.", "AuthorID": "57195258087", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Developmental Biology of Birth Defects, UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "57204628608": {"Name": "Tsogbayar T.", "AuthorID": "57204628608", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Developmental Biology of Birth Defects, UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "7006489319": {"Name": "Scambler P.J.", "AuthorID": "7006489319", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Developmental Biology of Birth Defects, UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "8836627200": {"Name": "Ivins S.", "AuthorID": "8836627200", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Developmental Biology of Birth Defects, UCL Institute of Child Health"}}}
