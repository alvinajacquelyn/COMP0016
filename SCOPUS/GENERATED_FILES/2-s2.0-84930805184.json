The membrane proximal domain of neuropilin-1, called c or MAM domain based on its sequence conservation, has been implicated in neuropilin oligomerization required for its function. The c/MAM domain of human neuropilin-1 has been recombinantly expressed to allow for investigation of its propensity to engage in molecular interactions with other protein or carbohydrate components on a cell surface. We found that the c/MAM domain was heavily O-glycosylated with up to 24 monosaccharide units in the form of disialylated core 1 and core 2 O-glycans. Attachment sites were identified on the chymotryptic c/MAM peptide ETGATEKPTVIDSTIQSEFPTY by electron-transfer dissociation mass spectrometry (ETD-MS/MS). For highly glycosylated species consisting of carbohydrate to about 50 %, useful results could only be obtained upon partial desialylation. ETD-MS/MS revealed a hierarchical order of the initial O-GalNAc addition to the four different glycosylation sites. These findings enable future functional studies about the contribution of the described glycosylations in neuropilin-1 oligomerization and the binding to partner proteins as VEGF or galectin-1. As a spin-off result the sialidase from Clostridium perfringens turned out to discriminate between galactose- and N-acetylgalactosamine-linked sialic acid.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Electron-transfer dissociation", "MAM-domain", "neuropilin-1", "O-GalNAc glycan", "O-glycosylation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Acetylglucosamine", "Glycosylation", "HEK293 Cells", "Humans", "Neuropilin-1", "Protein Domains", "Protein Processing, Post-Translational"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84930805184", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"55874782500": {"Name": "Windwarder M.", "AuthorID": "55874782500", "AffiliationID": "60024895", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences, Vienna"}, "7005626863": {"Name": "Altmann F.", "AuthorID": "7005626863", "AffiliationID": "60024895", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences, Vienna"}, "56677866700": {"Name": "Yelland T.", "AuthorID": "56677866700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London"}, "7006536499": {"Name": "Djordjevic S.", "AuthorID": "7006536499", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London"}}}
