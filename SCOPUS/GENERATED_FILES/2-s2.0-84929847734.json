All rights reserved.Objective: To examine the uptake of services and behaviors in the prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission (PMTCT) cascade in Zimbabwe and to determine factors associated with MTCT and maternal antiretroviral therapy (ART) or antiretroviral (ARV) prophylaxis. Design: Analysis of cross-sectional data from mother-infant pairs. Methods: We analyzed baseline data collected in 2012 as part of the impact evaluation of Zimbabwe's Accelerated National PMTCT Program. Using multistage cluster sampling, eligible mother-infant pairs were randomly sampled from the catchment areas of 157 facilities in 5 provinces, tested for HIV infection, and interviewed about PMTCT service utilization. Results: Of 8800 women, 94% attended \u22651 antenatal care visit, 92% knew their HIV serostatus during pregnancy, 77% delivered in a health facility, and 92% attended the 6-8 week postnatal visit. Among 1075 (12%) HIV-infected women, 59% reported ART/ARV prophylaxis and 63% of their HIV-exposed infants received ARV prophylaxis. Among HIV-exposed infants, maternal receipt of ART/ARV prophylaxis was protective against MTCT [adjusted prevalence ratio (PR a): 0.41, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.23 to 0.74]. Factors associated with receipt of maternal ART/ARV prophylaxis included \u22654 antenatal care visits (PR a: 1.18, 95% CI: 1.01 to 1.38), institutional delivery (PR a: 1.31, 95% CI: 1.13 to 1.52), and disclosure of serostatus (PR a: 1.30, 95% CI: 1.12 to 1.49). Conclusions: These data from women in the community indicate gaps in the PMTCT cascade before the accelerated program, which may have been missed by examination of health facility data alone. These gaps were especially noteworthy for services targeted specifically to HIV-infected women and their infants, such as maternal and infant ART/ARV prophylaxis.", "AuthorKeywords": ["HIV infection", "PMTCT cascade", "prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV", "vertical HIV transmission", "Zimbabwe"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Anti-Retroviral Agents", "Chemoprevention", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Data Collection", "Female", "HIV Infections", "Humans", "Infant", "Infant, Newborn", "Infectious Disease Transmission, Vertical", "Patient Acceptance of Health Care", "Pregnancy", "Pregnancy Complications, Infectious", "Public Health Administration", "Young Adult", "Zimbabwe"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84929847734", "SubjectAreas": [["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"7005161905": {"Name": "McCoy S.I.", "AuthorID": "7005161905", "AffiliationID": "60025038", "AffiliationName": "Division of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, University of California"}, "24436643400": {"Name": "Buzdugan R.", "AuthorID": "24436643400", "AffiliationID": "60025038", "AffiliationName": "Division of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, University of California"}, "7005340287": {"Name": "Padian N.S.", "AuthorID": "7005340287", "AffiliationID": "60025038", "AffiliationName": "Division of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, University of California"}, "35789012100": {"Name": "Martz T.E.", "AuthorID": "35789012100", "AffiliationID": "60025038", "AffiliationName": "Division of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, University of California"}, "36096247700": {"Name": "Musarandega R.", "AuthorID": "36096247700", "AffiliationID": "60116668", "AffiliationName": "Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation"}, "6602909582": {"Name": "Mahomva A.", "AuthorID": "6602909582", "AffiliationID": "60116668", "AffiliationName": "Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation"}, "13608093000": {"Name": "Engelsmann B.", "AuthorID": "13608093000", "AffiliationID": "106637720", "AffiliationName": "Organisation for Public Health Interventions and Development (OPHID) Trust"}, "36632730600": {"Name": "Mushavi A.", "AuthorID": "36632730600", "AffiliationID": "60043616", "AffiliationName": "Ministry of Health and Child Care"}, "56432392100": {"Name": "Cowan F.M.", "AuthorID": "56432392100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
