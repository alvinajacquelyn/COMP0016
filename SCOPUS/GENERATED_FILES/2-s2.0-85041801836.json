Network analysis is a relatively new approach in psychopathology research that considers mental disorders to be emergent phenomena from causal interactions among symptoms. This study re-analysed the British National Psychiatric Morbidity Survey data using network analysis to examine the network structure of paranoia in the general population. Methods: We used a Graphical Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (glasso) method that estimated an optimal network structure based on the Extended Bayesian Information Criterion. Network sub-communities were identified by spinglass and EGA algorithms and centrality metrics were calculated per item and per sub-community. Results: We replicated Bebbington\u2019s four component structure of paranoia, identifying \u2018interpersonal sensitivities\u2019, \u2018mistrust\u2019, \u2018ideas of reference\u2019 and \u2018ideas of persecution\u2019 as sub-communities in the network. In line with previous experimental findings, worry was the most central item in the network. However, \u2018mistrust\u2019 and \u2018ideas of reference\u2019 were the most central sub-communities. Conclusions: Rather than a strict hierarchy, we argue that the structure of paranoia is best thought of as a heterarchy, where the activation of high-centrality nodes and communities is most likely to lead to steady state paranoia. We also highlight the novel methodological approach used by this study: namely, using network analysis to re-examine a population structure of psychopathology previously identified by latent variable approaches.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Delusion", "Epidemiology", "Network", "Psychosis", "Schizophrenia"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Algorithms", "Anxiety", "Bayes Theorem", "Female", "Humans", "Interpersonal Relations", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Paranoid Disorders", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "Thinking", "Trust", "United Kingdom", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85041801836", "SubjectAreas": [["Epidemiology", "MEDI", "2713"], ["Health (social science)", "SOCI", "3306"], ["Social Psychology", "PSYC", "3207"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"7007065687": {"Name": "Bell V.", "AuthorID": "7007065687", "AffiliationID": "60028884", "AffiliationName": "South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57200605451": {"Name": "O\u2019Driscoll C.", "AuthorID": "57200605451", "AffiliationID": "60107401", "AffiliationName": "North East London NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
