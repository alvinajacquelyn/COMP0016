However, they are now emerging from this rather obscure status to become important targets for small-molecule drugs, which can stabilize the quadruplex structures and thereby promote selective downregulation of gene expression and telomerase inhibition, and also activate DNA damage responses. Most of these quadruplex-binding small molecules can stabilize a range of cellular quadruplexes, as well as clusters of quadruplexes within a single gene or telomere, which could be an advantage. This widespread stabilization can generate a polygene response, and thus is able to simultaneously affect several key driver genes in human cancers, with potential therapeutic benefit.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85026831797", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"]], "AuthorData": {"35820006900": {"Name": "Neidle S.", "AuthorID": "35820006900", "AffiliationID": "60016379, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy, University College London"}}}
