Using four case examples we described how biosecurity was applied in practical translocation scenarios prior to and during a translocation and also post-release. We implemented biosecurity, including quarantine barriers, at specific points in the translocation pathway where hazards, identified by the disease risk analysis, had the potential to induce disease. Evidence that biosecurity protected translocated and recipient populations, included an absence of mortality associated with high-risk non-native parasites, a reduction in mortality associated with endemic parasites, the absence of high-risk pathogenic parasites, or associated diseases, at the destination; and the apparent absence of diseases in closely related species at the destination site. The biosecurity protocols did not alter the level or duration of translocated species confinement and therefore probably did not act as a stressor. There is a monetary cost involved in biosecurity but the epidemiological evidence suggests that conservation translocation managers should carefully consider its use. Breakdowns in quarantine have occurred in human hospitals despite considerable investment and training for health professionals, and we therefore judge that there is a need for training in the objectives and maintenance of quarantine barriers in conservation translocations. Biosecurity protocols for conservation translocations should be continually updated in response to findings from disease risk analysis and post-release disease surveillance and we recommend further studies to evaluate their effectiveness.", "AuthorKeywords": ["biosecurity", "conservation", "translocation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Anura", "Bees", "Conservation of Natural Resources", "Humans", "Moths", "Passeriformes", "Ranidae", "Risk Assessment"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84982943668", "SubjectAreas": [["Ecology", "ENVI", "2303"], ["Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis", "ENVI", "2307"]], "AuthorData": {"50862164200": {"Name": "Vaughan-Higgins R.J.", "AuthorID": "50862164200", "AffiliationID": "60019939", "AffiliationName": "Conservation Medicine and Wildlife Health, School of Veterinary & Life Sciences, Murdoch University"}, "7003959725": {"Name": "Sainsbury A.W.", "AuthorID": "7003959725", "AffiliationID": "60005453, 60009498", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Zoology, Zoological Society of London"}, "57211792356": {"Name": "Masters N.", "AuthorID": "57211792356", "AffiliationID": "60009498", "AffiliationName": "Veterinary department, Zoological Society of London"}}}
