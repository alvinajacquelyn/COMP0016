All rights reserved.Whilst both \u2018parenting\u2019 and \u2018intimacy\u2019 have been explored extensively in recent social scientific research (for example, Lee et al 2014,Gabb and Silva 2011), their intersections in the context of family life remain curiously absent. This paper presents findings from on-going longitudinal research with parents in London, which investigates how the care of children, and particularly the feeding of infants, affects the parental couple\u2019s \u2018intimate\u2019 relationship. In particular, as part of this special section, it looks at couples\u2019 accounts of sex as they make the transition to parenthood, as a lens on the themes of gender, intimacy and equality. Far from being an easy relationship between them, as predicted by some scholars, this research shows that they are in fact, \u2018uncomfortable bedfellows\u2019.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Couples", "Equality", "Gender", "Intimacy", "Parenting", "Sex"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84949234982", "SubjectAreas": [["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"]], "AuthorData": {"36157708400": {"Name": "Faircloth C.", "AuthorID": "36157708400", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Social Anthropology, University of Cambridge"}}}
