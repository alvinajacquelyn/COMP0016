Few longitudinal studies have investigated childhood risk and protective factors. Aims To investigate the prevalence of eating disorder behaviours and cognitions and associated childhood psychological, physical and parental risk factors among a cohort of 14-yearold children. Method Data were collected from 6140 boys and girls aged 14 years. Gender-stratified models were used to estimate prospective associations between childhood body dissatisfaction, body mass index (BMI), self-esteem, maternal eating disorder and family economic disadvantage on adolescent eating disorder behaviours and cognitions. Results Childhood body dissatisfaction strongly predicted eating disorder cognitions in girls, but only in interaction with BMI in boys. Higher self-esteem had a protective effect, particularly in boys. Maternal eating disorder predicted body dissatisfaction and weight/shape concern in adolescent girls and dieting in boys. Conclusions Risk factors for eating disorder behaviours and cognitions vary according to gender. Prevention strategies should be gender-specific and target modifiable predictors in childhood and early adolescence.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adolescent Behavior", "Body Image", "Body Mass Index", "Body Weight", "Cognition", "Feeding and Eating Disorders", "Female", "Humans", "Longitudinal Studies", "Male", "Personal Satisfaction", "Prospective Studies", "Sex Factors", "Socioeconomic Factors", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84940545499", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"16031429800": {"Name": "Micali N.", "AuthorID": "16031429800", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Institute of Child Health, Behavioural and Brain Sciences Unit"}, "7004622714": {"Name": "De Stavola B.", "AuthorID": "7004622714", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Statistical Methodology, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "14020124700": {"Name": "Ploubidis G.", "AuthorID": "14020124700", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Population Health, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "23568462900": {"Name": "Simonoff E.", "AuthorID": "23568462900", "AffiliationID": "60006577, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, King's College London, Institute of Psychiatry, National Institute of Health Research Biomedical Research Unity for Mental Health"}, "7006097367": {"Name": "Treasure J.", "AuthorID": "7006097367", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Eating Disorders Research Unit, Psychological Medicine, Institute of Psychiatry, King's College London"}, "7102408771": {"Name": "Field A.E.", "AuthorID": "7102408771", "AffiliationID": "60032499", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology, Harvard School of Public Health"}}}
