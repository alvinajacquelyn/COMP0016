The exploration of OAM generation inspires various designs involving spiral phase plates, antenna arrays, metasurfaces, and computer-generated holograms. In this work, we theoretically and experimentally demonstrate an approach to producing OAM carrying EM waves by a point defect in three-dimensional (3D) photonic crystals (PCs). Simultaneous excitation of two vibrational-defect states with an elaborately engineered phase retardation generates a rotational state carrying OAM. Through converting guided waves in a line defect to localized waves in a point defect and then to radiated vortex waves in free space, the lowest four OAM-mode emitters, i.e., OAM indices of \u00b11 and \u00b12, are successfully realized. This work offers a physical mechanism to generate OAM by PCs, especially when the OAM generation is to be integrated with other designs.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Computer generated holograms", "Degree of freedom", "Orbital angular momentum", "Phase retardation", "Physical mechanism", "Rotational state", "Spiral phase plates", "Three dimensional (3D) photonic crystals"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85051468131", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"57116687500": {"Name": "Chen M.", "AuthorID": "57116687500", "AffiliationID": "60006541", "AffiliationName": "Electromagnetics and Optics Laboratory, Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Hong Kong"}, "56353178500": {"Name": "Jiang L.", "AuthorID": "56353178500", "AffiliationID": "60006541", "AffiliationName": "Electromagnetics and Optics Laboratory, Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Hong Kong"}, "56419475000": {"Name": "Sha W.", "AuthorID": "56419475000", "AffiliationID": "60117753, 60003970", "AffiliationName": "Innovative Institute of Electromagnetic Information and Electronic Integration, College of Information Science and Electronic Engineering, Zhejiang University"}}}
