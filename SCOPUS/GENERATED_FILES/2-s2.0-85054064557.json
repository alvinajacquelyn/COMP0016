There are no established surrogate markers in plasma of early NA-related toxicity. Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) is a protein produced by tubular cells following renal damage. We aimed therefore to retrospectively compare conventional renal markers (estimated glomerular filtration rates (eGFR) and urinary protein/creatinine ratio uPCR) with a sensitive biomarker (NGAL) in CHB patients on long-term NA therapy and assess the ability of new markers to predict NA-related renal toxicity (new onset of nonalbumin proteinuria). A total of 192 na\u00efve CHB patients (median age 41 years, 78% males, 25% HBeAg+, 35% cirrhosis) were NA treated for at least 5 years (median 8.34 years, range 5.54-11.1 years). The eGFR and uPCR were compared at baseline and last clinical visit with serum NGAL concentrations measured by ELISA at same time-points and assessed according to the presence/absence of nonalbumin proteinuria at last visit. While baseline and last visit eGFR were similar (median:78 vs 84 mL/min), serum NGAL concentrations increased during therapy (median:9.4 vs 16.4 ng/mL, P <.05). The proportion of patients with proteinuria (uPCR > 15) increased between baseline and last visit (4.6% vs 21.4%, P <.05), with 30 (16%) patients having de novo nonalbumin proteinuria at last visit. High baseline NGAL concentrations were exclusive to patients with de novo nonalbumin proteinuria (median:31.7 vs 7.8 ng/mL, P <.01) and baseline NGAL levels >25 mg/mL were predictive of nonalbumin proteinuria at last visit (AUROC = 0.813). In conclusion, serum NGAL can act as a surrogate marker of early renal injury (de novo nonalbumin proteinuria) in CHB on long-term NA therapy.", "AuthorKeywords": ["chronic hepatitis B", "long-term therapy", "neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL)", "nucleos(t)ide analogue", "proximal tubular nephropathy"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Age Factors", "Aged", "Antiviral Agents", "Biomarkers", "Creatinine", "Early Diagnosis", "Female", "Glomerular Filtration Rate", "Hepatitis B, Chronic", "Humans", "Lipocalin-2", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Nucleosides", "Nucleotides", "Proteinuria", "Renal Insufficiency", "Retrospective Studies", "ROC Curve", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85054064557", "SubjectAreas": [["Hepatology", "MEDI", "2721"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"], ["Virology", "IMMU", "2406"]], "AuthorData": {"16686358400": {"Name": "Carey I.", "AuthorID": "16686358400", "AffiliationID": "60021923", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Liver Studies, King's College Hospital"}, "57198211971": {"Name": "Byrne R.", "AuthorID": "57198211971", "AffiliationID": "60021923", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Liver Studies, King's College Hospital"}, "16303273200": {"Name": "Childs K.", "AuthorID": "16303273200", "AffiliationID": "60021923", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Liver Studies, King's College Hospital"}, "48662068800": {"Name": "Horner M.", "AuthorID": "48662068800", "AffiliationID": "60021923", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Liver Studies, King's College Hospital"}, "57197205420": {"Name": "Bruce M.", "AuthorID": "57197205420", "AffiliationID": "60021923", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Liver Studies, King's College Hospital"}, "57189581919": {"Name": "Wang B.", "AuthorID": "57189581919", "AffiliationID": "60021923", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Liver Studies, King's College Hospital"}, "7006885162": {"Name": "Dusheiko G.", "AuthorID": "7006885162", "AffiliationID": "60021923", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Liver Studies, King's College Hospital"}, "7201380739": {"Name": "Agarwal K.", "AuthorID": "7201380739", "AffiliationID": "60021923", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Liver Studies, King's College Hospital"}}}
