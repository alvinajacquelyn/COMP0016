Using linked employee-workplace data from the British Workplace Employment Relations Survey 2011, and using a variety of techniques including interval regression and propensity score matching, average hourly pay is found to be higher in dispersed ownership workplaces. The premium is broadly constant across most of the wage distribution, but falls at the 95th percentile to become statistically non-significant. This contrasts with earlier papers which indicate that higher level employees are the primary beneficiaries of higher pay from dispersed ownership. The dispersed ownership pay premium is not readily explained by efficiency wage perspectives but is consistent with a managerial desire for a \u2018quiet life\u2019.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85018906266", "SubjectAreas": [["Business, Management and Accounting (all)", "BUSI", "1400"], ["Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management", "BUSI", "1407"], ["Management of Technology and Innovation", "BUSI", "1405"]], "AuthorData": {"7003319666": {"Name": "Pendleton A.", "AuthorID": "7003319666", "AffiliationID": "60112747", "AffiliationName": "Durham University Business School"}, "7005546003": {"Name": "Bryson A.", "AuthorID": "7005546003", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60109561", "AffiliationName": "University College London \u2013 Institute of Education, IZA Bonn and the National Institute of Economic and Social Research"}, "6602249538": {"Name": "Gospel H.", "AuthorID": "6602249538", "AffiliationID": "60011520, 60016374, 60177635", "AffiliationName": "King\u2019s College London, Said Business School Oxford, and LUISS Rome"}}}
