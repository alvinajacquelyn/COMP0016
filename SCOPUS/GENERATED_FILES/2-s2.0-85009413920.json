Our measurements, made using the PEARL/HiPr and OSIRIS instruments at the ISIS neutron spallation source, covered the range 0.1 < P < 800 MPa and 150 < T < 280 K. The refined unit-cell volumes as a function of P and T are parameterized in the form of a Murnaghan integrated linear equation of state having a zero-pressure volume V0 = 706.23 (8) \u00c53, zero-pressure bulk modulus K0 = 19.9 (4) GPa and its first pressure derivative, K\u2032 = 9 (1). The structure's compressibility is highly anisotropic, as expected, with the three principal directions of the unit-strain tensor having compressibilities of 9.6 \u00d7 10-3, 3.4 \u00d7 10-2 and 3.4 \u00d7 10-3 GPa-1, the most compressible direction being perpendicular to the long axis of a discrete hexadecameric water cluster, (D2O)16. At high pressure we observed two different phase transitions. First, warming of MgSO4\u00b711D2O at 545 MPa resulted in a change in the diffraction pattern at 275 K consistent with partial (peritectic) melting; quasielastic neutron spectra collected simultaneously evince the onset of the reorientational motion of D2O molecules with characteristic time-scales of 20-30 ps, longer than those found in bulk liquid water at the same temperature and commensurate with the lifetime of solvent-separated ion pairs in aqueous MgSO4. Second, at \u223c 0.9 GPa, 240 K, MgSO4\u00b711D2O decomposed into high-pressure water ice phase VI and MgSO4\u00b79D2O, a recently discovered phase that has hitherto only been formed at ambient pressure by quenching small droplets of MgSO4(aq) in liquid nitrogen. The fate of the high-pressure enneahydrate on further compression and warming is not clear from the neutron diffraction data, but its occurrence indicates that it may also be a rock-forming mineral in the deep mantles of large icy satellites.", "AuthorKeywords": ["enneahydrate", "equation of state", "meridianiite", "neutron diffraction", "quasielastic neutron scattering", "undecahydrate"], "IndexKeywords": ["enneahydrate", "Equation of state", "meridianiite", "Quasi elastic neutron scattering", "undecahydrate"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85009413920", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"], ["Metals and Alloys", "MATE", "2506"], ["Materials Chemistry", "MATE", "2505"]], "AuthorData": {"7004475745": {"Name": "Fortes A.D.", "AuthorID": "7004475745", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, University College London"}, "55924594300": {"Name": "Fernandez-Alonso F.", "AuthorID": "55924594300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "7201659737": {"Name": "Tucker M.", "AuthorID": "7201659737", "AffiliationID": "60007722", "AffiliationName": "Spallation Neutron Source"}, "7102583827": {"Name": "Wood I.G.", "AuthorID": "7102583827", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, University College London"}}}
