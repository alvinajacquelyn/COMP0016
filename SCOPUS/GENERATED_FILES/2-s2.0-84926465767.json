IgG aPL against domain I of \u03b22-glycoprotein I (\u03b22GPI) [anti-DI (aDI)] is associated with the pathogenesis of APS, an autoimmune disease defined by thrombosis and pregnancy morbidity. To date, however, no study has demonstrated direct pathogenicity of IgG aDI in vivo. In this proof-of-concept study, we designed a novel system to affinity purify polyclonal aDI aPL in order to assess its prothrombotic ability in a well-characterized mouse microcirculation model for APS. Methods. Two polyclonal IgG fractions were isolated from serum of a patient with APS, both with high aPL activity but differing in aDI activity (aDI-rich and aDI-poor). These IgG fractions were tested for their pathogenic ability in an in vivo mouse model of thrombosis. Male CD1 mice were injected intraperitoneally with either aDIrich or aDI-poor IgG; as a control, IgG isolated from healthy serum was used. A pinch injury was applied to the right femoral vein and thrombus dynamics and tissue factor activity in isolated tissue were evaluated. Results. Both aDI-rich and aDI-poor IgG retained aCL and anti-\u03b22GPI activity, while only aDI-rich IgG displayed high aDI activity, as defined by our in-house cut-offs for positivity in each assay. aDI-rich IgG induced significantly larger thrombi in vivo compared with aDI-poor IgG (P<0.0001). Similarly, aDI-rich IgG significantly enhanced the procoagulant activity of carotid artery endothelium and peritoneal macrophages isolated from experimental animals (P<0.01). Conclusion. These data directly demonstrate that the ability to cause thrombosis in vivo is concentrated in the aDI fraction of aPL.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Anti-phospholipid antibodies", "Anti-phospholipid syndrome", "Domain i", "Mouse model", "Venous thrombosis", "\u03b22-glycoprotein i"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84926465767", "SubjectAreas": [["Rheumatology", "MEDI", "2745"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"15766296400": {"Name": "Pericleous C.", "AuthorID": "15766296400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Rheumatology Research, Division of Medicine, University College London"}, "35446856700": {"Name": "Latchman D.S.", "AuthorID": "35446856700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Rheumatology Research, Division of Medicine, University College London"}, "36051280800": {"Name": "Isenberg D.A.", "AuthorID": "36051280800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Rheumatology Research, Division of Medicine, University College London"}, "56506767800": {"Name": "Giles I.", "AuthorID": "56506767800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Rheumatology Research, Division of Medicine, University College London"}, "7003289700": {"Name": "Ioannou Y.", "AuthorID": "7003289700", "AffiliationID": "60024544, 60018207", "AffiliationName": "Arthritis Research UK Centre for Adolescent Rheumatology, University College London Hospital, Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "57212819228": {"Name": "Rahman A.", "AuthorID": "57212819228", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Rheumatology Research, Division of Medicine, University College London"}, "35622557400": {"Name": "Ruiz-Lim\u00f3n P.", "AuthorID": "35622557400", "AffiliationID": "60014569", "AffiliationName": "Division of Rheumatology, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Texas Medical Branch"}, "16314280100": {"Name": "Romay-Penabad Z.", "AuthorID": "16314280100", "AffiliationID": "60014569", "AffiliationName": "Division of Rheumatology, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Texas Medical Branch"}, "55491041200": {"Name": "Carrera Mar\u00edn A.", "AuthorID": "55491041200", "AffiliationID": "60014569", "AffiliationName": "Division of Rheumatology, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Texas Medical Branch"}, "7006846356": {"Name": "Pierangeli S.S.", "AuthorID": "7006846356", "AffiliationID": "60014569", "AffiliationName": "Division of Rheumatology, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Texas Medical Branch"}, "23970686100": {"Name": "Garza-Garcia A.", "AuthorID": "23970686100", "AffiliationID": "60023477, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "Structural Biology, Medical Research Council National Institute for Medical Research"}, "51562223300": {"Name": "Murfitt L.", "AuthorID": "51562223300", "AffiliationID": "60023477, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "Structural Biology, Medical Research Council National Institute for Medical Research"}, "7103273637": {"Name": "Driscoll P.C.", "AuthorID": "7103273637", "AffiliationID": "60023477, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "Structural Biology, Medical Research Council National Institute for Medical Research"}}}
