Here, we report that in rodents and human cadaver brains, ~75% of scalp-applied currents are attenuated by soft tissue and skull. Using intracellular and extracellular recordings in rats, we find that at least 1 mV/mm voltage gradient is necessary to affect neuronal spiking and subthreshold currents. We designed an 'intersectional short pulse' stimulation method to inject sufficiently high current intensities into the brain, while keeping the charge density and sensation on the scalp surface relatively low. We verify the regional specificity of this novel method in rodents; in humans, we demonstrate how it affects the amplitude of simultaneously recorded EEG alpha waves. Our combined results establish that neuronal circuits are instantaneously affected by intensity currents that are higher than those used in conventional protocols.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Animals", "Brain", "Cadaver", "Electroencephalography", "Female", "Healthy Volunteers", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Neural Pathways", "Neurons", "Patch-Clamp Techniques", "Rats", "Rats, Long-Evans", "Skull", "Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85041823790", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"57200601877": {"Name": "V\u00f6r\u00f6slakos M.", "AuthorID": "57200601877", "AffiliationID": "60021784", "AffiliationName": "Neuroscience Institute, New York University"}, "47461774800": {"Name": "Takeuchi Y.", "AuthorID": "47461774800", "AffiliationID": "60027332", "AffiliationName": "MTA-SZTE momentum Oscillatory Neuronal Networks Research Group, Department of Physiology, University of Szeged"}, "57190582716": {"Name": "Oliva A.", "AuthorID": "57190582716", "AffiliationID": "60021784", "AffiliationName": "Neuroscience Institute, New York University"}, "55179305800": {"Name": "Fern\u00e1ndez-Ruiz A.", "AuthorID": "55179305800", "AffiliationID": "60021784", "AffiliationName": "Neuroscience Institute, New York University"}, "55486011500": {"Name": "Koz\u00e1k G.", "AuthorID": "55486011500", "AffiliationID": "60027332", "AffiliationName": "MTA-SZTE momentum Oscillatory Neuronal Networks Research Group, Department of Physiology, University of Szeged"}, "8976416500": {"Name": "Ber\u00e9nyi A.", "AuthorID": "8976416500", "AffiliationID": "60021784", "AffiliationName": "Neuroscience Institute, New York University"}, "7006676856": {"Name": "Buzs\u00e1ki G.", "AuthorID": "7006676856", "AffiliationID": "60021784", "AffiliationName": "Center for Neural Science, New York University"}, "55814017700": {"Name": "Brinyiczki K.", "AuthorID": "55814017700", "AffiliationID": "60027332", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, University of Szeged"}, "56398399900": {"Name": "Zombori T.", "AuthorID": "56398399900", "AffiliationID": "60027332", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, University of Szeged"}, "7005430199": {"Name": "Iv\u00e1nyi B.", "AuthorID": "7005430199", "AffiliationID": "60027332", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, University of Szeged"}, "24385435400": {"Name": "Kincses Z.", "AuthorID": "24385435400", "AffiliationID": "60027332", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, University of Szeged"}}}
