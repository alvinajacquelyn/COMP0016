We report the first 60 GHz wireless link implementing a uni-traveling carrier photodiode (UTC-PD) at the transmitter and a photonic integrated chip incorporating a UTC-PD at the receiver. In this demonstration, a 64.5 GHz signal carrying 1 Gbps on-off keying (OOK) data was generated by heterodyning two optical tones into the transmitter UTC-PD. The signal was transmitted using a 24 dBi gain parabolic antenna over a wireless distance of three metres before reaching an identical receiver antenna. At the receiver, an electronic mixer was used to down-convert the received signal into an intermediate frequency of 12.5 GHz. The local oscillator to the electronic mixer was provided by heterodyne mixing of two optical tones generated using a UTC-PD that is monolithically integrated with semiconductor lasers. The down-converted signal was acquired by a real-time oscilloscope for offline processing, which showed zero error bits in a 10 5 bit-long transmission.", "AuthorKeywords": ["5G", "millimeter waves", "mixers", "photodiodes"], "IndexKeywords": ["Intermediate frequencies", "Local oscillators", "Monolithically integrated", "Off-line processing", "On off keying (OOK)", "Real-time oscilloscope", "Uni-traveling carrier photodiode", "Uni-traveling-carrier photodiodes"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85060045089", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"], ["Signal Processing", "COMP", "1711"], ["Instrumentation", "PHYS", "3105"], ["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"]], "AuthorData": {"57200522491": {"Name": "Mohammad A.", "AuthorID": "57200522491", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "55635480300": {"Name": "Balakier K.", "AuthorID": "55635480300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "55600338800": {"Name": "Shams H.", "AuthorID": "55600338800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "14019722700": {"Name": "Liu C.", "AuthorID": "14019722700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "53866442400": {"Name": "Graham C.", "AuthorID": "53866442400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "55312030000": {"Name": "Natrella M.", "AuthorID": "55312030000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "57204721787": {"Name": "Lin X.", "AuthorID": "57204721787", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "7004751445": {"Name": "Seeds A.", "AuthorID": "7004751445", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "7006454070": {"Name": "Renaud C.", "AuthorID": "7006454070", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "16231956400": {"Name": "Van Dijk F.", "AuthorID": "16231956400", "AffiliationID": "60007823, 60021378, 60107882", "AffiliationName": "III-V Lab, Laboratory of 'Nokia Bell Labs', Thales Research and Technology, CEA-LETI"}}}
