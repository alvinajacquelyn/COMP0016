For instance, unintentional injections into arteries can lead to strokes or cardiotoxicity during interventional pain management procedures that involve injections in the vicinity of nerves. Reliable detection with current external imaging systems remains elusive. Optical generation and reception of ultrasound allow for depth-resolved sensing and they can be performed with optical fibers that are positioned within needles used in clinical practice. The needle probe developed in this study comprised separate optical fibers for generating and receiving ultrasound. Photoacoustic generation of ultrasound was performed on the distal end face of an optical fiber by coating it with an optically absorbing material. Ultrasound reception was performed using a high-finesse Fabry-P\u00e9rot cavity. The sensor data was displayed as an M-mode image with a real-time interface. Imaging was performed on a biological tissue phantom.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Laser-generated ultrasound", "Needle guidance", "Photoacoustic"], "IndexKeywords": ["Absorbing materials", "Biological tissues", "Clinical practices", "Laser-generated ultrasound", "Minimally invasive", "Needle guidance", "Photoacoustic", "Real time interfaces"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84928535792", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Biomaterials", "MATE", "2502"], ["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"], ["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"56150220800": {"Name": "Colchester R.J.", "AuthorID": "56150220800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London, Malet Place Engineering Building"}, "7003418009": {"Name": "Mosse C.A.", "AuthorID": "7003418009", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London, Malet Place Engineering Building"}, "57188642825": {"Name": "Nikitichev D.I.", "AuthorID": "57188642825", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London, Malet Place Engineering Building"}, "7102686951": {"Name": "Zhang E.Z.", "AuthorID": "7102686951", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London, Malet Place Engineering Building"}, "7006238023": {"Name": "Beard P.C.", "AuthorID": "7006238023", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London, Malet Place Engineering Building"}, "55840844300": {"Name": "Desjardins A.E.", "AuthorID": "55840844300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London, Malet Place Engineering Building"}, "55820371500": {"Name": "West S.", "AuthorID": "55820371500", "AffiliationID": "60027403", "AffiliationName": "University College Hospital"}, "8306417100": {"Name": "Papakonstantinou I.", "AuthorID": "8306417100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London, Roberts Building"}}}
