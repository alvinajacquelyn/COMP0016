Temporal records compiled for a number of trace elements show a relatively wide spread in concentrations spanning several orders of magnitude within a single deposit. It has been suggested that this spread is present in both bulk rock digestion and laser ablation data, however, the comparability of data from the two methods has not been thoroughly evaluated. Here, we provide a statistical assessment of how comparable laser ablation data of individual BIF hematite and magnetite grains are to one another, as well as how closely averages of laser ablation data approximate bulk rock values. To do so, we use (laser ablation)-high resolution inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry ((LA)-HR-ICP-MS) data from 14 BIF slabs and corresponding powders that span four different formations. We focus in particular on BIF from the \u22653.75 Ga Nuvvuagittuq Supracrustal Belt (Qu\u00e9bec, Canada) and multiple BIF deposits of the 2.6\u20132.45 Ga Hamersley Group (North Western Australia), representing deposits separated by over a billion years and of differing metamorphic grade. The scaling between selected transition metals is also evaluated in light of expectations for possible delivery mechanisms of trace elements from seawater to BIF precursor sediments \u2013 the adsorption to hydrous ferric oxides, biological vectors, and detrital influence. Our findings show that average trace element concentrations between bulk versus laser ablation data typically vary within an order of magnitude. Furthermore, reproducibility between the two methods appears to be independent of formation age, metamorphic grade, or depositional setting. These findings underscore the overall fidelity of the BIF record at capturing seawater compositional signatures at various scales. We demonstrate that evaluations of ancient seawater chemistry using the BIF record are best served by a combined approach utilizing both bulk rock and laser ablation data, as bulk methods offer the most conservative proxy data for ancient seawater composition but may mask significant enrichments or depletions that are detectable at the grain-scale by laser ablation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Banded iron formations", "Bulk digestions", "Hamersley Basin", "Laser ablation", "Nuvvuagittuq Supracrustal Belt", "Trace elements"], "IndexKeywords": ["Banded iron formations", "Bulk digestions", "Compositional variability", "Hamersley Basin", "High resolution inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometries", "Precambrian atmospheres", "Statistical assessment", "Trace element concentrations"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85059805535", "SubjectAreas": [["Geology", "EART", "1907"], ["Geochemistry and Petrology", "EART", "1906"]], "AuthorData": {"54793364500": {"Name": "Robbins L.", "AuthorID": "54793364500", "AffiliationID": "60030835", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth & Atmospheric Sciences, University of Alberta"}, "6701782021": {"Name": "Konhauser K.", "AuthorID": "6701782021", "AffiliationID": "60030835", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth & Atmospheric Sciences, University of Alberta"}, "57192955111": {"Name": "Warchola T.", "AuthorID": "57192955111", "AffiliationID": "60030835", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth & Atmospheric Sciences, University of Alberta"}, "7006548150": {"Name": "Alessi D.", "AuthorID": "7006548150", "AffiliationID": "60030835", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth & Atmospheric Sciences, University of Alberta"}, "36105897200": {"Name": "Homann M.", "AuthorID": "36105897200", "AffiliationID": "60105671, 60104222", "AffiliationName": "European Institute for Marine Studies, CNRS-UMR6538 Laboratoire G\u00e9osciences Oc\u00e9an, Technop\u00f4le Brest-Iroise"}, "6505669139": {"Name": "Thoby M.", "AuthorID": "6505669139", "AffiliationID": "60105671, 60104222", "AffiliationName": "European Institute for Marine Studies, CNRS-UMR6538 Laboratoire G\u00e9osciences Oc\u00e9an, Technop\u00f4le Brest-Iroise"}, "57214610163": {"Name": "Foster I.", "AuthorID": "57214610163", "AffiliationID": "60105671, 60104222", "AffiliationName": "European Institute for Marine Studies, CNRS-UMR6538 Laboratoire G\u00e9osciences Oc\u00e9an, Technop\u00f4le Brest-Iroise"}, "13807956000": {"Name": "Lalonde S.", "AuthorID": "13807956000", "AffiliationID": "60105671, 60104222", "AffiliationName": "European Institute for Marine Studies, CNRS-UMR6538 Laboratoire G\u00e9osciences Oc\u00e9an, Technop\u00f4le Brest-Iroise"}, "54793443300": {"Name": "Mloszewska A.", "AuthorID": "54793443300", "AffiliationID": "60016849", "AffiliationName": "Earth Sciences Department, University of Toronto"}}}
