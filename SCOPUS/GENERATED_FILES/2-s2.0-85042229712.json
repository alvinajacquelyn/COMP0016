Engaging medical students to tackle this urgent challenge alongside clinical sciences can be demanding. This study examines medical student perceptions of a flipped approach to health inequalities co-designed by faculty and sixth-year students. Innovation: A flipped learning session was piloted for year 4 medical students combining an online lesson followed by a tutorial with a simulated patient. Methods: A mixed-methods approach collected questionnaire data using 4-point Likert scales and free text answers. A semi-structured group interview was conducted with six voluntary participants. Results: Two hundred and eighty-nine students completed questionnaires. 85% (n = 246) completed the online lesson. Students agreed the session helped their understanding of key concepts (mean 3.2), was improved by having an actor (mean = 3.6), and was enjoyable (mean = 3.2). Thematic analysis of qualitative questionnaire and interview data revealed three themes: engagement; structure; and attitudes towards social determinants of health. The simulation increased clinical relevance and students gained understanding of the impact of health inequalities upon individuals. Conclusions: This paper indicates flipped learning can increase clinical relevance and engagement in population health and person-centered care. Further work could assess changes in practice and attitudes of future doctors in tackling such global health challenges.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Attitude of Health Personnel", "Computer-Assisted Instruction", "Curriculum", "Education, Medical, Undergraduate", "Health Status Disparities", "Healthcare Disparities", "Humans", "Learning", "Organizational Innovation", "Patient Simulation", "Pilot Projects", "Program Evaluation", "Simulation Training", "Social Determinants of Health", "Students, Medical", "Surveys and Questionnaires"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85042229712", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"]], "AuthorData": {"57118121700": {"Name": "Gostelow N.", "AuthorID": "57118121700", "AffiliationID": "60029950", "AffiliationName": "Medical School, University College London Medical School"}, "57208385581": {"Name": "Barber J.", "AuthorID": "57208385581", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Primary Care and Population Health, University College London"}, "6505741121": {"Name": "Gishen F.", "AuthorID": "6505741121", "AffiliationID": "60029950", "AffiliationName": "University College London Medical School"}, "36458299400": {"Name": "Berlin A.", "AuthorID": "36458299400", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary\u2019s University"}}}
