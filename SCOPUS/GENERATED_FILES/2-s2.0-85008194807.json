This paper analyses new data from a randomized control trial conducted in Eritrea, which surprisingly shows the opposite: indoor residual spraying encouraged net acquisition and use. One possible explanation for this finding is that there is imperfect information about the risk of malaria infection. The introduction of indoor residual spraying may have made the problem of malaria more salient, leading to a change in beliefs about its importance and to an increase in private health investments.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bed nets", "Behavior", "Beliefs", "Indoor Residual Spray", "Information", "Malaria"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85008194807", "SubjectAreas": [["Economics and Econometrics", "ECON", "2002"], ["Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management", "BUSI", "1407"]], "AuthorData": {"57192816615": {"Name": "Armand A.", "AuthorID": "57192816615", "AffiliationID": "60033320", "AffiliationName": "University of Navarra and Navarra Center for International Development, Instituto Cultura y Sociedad"}, "36950364900": {"Name": "Carneiro P.", "AuthorID": "36950364900", "AffiliationID": "60117041, 60012327", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Fiscal Studies, Centre for Microdata Methods and Practice"}, "56207550700": {"Name": "Locatelli A.", "AuthorID": "56207550700", "AffiliationID": "60082963", "AffiliationName": "Bank of Italy, Trento branch"}, "37561797900": {"Name": "Mihreteab S.", "AuthorID": "37561797900", "AffiliationID": "100327343", "AffiliationName": "National Malaria Control Program"}, "35229673200": {"Name": "Keating J.", "AuthorID": "35229673200", "AffiliationID": "60021134", "AffiliationName": "Department of Tropical Medicine, School of Public Health & Tropical Medicine, Tulane University"}}}
