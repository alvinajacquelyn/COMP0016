The DEM specimens were temporarily are divided into grids so that soil particles could be created in batches into a smaller area. Using the specimen, a 2D DEM-centrifuge model was prepared by applying an increased gravity condition, which was then used to study the monotonic loading behaviour of a rigid monopile. This formed the DEM-centrifuge model, and it was found that the GM was efficient in preparing the dense samples because it reduced the overall sample preparation time and managed to generate more homogeneous specimens.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Centrifuge modeling", "Gravity conditions", "Grid methods", "Model scale", "Monotonic loading", "Particle generation", "Sample preparation", "Soil particles"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84985032138", "SubjectAreas": [["Civil and Structural Engineering", "ENGI", "2205"], ["Architecture", "ENGI", "2216"], ["Building and Construction", "ENGI", "2215"], ["Geotechnical Engineering and Engineering Geology", "EART", "1909"]], "AuthorData": {"56367953400": {"Name": "Duan N.", "AuthorID": "56367953400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dept. of Civil, Environment and Geomatic Engineering, Univ.
