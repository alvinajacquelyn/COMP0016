The current gold standard in drug sensitivity testing is slow and cumbersome. To tackle drug resistance effectively, a more rapid method of testing is required. Current molecular tests are fast, but only offer information on a limited number of genetic loci. Whole genome sequencing presents an attractive alternative that can provide comprehensive, clinically relevant information on all described loci. Although the standard approach to whole genome sequencing of Mycobacterium tuberculosis is slow due to the requirement of culture, this article will describe recent advances that mean it has the potential to provide results within days.", "AuthorKeywords": ["DST", "Genomics", "Sequencing", "Tuberculosis", "WGS"], "IndexKeywords": ["Antitubercular Agents", "Bacterial Typing Techniques", "Drug Resistance, Multiple, Bacterial", "Genetic Loci", "Genome, Bacterial", "High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing", "Humans", "Microbial Sensitivity Tests", "Molecular Targeted Therapy", "Mycobacterium tuberculosis", "Precision Medicine", "Tuberculosis, Multidrug-Resistant", "Tuberculosis, Pulmonary"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84954372169", "SubjectAreas": [["Microbiology", "IMMU", "2404"], ["Microbiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2726"], ["Virology", "IMMU", "2406"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"53866063000": {"Name": "Bryant J.M.", "AuthorID": "53866063000", "AffiliationID": "60176023", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity, UCL"}, "55498702100": {"Name": "Breuer J.", "AuthorID": "55498702100", "AffiliationID": "60176023", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity, UCL"}, "7005890471": {"Name": "Lipman M.", "AuthorID": "7005890471", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60170516", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Respiratory Medicine, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust, University College London"}}}
