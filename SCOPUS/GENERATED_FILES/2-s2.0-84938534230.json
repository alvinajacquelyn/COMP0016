Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the British Society for Rheumatology.Objective. Ciclosporin and MTX are used in idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (DM and PM) when patients incompletely respond to glucocorticoids. Their effectiveness is unproved in randomized controlled trials (RCTs). We evaluated their benefits in a placebo-controlled factorial RCT. Methods. A 56-week multicentre factorial-design double-blind placebo-controlled RCT compared steroids alone, MTX (15-25 mg weekly) plus steroids, ciclosporin (1-5 mg/kg/day) plus steroids and all three treatments. It enrolled adults with myositis (by Bohan and Peter criteria) with active disease receiving corticosteroids. Results. A total of 359 patients were screened and 58 randomized. Of the latter, 37 patients completed 12 months of treatment, 7 were lost to follow-up and 14 discontinued treatment. Patients completing 12 months of treatment showed significant improvement (P < 0.001 on paired t-tests) in manual muscle testing (14% change), walking time (22% change) and function (9% change). Intention to treat and completer analyses indicated that ciclosporin monotherapy, MTX monotherapy and ciclosporin/MTX combination therapy showed no significant treatment effects in comparison with placebo. Conclusion. Neither MTX nor ciclosporin (by themselves or in combination) improved clinical features in myositis patients who had incompletely responded to glucocorticoids.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Basic and clinical sciences", "Clinical trials and methods", "DMARDs therapies", "Immunosuppressant therapies", "Myositis and muscle disease", "Psychology and social phenomena", "Quality of life", "Rheumatic diseases"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84938534230", "SubjectAreas": [["Rheumatology", "MEDI", "2745"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"12241199600": {"Name": "Ibrahim F.", "AuthorID": "12241199600", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Rheumatology, King's College London"}, "7202833638": {"Name": "Gordon P.", "AuthorID": "7202833638", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Rheumatology, King's College London"}, "56755430600": {"Name": "White-Alao B.", "AuthorID": "56755430600", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Rheumatology, King's College London"}, "7404952159": {"Name": "Scott D.L.", "AuthorID": "7404952159", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Rheumatology, King's College London"}, "7005149637": {"Name": "Choy E.", "AuthorID": "7005149637", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "Cardiff Institute of Infection and Immunity, Cardiff University, School of Medicine"}, "16941587100": {"Name": "Dor\u00e9 C.J.", "AuthorID": "16941587100", "AffiliationID": "60020849, 60003108", "AffiliationName": "MRC Clinical Trials Unit, Whipps Cross University Hospital"}, "57220520024": {"Name": "Hakim A.", "AuthorID": "57220520024", "AffiliationID": "60020849", "AffiliationName": "Department of Rheumatology, Whipps Cross University Hospital"}, "7006811407": {"Name": "Kitas G.", "AuthorID": "7006811407", "AffiliationID": "60026570, 60000038", "AffiliationName": "Department of Rheumatology, Russells Hall Hospital, Dudley Group of Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57201108555": {"Name": "Isenberg D.", "AuthorID": "57201108555", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60010088", "AffiliationName": "Department of Rheumatology, University College, London Hospitals"}, "57214234713": {"Name": "Griffiths B.", "AuthorID": "57214234713", "AffiliationID": "60018514", "AffiliationName": "Musculoskeletal Unit, Freeman Hospital"}, "57195144464": {"Name": "Lecky B.", "AuthorID": "57195144464", "AffiliationID": "60020921", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Walton Centre for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "7005640479": {"Name": "Chakravarty K.", "AuthorID": "7005640479", "AffiliationID": "60007937", "AffiliationName": "Department of Rheumatology, Queen's Hospital"}, "7006442752": {"Name": "Winer J.", "AuthorID": "7006442752", "AffiliationID": "60012191", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, The Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Neuroscience Centre"}, "6701425047": {"Name": "Danko K.", "AuthorID": "6701425047", "AffiliationID": "60108571", "AffiliationName": "Department of Internal Medicine, Medical University of Debrecen"}, "57214353817": {"Name": "Cooper R.G.", "AuthorID": "57214353817", "AffiliationID": "60008873", "AffiliationName": "Rheumatic Diseases Centre, Salford Royal NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
