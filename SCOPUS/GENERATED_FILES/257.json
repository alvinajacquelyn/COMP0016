These efforts have frequently emphasised the importance of early diagnosis in dementia care. We sought to test the hypotheses that the mean cognitive score of new referrals to a secondary care memory assessment service increased while mean age decreased over a period of 20 years. We retrospectively analysed the data of 1476 patients. The passage of time was associated with a significant increase in mean cognitive scores, while there was no association between time and age after controlling for other factors. We suggest that memory services need to be designed to meet the needs of less cognitively impaired patients. In practice this means that using simple screening tests is not sufficient in this group of patients.", "AuthorKeywords": ["cognitive impairment", "dementia", "memory clinic", "patient profile", "trend"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Ambulatory Care Facilities", "Dementia", "Early Diagnosis", "Early Medical Intervention", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Mental Status Schedule", "Middle Aged", "Psychological Tests", "Referral and Consultation", "Retrospective Studies", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84976412270", "SubjectAreas": [["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"], ["Social Sciences (all)", "SOCI", "3300"]], "AuthorData": {"23984291000": {"Name": "Azam B.", "AuthorID": "23984291000", "AffiliationID": "60099287", "AffiliationName": "South West Yorkshire Partnership NHS Foundation Trust"}, "26640836100": {"Name": "Whitfield T.J.", "AuthorID": "26640836100", "AffiliationID": "60171633", "AffiliationName": "North Essex Partnership University NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57190005376": {"Name": "Radford D.", "AuthorID": "57190005376", "AffiliationID": "60171633", "AffiliationName": "North Essex Partnership University NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57189999245": {"Name": "Dontham S.G.", "AuthorID": "57189999245", "AffiliationID": "60171633", "AffiliationName": "North Essex Partnership University NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57197136335": {"Name": "Stevens T.", "AuthorID": "57197136335", "AffiliationID": "60171633", "AffiliationName": "North Essex Partnership University NHS Foundation Trust"}, "8589596700": {"Name": "Dannhauser T.", "AuthorID": "8589596700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "36830984200": {"Name": "Walker Z.", "AuthorID": "36830984200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
