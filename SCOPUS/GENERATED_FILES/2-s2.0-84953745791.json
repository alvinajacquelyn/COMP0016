Introduction Despite the efforts of organizations such as the Institute for Fiscal Studies, many current public debates about taxation are conducted without a sufficient empirical base. The participants are, rather, motivated by ideology \u2013 reasoning from theoretical principles \u2013 while advancing claims about the presumptive distributional effects of a particular tax. By contrast, eighteenth-century moral philosophy and nineteenth-century political economy self-consciously developed against the backdrop of the British state's growing statistical capacities. Debates about the Corn Laws, for instance, were mediated by a wealth of data generated from the English Corn Returns, which in turn produced improvements in the way the data was handled (Adrian, 1977; Fairlie, 1969; Barnes, 1930; Fay, 1932). As early as 1685, the British parliament appointed independent inspectors to report at quarter sessions the market prices of \u2018corn\u2019 (which in the English context meant \u2018grain\u2019 in a general sense, including wheat, barley, malt, rye, oats and peas/beans) in the English maritime districts with an eye to adjusting and enforcing the custom duties and bounties on imported foreign grains (Coffman and Ormrod, 2014). From 1770, inspectors were required to report weekly quantities and prices for specified coastal and inland market towns to the official corn commissioners. The prices were, in turn, published in the London Gazette. After 1820, the Gazette printed quantities as well as prices for up to 290 markets. Eighteenth-century moral philosophers and nineteenth-century political economists including Adam Smith, Thomas Robert Malthus and David Ricardo used this data to debate with each other about the distributional effects of the corn bounties and Corn Laws (Coffman and Omrod, 2014). This chapter explores the seminal role of grain markets in economic theory, before examining the structure of English and North American grain markets, the origins and evolution of the Corn Returns, and the use of the Corn Returns in the first 150 years of administration of the Corn Laws; the chapter ends with a consideration of the empiricist impulse within early political economy and with it how certain modes of analysis were brought to bear on contemporary policy debates.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84953745791", "SubjectAreas": [["Economics, Econometrics and Finance (all)", "ECON", "2000"], ["Business, Management and Accounting (all)", "BUSI", "1400"]], "AuthorData": {"56603101200": {"Name": "Coffman D.D.", "AuthorID": "56603101200", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "The Bartlett School, University College London"}}}
