Methods: Individuals from two large cohorts experiencing virological failure (VF) while maintained on ART with =1 CD4 count and =1 resistance test were included. CD4 slopes were estimated using linear mixed models. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to assess the effect of clusters of mutations, defined using extracted component based scores from the PCA, on CD4 decline. Results: 5,357 individuals contributing 7,661 VF episodes were included: any DRM were detected in 88.8% of episodes. After adjustment, CD4 counts declined less steeply during episodes where DRM were detected compared to episodes with no DRM (difference =28 cells/mm3/year, 95% CI =18, 39; P<0.001). Among individuals with at least one DRM, we found evidence that any nucleoside/ nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) resistance, the reverse transcriptase (RT) mutations M184V, D67N and T215Y as well as the protease mutations V82A and I54V were associated with reduced CD4 declines. The detection of any non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor resistance, the RT mutations V179D and L74V were associated with steeper CD4 declines. The presence of some mutation patterns similar to the clusters identified by the PCA also affected the CD4 decline. Conclusions: Detection of resistance and of certain DRM during VF of ART has a small but significant favourable effect on CD4 decline.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Alleles", "Amino Acid Substitution", "Antiretroviral Therapy, Highly Active", "CD4 Lymphocyte Count", "CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes", "Drug Resistance, Viral", "Female", "HIV Infections", "HIV-1", "Humans", "Male", "Mutation", "Treatment Outcome", "Viral Load"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85047134627", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"56601225300": {"Name": "Schultze A.", "AuthorID": "56601225300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infection and Population Health, UCL"}, "56466212800": {"Name": "Sabin C.", "AuthorID": "56466212800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infection and Population Health, UCL"}, "35372648800": {"Name": "Phillips A.N.", "AuthorID": "35372648800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infection and Population Health, UCL"}, "56606700000": {"Name": "Hill T.", "AuthorID": "56606700000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infection and Population Health, UCL"}, "57191913967": {"Name": "Tostevin A.", "AuthorID": "57191913967", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infection and Population Health, UCL"}, "56595739700": {"Name": "Dunn D.", "AuthorID": "56595739700", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60003108", "AffiliationName": "MRC Clinical Trials Unit, UCL"}, "55134188900": {"Name": "Cozzi-Lepri A.", "AuthorID": "55134188900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infection and Population Health, UCL"}, "7007168393": {"Name": "Paredes R.", "AuthorID": "7007168393", "AffiliationID": "112859844", "AffiliationName": "Institut de Recerca de la SIDA\u2013IrsiCaixa"}, "7201727367": {"Name": "Pillay D.", "AuthorID": "7201727367", "AffiliationID": "60010499, 60138826", "AffiliationName": "Africa Centre for Population Health, University of KwaZulu-Natal"}, "6701726336": {"Name": "Mackie N.", "AuthorID": "6701726336", "AffiliationID": "60111785", "AffiliationName": "Department of HIV, Sexual Health and Infections, Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"}, "57201980205": {"Name": "Castagna A.", "AuthorID": "57201980205", "AffiliationID": "60009622", "AffiliationName": "Universit\u00e0 Vita-Salute San Raffaele"}, "7201357349": {"Name": "Chadwick D.", "AuthorID": "7201357349", "AffiliationID": "60030723", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Clinical Infection, James Cook University Hospital"}, "24278383500": {"Name": "Falconer K.", "AuthorID": "24278383500", "AffiliationID": "60019295", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infectious Diseases, Karolinska University Hospital"}, "6701366859": {"Name": "Geretti A.M.", "AuthorID": "6701366859", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Infection and Global Health, University of Liverpool"}, "57203678070": {"Name": "Post F.A.", "AuthorID": "57203678070", "AffiliationID": "60021923", "AffiliationName": "Department of Sexual Health and HIV, King\u2019s College Hospital"}, "7005723136": {"Name": "Kirk O.", "AuthorID": "7005723136", "AffiliationID": "60030840, 60006564", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infectious Diseases, CHIP, Section 2100, Rigshospitalet, University of Copenhagen"}, "35307337700": {"Name": "Lundgren J.", "AuthorID": "35307337700", "AffiliationID": "60030840, 60006564", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infectious Diseases, CHIP, Section 2100, Rigshospitalet, University of Copenhagen"}, "7006184267": {"Name": "Pozniak A.", "AuthorID": "7006184267", "AffiliationID": "60002484", "AffiliationName": "St Stephens AIDS Trust, Chelsea and Westminster Hospital"}, "7403461374": {"Name": "Nelson M.", "AuthorID": "7403461374", "AffiliationID": "60002484", "AffiliationName": "St Stephens AIDS Trust, Chelsea and Westminster Hospital"}}}
