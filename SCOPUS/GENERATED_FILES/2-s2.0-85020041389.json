Here we report a novel ambient-pressure chemical vapor deposition route to Nb2O5 via aerosol-assisted chemical vapor deposition. The amorphous as-deposited films were annealed in air to obtain the the three most stable crystal structures: orthorhombic, tetragonal, and monoclinic. The films were thoroughly characterized for their material properties, and an in-depth study into the optical properties was carried out using state-of-the-art hybrid functional theory that allowed more insight into the optical properties of the materials.", "AuthorKeywords": ["band gap", "CVD", "density functional theory", "niobium oxide", "polymorphs"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aerosol-assisted chemical vapor depositions", "Ambient pressure chemical vapor depositions", "As-deposited films", "Hybrid functional", "Hybrid functional theory", "In-depth study", "State of the art", "Synthetic routes"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85020041389", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"]], "AuthorData": {"37081732100": {"Name": "Sathasivam S.", "AuthorID": "37081732100", "AffiliationID": "60112905", "AffiliationName": "Bio Nano Consulting Ltd., Gridiron Building"}, "7003437916": {"Name": "Carmalt C.", "AuthorID": "7003437916", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Materials Chemistry Centre, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "56217400400": {"Name": "Parkin I.", "AuthorID": "56217400400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Materials Chemistry Centre, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "56924712400": {"Name": "Williamson B.", "AuthorID": "56924712400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Kathleen Lonsdale Materials Chemistry, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "16647397400": {"Name": "Scanlon D.", "AuthorID": "16647397400", "AffiliationID": "60104663", "AffiliationName": "Diamond Light Source Ltd., Diamond House, Harwell Science and Innovation Campus"}, "56524648200": {"Name": "Althabaiti S.", "AuthorID": "56524648200", "AffiliationID": "60004582", "AffiliationName": "Surface Chemistry and Catalytic Studies Group, King Abdulaziz University"}, "35581165800": {"Name": "Obaid A.", "AuthorID": "35581165800", "AffiliationID": "60004582", "AffiliationName": "Surface Chemistry and Catalytic Studies Group, King Abdulaziz University"}, "55411212800": {"Name": "Basahel S.", "AuthorID": "55411212800", "AffiliationID": "60004582", "AffiliationName": "Surface Chemistry and Catalytic Studies Group, King Abdulaziz University"}, "25223509900": {"Name": "Mokhtar M.", "AuthorID": "25223509900", "AffiliationID": "60004582", "AffiliationName": "Surface Chemistry and Catalytic Studies Group, King Abdulaziz University"}}}
