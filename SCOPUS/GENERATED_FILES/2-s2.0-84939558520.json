To date, large-scale genome-wide association studies have identified 157 common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that influence plasma lipid levels, providing a powerful tool to investigate the effect of plasma lipid levels on atherosclerotic plaque composition. Methods: In this study, we included 1443 carotid endarterectomy patients from the Athero-Express Biobank Study with genotype data. Plasma concentrations of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), total cholesterol (TC) and triglycerides (TG) were determined at the time of endarterectomy. Atherosclerotic plaques, obtained during surgery, were histologically examined. For all patients, we calculated weighted genetic burden scores (GBS) for all lipid traits on the basis of the available genotype data. Plasma lipid levels and GBS were tested for association with 7 histological features using linear and logistic regression models. Results: All GBS were associated with their respective plasma lipid concentrations (pHDL-C = 2.4 \u00d7 10-14, pLDL-C = 0.003, pTC = 2.1 \u00d7 10-6, pTG = 3.4 \u00d7 10-8). Neither the measured plasma lipids, nor the GBS, were associated with histological features of atherosclerotic plaque composition. In addition, neither the plasma lipids nor the GBS were associated with clinical endpoints within 3 years of follow-up, with the notable exception of a negative association between HDL-C and composite cardiovascular endpoints. Conclusion: This study found no evidence that plasma lipid levels or their genetic determinants influence carotid plaque composition.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Atherosclerosis", "Cardiovascular disease", "Carotid endarterectomy", "Genetic burden score", "Lipids", "Lipoproteins", "Polygenic risk score"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Biological Specimen Banks", "Biomarkers", "Carotid Arteries", "Carotid Artery Diseases", "Endarterectomy, Carotid", "Female", "Genetic Association Studies", "Genetic Markers", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Humans", "Linear Models", "Lipids", "Logistic Models", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Phenotype", "Plaque, Atherosclerotic", "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide", "Risk Assessment", "Risk Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84939558520", "SubjectAreas": [["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"55857698700": {"Name": "Siemelink M.", "AuthorID": "55857698700", "AffiliationID": "60032724", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Experimental Cardiology, Division Heart and Lungs, University Medical Center Utrecht"}, "57204459507": {"Name": "van der Laan S.", "AuthorID": "57204459507", "AffiliationID": "60032724", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Experimental Cardiology, Division Heart and Lungs, University Medical Center Utrecht"}, "36098680500": {"Name": "van Setten J.", "AuthorID": "36098680500", "AffiliationID": "60032724", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Experimental Cardiology, Division Heart and Lungs, University Medical Center Utrecht"}, "14071039800": {"Name": "den Ruijter H.", "AuthorID": "14071039800", "AffiliationID": "60032724", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Experimental Cardiology, Division Heart and Lungs, University Medical Center Utrecht"}, "7004573949": {"Name": "Pasterkamp G.", "AuthorID": "7004573949", "AffiliationID": "60032724", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Clinical Chemistry and Hematology, Division Laboratories and Pharmacy, University Medical Center Utrecht"}, "55628963500": {"Name": "de Vries J.", "AuthorID": "55628963500", "AffiliationID": "60025865", "AffiliationName": "Department of Vascular Surgery, St. Antonius Hospital"}, "24464360800": {"Name": "de Borst G.", "AuthorID": "24464360800", "AffiliationID": "60032724", "AffiliationName": "Department of Vascular Surgery, University Medical Center Utrecht"}, "7103009095": {"Name": "Moll F.", "AuthorID": "7103009095", "AffiliationID": "60032724", "AffiliationName": "Department of Vascular Surgery, University Medical Center Utrecht"}, "7006736234": {"Name": "Asselbergs F.", "AuthorID": "7006736234", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular Science, Faculty of Population Health Sciences, University College London"}, "57202569273": {"Name": "de Bakker P.", "AuthorID": "57202569273", "AffiliationID": "60032724", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology, Julius Center for Health Sciences and Primary Care, University Medical Center Utrecht"}}}
