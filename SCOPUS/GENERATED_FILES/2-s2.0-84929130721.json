The Global SYMPLICITY Registry is a prospective, open-label, multicenter registry. Office and 24-hour ambulatory blood pressures (BPs) were measured. Change from baseline to 6 months was analyzed for all patients and for subgroups based on baseline office systolic BP, diabetic status, and renal function; a cohort with severe hypertension (office systolic pressure, \u2265160 mm Hg; 24-hour systolic pressure, \u2265135 mm Hg; and \u22653 antihypertensive medication classes) was also included. The analysis included protocol-defined safety events. Six-month outcomes for 998 patients, including 323 in the severe hypertension cohort, are reported. Mean baseline office systolic BP was 163.5\u00b124.0 mm Hg for all patients and 179.3\u00b116.5 mm Hg for the severe cohort; the corresponding baseline 24-hour mean systolic BPs were 151.5\u00b117.0 and 159.0\u00b115.6 mm Hg. At 6 months, the changes in office and 24-hour systolic BPs were -11.6\u00b125.3 and -6.6\u00b118.0 mm Hg for all patients (P<0.001 for both) and -20.3\u00b122.8 and -8.9\u00b116.9 mm Hg for those with severe hypertension (P<0.001 for both). Renal denervation was associated with low rates of adverse events. After the procedure through 6 months, there was 1 new renal artery stenosis >70% and 5 cases of hospitalization for a hypertensive emergency. In clinical practice, renal denervation resulted in significant reductions in office and 24-hour BPs with a favorable safety profile. Greater BP-lowering effects occurred in patients with higher baseline pressures. Clinical Trial Registration - URL: www.clinicaltrials.gov.
