Although the combination of positive inotropic activity with negative chronotropic effects has been shown to reduce hospital admissions in heart failure, there is a distinct lack of robust trial data, particularly in patients with atrial fibrillation. We recently performed a comprehensive meta-analysis of all digoxin studies and demonstrated a neutral effect on mortality. This contradicts prior observational data that overlook the fact that digitalis is usually given as second-line therapy to the sickest patients. Use of these agents in clinical practice should take account of appropriate dose, serum concentration, drug interactions, and potential side effects. The aim of this review is to evaluate the evidence base for cardiac glycosides and provide a pragmatic guide to their advantages and disadvantages.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Atrial fibrillation", "Cardiac glycoside", "Digoxin", "Heart failure", "Hospitalization", "Mortality", "Outcomes."], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Anti-Arrhythmia Agents", "Atrial Fibrillation", "Cardiotonic Agents", "Digoxin", "Heart Conduction System", "Heart Failure", "Heart Rate", "Heart Ventricles", "Humans", "Myocardial Contraction", "Patient Admission", "Patient Selection", "Risk Factors", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84964771598", "SubjectAreas": [["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"55263618500": {"Name": "Ziff O.J.", "AuthorID": "55263618500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}, "33567902400": {"Name": "Kotecha D.", "AuthorID": "33567902400", "AffiliationID": "60012932, 60019578", "AffiliationName": "Monash Centre of Cardiovascular Research & Education in Therapeutics, Monash University"}}}
