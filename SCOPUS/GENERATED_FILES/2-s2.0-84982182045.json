R. Leavis knew Ludwig Wittgenstein from the nineteen twenties to the time of Wittgenstein's death in 1951. But the nature of their encounter leaves the impression of what Michael Bell has called \"potentially important unfinished business in their intellectual nonre-lationship.\" Their shared suspicion of theory might be thought to have aligned them in their judgments and in their respective conceptions of philosophy and literature; yet such alignment as there was scarcely prevented misunderstanding. A more important potential connection is to be found, however, in their ideas about language, especially in terms of its relation to imagination and maturity of judgment.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84982182045", "SubjectAreas": [["Philosophy", "ARTS", "1211"], ["Literature and Literary Theory", "ARTS", "1208"]], "AuthorData": {"6701545310": {"Name": "Standish P.", "AuthorID": "6701545310", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Education"}}}
