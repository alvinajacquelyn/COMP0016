One of the concerns relating to the spiking neural networks is their speed of operation and the number of iterations necessary to train and use the network. Here, we propose a biologically plausible model of a spiking neural network which is used in multiple, separately trained copies to process subsets of data in parallel. This ensemble of networks is tested by applying it to the task of unsupervised classification of spatio-temporal patterns. Results show that despite different starting weights and independent training, the networks produce highly similar spiking patterns in response to the same class of inputs, enabling classification with fast training time.", "AuthorKeywords": ["ensemble network", "parallel computing", "pattern detection", "spike timing dependent plasticity", "spiking neural network"], "IndexKeywords": ["Ensemble networks", "Number of iterations", "Parallel classifications", "Pattern detection", "Spatiotemporal patterns", "Spike timing dependent plasticities", "Spiking neural networks", "Unsupervised classification"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85046145283", "SubjectAreas": [["Artificial Intelligence", "COMP", "1702"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Control and Optimization", "MATH", "2606"]], "AuthorData": {"57201795484": {"Name": "Kozdon K.", "AuthorID": "57201795484", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "24466639300": {"Name": "Bentley P.", "AuthorID": "24466639300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}}}
