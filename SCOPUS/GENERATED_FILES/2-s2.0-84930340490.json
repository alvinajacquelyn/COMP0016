Airports, we suggest, invite us to re-think \u2018organization\u2019 as the partial, contingent and always-incomplete outcome of complex order(ing)s and disorder(ing)s played out across various spaces, agencies and materials. When \u2018something happens\u2019 we begin to see how spaces, agents and materials are subject to unexpected becomings: objects appear treacherous, spaces mutable, agencies ineffectual and informants unreliable. Following the work of Weick we might say that in such moments of uncertainty we are forced to reconsider our customary ways of thinking about objects, subjects and systems. We argue this thinking requires a relational understanding of organization so that we can better grasp how organizations are continuously being made and un-made through an on-going co-creation and dispersal of parts.", "AuthorKeywords": ["airports", "order/disorder", "process theory", "relationality", "sense-making", "spectrality"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84930340490", "SubjectAreas": [["Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)", "ARTS", "1201"], ["Social Sciences (all)", "SOCI", "3300"], ["Strategy and Management", "BUSI", "1408"], ["Management of Technology and Innovation", "BUSI", "1405"]], "AuthorData": {"11939383100": {"Name": "Knox H.", "AuthorID": "11939383100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "56595647200": {"Name": "O\u2019Doherty D.", "AuthorID": "56595647200", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "University of Manchester"}, "15833515600": {"Name": "Westrup C.", "AuthorID": "15833515600", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "University of Manchester"}, "8613570600": {"Name": "Vurdubakis T.", "AuthorID": "8613570600", "AffiliationID": "60023643", "AffiliationName": "University of Lancaster"}}}
