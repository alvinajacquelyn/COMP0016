The aims of these modeling approaches are to predict the 3D structures of the receptor-ligand complexes, to explore the key interactions between the receptor and the ligand and to utilize these insights in the design of new molecules with improved binding, selectivity or other pharmacological properties. In this book chapter, we present a brief survey of key computational approaches integrated with hierarchical GPCR modeling protocol (HGMP) used in hit-to-lead (H2L) and in lead optimization (LO) stages of structure-based drug discovery (SBDD). We outline the differences in modeling strategies used in H2L and LO of SBDD and illustrate how these tools have been applied in three drug discovery projects.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Docking", "G protein-coupled receptor", "Hit-to-lead", "Lead optimization", "Molecular dynamics", "Simulation", "Structure-based drug design"], "IndexKeywords": ["Computational Biology", "Computer Simulation", "Drug Discovery", "Ligands", "Models, Molecular", "Molecular Docking Simulation", "Molecular Dynamics Simulation", "Protein Binding", "Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship", "Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled", "Software", "Water", "Workflow"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85036612992", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"]], "AuthorData": {"7003508743": {"Name": "Heifetz A.", "AuthorID": "7003508743", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Biosciences, Research Department of Structural and Molecular Biology, Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London"}, "56005887100": {"Name": "Southey M.", "AuthorID": "56005887100", "AffiliationID": "60102134", "AffiliationName": "Evotec (UK) Ltd."}, "6603296449": {"Name": "Morao I.", "AuthorID": "6603296449", "AffiliationID": "60102134", "AffiliationName": "Evotec (UK) Ltd."}, "6602870623": {"Name": "Bodkin M.", "AuthorID": "6602870623", "AffiliationID": "60102134", "AffiliationName": "Evotec (UK) Ltd."}, "6701753724": {"Name": "Townsend-Nicholson A.", "AuthorID": "6701753724", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Biosciences, Research Department of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London"}}}
