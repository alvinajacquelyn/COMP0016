Biochemically, human MOB2 (hMOB2) can inhibit NDR kinases by competing with hMOB1 for binding to NDRs. However, biological roles of hMOB2 have remained enigmatic. Here, we describe novel functions of hMOB2 in the DNA damage response (DDR) and cell cycle regulation. hMOB2 promotes DDR signalling, cell survival and cell cycle arrest after exogenously induced DNA damage. Under normal growth conditions in the absence of exogenously induced DNA damage hMOB2 plays a role in preventing the accumulation of endogenous DNA damage and a subsequent p53/p21-dependent G1/S cell cycle arrest. Unexpectedly, these molecular and cellular phenotypes are not observed upon NDR manipulations, indicating that hMOB2 performs these functions independent of NDR signalling. Thus, to gain mechanistic insight, we screened for novel binding partners of hMOB2, revealing that hMOB2 interacts with RAD50, facilitating the recruitment of the MRE11-RAD50-NBS1 (MRN) DNA damage sensor complex and activated ATM to DNA damaged chromatin. Taken together, we conclude that hMOB2 supports the DDR and cell cycle progression.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cell cycle checkpoint activation", "Cell cycle progression", "DNA damage response signalling", "Mps one binder 2", "MRE11-RAD50-NBS1 protein complex", "P53 tumour suppressor protein"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Antibiotics, Antineoplastic", "Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins", "Cell Cycle Proteins", "Cell Line, Tumor", "Cercopithecus aethiops", "Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone", "COS Cells", "Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21", "DNA Damage", "Doxorubicin", "G1 Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints", "Humans", "Nerve Tissue Proteins", "Nuclear Proteins", "Phosphorylation", "Radiation, Ionizing", "RNA, Small Interfering", "S Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints", "Signal Transduction", "Tumor Suppressor Protein p53"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84918793074", "SubjectAreas": [["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"7005318890": {"Name": "Gomez V.", "AuthorID": "7005318890", "AffiliationID": "60109234, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Cancer Institute, University College London"}, "56450909500": {"Name": "Gundogdu R.", "AuthorID": "56450909500", "AffiliationID": "60109234, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Cancer Institute, University College London"}, "56882938700": {"Name": "Gomez M.", "AuthorID": "56882938700", "AffiliationID": "60109234, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Cancer Institute, University College London"}, "55486895300": {"Name": "Hoa L.", "AuthorID": "55486895300", "AffiliationID": "60109234, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Cancer Institute, University College London"}, "57057355900": {"Name": "Panchal N.", "AuthorID": "57057355900", "AffiliationID": "60109234, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Cancer Institute, University College London"}, "6603634936": {"Name": "Hergovich A.", "AuthorID": "6603634936", "AffiliationID": "60109234, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Cancer Institute, University College London"}, "7004395971": {"Name": "O'Driscoll M.", "AuthorID": "7004395971", "AffiliationID": "60009097, 60017317", "AffiliationName": "Genome Damage and Stability Centre, University of Sussex"}}}
