Since the 19th century, it concentrated on authenticity, purity, quality and the analysis of active substances, and was established as an academic branch discipline within pharmacy and continuously developed into a modern, highly sophisticated science. Even though the paradigm in pharmacy changed in the 19th century with the discovery of morphine and concentrated on single substances that could be synthesized fast by the upcoming industry, medicinal plants always remained an important element of the Materia medica, and during the last decades, medicinal plants continue to be a source of remedies, and natural products are an inspiration for new medicine. In this research, pharmacognostic skills remain an essential element, both with regards to identity, quality assurance of botanicals (both herbal medicines and supplements), and the discovery and development of new medicines. Over the years, the specific pharmacognostical tools have changed dramatically, and most recently, DNA-based techniques have become another element of our spectrum of scientific methods.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alexander Tschirch", "ethnopharmacology", "history of pharmacy", "Hypericaceae (Guttiferae)", "Hypericum perforatum", "medicinal plant research", "pharmacognosy"], "IndexKeywords": ["Biological Products", "Dietary Supplements", "DNA Barcoding, Taxonomic", "DNA, Plant", "Europe", "History, 18th Century", "History, 19th Century", "History, 20th Century", "History, 21st Century", "Humans", "Materia Medica", "Pharmacognosy", "Plants, Medicinal", "Quality Control"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85018684473", "SubjectAreas": [["Analytical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1602"], ["Molecular Medicine", "BIOC", "1313"], ["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"], ["Pharmaceutical Science", "PHAR", "3003"], ["Drug Discovery", "PHAR", "3002"], ["Complementary and Alternative Medicine", "MEDI", "2707"], ["Organic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1605"]], "AuthorData": {"55544514000": {"Name": "Heinrich M.", "AuthorID": "55544514000", "AffiliationID": "60016379, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Cluster Biodiversity and Medicines/Research Group Pharmacognosy and Phytotherapy, UCL, School of Pharmacy, Univ.
