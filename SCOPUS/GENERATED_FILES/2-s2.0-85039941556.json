The GOALS feasibility randomized controlled trial assessed training and implementation of an evidence-based intervention by frontline workers, targeting recovery goals. Training uptake and therapy fidelity were good. Case managers with crisis management responsibilities were less likely than clinical assistants to deliver therapy. Participants receiving \u201csufficient therapy\u201d achieved goals, but therapy was usually provided by clinical assistants. This is consistent with implementation science principles, that training must be combined with supportive organizational structures, such as by focusing on roles that already include therapy delivery or developing stronger organizational supports for case managers.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Cognitive Behavioral Therapy", "Community Mental Health Services", "Evidence-Based Practice", "Feasibility Studies", "Health Personnel", "Humans", "Implementation Science", "Inservice Training", "Psychotic Disorders"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85039941556", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"7004167371": {"Name": "Garety P.A.", "AuthorID": "7004167371", "AffiliationID": "60028884", "AffiliationName": "South London and Maudsley National Health Service (NHS) Foundation Trust"}, "55243134200": {"Name": "Craig T.K.J.", "AuthorID": "55243134200", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology, and Neuroscience, King's College London"}, "10539636700": {"Name": "Fornells-Ambrojo M.", "AuthorID": "10539636700", "AffiliationID": "60028884", "AffiliationName": "South London and Maudsley National Health Service (NHS) Foundation Trust"}, "9332406200": {"Name": "Jolley S.", "AuthorID": "9332406200", "AffiliationID": "60028884", "AffiliationName": "South London and Maudsley National Health Service (NHS) Foundation Trust"}, "7101776972": {"Name": "Landau S.", "AuthorID": "7101776972", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology, and Neuroscience, King's College London"}, "7003937597": {"Name": "McCrone P.", "AuthorID": "7003937597", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology, and Neuroscience, King's College London"}, "55761733200": {"Name": "Zala D.", "AuthorID": "55761733200", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology, and Neuroscience, King's College London"}, "37073443500": {"Name": "Waller H.", "AuthorID": "37073443500", "AffiliationID": "60028884", "AffiliationName": "South London and Maudsley National Health Service (NHS) Foundation Trust"}, "56222808200": {"Name": "Iredale C.H.", "AuthorID": "56222808200", "AffiliationID": "60028884", "AffiliationName": "South London and Maudsley National Health Service (NHS) Foundation Trust"}, "57200149459": {"Name": "Basit N.", "AuthorID": "57200149459", "AffiliationID": "60028884", "AffiliationName": "South London and Maudsley National Health Service (NHS) Foundation Trust"}, "57200144324": {"Name": "Halkoree R.", "AuthorID": "57200144324", "AffiliationID": "60028884", "AffiliationName": "South London and Maudsley National Health Service (NHS) Foundation Trust"}, "31767766300": {"Name": "Tunnard C.", "AuthorID": "31767766300", "AffiliationID": "60028884", "AffiliationName": "South London and Maudsley National Health Service (NHS) Foundation Trust"}}}
