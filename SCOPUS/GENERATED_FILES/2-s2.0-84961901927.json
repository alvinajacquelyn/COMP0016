What possibilities, however, do robotics and artificial intelligence programming open up for extending Parametricism's influence into the construction phase? Robert Stuart-Smith, a course master at the Architectural Association Design Research Laboratory (AADRL), explores how architecture might adopt autonomous swarm-construction techniques. He describes the research that he has carried out with colleagues and students employing flying multicopters or unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to design and additively manufacture 3D-printed buildings onsite.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84961901927", "SubjectAreas": [["Architecture", "ENGI", "2216"], ["Visual Arts and Performing Arts", "ARTS", "1213"]], "AuthorData": {"57188634980": {"Name": "Stuart-Smith R.", "AuthorID": "57188634980", "AffiliationID": "116479545", "AffiliationName": "Architectural Association Design Research Laboratory (AADRL)"}}}
