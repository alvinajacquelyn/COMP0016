To achieve tracking a new sliding surface is proposed and to ensure sliding motion super-twisting control (STC) is employed. The proposed sliding surface is more general, and it can be used for constant reference tracking in both minimum phase and non-minimum phase systems. The proposed method is validated on the unstable non-minimum phase inverted pendulum system and also the results are compared with the first order sliding mode control (SMC) in simulation and experimentally both.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Non-minimum phase system", "Output regulation", "Second order sliding mode", "Super-twisting control"], "IndexKeywords": ["Inverted pendulum system", "Non-minimum phase systems", "Output regulation", "Reference-tracking", "Second order sliding mode (SOSM)", "Second order sliding modes", "Sliding mode control(SMC)", "Super twisting controls"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85057259767", "SubjectAreas": [["Engineering (all)", "ENGI", "2200"]], "AuthorData": {"55368137300": {"Name": "Chalanga A.", "AuthorID": "55368137300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "36988890400": {"Name": "Patil M.", "AuthorID": "36988890400", "AffiliationID": "60014153", "AffiliationName": "Department of Instrumentation Engineering, V.E.S.
