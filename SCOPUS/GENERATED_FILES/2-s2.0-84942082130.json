We present detailed measurements of the galaxy intrinsic alignments and associated ellipticity-direction (ED) and projected shape (wg+) correlation functions for galaxies in the cosmological hydrodynamic MassiveBlack-II simulation. We carefully assess the effects on galaxy shapes, misalignment of the stellar component with the dark matter shape and two-point statistics of iterative weighted (by mass and luminosity) definitions of the (reduced and unreduced) inertia tensor. We find that iterative procedures must be adopted for a reliable measurement of the reduced tensor but that luminosity versus mass weighting has only negligible effects. Both ED and wg+ correlations increase in amplitude with subhalo mass (in the range of 1010-6.0 x 1014 h-1M{bull's eye}), with a weak redshift dependence (from z = 1 to 0.06) at fixed mass. At z \u223c 0.3, we predict a wg+ that is in reasonable agreement with Sloan Digital Sky Survey luminous red galaxy measurements and that decreases in amplitude by a factor of \u223c5-18 for galaxies in the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope survey. We also compared the intrinsic alignments of centrals and satellites, with clear detection of satellite radial alignments within their host haloes. Finally, we show that wg+ (using subhaloes as tracers of density) and w\u03b4+ (using dark matter density) predictions from the simulations agree with that of non-linear alignment (NLA) models at scales where the two-halo term dominates in the correlations (and tabulate associated NLA fitting parameters). The one-halo term induces a scale-dependent bias at small scales which is not modelled in the NLA model.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cosmology: theory", "Galaxies: star formation", "Gravitational lensing: weak", "Hydrodynamics", "Methods: numerical"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84942082130", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"56152658800": {"Name": "Tenneti A.", "AuthorID": "56152658800", "AffiliationID": "60027950", "AffiliationName": "McWilliams Center for Cosmology, Department of Physics, Carnegie Mellon University"}, "57218165729": {"Name": "Singh S.", "AuthorID": "57218165729", "AffiliationID": "60027950", "AffiliationName": "McWilliams Center for Cosmology, Department of Physics, Carnegie Mellon University"}, "7004175711": {"Name": "Mandelbaum R.", "AuthorID": "7004175711", "AffiliationID": "60027950", "AffiliationName": "McWilliams Center for Cosmology, Department of Physics, Carnegie Mellon University"}, "57200591754": {"Name": "Matteo T.D.", "AuthorID": "57200591754", "AffiliationID": "60027950", "AffiliationName": "McWilliams Center for Cosmology, Department of Physics, Carnegie Mellon University"}, "54580801600": {"Name": "Feng Y.", "AuthorID": "54580801600", "AffiliationID": "60027950", "AffiliationName": "McWilliams Center for Cosmology, Department of Physics, Carnegie Mellon University"}, "26532788400": {"Name": "Khandai N.", "AuthorID": "26532788400", "AffiliationID": "60105512", "AffiliationName": "School of Physical Sciences, National Institute of Science Education and Research"}}}
