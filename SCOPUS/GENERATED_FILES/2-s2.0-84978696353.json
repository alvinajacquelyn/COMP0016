This article takes issue with the theoretical and empirical underpinnings of this proposition. To do so, it reviews and codifies an emerging strand of literature that transcends the narrow assumptions of economic models of corruption and theorizes much more carefully the social structures within which corruption takes place. This body of research, which heralds a \u2018sociological turn\u2019 in corruption studies, provides a robust framework to account for the economic effects of corruption in specific country contexts and suggests that fighting corruption per se might not always be necessary for development; in fact, it might sometimes prove counterproductive.", "AuthorKeywords": ["corruption", "growth", "patron\u2013client networks", "power", "\u2018post-Washington Consensus\u2019"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84978696353", "SubjectAreas": [["Development", "SOCI", "3303"]], "AuthorData": {"55967798300": {"Name": "Uberti L.", "AuthorID": "55967798300", "AffiliationID": "60017311", "AffiliationName": "Department of Politics, University of Otago"}}}
