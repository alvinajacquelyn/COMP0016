This review focuses on the evidences and the gaps with regard to the translational journey of cardioprotective interventions. Gaps are classified into 3 main groups: 1) those related to pre-clinical studies, 2) those associated with the validation of infarct size as a good surrogate and 3) those based on design and interpretation of randomized clinical trials on cardioprotection. Addressing these gaps might increase the chances to successfully translate cardioprotective therapies into improving both post-STEMI heart failure and cardiovascular death rates.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Ischemia\u2013reperfusion injury", "Outcomes research", "ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction"], "IndexKeywords": ["Heart Failure", "Humans", "Myocardial Reperfusion", "Myocardial Reperfusion Injury", "Patient Selection", "Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic", "Secondary Prevention", "ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction", "Validation Studies as Topic"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84976869433", "SubjectAreas": [["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"55638006600": {"Name": "Rossello X.", "AuthorID": "55638006600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "The Hatter Cardiovascular Institute, University College London"}, "7103223278": {"Name": "Yellon D.M.", "AuthorID": "7103223278", "AffiliationID": "60029950, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "NIHR UCLH Biomedical Research Centre, University College London Hospital & Medical School"}}}
