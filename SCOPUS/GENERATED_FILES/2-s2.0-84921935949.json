Anti-VEGF-A therapies bind and block both pro-angiogenic VEGF-Axxx and the partial agonist VEGF-Axxxb isoforms, but their anti-angiogenic benefit only comes about from targeting the pro-angiogenic isoforms. Therefore, antibodies that exclusively target the pro-angiogenic isoforms may be more effective. To determine whether C-terminal-targeted antibodies could inhibit angiogenesis, we generated a polyclonal antibody to the last nine amino acids of VEGF-A165 and tested it in vitro and in vivo. The exon8a polyclonal antibody (Exon8apab) did not bind VEGF-A165b even at greater than 100-fold excess concentration, and dose dependently inhibited VEGF-A165 induced endothelial migration in vitro at concentrations similar to the VEGF-A antibody fragment ranibizumab. Exon8apab can inhibit tumour growth of LS174t cells implanted in vivo and blood vessel growth in the eye in models of age-related macular degeneration, with equal efficacy to non-selective anti-VEGF-A antibodies. It also showed that it was the VEGF-Axxx levels specifically that were upregulated in plasma from patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy. These results suggest that VEGF-A165-specific antibodies can be therapeutically useful.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bevacizumab", "Splicing", "VEGF", "VEGF-A165b"], "IndexKeywords": ["Amino Acid Motifs", "Angiogenesis Inhibitors", "Antibodies", "Cell Movement", "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug", "Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay", "Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells", "Humans", "Neovascularization, Pathologic", "Protein Isoforms", "Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84921935949", "SubjectAreas": [["Physiology", "BIOC", "1314"], ["Clinical Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1308"], ["Cancer Research", "BIOC", "1306"]], "AuthorData": {"14629850000": {"Name": "Carter J.G.", "AuthorID": "14629850000", "AffiliationID": "60015138, 60030816", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Biology, Queens Medical Centre, University of Nottingham"}, "35764243900": {"Name": "Gammons M.V.R.", "AuthorID": "35764243900", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "Microvascular Research Laboratories, School of Physiology and Pharmacology, University of Bristol"}, "25631597400": {"Name": "Damodaran G.", "AuthorID": "25631597400", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "Microvascular Research Laboratories, School of Physiology and Pharmacology, University of Bristol"}, "7006917127": {"Name": "Churchill A.J.", "AuthorID": "7006917127", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "Microvascular Research Laboratories, School of Physiology and Pharmacology, University of Bristol"}, "7102941685": {"Name": "Harper S.J.", "AuthorID": "7102941685", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "Microvascular Research Laboratories, School of Physiology and Pharmacology, University of Bristol"}, "7202955371": {"Name": "Bates D.O.", "AuthorID": "7202955371", "AffiliationID": "60015138, 60030816", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Biology, Queens Medical Centre, University of Nottingham"}}}
