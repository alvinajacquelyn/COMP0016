Diabetic Medicine published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of Diabetes UK.Aims: Conventional definitions of obesity, e.g. body mass index (BMI) \u2265 30 kg/m2 or waist circumference cut-points of 102 cm (men) and 88 cm (women), may underestimate metabolic risk in non-Europeans. We prospectively identified equivalent ethnicity-specific obesity cut-points for the estimation of diabetes risk in British South Asians, African-Caribbeans and Europeans. Methods: We studied a population-based cohort from London, UK (1356 Europeans, 842 South Asians, 335 African-Caribbeans) who were aged 40-69 years at baseline (1988-1991), when they underwent anthropometry, fasting and post-load (75 g oral glucose tolerance test) blood tests. Incident Type 2 diabetes was identified from primary care records, participant recall and/or follow-up biochemistry. Ethnicity-specific obesity cut-points in association with diabetes incidence were estimated using negative binomial regression. Results: Diabetes incidence rates (per 1000 person years) at a median follow-up of 19 years were 20.8 (95% CI: 18.4, 23.6) and 12.0 (8.3, 17.2) in South Asian men and women, 16.5 (12.7, 21.4) and 17.5 (13.0, 23.7) in African-Caribbean men and women, and 7.4 (6.3, 8.7), and 7.2 (5.3, 9.8) in European men and women. For incidence rates equivalent to those at a BMI of 30 kg/m2 in European men and women, age- and sex-adjusted cut-points were: South Asians, 25.2 (23.4, 26.6) kg/m2; and African-Caribbeans, 27.2 (25.2, 28.6) kg/m2. For South Asian and African-Caribbean men, respectively, waist circumference cut-points of 90.4 (85.0, 94.5) and 90.6 (85.0, 94.5) cm were equivalent to a value of 102 cm in European men. Waist circumference cut-points of 84.0 (74.0, 90.0) cm in South Asian women and 81.2 (71.4, 87.4) cm in African-Caribbean women were equivalent to a value of 88 cm in European women. Conclusions: In prospective analyses, British South Asians and African-Caribbeans had equivalent diabetes incidence rates at substantially lower obesity levels than the conventional European cut-points.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "African Continental Ancestry Group", "Aged", "Asian Continental Ancestry Group", "Body Mass Index", "Caribbean Region", "Cohort Studies", "Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2", "Diagnosis, Differential", "European Continental Ancestry Group", "Female", "Humans", "Incidence", "Insulin Resistance", "London", "Longitudinal Studies", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Obesity", "Overweight", "Prospective Studies", "Risk Factors", "Urban Health"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84921342635", "SubjectAreas": [["Internal Medicine", "MEDI", "2724"], ["Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism", "MEDI", "2712"], ["Endocrinology", "BIOC", "1310"]], "AuthorData": {"8878251700": {"Name": "Tillin T.", "AuthorID": "8878251700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}, "7401765648": {"Name": "Hughes A.D.", "AuthorID": "7401765648", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}, "7005513520": {"Name": "Chaturvedi N.", "AuthorID": "7005513520", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}, "7007043802": {"Name": "Sattar N.", "AuthorID": "7007043802", "AffiliationID": "60162089", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular and Medical Sciences, University of Glasgow School of Medicine"}, "7006405481": {"Name": "Godsland I.F.", "AuthorID": "7006405481", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Endocrinology and Medicine, Department of Medicine, Imperial College London"}, "6603478414": {"Name": "Forouhi N.G.", "AuthorID": "6603478414", "AffiliationID": "60025649, 60009969", "AffiliationName": "MRC Epidemiology Unit, University of Cambridge School of Clinical Medicine"}}}
