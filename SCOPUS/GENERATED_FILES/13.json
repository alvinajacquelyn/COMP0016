In particular, the C3 proteolytic fragment, iC3b, and its degradation product C3dg, which is generated by cleavage by factor I (FI) and the cofactor complement receptor CR1, are important in bridging innate and adaptive immunity. Via a thioester (TE) bond, iC3b and C3dg covalently tag pathogens, modulating phagocytosis and adaptive immune responses. Objective: To examine plasmin-mediated proteolysis of iC3b, and to evaluate the functional consequences, comparing the effects with products generated by FI/CR1 cleavage of iC3b. Methods: Dose-dependent and time-dependent plasmin-mediated cleavage of iC3b were characterized by analytical gel electrophoresis. The properties of the resultant TE bond-containing fragments on phagocytosis and induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines were measured in cell culture systems. Results: At low concentrations, plasmin effectively cleaves iC3b, but at numerous previously undescribed sites, giving rise to novel C3c-like and C3dg-like moieties, the latter of which retain the TE bond. When attached to zymosan or erythrocytes and exposed to THP-1 macrophages, the C3dg-like proteins behave almost identically to the bona fide C3dg, yielding less phagocytosis as compared with the opsonin iC3b, and more macrophage secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokine, IL-12. Conclusion: Plasmin cleavage of iC3b provides a complement regulatory pathway that is as efficient as FI/CR1 but does not require a cellular cofactor.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Complement", "Fibrinolysis", "IL-12", "Inflammation", "Innate immunity", "Macrophage"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Cell Line", "Complement Activation", "Complement C3 Convertase, Alternative Pathway", "Complement C3b", "Fibrinolysin", "Fibrinolysis", "Humans", "Immunity, Innate", "Inflammation Mediators", "Interleukin-12", "Macrophages", "Peptide Fragments", "Phagocytosis", "Proteolysis", "Rabbits", "Signal Transduction", "Time Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84926086856", "SubjectAreas": [["Hematology", "MEDI", "2720"]], "AuthorData": {"22978984100": {"Name": "Foley J.", "AuthorID": "22978984100", "AffiliationID": "60010365", "AffiliationName": "Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, University of British Columbia"}, "42361638300": {"Name": "Peterson E.", "AuthorID": "42361638300", "AffiliationID": "60010365", "AffiliationName": "Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, University of British Columbia"}, "56037870300": {"Name": "Lei V.", "AuthorID": "56037870300", "AffiliationID": "60010365", "AffiliationName": "Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, University of British Columbia"}, "56508874900": {"Name": "Wan L.", "AuthorID": "56508874900", "AffiliationID": "60010365", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Blood Research, Life Sciences Institute, University of British Columbia"}, "15063205900": {"Name": "Krisinger M.", "AuthorID": "15063205900", "AffiliationID": "60010365", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Faculty of Medicine, University of British Columbia"}, "7102459731": {"Name": "Conway E.", "AuthorID": "7102459731", "AffiliationID": "60010365", "AffiliationName": "Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, University of British Columbia"}}}
