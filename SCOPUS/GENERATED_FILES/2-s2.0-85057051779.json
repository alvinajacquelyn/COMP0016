Despite the gene\u2019s early and prominent expression in the cerebellum and the evidence for reciprocal cerebellum-basal ganglia connectivity, very little is known about cerebellar abnormalities in affected KE members. Using cerebellum-specific voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and volumetry, we provide converging evidence from subsets of affected KE members scanned at three time points for grey matter (GM) volume reduction bilaterally in neocerebellar lobule VIIa Crus I compared with unaffected members and unrelated controls. We also show that right Crus I volume correlates with left and total caudate nucleus volumes in affected KE members, and that right and total Crus I volumes predict the performance of affected members in non-word repetition and non-verbal orofacial praxis. Crus I also shows bilateral hypo-activation in functional MRI in the affected KE members relative to controls during non-word repetition. The association of Crus I with key aspects of the behavioural phenotype of this FOXP2 point mutation is consistent with recent evidence of cerebellar involvement in complex motor sequencing. For the first time, specific cerebello-basal ganglia loops are implicated in the execution of complex oromotor sequences needed for human speech.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Caudate nucleus", "Cerebellum", "FOXP2", "MRI", "Verbal dyspraxia", "VIIa crus I"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Cerebellum", "Child", "Female", "Forkhead Transcription Factors", "Humans", "Language Disorders", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Nervous System Malformations", "Point Mutation", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85057051779", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"37055385200": {"Name": "Argyropoulos G.P.D.", "AuthorID": "37055385200", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Nuffield Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Oxford"}, "57208209421": {"Name": "Belton-Pagnamenta E.", "AuthorID": "57208209421", "AffiliationID": "60012197", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology and Clinical Language Sciences, University of Reading"}, "7003352056": {"Name": "Li\u00e9geois F.", "AuthorID": "7003352056", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Cognitive Neuroscience and Neuropsychiatry Section, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "7004489148": {"Name": "Vargha-Khadem F.", "AuthorID": "7004489148", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children National Health Foundation Trust"}, "7101970036": {"Name": "Watkins K.E.", "AuthorID": "7101970036", "AffiliationID": "60002634", "AffiliationName": "Department of Experimental Psychology, University of Oxford"}, "6603762320": {"Name": "Saleem K.S.", "AuthorID": "6603762320", "AffiliationID": "60003158", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Neuropsychology, National Institute of Mental Health"}, "7007041182": {"Name": "Mishkin M.", "AuthorID": "7007041182", "AffiliationID": "60003158", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Neuropsychology, National Institute of Mental Health"}}}
