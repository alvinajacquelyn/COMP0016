In childhood epilepsy, mental retardation and neuropsychiatric disorders are common while in adults movement disorders, such as highly asymmetric parkinsonism or hemidystonia as well as neuropsychiatric problems have been reported. Methods: Here, we present three adult patients with features that expand the clinical spectrum and give an overview of the most common clinical signs associated with this rare condition. Results: All three patients had prominent neuropsychiatric symptoms such as mood swings and increased irritability. Furthermore, one patient developed hemichorea which can be a rare presentation of cerebral hemiatrophy. Conclusions: Cerebral hemiatrophy syndromes are a heterogeneous group of disorders that may also present with neuropsychiatric symptoms or hemichorea.", "AuthorKeywords": ["apomorphine", "cerebral hemiatrophy syndrome", "hemichorea", "imaging", "neuropsychiatric symptoms"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85067376239", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"56200008600": {"Name": "Reiter E.", "AuthorID": "56200008600", "AffiliationID": "60008222", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Innsbruck Medical University"}, "57190132408": {"Name": "Heim B.", "AuthorID": "57190132408", "AffiliationID": "60008222", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Innsbruck Medical University"}, "6602530679": {"Name": "Scherfler C.", "AuthorID": "6602530679", "AffiliationID": "60008222", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Innsbruck Medical University"}, "57206245461": {"Name": "Mueller C.", "AuthorID": "57206245461", "AffiliationID": "60008222", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Innsbruck Medical University"}, "24328558100": {"Name": "Nocker M.", "AuthorID": "24328558100", "AffiliationID": "60008222", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Innsbruck Medical University"}, "12782170900": {"Name": "Ndayisaba J.P.", "AuthorID": "12782170900", "AffiliationID": "60008222", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Innsbruck Medical University"}, "12766746600": {"Name": "Loescher W.", "AuthorID": "12766746600", "AffiliationID": "60008222", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Innsbruck Medical University"}, "7004725975": {"Name": "Seppi K.", "AuthorID": "7004725975", "AffiliationID": "60008222", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Innsbruck Medical University"}, "35373337300": {"Name": "Poewe W.", "AuthorID": "35373337300", "AffiliationID": "60008222", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Innsbruck Medical University"}, "21647300300": {"Name": "Wenning G.K.", "AuthorID": "21647300300", "AffiliationID": "60008222", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Innsbruck Medical University"}, "23102683300": {"Name": "Djamshidian A.", "AuthorID": "23102683300", "AffiliationID": "60115564, 60033387", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience and Reta Lila Weston Institute for Neurological Studies, University of London"}, "57208252964": {"Name": "Lees A.J.", "AuthorID": "57208252964", "AffiliationID": "60115564, 60033387", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience and Reta Lila Weston Institute for Neurological Studies, University of London"}, "57210127924": {"Name": "Warner T.", "AuthorID": "57210127924", "AffiliationID": "60115564, 60033387", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience and Reta Lila Weston Institute for Neurological Studies, University of London"}}}
