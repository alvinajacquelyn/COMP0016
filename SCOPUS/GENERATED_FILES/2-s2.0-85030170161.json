Although many studies focus on the gene flow between different populations of a single species, the potential for gene flow and introgression between species is understudied, particularly in seabirds. The only well-studied example of a mixed-species, hybridizing population of petrels exists on Round Island, in the Indian Ocean. Previous research assumed that Round Island represents a point of secondary contact between Atlantic (Pterodroma arminjoniana) and Pacific species (Pterodroma neglecta and Pterodroma heraldica). This study uses microsatellite genotyping and tracking data to address the possibility of between-species hybridization occurring outside the Indian Ocean. Dispersal and gene flow spanning three oceans were demonstrated between the species in this complex. Analysis of migration rates estimated using bayesass revealed unidirectional movement of petrels from the Atlantic and Pacific into the Indian Ocean. Conversely, structure analysis revealed gene flow between species of the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, with potential three-way hybrids occurring outside the Indian Ocean. Additionally, geolocation tracking of Round Island petrels revealed two individuals travelling to the Atlantic and Pacific. These results suggest that interspecific hybrids in Pterodroma petrels are more common than was previously assumed. This study is the first of its kind to investigate gene flow between populations of closely related Procellariiform species on a global scale, demonstrating the need for consideration of widespread migration and hybridization in the conservation of threatened seabirds.", "AuthorKeywords": ["dispersal", "gene flow", "hybridization", "petrel", "Pterodroma", "tracking"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animal Migration", "Animals", "Atlantic Ocean", "Birds", "Gene Flow", "Genetic Variation", "Genetics, Population", "Genotype", "Hybridization, Genetic", "Indian Ocean", "Microsatellite Repeats", "Models, Genetic", "Pacific Ocean"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85030170161", "SubjectAreas": [["Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics", "AGRI", "1105"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"]], "AuthorData": {"57195933135": {"Name": "Booth Jones K.A.", "AuthorID": "57195933135", "AffiliationID": "60016777", "AffiliationName": "British Trust for Ornithology"}, "6701758644": {"Name": "Nicoll M.A.C.", "AuthorID": "6701758644", "AffiliationID": "60005453", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Zoology, Zoological Society London"}, "7102487714": {"Name": "Norris K.", "AuthorID": "7102487714", "AffiliationID": "60005453", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Zoology, Zoological Society London"}, "26667976200": {"Name": "Raisin C.", "AuthorID": "26667976200", "AffiliationID": "60109277", "AffiliationName": "Chester Zoo"}, "34871764100": {"Name": "Dawson D.A.", "AuthorID": "34871764100", "AffiliationID": "60001881, 60007317", "AffiliationName": "Department of Animal and Plant Sciences, NERC Biomolecular Analysis Facility, University of Sheffield"}, "24468022600": {"Name": "Hipperson H.", "AuthorID": "24468022600", "AffiliationID": "60001881, 60007317", "AffiliationName": "Department of Animal and Plant Sciences, NERC Biomolecular Analysis Facility, University of Sheffield"}, "8527999300": {"Name": "Horsburgh G.J.", "AuthorID": "8527999300", "AffiliationID": "60001881, 60007317", "AffiliationName": "Department of Animal and Plant Sciences, NERC Biomolecular Analysis Facility, University of Sheffield"}, "6602880676": {"Name": "Groombridge J.J.", "AuthorID": "6602880676", "AffiliationID": "60010818", "AffiliationName": "Durrell Institute of Conservation and Ecology, School of Anthropology and Conservation, University of Kent"}, "23501946300": {"Name": "Ismar S.M.H.", "AuthorID": "23501946300", "AffiliationID": "60079129", "AffiliationName": "GEOMAR, Helmholtz Zentrum f\u00fcr Ozeanforschung Kiel"}, "9744925100": {"Name": "Sweet P.", "AuthorID": "9744925100", "AffiliationID": "60011425", "AffiliationName": "Division of Vertebrate Zoology \u2013 Ornithology, American Museum of Natural History"}, "7408261355": {"Name": "Jones C.G.", "AuthorID": "7408261355", "AffiliationID": "60030656", "AffiliationName": "Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust"}, "8563348500": {"Name": "Tatayah V.", "AuthorID": "8563348500", "AffiliationID": "60072657", "AffiliationName": "Mauritian Wildlife Foundation"}, "56146697200": {"Name": "Ruhomaun K.", "AuthorID": "56146697200", "AffiliationID": "117968981", "AffiliationName": "National Parks and Conservation Service (Government of Mauritius)"}}}
