Inferentialism is a semantic theory which explains concept formation in terms of the inferences individuals make in the context of an intersubjective practice of acknowledging, attributing, and challenging one another\u2019s commitments. The article argues that inferentialism can help to overcome certain problems that have plagued the various forms of constructivism, and socioconstructivism in particular. Despite the range of socioconstructivist positions on offer, there is reason to think that versions of these problems will continue to haunt socioconstructivism. The problems are that socioconstructivists (i) have not come to a satisfactory resolution of the social-individual dichotomy, (ii) are still threatened by relativism, and (iii) have been vague in their characterization of what construction is. We first present these problems; then we introduce inferentialism, and finally we show how inferentialism can help to overcome the problems. We argue that inferentialism (i) contains a powerful conception of norms that can overcome the social-individual dichotomy, (ii) draws attention to the reality that constrains our inferences, and (iii) develops a clearer conception of learning in terms of the mastering of webs of reasons. Inferentialism therefore represents a powerful alternative theoretical framework to socioconstructivism.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Constructivism", "Inferentialism", "Mathematics education", "Socioconstructivism", "Theories of learning"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85037033652", "SubjectAreas": [["Mathematics (all)", "MATH", "2600"], ["Education", "SOCI", "3304"]], "AuthorData": {"57198768811": {"Name": "Noorloos R.", "AuthorID": "57198768811", "AffiliationID": "60007989", "AffiliationName": "Utrecht University"}, "9634128500": {"Name": "Bakker A.", "AuthorID": "9634128500", "AffiliationID": "60007989", "AffiliationName": "Utrecht University"}, "57198779823": {"Name": "Taylor S.D.", "AuthorID": "57198779823", "AffiliationID": "60025310", "AffiliationName": "Heinrich Heine University D\u00fcsseldorf"}, "22950052200": {"Name": "Derry J.", "AuthorID": "22950052200", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Education"}}}
