The original 564-bp nucleotide sequence from NCBI was codon optimized and assembled by overlapping PCR method comprising of 16 oligos of 50-nt length with 15 base overhang. The synthetic gene (CO-GCSF) was cloned under glucose utilizing glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAP) and methanol-utilizing alcohol oxidase (AOX1) promoters and expressed in Pichia pastoris SMD1168 strain. Constitutive expression under GAP resulted in cellular toxicity while AOX1 promoter controlled expression was stable. Variation in the levels of expression was observed among the transformant colonies with transformant #2 secreting up to \u223c4 mg/L of GCSF. The molecular mass of the expressed GCSF in P. pastoris was \u223c19.0 kDa. Quatitation of the expressed protein was carried out by a highly reproducible gel densitometric method. Effect of several operational and nutritional conditions was studied on GCSF production and the results suggest a general approach for increasing the yield of GCSF several folds (2- to 5-fold) over the standard conditions employed currently. Cultivation of the single-copy integrant in the chemically defined medium in a 5-L fermenter resulted in a volumetric productivity of \u223c0.7 mg/L/h at the end of the induction phase, which was about 4-fold higher than attained in the shake flask.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Amino acid supplementation", "AOX1 promoter", "Codon-optimized GCSF", "Low pH stability", "Pichia pastoris"], "IndexKeywords": ["Amino acid supplementation", "AOX1 promoter", "Codon-optimized GCSF", "PH stability", "Pichia Pastoris", "Bioreactors", "Cloning, Molecular", "Codon", "Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor", "Humans", "Open Reading Frames", "Pichia"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84958178593", "SubjectAreas": [["Biotechnology", "BIOC", "1305"], ["Bioengineering", "CENG", "1502"], ["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology", "IMMU", "2402"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"]], "AuthorData": {"56912106200": {"Name": "Maity N.", "AuthorID": "56912106200", "AffiliationID": "60032730", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemical Engineering and Biotechnology, Indian Institute of Technology Delhi"}, "37080752800": {"Name": "Gautam A.", "AuthorID": "37080752800", "AffiliationID": "60032730", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemical Engineering and Biotechnology, Indian Institute of Technology Delhi"}, "7402725328": {"Name": "Mishra S.", "AuthorID": "7402725328", "AffiliationID": "60032730", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemical Engineering and Biotechnology, Indian Institute of Technology Delhi"}, "56220258700": {"Name": "Sahai V.", "AuthorID": "56220258700", "AffiliationID": "60032730", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemical Engineering and Biotechnology, Indian Institute of Technology Delhi"}, "56912214300": {"Name": "Thawani A.", "AuthorID": "56912214300", "AffiliationID": "60009254", "AffiliationName": "Lilly Hall of Biological Sciences, Purdue University - West Lafayette"}, "56911444800": {"Name": "Sharma A.", "AuthorID": "56911444800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Biochemical Engineering Department, University College London"}}}
