Vision is an integrative sense which affords learning via sighted observation. Visual impairment (VI) denies/restricts access to learning via sight. As a result, children with VI and conditions where VI may be a component (e.g. Down syndrome (DS)) require structured, systematic support to develop ILS. The current study used a repeated-measures-intervention approach to examine the development of the ILS of dressing (ILSD) with novel intervention materials in young children. Participants (N = 27: age range 5;05\u201310;02 years) were drawn from three groups: VI (n = 9; age range 5;05\u201310;02 years); DS (n = 9; age range 5;05\u201310;00 years) and Typically Developing (TD) (n = 9; age range 6;05\u20138;00 years). The effectiveness of the intervention materials was measured over a period of 10 weeks. Clear and systematic verbal instruction combined with motor activities was useful in supporting ILSD. The assessment of the longer-term effectiveness was carried out at 1 and 3 months post-intervention. This paper reported that the novel intervention materials supported the development of ILSD in all three groups. The findings could form a model for future work regarding the development of ILS in other skill areas and generalised to other developmental disorders.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Habilitation", "inclusion", "independence", "task analysis", "visual impairment"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85045046544", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)", "ARTS", "1201"]], "AuthorData": {"57201486223": {"Name": "Hayton J.", "AuthorID": "57201486223", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "Lifespan Learning and Sleep Laboratory, Department of Psychology and Human Development, UCL-Institute of Education"}, "26039574100": {"Name": "Wall K.", "AuthorID": "26039574100", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology and Human Development, UCL-Institute of Education"}, "12799328500": {"Name": "Dimitriou D.", "AuthorID": "12799328500", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "Lifespan Learning and Sleep Laboratory, Department of Psychology and Human Development, UCL-Institute of Education"}}}
