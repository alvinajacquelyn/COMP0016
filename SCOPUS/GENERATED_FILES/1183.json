The region is about 5. km away from the East Anatolian Fault, therefore, this paper focuses on dynamic testing and earthquake simulations carried out within the framework of the Commagene Nemrut Conservation Development Program in order to explain monuments' current condition. The simulations showed vulnerability of cut-stone blocks separating from one another under seismic action, and simple strengthening solutions were proposed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Earthquake", "Modeling", "Nemrud", "Nemrut monuments", "Non-linear seismic analysis", "Structural identification"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84929519833", "SubjectAreas": [["Conservation", "ARTS", "1206"], ["Chemistry (miscellaneous)", "CHEM", "1601"], ["Archeology (arts and humanities)", "ARTS", "1204"], ["Materials Science (miscellaneous)", "MATE", "2501"], ["Economics, Econometrics and Finance (all)", "ECON", "2000"], ["Spectroscopy", "CHEM", "1607"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"]], "AuthorData": {"56254804900": {"Name": "Akta\u015f Y.", "AuthorID": "56254804900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL, Civil, Environmental and Geomatic Engineering"}, "6602844436": {"Name": "Turer A.", "AuthorID": "6602844436", "AffiliationID": "60004305", "AffiliationName": "METU, Civil Engineering"}}}
