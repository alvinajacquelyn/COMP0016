Performing an orchidopexy followed by a surgical sperm retrieval (SSR) is a potential option to retrieve spermatozoa. A microdissection TESE (mTESE) procedure is performed to retrieve mature spermatozoa for use in ICSI. This paper reviews the outcomes of mTESE in adults following an orchidopexy. Material and methods: A cohort of azoospermic patients underwent adult orchidopexy over a 10-year period at a single specialist centre. Data were collected retrospectively from the patient records retrieved from an institutional database. All patients underwent pre-operative imaging to localize the testicles, serum testosterone levels and a semen analysis. Separate intraoperative testicular biopsies were performed to exclude intratubular germ cell neoplasia (ITGCN) and to analyse the Johnsen score. Results: Twelve patients (age range 18\u201336 years) underwent orchidopexy procedures for either intra-abdominal or inguinal testicles. Mean follow-up was 34 months (range 13\u201358). Ninety per cent of patients had bilateral UDT with azoospermia. Pre-operative testosterone levels were within the normal range (mean 13.9 nmol/L; range 9.1\u201324.2). Five pelvic testicles (from four patients) were brought down and underwent a delayed mTESE. A total of nine inguinal orchidopexy procedures were carried out in eight men, and spermatozoa were found and preserved in three patients. None of the men with intra-abdominal testicles had mature spermatozoa present following a delayed mTESE. Overall, SSR was successful in 37.5% of the patients. Histological analysis showed no cases of ITGCN and the Johnsen scores ranged from 1 to 3.3. Conclusions: Microdissection TESE following orchidopexy for inguinal testicles can result in a successful SSR in over 1/3rd of patients. Intra-abdominal testicles appear to lack spermatogonia although the testicles can still be preserved for endogenous hormone production. Adult orchidopexy allows preservation of endogenous testosterone, easier self-examination and an immediate or delayed mTESE in azoospermic patients.", "AuthorKeywords": ["cryptorchidism", "microdissection TESE", "orchidopexy", "sperm retrieval", "undescended testicle"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Humans", "Male", "Microdissection", "Orchiopexy", "Retrospective Studies", "Sperm Retrieval"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85068740069", "SubjectAreas": [["Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism", "MEDI", "2712"], ["Reproductive Medicine", "MEDI", "2743"], ["Endocrinology", "BIOC", "1310"], ["Urology", "MEDI", "2748"]], "AuthorData": {"14029175800": {"Name": "Sangster P.", "AuthorID": "14029175800", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Andrology, University College London Hospital"}, "35092062900": {"Name": "Alnajjar H.M.", "AuthorID": "35092062900", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Andrology, University College London Hospital"}, "15764669400": {"Name": "Ahmed K.", "AuthorID": "15764669400", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Andrology, University College London Hospital"}, "37033467500": {"Name": "Christodoulidou M.", "AuthorID": "37033467500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Surgery and Interventional Science, University College London"}, "57209807778": {"Name": "Williamson E.", "AuthorID": "57209807778", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Andrology, University College London Hospital"}, "7404901815": {"Name": "Kelly J.D.", "AuthorID": "7404901815", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Surgery and Interventional Science, University College London"}, "55781298300": {"Name": "Ralph D.", "AuthorID": "55781298300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Surgery and Interventional Science, University College London"}, "24339107700": {"Name": "Muneer A.", "AuthorID": "24339107700", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, University College London Hospital"}, "6505884598": {"Name": "Dawas K.", "AuthorID": "6505884598", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery, University College London Hospital"}}}
