All rights reserved.Objective. To date, \u201chealed/non-healed\u201d and clinical judgment are the only available assessment tools for digital ulcers (DU) in patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc). The aim of our study is to examine a preliminary composite DU clinical assessment score (DUCAS) for SSc for face, content, and construct validity. Methods. Patients with SSc presenting at least 1 finger DU were enrolled and assessed with the Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index, Cochin scale, visual analog scale (VAS) for DU-related pain, patient global DU status, and global assessment as patient-reported outcomes (PRO), and physician VAS for DU status (phyGDU) as an SSc-DU expert physician/nurse measure. The DUCAS included 7 DU-related variables selected by a committee of SSc DU experts and weighted on a clinical basis. Face validity was examined by consensus and partial construct validity was tested through convergent correlation with other measures of hand function, using Spearman's correlations. A range of patients with SSc was examined. A linear regression model with backward stepwise analysis was used to determine the relationship of individual variables with the primary clinical parameter, phyGDU. Results. Forty-four patients with SSc (9 males, mean age 55 \u00b1 15 yrs, mean disease duration 9.9 \u00b1 5.8 yrs) were enrolled in the study. Overall DUCAS showed significant positive correlations with all abovementioned PRO (r > 0.4, p < 0.01). When all scores and scales were modeled, only DUCAS significantly predicted phyGDU (r = 0.59, R2 = 0.354, Akaike information criterion = 385.4). Conclusion. Preliminarily, we suggest that the DUCAS may be a new clinical score for SSc-related DU, having face and content validity and convergent/divergent correlations (construct validity). These early data suggest that this score deserves further evaluation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Digital Ulcer", "Disease Activity Score", "Outcome Measures Wounds and Injuries", "Systemic Sclerosis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Disability Evaluation", "Female", "Health Status", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Quality of Life", "Scleroderma, Systemic", "Severity of Illness Index", "Skin Ulcer", "Symptom Assessment"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85066444072", "SubjectAreas": [["Rheumatology", "MEDI", "2745"], ["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"]], "AuthorData": {"55215566600": {"Name": "Bruni C.", "AuthorID": "55215566600", "AffiliationID": "60021859", "AffiliationName": "Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, Department of Public Health, University of Florence"}, "16634845800": {"Name": "Braschi F.", "AuthorID": "16634845800", "AffiliationID": "60021859", "AffiliationName": "Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, Department of Public Health, University of Florence"}, "24341992900": {"Name": "Pucci T.", "AuthorID": "24341992900", "AffiliationID": "60021921", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geriatric Medicine, Division of Rheumatology, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria Careggi (AOUC)"}, "57156565500": {"Name": "Piemonte G.", "AuthorID": "57156565500", "AffiliationID": "60021921", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geriatric Medicine, Division of Rheumatology, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria Careggi (AOUC)"}, "57156344700": {"Name": "Benelli L.", "AuthorID": "57156344700", "AffiliationID": "60021859", "AffiliationName": "Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, Department of Public Health, University of Florence"}, "57209177002": {"Name": "Poli M.", "AuthorID": "57209177002", "AffiliationID": "60021921", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geriatric Medicine, Division of Rheumatology, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria Careggi (AOUC)"}, "6601986831": {"Name": "Rasero L.", "AuthorID": "6601986831", "AffiliationID": "60021859", "AffiliationName": "Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, Department of Public Health, University of Florence"}, "57206163255": {"Name": "Furst D.E.", "AuthorID": "57206163255", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Rheumatology and Connective Tissue Diseases, University College London (UCL), Division of Medicine"}, "7005642558": {"Name": "Matucci-Cerinic M.", "AuthorID": "7005642558", "AffiliationID": "60021859", "AffiliationName": "Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, Department of Public Health, University of Florence"}, "56115357300": {"Name": "Ngcozana T.", "AuthorID": "56115357300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Rheumatology and Connective Tissue Diseases, University College London (UCL), Division of Medicine"}, "7006031021": {"Name": "Denton C.P.", "AuthorID": "7006031021", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Rheumatology and Connective Tissue Diseases, University College London (UCL), Division of Medicine"}, "55990793600": {"Name": "Suliman Y.A.", "AuthorID": "55990793600", "AffiliationID": "60000617", "AffiliationName": "Rheumatology and Rehabilitation Department, Assiut University Hospital"}, "6701771669": {"Name": "Guiducci S.", "AuthorID": "6701771669", "AffiliationID": "60000617", "AffiliationName": "Rheumatology and Rehabilitation Department, Assiut University Hospital"}, "35218795900": {"Name": "Bellando-Randone S.", "AuthorID": "35218795900", "AffiliationID": "60000617", "AffiliationName": "Rheumatology and Rehabilitation Department, Assiut University Hospital"}, "57193158727": {"Name": "Balduzzi S.", "AuthorID": "57193158727", "AffiliationID": "60026556", "AffiliationName": "Department of Rheumatology, Institute for Research and Health Care (IRCCS) Policlinico San Matteo Foundation"}, "57207606647": {"Name": "Montecucco C.M.", "AuthorID": "57207606647", "AffiliationID": "60026556", "AffiliationName": "Department of Rheumatology, Institute for Research and Health Care (IRCCS) Policlinico San Matteo Foundation"}, "55353634900": {"Name": "Grotts J.", "AuthorID": "55353634900", "AffiliationID": "60027550", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine Statistics Core, Division of Rheumatology, Department of Medicine, University of California at Los Angeles"}}}
