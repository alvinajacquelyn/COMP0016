Phytoliths and macro remains have been used to understand crop choices in this period. Distinguishing between phytoliths from millet crops and panicoid non cultigens can be challenging. We examine the effect of using only one or two identification criteria compared with a more stringent five or more with phytoliths from archaeological samples to examine crop ratios. We compare our results with the results from the macro remains. This demonstrates, firstly, that using more identification markers has a very definite effect on the results and secondly, phytoliths and macro remains are complementary proxies that when used together can produce more accurate results than used alone.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Archaeobotany", "Broomcorn millet", "China", "Crops", "Foxtail millet", "Phytoliths"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84961177574", "SubjectAreas": [["Archeology (arts and humanities)", "ARTS", "1204"], ["Anthropology", "SOCI", "3314"], ["Archeology", "SOCI", "3302"]], "AuthorData": {"36118300000": {"Name": "Weisskopf A.", "AuthorID": "36118300000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Archaeology, University College London"}, "7404852067": {"Name": "Lee G.", "AuthorID": "7404852067", "AffiliationID": "60012317", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anthropology, University of Oregon"}}}
