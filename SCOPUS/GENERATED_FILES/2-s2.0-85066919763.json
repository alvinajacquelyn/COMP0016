This review investigates whether AT in children with CIs leads to improvements in speech and language development, cognition, and/or quality of life and whether improvements, if any, remain over time post AT intervention. Method: A systematic search of 7 databases identified 96 review articles published up until January 2017, 9 of which met the inclusion criteria. Data were extracted and independently assessed for risk of bias and quality of study against a PICOS (participants, intervention, control, outcomes, and study) framework. Results: All studies reported improvements in trained AT tasks, including speech discrimination/identification and working memory. Retention of improvements over time was found whenever it was assessed. Transfer of learning was measured in 4 of 6 studies, which assessed generalization. Quality of life was not assessed. Overall, evidence for the included studies was deemed to be of low quality. Conclusion: Benefits of AT were illustrated through the improvement in trained tasks, and this was observed in all reviewed studies. Transfer of improvement to other domains and also retention of benefits post AT were evident when assessed, although rarely done. However, higher quality evidence to further examine outcomes of AT in pediatric CI recipients is needed.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Cochlear Implantation", "Cochlear Implants", "Cognition", "Humans", "Language Development", "Quality of Life", "Speech"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85066919763", "SubjectAreas": [["Language and Linguistics", "ARTS", "1203"], ["Linguistics and Language", "SOCI", "3310"], ["Speech and Hearing", "HEAL", "3616"]], "AuthorData": {"57209227930": {"Name": "Rayes H.", "AuthorID": "57209227930", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Speech Hearing and Phonetic Sciences, Faculty of Brain Sciences, University College London"}, "7006164240": {"Name": "Vickers D.", "AuthorID": "7006164240", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Neurosciences, Clinical School, University of Cambridge"}, "36894635400": {"Name": "Al-Malky G.", "AuthorID": "36894635400", "AffiliationID": "60011326, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Ear Institute, Faculty of Brain Sciences, University College London"}}}
