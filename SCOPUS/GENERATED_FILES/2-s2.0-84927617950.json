We use the transition intensities from the HITRAN database of 14 vibrational bands for our comparisons. The intensities of all fundamental bands show strong sensitivity to the ab initio method used for constructing the DMS while hot, overtone and combination bands up to 4000cm-1 do not. The core-correlation and relativistic effects are found to be important for computed line intensities, for instance affecting the most intense fundamental band (\u03bd2) by about 20%. Our recommended DMS, called ALYT2, is based on the CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pV(6+d)Z level of theory supplemented by a core-correlation/relativistic corrective surface obtained at the CCSD[T]/aug-cc-pCV5Z-DK level. The corresponding computed intensities agree significantly better (to within 10%) with experimental data taken directly from original papers. Worse agreement (differences of about 25%) is found for those HITRAN intensities obtained from fitted effective dipole models, suggesting the presence of underlying problems in those fits.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Databases", "HITRAN", "Line-lists", "Radiative transfer"], "IndexKeywords": ["Combination bands", "Dipole moment surfaces", "HITRAN", "Line lists", "Relativistic effects", "Theoretical calculations", "Transition intensity", "Vibration rotations"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84927617950", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiation", "PHYS", "3108"], ["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"], ["Spectroscopy", "CHEM", "1607"]], "AuthorData": {"55905085600": {"Name": "Azzam A.A.A.", "AuthorID": "55905085600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "23486133800": {"Name": "Lodi L.", "AuthorID": "23486133800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "35605893200": {"Name": "Yurchenko S.N.", "AuthorID": "35605893200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "7101645601": {"Name": "Tennyson J.", "AuthorID": "7101645601", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}}}
