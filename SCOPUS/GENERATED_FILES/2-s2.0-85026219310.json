Consecutive patients (n=272) with a multidisciplinary IPF diagnosis had the extent of interstitial lung disease (ILD) scored visually and by CALIPER. Visually scored emphysema was subcategorised as isolated or mixed with fibrotic lung. The CT scores were evaluated against functional indices forced vital capacity (FVC), diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DLCO), transfer coefficient of the lung for carbon monoxide (KCO), composite physiologic index (CPI)) and mortality. The presence and extent of emphysema had no impact on survival. Results were maintained following correction for age, gender, smoking status and baseline severity using DLCO, and combined visual emphysema and ILD extent. Visual emphysema quantitation indicated that relative preservation of lung volumes (FVC) resulted from tractionally dilated airways within fibrotic lung, ventilating areas of admixed emphysema (p<0.0001), with no independent effect on FVC from isolated emphysema. Conversely, only isolated emphysema (p<0.0001) reduced gas transfer (DLCO). There is no prognostic impact of emphysema in IPF, beyond that explained by the additive extents of both fibrosis and emphysema. With respect to the location of pulmonary fibrosis, emphysema distribution determines the functional effects of emphysema.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Carbon Monoxide", "Female", "Forced Expiratory Volume", "Humans", "Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis", "Kaplan-Meier Estimate", "Lung", "Male", "Prognosis", "Pulmonary Emphysema", "Severity of Illness Index", "Tomography, X-Ray Computed", "United Kingdom", "Vital Capacity"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85026219310", "SubjectAreas": [["Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine", "MEDI", "2740"]], "AuthorData": {"57200973324": {"Name": "Jacob J.", "AuthorID": "57200973324", "AffiliationID": "60022023, 60009009", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Royal Brompton Hospital, Royal Brompton and Harefield NHS Foundation Trust"}, "36241963000": {"Name": "Nair A.", "AuthorID": "36241963000", "AffiliationID": "60022023, 60009009", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Royal Brompton Hospital, Royal Brompton and Harefield NHS Foundation Trust"}, "36555011900": {"Name": "Walsh S.L.F.", "AuthorID": "36555011900", "AffiliationID": "60022023, 60009009", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Royal Brompton Hospital, Royal Brompton and Harefield NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7102078625": {"Name": "Hansell D.M.", "AuthorID": "7102078625", "AffiliationID": "60022023, 60009009", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Royal Brompton Hospital, Royal Brompton and Harefield NHS Foundation Trust"}, "6602803945": {"Name": "Bartholmai B.J.", "AuthorID": "6602803945", "AffiliationID": "60032610", "AffiliationName": "Division of Radiology, Mayo Clinic Rochester"}, "8596434600": {"Name": "Rajagopalan S.", "AuthorID": "8596434600", "AffiliationID": "60032610", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physiology and Biomedical Engineering, Mayo Clinic Rochester"}, "6603861094": {"Name": "Karwoski R.", "AuthorID": "6603861094", "AffiliationID": "60032610", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physiology and Biomedical Engineering, Mayo Clinic Rochester"}, "36614291500": {"Name": "Kokosi M.", "AuthorID": "36614291500", "AffiliationID": "60022023, 60009009", "AffiliationName": "Interstitial Lung Disease Unit, Royal Brompton Hospital, Royal Brompton and Harefield NHS Foundation Trust"}, "56799189700": {"Name": "Maher T.M.", "AuthorID": "56799189700", "AffiliationID": "60022023, 60009009", "AffiliationName": "Interstitial Lung Disease Unit, Royal Brompton Hospital, Royal Brompton and Harefield NHS Foundation Trust"}, "6602708198": {"Name": "Renzoni E.", "AuthorID": "6602708198", "AffiliationID": "60022023, 60009009", "AffiliationName": "Interstitial Lung Disease Unit, Royal Brompton Hospital, Royal Brompton and Harefield NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57201532967": {"Name": "Wells A.U.", "AuthorID": "57201532967", "AffiliationID": "60022023, 60009009", "AffiliationName": "Interstitial Lung Disease Unit, Royal Brompton Hospital, Royal Brompton and Harefield NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
