Here, we find that Jarid1b is highly expressed in primitive hematopoietic compartments and is overexpressed in acute myeloid leukemias. Constitutive genetic deletion of Jarid1b did not impact steady-state hematopoiesis. In contrast, acute deletion of Jarid1b from bone marrow increased peripheral blood T cells and, following secondary transplantation, resulted in loss of bone marrow reconstitution. Our results reveal that deletion of Jarid1b compromises hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) self-renewal capacity and suggest that Jarid1b is a positive regulator of HSC potential.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Cell Differentiation", "Cell Division", "Cell Proliferation", "DNA-Binding Proteins", "Hematopoiesis", "Hematopoietic Stem Cells", "Jumonji Domain-Containing Histone Demethylases", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Knockout"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84926151106", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"], ["Hematology", "MEDI", "2720"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"57216189696": {"Name": "Stewart M.H.", "AuthorID": "57216189696", "AffiliationID": "60009982", "AffiliationName": "Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine, Harvard University"}, "7103169612": {"Name": "Rossi D.J.", "AuthorID": "7103169612", "AffiliationID": "60009982", "AffiliationName": "Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine, Harvard University"}, "26532449500": {"Name": "Albert M.", "AuthorID": "26532449500", "AffiliationID": "60083854, 60030840", "AffiliationName": "Biotech Research and Innovation Center, Center for Epigenetics, University of Copenhagen"}, "24336454800": {"Name": "Sroczynska P.", "AuthorID": "24336454800", "AffiliationID": "60083854, 60030840", "AffiliationName": "Biotech Research and Innovation Center, Center for Epigenetics, University of Copenhagen"}, "56097260400": {"Name": "Cruickshank V.A.", "AuthorID": "56097260400", "AffiliationID": "60083854, 60030840", "AffiliationName": "Biotech Research and Innovation Center, Center for Epigenetics, University of Copenhagen"}, "18334899300": {"Name": "Helin K.", "AuthorID": "18334899300", "AffiliationID": "60083854, 60030840", "AffiliationName": "Biotech Research and Innovation Center, Center for Epigenetics, University of Copenhagen"}, "55712450300": {"Name": "Guo Y.", "AuthorID": "55712450300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Stem Cell Group, University College London Cancer Institute, University College London"}, "7006621281": {"Name": "Enver T.", "AuthorID": "7006621281", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Stem Cell Group, University College London Cancer Institute, University College London"}}}
