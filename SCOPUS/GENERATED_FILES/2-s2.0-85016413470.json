The ice sheet is modelled by a thin elastic sheet and uniform physical properties are assumed. The fluid is assumed to be inviscid, incompressible and homogeneous, and the depth to be infinite. The boundary condition on the ice sheet is linearized and satisfied on its mean position, while the fully nonlinear boundary condition is imposed on the instantaneous position of the body surface. The velocity potential is formulated by the multipole expansion method in the polar coordinate system with its origin fixed at the centre of the cylinder. Detailed results through the hydrodynamic force and deformation of the ice sheet are provided. The effects of the ice sheet properties, and motion amplitude and frequency are investigated.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Circular cylinder", "Ice sheet", "Large amplitude oscillation", "Multipole expansion"], "IndexKeywords": ["Hydrodynamic problems", "Ice sheet", "Large amplitude oscillation", "Large-amplitude motion", "Multipole expansion methods", "Multipole expansions", "Polar coordinate systems", "Velocity potentials"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85016413470", "SubjectAreas": [["Mathematical Physics", "MATH", "2610"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"56723490000": {"Name": "Li Z.", "AuthorID": "56723490000", "AffiliationID": "60069706", "AffiliationName": "School of Naval Architecture and Ocean Engineering, Jiangsu University of Science and Technology"}, "56969946300": {"Name": "Shi Y.", "AuthorID": "56969946300", "AffiliationID": "60003353", "AffiliationName": "College of Shipbuilding Engineering, Harbin Engineering University"}, "14012675900": {"Name": "Wu G.", "AuthorID": "14012675900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}}}
