Some papers have dealt with managerial satisfaction and businesses' performance adopting agency theory to interpret the results. However, no studies have yet considered the relationship between the satisfaction levels of an environmental manager and corporate environmental performance. This paper thus analyses the role played by the environmental manager's satisfaction in enhancing corporate environmental performance and reputation. The paper uses data from a survey of 412 Eco Management and Audit Scheme registered organizations. The results show a positive relationship between managerial satisfaction and environmental performance, whereas no such positive relationship was found when considering eco\u2010innovation performance. In addition, the environmental manager's satisfaction has a positive and indirect influence on the corporate environmental reputation. These results contribute to the literature on agency theory and aim to extend the debate between job satisfaction and job performance to the sustainable business field.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Eco\u2010innovation", "Environmental management systems", "Environmental performance", "Managerial satisfaction", "Structural equation model"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85058834008", "SubjectAreas": [["Business and International Management", "BUSI", "1403"], ["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"], ["Strategy and Management", "BUSI", "1408"], ["Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law", "ENVI", "2308"]], "AuthorData": {"35742644400": {"Name": "Daddi T.", "AuthorID": "35742644400", "AffiliationID": "60028039", "AffiliationName": "Sant'Anna School of Advanced Studies, Institute of Management"}, "6506317754": {"Name": "Iraldo F.", "AuthorID": "6506317754", "AffiliationID": "60028039", "AffiliationName": "Sant'Anna School of Advanced Studies, Institute of Management"}, "26649234500": {"Name": "Testa F.", "AuthorID": "26649234500", "AffiliationID": "60028039", "AffiliationName": "Sant'Anna School of Advanced Studies, Institute of Management"}, "55832669000": {"Name": "De Giacomo M.R.", "AuthorID": "55832669000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Institute for Sustainable Resources"}}}
