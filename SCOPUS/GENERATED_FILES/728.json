In both domains, two fundamental properties of the processing system have been debated: Whether the flow of information from a level n to a subsequent level n+1 is maximal or minimal (e.g., does information cascade from one processing level to the next or is only the end result at each level transmitted to the following level?); and whether the flow of information from a level n to a level n+1 is bidirectional or unidirectional (does information at a given level feed back to a previous level?).", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": null, "EID": "2-s2.0-85082914203", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychology (all)", "PSYC", "3200"]], "AuthorData": {"55919485500": {"Name": "Vigliocco G.", "AuthorID": "55919485500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "6603917526": {"Name": "Hartsuiker R.J.", "AuthorID": "6603917526", "AffiliationID": "60033316", "AffiliationName": "Ghent University"}}}
