Badgers are a wildlife reservoir of disease, although the eight-year Independent Scientific Group (ISG) Randomised Badger Culling Trial concluded with a recommendation against culling. The report advised government that bovine TB could be controlled, and ultimately eradicated, by cattle-based measures alone. Despite the ISG recommendation against culling, the farming and veterinary industries continued to lobby government for a badger cull. The 2005\u20132010 Labour government followed the ISG advice and decided against a cull. The 2010\u20132015 Coalition and the 2015-present Conservative governments have followed a badger culling policy. This paper investigates whether a virtuous government would cull badgers. It provides an overview of virtue theory in the context of government animal health and welfare policy. Bovine TB and badger control policy options are then analysed in the context of the virtues of justice, wisdom, integrity, loyalty, curiosity, trust, empathy, compassion and aesthetics. Justice is the first virtue of government, and badger culling is seriously problematic from a virtue perspective given that five badgers are culled per cow that avoids slaughter as a result. Analysis based on other virtues strongly suggests that government should not cull badgers. The paper concludes that a virtuous government would not cull badgers as part of policy to control bovine TB in cattle.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Animal health and welfare policy", "Badger culling", "Badger vaccination", "Bovine tuberculosis", "Evidence-based policy", "Virtue theory"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85028534403", "SubjectAreas": [["Environmental Chemistry", "ENVI", "2304"], ["History", "ARTS", "1202"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (miscellaneous)", "AGRI", "1101"], ["Environmental Science (all)", "ENVI", "2300"]], "AuthorData": {"57196663609": {"Name": "McCulloch S.", "AuthorID": "57196663609", "AffiliationID": "60003310", "AffiliationName": "University of Winchester"}, "7202205455": {"Name": "Reiss M.", "AuthorID": "7202205455", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Education, University College London"}}}
