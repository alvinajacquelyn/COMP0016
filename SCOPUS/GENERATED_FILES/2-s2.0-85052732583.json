Re-use permitted under CC BY. Published by BMJ.Objectives To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the implementation of the Identification and Referral to Improve Safety (IRIS) programme using up-to-date real-world information on costs and effectiveness from routine clinical practice. A Markov model was constructed to estimate mean costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) of IRIS versus usual care per woman registered at a general practice from a societal and health service perspective with a 10-year time horizon. Design and setting Cost-utility analysis in UK general practices, including data from six sites which have been running IRIS for at least 2 years across England. Participants Based on the Markov model, which uses health states to represent possible outcomes of the intervention, we stipulated a hypothetical cohort of 10 000 women aged 16 years or older. Interventions The IRIS trial was a randomised controlled trial that tested the effectiveness of a primary care training and support intervention to improve the response to women experiencing domestic violence and abuse, and found it to be cost-effective. As a result, the IRIS programme has been implemented across the UK, generating data on costs and effectiveness outside a trial context. Results The IRIS programme saved \u00a314 per woman aged 16 years or older registered in general practice (95% uncertainty interval -\u00a3151 to \u00a337) and produced QALY gains of 0.001 per woman (95% uncertainty interval -0.005 to 0.006). The incremental net monetary benefit was positive both from a societal and National Health Service perspective (\u00a342 and \u00a322, respectively) and the IRIS programme was cost-effective in 61% of simulations using real-life data when the cost-effectiveness threshold was \u00a320 000 per QALY gained as advised by National Institute for Health and Care Excellence. Conclusion The IRIS programme is likely to be cost-effective and cost-saving from a societal perspective in the UK and cost-effective from a health service perspective, although there is considerable uncertainty surrounding these results, reflected in the large uncertainty intervals.", "AuthorKeywords": ["cost-effectiveness", "domestic violence", "family medicine primary care", "general practice", "intimate partner violence", "training programme"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Aged", "Cost-Benefit Analysis", "Domestic Violence", "Education, Professional", "Female", "General Practice", "Health Personnel", "Humans", "Middle Aged", "Patient Care Team", "Primary Health Care", "Program Evaluation", "Quality of Life", "Quality-Adjusted Life Years", "Referral and Consultation", "State Medicine", "Uncertainty", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85052732583", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"57203187464": {"Name": "Barbosa E.C.", "AuthorID": "57203187464", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Department of Applied Health Research"}, "36093643600": {"Name": "Verhoef T.I.", "AuthorID": "36093643600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Department of Applied Health Research"}, "57210018355": {"Name": "Morris S.", "AuthorID": "57210018355", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Department of Applied Health Research"}, "55263597100": {"Name": "Solmi F.", "AuthorID": "55263597100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, University College London"}, "43661247000": {"Name": "Johnson M.", "AuthorID": "43661247000", "AffiliationID": "121314683", "AffiliationName": "IRISi Interventions"}, "56670957700": {"Name": "Sohal A.", "AuthorID": "56670957700", "AffiliationID": "60022109, 60159931", "AffiliationName": "NIHR CLAHRC North Thames at Bart's Health NHS Trust, Centre for Primary Care and Public Health, Queen Mary University of London"}, "57203179378": {"Name": "El-Shogri F.", "AuthorID": "57203179378", "AffiliationID": "60022109, 60159931", "AffiliationName": "NIHR CLAHRC North Thames at Bart's Health NHS Trust, Centre for Primary Care and Public Health, Queen Mary University of London"}, "57203723937": {"Name": "Dowrick S.", "AuthorID": "57203723937", "AffiliationID": "60022109, 60159931", "AffiliationName": "NIHR CLAHRC North Thames at Bart's Health NHS Trust, Centre for Primary Care and Public Health, Queen Mary University of London"}, "55228809500": {"Name": "Griffiths C.", "AuthorID": "55228809500", "AffiliationID": "60022109", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Primary Care and Public Health, Queen Mary University of London"}, "7004645125": {"Name": "Eldridge S.", "AuthorID": "7004645125", "AffiliationID": "60022109, 60159931", "AffiliationName": "NIHR CLAHRC North Thames at Bart's Health NHS Trust, Centre for Primary Care and Public Health, Queen Mary University of London"}, "57193512604": {"Name": "Lewis N.V.", "AuthorID": "57193512604", "AffiliationID": "60022109, 60159931", "AffiliationName": "NIHR CLAHRC North Thames at Bart's Health NHS Trust, Centre for Primary Care and Public Health, Queen Mary University of London"}, "6602134600": {"Name": "Ronalds C.", "AuthorID": "6602134600", "AffiliationID": "121195135", "AffiliationName": "Pankhurst Trust Incorporating, Manchester Women's Aid"}, "35573080400": {"Name": "Devine A.", "AuthorID": "35573080400", "AffiliationID": "60012718, 60175823", "AffiliationName": "Mahidol-Oxford Tropical Medicine Research Unit, Mahidol University"}, "7202315044": {"Name": "Spencer A.", "AuthorID": "7202315044", "AffiliationID": "60111707", "AffiliationName": "University of Exeter Medical School"}, "55749172200": {"Name": "Feder G.", "AuthorID": "55749172200", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "School of Social and Community Medicine, University of Bristol"}}}
