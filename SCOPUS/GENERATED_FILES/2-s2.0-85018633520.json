The accurate prediction of VATTs demands a turbulence simulation approach that is able to predict accurately flow separation and vortex shedding and a numerical method that can cope with moving boundaries. Thus, in this study an immersed boundary-based large-eddy simulation (LES-IB) method is refined to allow accurate simulation of the blade vortex interaction of VATTs. The method is first introduced and validated for a VATT subjected to laminar flow. Comparisons with highly-accurate body-fitted numerical models results demonstrate the method's ability of reproducing accurately the performance and fluid mechanics of the chosen VATT. Then, the simulation of a VATT under turbulent flow is performed and comparisons with data from experiments and results from RANS-based models demonstrate the accuracy of the method. The vortex-blade interaction is visualised for various tip speed ratios and together with velocity spectra detailed insights into the fluid mechanics of VATTs are provided.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Direct forcing", "Immersed boundary method", "Large-eddy simulation", "Tidal turbines", "Vertical axis turbines", "Vortex-blade interaction"], "IndexKeywords": ["Accurate prediction", "Blade vortex interaction", "Direct forcing", "Immersed boundary methods", "Tidal turbines", "Turbulence simulation", "Vertical axis tidal turbines", "Vertical axis turbines"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85018633520", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"], ["Engineering (all)", "ENGI", "2200"]], "AuthorData": {"56646410800": {"Name": "Ouro P.", "AuthorID": "56646410800", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "Hydro-environmental Research Centre, Cardiff School of Engineering"}, "6507316700": {"Name": "Stoesser T.", "AuthorID": "6507316700", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "Hydro-environmental Research Centre, Cardiff School of Engineering"}}}
