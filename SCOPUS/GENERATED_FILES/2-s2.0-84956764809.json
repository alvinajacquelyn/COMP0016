There are several examples of real ecosystems in patchy environments where the habitats are heterogeneous in their local density dependence. We investigate a multi-patch model of a single species with spatial dispersal, where the growth of the local population is logistic in some localities (negative density dependence) while other patches exhibit a strong Allee effect (positive density dependence). When the local dynamics is logistic in each patch and the habitats are interconnected by dispersal then the total population has only the extinction steady state and a componentwise positive equilibrium, corresponding to persistence in each patch. We show that animal populations in patchy environments can have a large number of steady states if local density dependence varies over the locations. It is demonstrated that, depending on the network topology of migration routes between the patches, the interaction of spatial dispersal and local density dependence can create a variety of coexisting stable positive equilibria. We give a detailed description of the multiple ways dispersal can rescue local populations from extinction.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Allee effect", "ODE", "Patch-model", "Population migration"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Ecology", "Ecosystem", "Models, Biological", "Population Density", "Population Dynamics", "Population Growth"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84956764809", "SubjectAreas": [["Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics", "AGRI", "1105"]], "AuthorData": {"36773283600": {"Name": "Knipl D.", "AuthorID": "36773283600", "AffiliationID": "60027332", "AffiliationName": "MTA-SZTE Analysis and Stochastic Research Group, University of Szeged"}, "20734934300": {"Name": "R\u00f6st G.", "AuthorID": "20734934300", "AffiliationID": "60068482, 60027332", "AffiliationName": "Bolyai Institute, University of Szeged"}}}
