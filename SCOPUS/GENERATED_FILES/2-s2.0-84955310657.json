However, studying their functional properties is difficult because synaptic connections typically consist of multiple synaptic contacts that release vesicles stochastically and exhibit time-dependent behavior. Moreover, most central synapses are small and inaccessible to direct measurements. Estimation of synaptic properties from postsynaptic currents or potentials is complicated by the presence of nonuniform release probability and nonuniform quantal properties. The presence of multivesicular release and postsynaptic receptor saturation at some synapses can also complicate the interpretation of quantal parameters. Multipleprobability fluctuation analysis (MPFA; also known as variance-mean analysis) is a method that has been developed for estimating synaptic parameters from the variance and mean amplitude of synaptic responses recorded at different release probabilities. This statistical approach, which incorporates nonuniform synaptic properties, has become widely used for studying synaptic transmission. In this chapter, we describe the statistical models used to extract quantal parameters and discuss their interpretation when applying MPFA.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Active zone", "MPFA", "Quantal analysis", "Release probability", "Release site", "Synapse", "Variance-mean analysis", "Vesicle"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84955310657", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics (all)", "PHAR", "3000"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"26767988800": {"Name": "Lanore F.", "AuthorID": "26767988800", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "7201936933": {"Name": "Silver R.", "AuthorID": "7201936933", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
