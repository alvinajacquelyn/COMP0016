The individual's aortic root is replicated by 3-dimensional printing. A polymer mesh sleeve is manufactured, which is implanted with the aim to support and stabilize the aortic wall. Objectives: The aim of this study was to assess effectiveness of PEARS for prevention of aortic root dilatation in Marfan patients. Methods: A total of 24 consecutive Marfan patients operated 2004 to 2012 were prospectively monitored with magnetic resonance imaging. Following a pre-defined protocol, baseline and follow-up aorta measurements were made in a blinded random sequence. Results: The mean age of the patients was 33 \u00b1 13.3 years (range: 16 to 58 years), and the mean aortic root diameter was 45 \u00b1 2.8 mm (range: 41 to 52 mm). Follow-up was 6.3 \u00b1 2.6 years. There was no increase in the aortic root and ascending aorta diameters, but there was a tendency toward reduction: annulus diameter 28.9 \u00b1 2.3 mm to 28.5 \u00b1 2.4 mm (change \u22120.39 mm, 95% confidence interval [CI]: \u22121.05 to 0.27 mm), sinus of Valsalva diameter 44.9 \u00b1 2.9 mm to 44.5 \u00b1 3.0 mm (change \u22120.37 mm, 95% CI: \u22121.23 to 0.51 mm), and ascending aorta diameter 32.4 \u00b1 3.6 mm to 32.3 \u00b1 3.7 mm (change \u22120.10 mm, 95% CI: \u22120.92 to 0.74 mm). In the same period, the descending aorta diameter increased from 22.9 \u00b1 2.4 mm to 24.2 \u00b1 3.0 mm (change 1.32 mm, 95% CI: 0.70 to 1.94 mm; p < 0.001) with a tendency toward increase in aortic arch diameter 24.1 \u00b1 2.0 mm to 24.5 \u00b1 2.8 mm (change 0.41 mm, 95% CI: \u22120.56 to 1.37 mm). Conclusions: PEARS is effective in stabilizing the aortic root and preventing its dilatation. It is a viable alternative for prevention of aortic root dissection in Marfan patients.", "AuthorKeywords": ["aneurysm", "aorta", "dissection", "magnetic resonance", "Marfan syndrome"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aneurysm, Dissecting", "Aorta", "Aortic Aneurysm", "Blood Vessel Prosthesis", "Dilatation, Pathologic", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Cine", "Marfan Syndrome", "Middle Aged", "Printing, Three-Dimensional", "Prophylactic Surgical Procedures", "Prospective Studies", "Surgical Mesh", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85051789000", "SubjectAreas": [["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"56022489600": {"Name": "Izgi C.", "AuthorID": "56022489600", "AffiliationID": "60009009", "AffiliationName": "Cardiovascular Research Center & Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance Unit, Royal Brompton Hospital"}, "24175610200": {"Name": "Alpendurada F.", "AuthorID": "24175610200", "AffiliationID": "60010719, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "National Heart & Lung Institute, Imperial College"}, "22135652600": {"Name": "Nyktari E.", "AuthorID": "22135652600", "AffiliationID": "60009009", "AffiliationName": "Cardiovascular Research Center & Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance Unit, Royal Brompton Hospital"}, "13009266800": {"Name": "Boutsikou M.", "AuthorID": "13009266800", "AffiliationID": "60009009", "AffiliationName": "Cardiovascular Research Center & Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance Unit, Royal Brompton Hospital"}, "7005490421": {"Name": "Mohiaddin R.", "AuthorID": "7005490421", "AffiliationID": "60010719, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "National Heart & Lung Institute, Imperial College"}, "57194140346": {"Name": "Newsome S.", "AuthorID": "57194140346", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Statistics, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "7102974417": {"Name": "Pepper J.", "AuthorID": "7102974417", "AffiliationID": "60010719, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "National Heart & Lung Institute, Imperial College"}, "57196678944": {"Name": "Treasure T.", "AuthorID": "57196678944", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Operational Research Unit, University College London"}}}
