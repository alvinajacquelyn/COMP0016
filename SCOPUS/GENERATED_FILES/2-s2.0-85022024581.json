Shells were recovered by hand during excavation and all excavated deposit was processed by flotation, with a 250 \u03bcm mesh to recover floating material and a 1.0 mm mesh to recover the heavy fraction. The total assemblage comprised 5780 individuals (MNI) among 33 taxa, the sieved sub-assemblage having the highest proportions of these (2841 MNI in 31 taxa) and the hand-picked sub-assemblage the lowest (698 MNI in 11 taxa). Eleven taxa were absent from the flotation sub-assemblage, although the recovered MNI (2241; 39% of the total MNI) was high. The palaeoecological implications of the results are considered. Adult and large-sized juvenile shells of the edible land snail Cepaea nemoralis are abundant in the hand-picked sub-assemblage, but it is the absence of small-sized juvenile shells in the flotation and wet-sieved sub-assemblages that permits the inference that the species was collected for consumption. Wet sieving is therefore essential, both for interpreting hand-picked samples and in particular for the recovery of representative assemblages of land molluscs.", "AuthorKeywords": ["flotation", "hand picking", "Land snails", "Pico Ramos", "recovery methods", "wet sieving"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85022024581", "SubjectAreas": [["Archeology (arts and humanities)", "ARTS", "1204"], ["Archeology", "SOCI", "3302"], ["Environmental Science (miscellaneous)", "ENVI", "2301"]], "AuthorData": {"7402627589": {"Name": "Thomas K.", "AuthorID": "7402627589", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Archaeology, University College London"}, "8293557800": {"Name": "Zapata L.", "AuthorID": "8293557800", "AffiliationID": "60103709", "AffiliationName": "Departamento Geograf\u00eda, Historia y Arqueolog\u00eda, University of the Basque Country (UPV/EHU)"}}}
