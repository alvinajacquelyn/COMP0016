However, very little is known about how mothers experience social work intervention during the perinatal period. This study explored experiences of social work intervention among women with perinatal mental health difficulties. Qualitative semi-structured interviews were carried out with 18 women with 6- to 9-month-old babies, who had been treated in England for a perinatal mental health difficulty and also had social services intervention. Interviews were analysed using thematic analysis. Findings suggested that mothers had a predominantly negative view of children's social services, especially when social workers had significant child protection concerns. The fear of being judged an unfit mother and having their babies taken away overshadowed their encounters. Mothers felt that social workers would not accept they could be good mothers in spite of their difficulties and set them up to fail. Some felt that social workers focused exclusively on the risks to the baby and did not acknowledge the mother's own needs or understand perinatal mental health. In some cases, social work intervention was described as intensifying pressure on mothers\u2019 mental health, leading to escalating difficulties and increased likelihood of care proceedings. At the same time, our study also included examples of mothers forming positive relationships with social workers, and of \u2018turning points\u2019 where initially negative interactions stabilised and child protection concerns lessened. Women's accounts highlighted the importance of feeling \u2018known\u2019 by social workers who understood and respected them. The findings also suggested there may be value in improving collaboration between social workers and mental health professionals to create more space for representation of women's needs as well as those of their babies.", "AuthorKeywords": ["child protection", "mothers\u2019 perspectives", "perinatal mental health", "qualitative research", "social work"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adaptation, Psychological", "Adult", "Community Health Nursing", "England", "Female", "Humans", "Infant", "Mental Health", "Mother-Child Relations", "Mothers", "Parturition", "Postnatal Care", "Postpartum Period", "Pregnancy", "Qualitative Research", "Self Efficacy", "Social Support"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85071036573", "SubjectAreas": [["Social Sciences (miscellaneous)", "SOCI", "3301"], ["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"], ["Health Policy", "MEDI", "2719"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"56418502300": {"Name": "Lever Taylor B.", "AuthorID": "56418502300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, University College London"}, "56602741700": {"Name": "Mosse L.", "AuthorID": "56602741700", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "CAMHS Research Unit, Department of Psychology, King's College London"}, "11839741500": {"Name": "Stanley N.", "AuthorID": "11839741500", "AffiliationID": "60031259", "AffiliationName": "School of Social Work, Care and Community, University of Central Lancashire"}}}
