This study focuses on the prediction of the occupational class for a public user profile. Our analysis is conducted on a new annotated corpus of Twitter users, their respective job titles, posted textual content and platform-related attributes. We frame our task as classification using latent feature representations such as word clusters and embeddings. The employed linear and, especially, non-linear methods can predict a user's occupational class with strong accuracy for the coarsest level of a standard occupation taxonomy which includes nine classes. Combined with a qualitative assessment, the derived results confirm the feasibility of our approach in inferring a new user attribute that can be embedded in a multitude of downstream applications.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Downstream applications", "Feature representation", "Non-linear methods", "Qualitative assessments", "Social attributes", "Social media", "Textual content", "Word-clusters"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84943802434", "SubjectAreas": [["Artificial Intelligence", "COMP", "1702"], ["Software", "COMP", "1712"]], "AuthorData": {"56898943200": {"Name": "Preot'iuc-Pietro D.", "AuthorID": "56898943200", "AffiliationID": "60006297", "AffiliationName": "Computer and Information Science, University of Pennsylvania"}, "36610455100": {"Name": "Lampos V.", "AuthorID": "36610455100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "55418795600": {"Name": "Aletras N.", "AuthorID": "55418795600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}}}
