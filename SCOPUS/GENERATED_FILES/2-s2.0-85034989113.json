We aimed to broaden the fndings of previous studies and identify key features of GP training practices. In particular, we wanted to extend previous fndings regarding QOF achievement and patient experience derived from the General Practice Patient Survey (GPPS), with recent data on the use of urgent cancer referral pathways ('Two Week Wait', or '2WW,' referrals) and secondary care utilisation by GP training Practices. We compared training and non-training practices, adjusting for differences in practice size and demographic features. Compared with nontraining practices, we found reported patient satisfaction with 'access' was 2.0% higher (p < 0.001), 'communication' 0.75% higher (p < 0.001), 'overall experience' 2.8% higher (p < 0.001), 'continuity of care' 2.2% lower (p < 0.001). Mean QOF scores were 11 points higher in training practices (p < 0.001). There were few differences between the two types of practice in terms of Emergency hospital admissions, Ambulatory Care Sensitive (ACSC) admissions, Accident and Emergency attendances and Out-Patient attendances. Training practices used the 2WW referral pathway more frequently than non-training practices resulting in a 1.1% higher 'cancer detection rate' (p = 0.007).", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cancer urgent referral pathway", "GP postgraduate training practices", "Primary care"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cross-Sectional Studies", "England", "General Practice", "Humans", "Patient Satisfaction", "Quality Indicators, Health Care", "Referral and Consultation", "Secondary Care", "Socioeconomic Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85034989113", "SubjectAreas": [["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"57188825340": {"Name": "Weston C.", "AuthorID": "57188825340", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Primary Care and Public Health Sciences, King's College London"}, "57197817006": {"Name": "Lock J.", "AuthorID": "57197817006", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Primary Care and Public Health Sciences, King's College London"}, "12242332000": {"Name": "Durbaba S.", "AuthorID": "12242332000", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Primary Care and Public Health Sciences, King's College London"}, "7005599508": {"Name": "Ashworth M.", "AuthorID": "7005599508", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Primary Care and Public Health Sciences, King's College London"}, "8970955500": {"Name": "Ahluwalia S.", "AuthorID": "8970955500", "AffiliationID": "114524656", "AffiliationName": "Health Education England"}, "8725282000": {"Name": "Bassett P.", "AuthorID": "8725282000", "AffiliationID": "112710538", "AffiliationName": "Statsconsultancy Ltd"}}}
