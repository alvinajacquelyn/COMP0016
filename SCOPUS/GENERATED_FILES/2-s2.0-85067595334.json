However, as a disease progresses, knowing when, how, and for what purposes patients want to interact with and construct personal meaning from health-related information is still unclear. This paper presents findings regarding the information work of chronic kidney disease patients. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 13 patients and 6 clinicians, and observations at 9 patient group events. We used the stages of the information journey \u2013 recognizing need, seeking, interpreting, and using information \u2013 to frame our data analysis. We identified two distinct but often overlapping information work phases, \u2018Learning\u2019 and \u2018Living With\u2019 a chronic condition to show how patient information work activities shift over time. We also describe social and individual factors influencing information work, and discuss technology design opportunities including customized education and collaboration tools.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Chronic kidney disease", "Information journey", "Information work", "Meaning making", "Patient self-management", "Sensemaking"], "IndexKeywords": ["Chronic kidney disease", "Information journey", "Information work", "Meaning makings", "Self management", "Sensemaking"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85067595334", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Human-Computer Interaction", "COMP", "1709"], ["Computer Graphics and Computer-Aided Design", "COMP", "1704"]], "AuthorData": {"57197897716": {"Name": "Burgess E.R.", "AuthorID": "57197897716", "AffiliationID": "60007363", "AffiliationName": "Communication Studies, Northwestern University"}, "7402242870": {"Name": "Reddy M.C.", "AuthorID": "7402242870", "AffiliationID": "60007363", "AffiliationName": "Communication Studies, Northwestern University"}, "55437680000": {"Name": "Davenport A.", "AuthorID": "55437680000", "AffiliationID": "60032819, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL, Dept. of Nephrology, Royal Free Hospital"}, "23668261400": {"Name": "Laboi P.", "AuthorID": "23668261400", "AffiliationID": "112681382", "AffiliationName": "Nephrology York Teaching Hospital"}, "7004087556": {"Name": "Blandford A.", "AuthorID": "7004087556", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Digital Health, University College London"}}}
