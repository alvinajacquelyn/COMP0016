To date, this research area is surprisingly under-explored in the megaproject management literature. The study is based on thirty interviews with innovation champions to capture their own perceptions and narratives on the ways innovation is stimulated and promoted in megaprojects, combined with relevant textual materials. Innovation was commonly defined as a step change or best practice that creates value that could be financial, environmental, societal etc. The data demonstrate the role of CEOs and their collaboration with innovation champions and academic partners in introducing innovation into the vocabulary of megaprojects, developing and formalising innovation strategy, and transferring experiences across megaprojects. The data show the ways different communication channels are used to promote innovations by champions such as forums, portals, platforms, campaigns, events etc.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Championing", "Communication", "Innovation", "Megaprojects", "Promoting"], "IndexKeywords": ["Best practices", "Championing", "Innovation strategy", "Megaprojects", "Promoting", "Step changes"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85053537885", "SubjectAreas": [["Business and International Management", "BUSI", "1403"], ["Management of Technology and Innovation", "BUSI", "1405"]], "AuthorData": {"55218042800": {"Name": "Sergeeva N.", "AuthorID": "55218042800", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "The Bartlett School of Construction & Project Management, University College London"}, "57203919019": {"Name": "Zanello C.", "AuthorID": "57203919019", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "The Bartlett School of Construction & Project Management, University College London"}}}
