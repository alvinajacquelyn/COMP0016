Smears and E. S\u00fcli designed and analyzed a discontinuous Galerkin finite element method for the approximation of solutions to elliptic partial differential equations in nondivergence form. The results were proven, based on the assumption that the computational domain was convex and polytopal. In this paper, we extend this framework, allowing for Lipschitz continuous domains with piecewise curved boundaries.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cordes condition", "curved", "discontinuous Galerkin", "finite element methods", "nondivergence form", "PDEs"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cordes condition", "curved", "Discontinuous galerkin", "Nondivergence form", "PDEs"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85063687413", "SubjectAreas": [["Analysis", "MATH", "2603"], ["Numerical Analysis", "MATH", "2612"], ["Computational Mathematics", "MATH", "2605"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"57208057465": {"Name": "Kawecki E.", "AuthorID": "57208057465", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Mathematical Institute, University of Oxford"}}}
