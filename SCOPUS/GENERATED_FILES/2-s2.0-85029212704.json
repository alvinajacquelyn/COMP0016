All wave load components, including wave-in-deck slamming pressures, were predicted using a commercial computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code STAR-CCMC+ and compared against experimental measurements. Slamming pressures were calculated using both data obtained locally at discrete points and globally averaged over the whole exposed area of the deck. In all simulated cases, the deck area exposed to a wave-slamming event was found to be in contact with a water-air mixture with a significant proportion of air phase. It was concluded that the slamming pressure data for the exposed area provided better insights into the pressure changes due to air compressibility and its content.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Offshore platforms", "Slamming pressure", "Wave-in-deck loads"], "IndexKeywords": ["Air compressibility", "Computational Fluid Dynamics codes", "Extreme wave events", "Hydrodynamic loads", "Numerical investigations", "Off shore platforms", "Slamming pressure", "Wave-in-deck loads"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85029212704", "SubjectAreas": [["Civil and Structural Engineering", "ENGI", "2205"], ["Ocean Engineering", "ENGI", "2212"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"]], "AuthorData": {"56349134200": {"Name": "Abdussamie N.", "AuthorID": "56349134200", "AffiliationID": "60007015, 60015356", "AffiliationName": "Australian Maritime College Search (AMCS), University of Tasmania"}, "21739922600": {"Name": "Ojeda R.", "AuthorID": "21739922600", "AffiliationID": "60007015, 60015356", "AffiliationName": "Australian Maritime College Search (AMCS), University of Tasmania"}, "36084146600": {"Name": "Drobyshevski Y.", "AuthorID": "36084146600", "AffiliationID": "60007015, 60015356", "AffiliationName": "Australian Maritime College Search (AMCS), University of Tasmania"}, "25924671700": {"Name": "Amin W.", "AuthorID": "25924671700", "AffiliationID": "60007015, 60015356", "AffiliationName": "Australian Maritime College Search (AMCS), University of Tasmania"}, "25925551300": {"Name": "Thomas G.", "AuthorID": "25925551300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London (UCL)"}}}
