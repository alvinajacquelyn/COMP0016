To tackle the first problem, we propose a novel 3D Local Shape Context feature extracted from human body silhouette to characterise the local structure of body joints. To tackle the second problem, we incorporate a graphical model into regression forests to exploit structural constrains. Experiments demonstrate that our method can efficiently learn local body structures and localise joints. Compared with the state-of-the-art methods, our method significantly improves the accuracy of pose estimation from depth images.", "AuthorKeywords": ["3D local shape context", "Graphical models", "Pose estimation", "Regression forests"], "IndexKeywords": ["Dependence structures", "GraphicaL model", "Human pose estimations", "Local shape", "Local structure", "Pose estimation", "Regression forests", "State-of-the-art methods"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84935565627", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"], ["Artificial Intelligence", "COMP", "1702"]], "AuthorData": {"57211831575": {"Name": "He L.", "AuthorID": "57211831575", "AffiliationID": "60025278", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University"}, "7407146835": {"Name": "Wang G.", "AuthorID": "7407146835", "AffiliationID": "60025278", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University"}, "7102880275": {"Name": "Liao Q.", "AuthorID": "7102880275", "AffiliationID": "105310906", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic Engineering, Graduate School at Shenzhen, Xili university town"}, "7202881908": {"Name": "Xue J.H.", "AuthorID": "7202881908", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Statistical Science, University College London"}}}
