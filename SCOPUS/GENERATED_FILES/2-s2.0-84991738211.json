Observations of this shadow would provide direct evidence of the existence of astrophysical black holes. Although it is expected that astrophysical black holes are described by the axisymmetric Kerr solution, there also exist many other black hole solutions, both in general relativity and in other theories of gravity, which cannot presently be ruled out. To this end, we present calculations of black hole shadow images from various metric theories of gravity as described by our recent work on a general parametrization of axisymmetric black holes [R. Konoplya, L. Rezzolla, and A. Zhidenko, Phys. Rev. D 93, 064015 (2016).]. An algorithm to perform general ray-tracing calculations for any metric theory of gravity is first outlined and then employed to demonstrate that even for extremal metric deformation parameters of various black hole spacetimes, this parametrization is both robust and rapidly convergent to the correct solution.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84991738211", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (miscellaneous)", "PHYS", "3101"]], "AuthorData": {"55347813900": {"Name": "Younsi Z.", "AuthorID": "55347813900", "AffiliationID": "60007762", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Theoretical Physics, Goethe-University"}, "6602241993": {"Name": "Zhidenko A.", "AuthorID": "6602241993", "AffiliationID": "60001430", "AffiliationName": "Centro de Matem\u00e1tica, Computa\u00e7\u00e3o e Cogni\u00e7\u00e3o, Universidade Federal Do ABC (UFABC)"}, "7003794296": {"Name": "Rezzolla L.", "AuthorID": "7003794296", "AffiliationID": "60083550", "AffiliationName": "Frankfurt Institute for Advanced Studies"}, "6602086169": {"Name": "Konoplya R.", "AuthorID": "6602086169", "AffiliationID": "60007762", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Theoretical Physics, Goethe-University"}, "15070911300": {"Name": "Mizuno Y.", "AuthorID": "15070911300", "AffiliationID": "60007762", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Theoretical Physics, Goethe-University"}}}
