However, it is unclear whether morphological differences correlate with functionality, and this lack of knowledge limits their translational applications. Here, we show that SS-hAFSCs and RS-hAFSCs differ in their neuro-protective ability, demonstrating that a single contralateral injection of SS-hAFSCs into hypoxic-ischemic P7 mice conferred a 47% reduction in hippocampal tissue loss and 43-45% reduction in TUNEL-positive cells in the hippocampus and striatum 48 hours after the insult, decreased microglial activation and TGF\u03b21 levels, and prevented demyelination. On the other hand, RS-hAFSCs failed to show such neuro-protective effects. It is possible that SS-hAFSCs exert their neuroprotection via endoglin-dependent inhibition of TGF\u03b21 signaling in target cells. These findings identify a sub-population of CD117+CD90+CD105+ stem cells as a promising source for the neuro-protection of the developing brain.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Amniotic Fluid", "Animals", "Antigens, CD", "Apoptosis", "Brain Ischemia", "Cell Lineage", "Cell- and Tissue-Based Therapy", "Corpus Striatum", "Demyelinating Diseases", "Disease Models, Animal", "Endoglin", "Gene Expression", "Hippocampus", "Humans", "Hypoxia", "In Situ Nick-End Labeling", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Microglia", "Neuroprotection", "Stem Cell Transplantation", "Stem Cells", "Transforming Growth Factor beta1"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85041669503", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"52463338400": {"Name": "Corcelli M.", "AuthorID": "52463338400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Institute for Women's Health, Maternal and Fetal Medicine Department"}, "57125654700": {"Name": "Hawkins K.", "AuthorID": "57125654700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Institute for Women's Health, Maternal and Fetal Medicine Department"}, "57195215813": {"Name": "Vlahova F.", "AuthorID": "57195215813", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Institute for Women's Health, Maternal and Fetal Medicine Department"}, "57217925766": {"Name": "Hunjan A.", "AuthorID": "57217925766", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Institute for Women's Health, Maternal and Fetal Medicine Department"}, "57200568851": {"Name": "Dowding K.", "AuthorID": "57200568851", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Institute for Women's Health, Maternal and Fetal Medicine Department"}, "7402605276": {"Name": "David A.L.", "AuthorID": "7402605276", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "NIHR University College London Hospitals Biomedical Research Centre, Maple House"}, "7006889522": {"Name": "Peebles D.", "AuthorID": "7006889522", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Institute for Women's Health, Maternal and Fetal Medicine Department"}, "22937760400": {"Name": "Hristova M.", "AuthorID": "22937760400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Institute for Women's Health, Maternal and Fetal Medicine Department"}, "17034676900": {"Name": "Guillot P.V.", "AuthorID": "17034676900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Institute for Women's Health, Maternal and Fetal Medicine Department"}, "57203257829": {"Name": "De Coppi P.", "AuthorID": "57203257829", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Great Ormond Street Institute for Child Health"}, "57203054731": {"Name": "Gressens P.", "AuthorID": "57203054731", "AffiliationID": "60004111, 60177635", "AffiliationName": "King's College London, Department of Perinatal Imaging and Health, St. Thomas' Hospital"}, "7102850024": {"Name": "Hagberg H.", "AuthorID": "7102850024", "AffiliationID": "60027675, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Perinatal Center, Institutes of Clinical Sciences and Neuroscience and Physiology, Sahlgrenska Academy, Gothenburg University"}}}
