We report ECG outcome obtained during the screening period for an HIV vaccine trial. Methods ECG was performed in healthy Tanzanian volunteers. ECG abnormalities and findings interfering with the interpretation of myo/pericarditis were subject to study ineligibility. We determined the prevalence of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) defined by the Sokolow-Lyon (SL) or the Cornell index, ST-elevations and early repolarization (ERP) in association with gender, age, BMI and body height by regression analysis adjusted for gender and age. Results In 257 volunteers (median age 23years, 63% males) overall positivity for LVH defined by SL or Cornell criteria was seen in 20.6% and 3.5%, ST-elevations \u22650.1mV or \u22650.2mV in 77.8% and 38.1%, and ERP in 23.4%. Positive SL criteria were associated with male gender (PR 7.84, p<0.001) and lower age (PR 0.70, p=0.002), and associated with increased body height and lower BMI in univariate analysis. Positive Cornell criteria were only associated with lower age (PR 0.44, p=0.010). ST-elevations \u22650.2mV were associated with male gender (PR 8.05, p<0.001) and lower age (PR 0.81, p=0.003), and ERP with male gender (PR 2.86, p<0.001). Vaccine study ineligibility due to ECG findings was concluded in 22.1% of the screening population. Conclusions High prevalence of LVH according to SL in association with ST-elevation and ERP is especially found in young and male Africans. ECG variations need to be considered for eligibility criteria in studies investigating potential cardiotoxic agents in Africa.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Africa", "Early repolarization", "ECG", "MVA vaccine", "ST-elevation"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85017230646", "SubjectAreas": [["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"56612918300": {"Name": "Mann P.", "AuthorID": "56612918300", "AffiliationID": "60003625", "AffiliationName": "Vaccine and Infectious Disease Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"}, "57203032681": {"Name": "Hoelscher M.", "AuthorID": "57203032681", "AffiliationID": "113978747", "AffiliationName": "German Center for Infection Research (DZIF), Partner site Munich"}, "57189487636": {"Name": "Kroidl A.", "AuthorID": "57189487636", "AffiliationID": "113978747", "AffiliationName": "German Center for Infection Research (DZIF), Partner site Munich"}, "24768182600": {"Name": "Munseri P.", "AuthorID": "24768182600", "AffiliationID": "60091726", "AffiliationName": "Muhimbili University of Health and Allied Sciences (MUHAS)"}, "6506376378": {"Name": "Lwakatare J.", "AuthorID": "6506376378", "AffiliationID": "60091726", "AffiliationName": "Muhimbili University of Health and Allied Sciences (MUHAS)"}, "8354719300": {"Name": "Bakari M.", "AuthorID": "8354719300", "AffiliationID": "60091726", "AffiliationName": "Muhimbili University of Health and Allied Sciences (MUHAS)"}, "56613387600": {"Name": "Missanga M.", "AuthorID": "56613387600", "AffiliationID": "114340800", "AffiliationName": "NIMR Mbeya Medical Research Center (MMRC)"}, "57193867357": {"Name": "Kapesa E.", "AuthorID": "57193867357", "AffiliationID": "114340800", "AffiliationName": "NIMR Mbeya Medical Research Center (MMRC)"}, "6508237830": {"Name": "Maboko L.", "AuthorID": "6508237830", "AffiliationID": "114340800", "AffiliationName": "NIMR Mbeya Medical Research Center (MMRC)"}, "6602663240": {"Name": "Janabi M.", "AuthorID": "6602663240", "AffiliationID": "60071590", "AffiliationName": "Muhimbili National Hospital"}, "7103268631": {"Name": "Robb M.", "AuthorID": "7103268631", "AffiliationID": "60014443", "AffiliationName": "The Henry M.
