We describe the case of a 70-year-old man who developed metastatic lesions within his corpus cavernosum 2 years after being diagnosed and treated for a mucinous adenocarcinoma of the rectum and a year after a wedge resection of an isolated lung metastasis. He proceeded with total penectomy and intraoperatively two skip lesions were also found within the wall of his urethra; histological analysis proved that these were also metastatic lesions. A perineal urethrostomy was formed with the remaining macroscopically healthy urethra. He made a good recovery from his operation and continued his treatment under the oncology team.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adenocarcinoma, Mucinous", "Aged", "Humans", "Male", "Penile Neoplasms", "Rectal Neoplasms", "Time Factors", "Urethral Neoplasms"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84981287944", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"37033467500": {"Name": "Christodoulidou M.", "AuthorID": "37033467500", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, University College London Hospital"}, "56147587200": {"Name": "Sahdev V.", "AuthorID": "56147587200", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, University College London Hospital"}, "24339107700": {"Name": "Muneer A.", "AuthorID": "24339107700", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, University College London Hospital"}, "26667018400": {"Name": "Nigam R.", "AuthorID": "26667018400", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, University College London Hospital"}}}
