In particular, we demonstrate that the localization length of the Anderson modes increases when the width of the Bragg gap decreases, such that in the vanishingly small bandgap limit, namely when a Dirac point is formed, even extremely high levels of disorder are unable to localize the optical modes residing near the Dirac point. A comparative analysis of the key features of the propagation of Anderson modes formed in the Bragg gap or near the Dirac point is also presented. Our findings could provide valuable guidelines in assessing the influence of structural disorder on the functionality of a broad array of optical nanodevices.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84945286864", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"56650469000": {"Name": "Deng H.", "AuthorID": "56650469000", "AffiliationID": "60025084", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory for Laser Plasma, Collaborative Innovation Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University"}, "35239643800": {"Name": "Chen X.", "AuthorID": "35239643800", "AffiliationID": "60025084", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory for Laser Plasma, Collaborative Innovation Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University"}, "23669646100": {"Name": "Ye F.", "AuthorID": "23669646100", "AffiliationID": "60025084", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory for Laser Plasma, Collaborative Innovation Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University"}, "57194699446": {"Name": "Malomed B.A.", "AuthorID": "57194699446", "AffiliationID": "60005681", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physical Electronics, School of Electrical Engineering, Tel Aviv University"}, "7004097868": {"Name": "Panoiu N.C.", "AuthorID": "7004097868", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}}}
