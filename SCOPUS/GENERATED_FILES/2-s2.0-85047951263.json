Approach and Results-Adult participants (n=37 059; age=57.7\u00b111.9 years; 46.8%men) were recruited from general population household-based surveys (Health Survey for England and Scottish Health Survey). Individual participant data were linked with the British National Health Service Central Registry to record mortality. There were 2250 deaths from all causes during 326 016 person-years of follow-up. When compared with the reference category (HDL-C=1.5-1.99 mmol/L), a U-shaped association was apparent for all-cause mortality, with elevated risk in participants with the lowest (hazard ratio=1.23; 95%confidence interval, 1.06, 1.44) and highest (1.25; 0.97, 1.62) HDL-C concentration. Associations for cardiovascular disease were linear, and elevated risk was observed in those with the lowest HDL-C concentration (1.49; 1.15, 1.94). Conclusions-A U-shaped association was observed between HDL-C and mortality in a large general population sample.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cardiovascular diseases", "Cholesterol", "HDL", "HDL", "Health surveys", "Lipoproteins", "Mortality"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Biomarkers", "Cardiovascular Diseases", "Cause of Death", "Cholesterol, HDL", "Dyslipidemias", "England", "Female", "Health Surveys", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Registries", "Risk Assessment", "Risk Factors", "Scotland", "Time Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85047951263", "SubjectAreas": [["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"8502496600": {"Name": "Hamer M.", "AuthorID": "8502496600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "9844699900": {"Name": "O'Donovan G.", "AuthorID": "9844699900", "AffiliationID": "60000891, 60183204", "AffiliationName": "National Centre for Sport and Exercise Medicine-East Midlands, Loughborough University, School of Sport, Exercise, and Health Sciences"}, "55847987800": {"Name": "Stamatakis E.", "AuthorID": "55847987800", "AffiliationID": "60025709", "AffiliationName": "Charles Perkins Centre, Prevention Research Collaboration, School of Public Health, University of Sydney"}}}
