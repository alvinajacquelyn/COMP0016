These include RNA interference and anti-sense oligonucleotides, both of which act at the post-transcriptional level, and genome-editing techniques, which aim to repair the responsible mutant gene. All serve to inhibit the expression of disease-causing proteins, leading to the potential prevention or even reversal of the disease phenotype. In this review we summarise the main developments in gene suppression strategies, using examples from Huntington's disease and other inherited causes of neurodegeneration, and explore how these might illuminate a path to tackle other proteinopathy-associated dementias in the future.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Anti-sense oligonucleotides", "CRISPR/Cas9", "Dementia", "Gene suppression", "Huntington's disease", "RNA interference", "Therapeutics", "Zinc-finger proteins"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Genetic Therapy", "Humans", "Neurodegenerative Diseases"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85030669111", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"]], "AuthorData": {"56825117700": {"Name": "Ghosh R.", "AuthorID": "56825117700", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL, Huntington's Disease Centre, Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "7006745684": {"Name": "Tabrizi S.", "AuthorID": "7006745684", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL, Huntington's Disease Centre, Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, UCL Institute of Neurology"}}}
