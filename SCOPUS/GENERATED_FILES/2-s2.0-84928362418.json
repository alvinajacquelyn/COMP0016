All rights reserved.Abstract Background Aphasia is an important stroke sequel that impacts negatively on the HQoL of stroke patients. Although a number of stroke patients with aphasia will have good functional recovery, many are left with language deficits. Method Papers were identified through PubMed and MEDLINE search, with keywords such as: 'stroke', 'aphasia', 'post-stroke aphasia', 'factors that predict aphasia recovery', 'aphasia outcomes' and 'aphasia prognosis'. Results The most important factors that determine recovery are the lesion location and size, aphasia type and severity and to some extent the nature of early haemodynamic response, and treatment received. Anagraphic factors like gender, age, handedness and education have not been found to be robust predictors of recovery. Conclusions Predicting post-stroke aphasia recovery is difficult, because of the interplay between lesion, anagraphic, and treatment-related factors, in addition to the role of neuroplasticity.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Aphasia", "Language", "Neuroplasticity", "Predictors", "Recovery", "Stroke"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aphasia", "Brain", "Humans", "Language", "Prognosis", "Recovery of Function", "Severity of Illness Index", "Stroke"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84928362418", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"40561981800": {"Name": "Watila M.", "AuthorID": "40561981800", "AffiliationID": "60013763", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, University of Maiduguri Teaching Hospital"}, "56604355000": {"Name": "Balarabe B.", "AuthorID": "56604355000", "AffiliationID": "60032480", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Usman DanFodio University Teaching Hospital"}}}
