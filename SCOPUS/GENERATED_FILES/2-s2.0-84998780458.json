All rights reserved.Importance Mutations in phototransduction and retinal signaling genes are implicated in many retinopathies. To our knowledge, GNB3 encoding the G-protein \u03b2 subunit 3 (G\u03b23) has not previously been implicated in human disease. OBSERVATIONS In this brief report, whole-exome sequencing was conducted on a patient with distinct inherited retinal disease presenting in childhood, with a phenotype characterized by nystagmus, normal retinal examination, and mild disturbance of the central macula on detailed retinal imaging. This sequencing revealed a homozygous GNB3 nonsense mutation (c.124C>T; p.Arg42Ter). Whole-exome sequencing was conducted from April 2015 to July 2015. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Expressed in cone photoreceptors and ON-bipolar cells, G\u03b23 is essential in phototransduction and ON-bipolar cell signaling. Knockout of Gnb3 in mice results in dysfunction of cone photoreceptors and ON-bipolar cells and a naturally occurring chicken mutation leads to retinal degeneration. Identification of further affected patients may allow description of the phenotypic and genotypic spectrum of disease associated with GNB3 retinopathy.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Child", "Codon, Nonsense", "DNA", "DNA Mutational Analysis", "Electroretinography", "Genes, Recessive", "Genotype", "Heterotrimeric GTP-Binding Proteins", "Humans", "Male", "Pedigree", "Retina", "Retinal Diseases", "Tomography, Optical Coherence"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84998780458", "SubjectAreas": [["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"]], "AuthorData": {"6508145987": {"Name": "Arno G.", "AuthorID": "6508145987", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "7102202117": {"Name": "Holder G.E.", "AuthorID": "7102202117", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "11438905600": {"Name": "Chakarova C.", "AuthorID": "11438905600", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "34881748700": {"Name": "Fiorentino A.", "AuthorID": "34881748700", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "57204676942": {"Name": "Cheetham M.E.", "AuthorID": "57204676942", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "57197636332": {"Name": "Hardcastle A.J.", "AuthorID": "57197636332", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "7202946936": {"Name": "Webster A.R.", "AuthorID": "7202946936", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "7101991490": {"Name": "Michaelides M.", "AuthorID": "7101991490", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "7102175423": {"Name": "Kohl S.", "AuthorID": "7102175423", "AffiliationID": "60017246", "AffiliationName": "Molecular Genetics Laboratory, Institute for Ophthalmic Research, Centre for Ophthalmology, University of Tuebingen"}, "37665820900": {"Name": "Pontikos N.", "AuthorID": "37665820900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London Genetics Institute"}, "16402494600": {"Name": "Plagnol V.", "AuthorID": "16402494600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London Genetics Institute"}}}
