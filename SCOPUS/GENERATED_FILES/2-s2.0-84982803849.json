The Mozambique Channel (SW Indian Ocean) is characterized by several flat-topped seamounts ranging from 11\u00b0S to 21\u00b0S in latitudes. Based on a comprehensive geomorphologic study and on dredged samples analysis, we show that these features correspond to tropical isolated shallow-water carbonate platforms. Coupling strontium isotopy and foraminifera biostratigraphy, well-constrained chronostratigraphy results indicate that shallow-water carbonate production started in the Mozambique Channel during distinct Cenozoic periods ranging from Paleocene to Early Miocene. Our data also demonstrate that these carbonate platforms were subsequently characterized by different evolutions locally marked by tectonic and rejuvenated volcanism. While some of them kept developed until present days, forming modern carbonate systems, some others were drowned during Late Neogene and subsided to form guyots. Although different factors can be discussed, tectonic and volcanism appear as good potential triggers for demise episodes during Late Miocene-Early Pliocene times. Chronology and location of this geodynamical activity tend to emphasize influence of East African rift system until southern Mozambique Channel.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Carbonate platform", "Cenozoic", "Drowning", "East African rift system", "Mozambique Channel"], "IndexKeywords": ["Carbonate platforms", "Cenozoic", "Drowning", "East African Rift", "Mozambique channels"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84982803849", "SubjectAreas": [["Oceanography", "EART", "1910"], ["Geology", "EART", "1907"], ["Geochemistry and Petrology", "EART", "1906"]], "AuthorData": {"56994002300": {"Name": "Courgeon S.", "AuthorID": "56994002300", "AffiliationID": "60019839", "AffiliationName": "IFREMER, Institut Carnot Edrome, Unit\u00e9 G\u00e9osciences Marines"}, "6701410958": {"Name": "Camoin G.", "AuthorID": "6701410958", "AffiliationID": "60102127, 60028993, 60008134, 60012012", "AffiliationName": "Aix-Marseille Universit\u00e9, CNRS, IRD, CEREGE UM34"}, "6602761796": {"Name": "Borgomano J.", "AuthorID": "6602761796", "AffiliationID": "60102127, 60028993, 60008134, 60012012", "AffiliationName": "Aix-Marseille Universit\u00e9, CNRS, IRD, CEREGE UM34"}, "7801631984": {"Name": "Jorry S.", "AuthorID": "7801631984", "AffiliationID": "60019839", "AffiliationName": "IFREMER, Institut Carnot Edrome, Unit\u00e9 G\u00e9osciences Marines"}, "15080763100": {"Name": "Jouet G.", "AuthorID": "15080763100", "AffiliationID": "60019839", "AffiliationName": "IFREMER, Institut Carnot Edrome, Unit\u00e9 G\u00e9osciences Marines"}, "22836604100": {"Name": "Pelleter E.", "AuthorID": "22836604100", "AffiliationID": "60019839", "AffiliationName": "IFREMER, Institut Carnot Edrome, Unit\u00e9 G\u00e9osciences Marines"}, "6603431289": {"Name": "BouDagher-Fadel M.", "AuthorID": "6603431289", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Earth Science"}, "56618988500": {"Name": "R\u00e9villon S.", "AuthorID": "56618988500", "AffiliationID": "60105671, 60026314", "AffiliationName": "SEDISOR/UMR 6538, Laboratoire Domaines Oc\u00e9aniques, IUEM"}, "55879333700": {"Name": "Bach\u00e8lery P.", "AuthorID": "55879333700", "AffiliationID": "60101368", "AffiliationName": "Laboratoire Magmas et Volcans, Observatoire de Physique du Globe de Clermont-Ferrand"}, "7005107085": {"Name": "Poli E.", "AuthorID": "7005107085", "AffiliationID": "60015295, 60014309", "AffiliationName": "TOTAL Exploration and Production, CSTJF"}, "6701787124": {"Name": "Droxler A.", "AuthorID": "6701787124", "AffiliationID": "60005286", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Science, Rice University"}}}
