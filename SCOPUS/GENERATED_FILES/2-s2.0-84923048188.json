A number of different approaches have been established to isolate, identify and quantify phosphorylated proteins and peptides. In the current report, a comparison between SCX prefractionation versus an antibody based approach, both coupled to TiO2 enrichment and applied to TMT labelled cellular lysates, is described. The antibody strategy was more complete for enriching phosphopeptides and allowed the identification of a large set of proteins known to be phosphorylated (715 protein groups) with a minimum number of not previously known phosphorylated proteins (2).", "AuthorKeywords": ["Peptides immunoprecipitation", "Phosphopeptides enrichment", "Titanium dioxide", "TMT"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84923048188", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"]], "AuthorData": {"56519569000": {"Name": "Lombardi B.", "AuthorID": "56519569000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Proteomics and Molecular Cell Dynamics, Center for Nephrology, School of Life and Medical Sciences, University College London"}, "56519242300": {"Name": "Zimmermann J.G.", "AuthorID": "56519242300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Proteomics and Molecular Cell Dynamics, Center for Nephrology, School of Life and Medical Sciences, University College London"}, "57218199523": {"Name": "Rendell N.", "AuthorID": "57218199523", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Wolfson Drug Discovery Unit, Centre for Amyloidosis and Acute Phase Proteins, Division of Medicine, University College London"}, "7402850232": {"Name": "Edwards M.", "AuthorID": "7402850232", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, Division of Biosciences, University College London"}, "7102317240": {"Name": "Katan M.", "AuthorID": "7102317240", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, Division of Biosciences, University College London"}}}
