All rights reserved.Radar backscatter from the sea-surface is typically non-stationary and may contain sea-spikes which resemble targets and can cause false detections in a radar system. To improve detection performance, this paper investigates a technique based on stationary wavelet transforms (SWT) and demonstrates its performance on both monostatic and bistatic sea-clutter data. By exploiting the different components (sub-bands) of the SWT decomposition, this technique can better distinguish between the different spectral components of the returned signal. The detection performance is measured by Monte Carlo simulation with a cell averaging constant false alarm rate (CA-CFAR) detector. The most appropriate choice of sub-band is selected using an a entropy based metric.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bistatic radar", "Detection", "Sea clutter", "Wavelets"], "IndexKeywords": ["Bistatic radars", "Constant false alarm rate", "Detection performance", "Radar backscatter", "Sea clutters", "Spectral components", "Stationary wavelet transforms", "Wavelets"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85048653677", "SubjectAreas": [["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"56736534200": {"Name": "Duk V.", "AuthorID": "56736534200", "AffiliationID": "60009512", "AffiliationName": "University of Adelaide"}, "9840409300": {"Name": "Rosenberg L.", "AuthorID": "9840409300", "AffiliationID": "113782282", "AffiliationName": "Defence Science and Technology Group"}, "55531018200": {"Name": "Ng B.", "AuthorID": "55531018200", "AffiliationID": "60009512", "AffiliationName": "University of Adelaide"}, "36186273500": {"Name": "Ritchie M.", "AuthorID": "36186273500", "AffiliationID": "60026242", "AffiliationName": "Defence Science and Technology Laboratory"}, "56178590100": {"Name": "Palama R.", "AuthorID": "56178590100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "56448054200": {"Name": "Griffiths H.", "AuthorID": "56448054200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
