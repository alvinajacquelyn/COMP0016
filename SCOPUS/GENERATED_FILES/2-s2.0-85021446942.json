However, reports of serious adverse events including a number of patient deaths have raised concerns about safety of this treatment. Presently available preclinical models are not designed for predicting toxicities seen in human patients. Besides choosing the right animal model, careful considerations must be taken in chimeric antigen receptor T-cell design and the amount of T cells infused. The development of more sophisticated in vitro models and humanized mouse models for preclinical modeling and toxicity tests will help us to improve the design of clinical trials in cancer immunotherapy.", "AuthorKeywords": ["cancer immunotherapy", "CAR", "CD19", "chimeric antigen receptor T cell", "humanized mouse models", "organoids", "preclinical models"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Humans", "Immunotherapy", "Lymphocyte Transfusion", "Mice", "Neoplasms, Experimental", "Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell", "Recombinant Fusion Proteins", "T-Lymphocytes"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85021446942", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"], ["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"]], "AuthorData": {"56652536900": {"Name": "Wegner A.", "AuthorID": "56652536900", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60032819", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Immunity and Transplantation, University College London, Royal Free Hospital"}}}
