All rights reserved.Imidazole anchored onto a silica matrix, by means of a propyl linkage, is found to be an effective heterogeneous catalyst for the synthesis of cyclic carbonates from epoxides and CO2 in near quantitative yield. The versatility of this catalyst is demonstrated by using different substrates (epichlorohydrin, propylene oxide, butylene oxide and styrene oxide) for this cycloaddition reaction. These CO2 insertion reactions were typically carried out in the temperature range of 343 to 403 K at 0.6 MPa CO2 pressure under solvent-free conditions. Several spectroscopic methods were used to characterize the catalyst and study the integrity of the fresh and spent catalysts.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Anchored imidazole", "CO2 utilization", "Cyclic carbonates", "Epoxides"], "IndexKeywords": ["Anchored imidazole", "Cyclic carbonates", "Cycloaddition reaction", "Different substrates", "Epoxides", "Heterogeneous catalyst", "Solvent free conditions", "Synthesis of cyclic carbonates"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84910140398", "SubjectAreas": [["Catalysis", "CENG", "1503"], ["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Process Chemistry and Technology", "CENG", "1508"]], "AuthorData": {"6701530392": {"Name": "Sankar M.", "AuthorID": "6701530392", "AffiliationID": "60012548", "AffiliationName": "Catalysis and Inorganic Chemistry Division, National Chemical Laboratory"}, "55767788400": {"Name": "Manikandan P.", "AuthorID": "55767788400", "AffiliationID": "118017071", "AffiliationName": "SABIC Technology Centre"}, "6602749484": {"Name": "Ajithkumar T.G.", "AuthorID": "6602749484", "AffiliationID": "60012548", "AffiliationName": "Central NMR Facility, National Chemical Laboratory"}, "7006847733": {"Name": "Sankar G.", "AuthorID": "7006847733", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}}}
