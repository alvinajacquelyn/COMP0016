Many causes of IP have been identified including haematological dyscrasias (particularly, sickle cell disease), drugs and rarely malignancy. There are also a large proportion of men, in which no aetiology is identified. Identification of men at risk for malignancy provides a diagnostic challenge to the clinicians looking after these patients. All cases of IP between 2007 and 2017 at a single tertiary andrology unit were identified. The case notes and electronic records of these patients were reviewed to identify cases of malignant priapism. Men with idiopathic IP were used as a control group for comparative statistics. In total, 412 men with IP were identified, 202 of which had idiopathic IP. Within this group, the prevalence of malignant priapism was 3.5% (n = 11). MP secondary to local invasion or penile metastases occurred in seven of the 11 men (bladder \u00d7 3, prostate, lung, urethral and chondrosarcoma of the pelvis). MP secondary to haematological malignancy occurred in the remaining four (chronic myeloid leukaemia \u00d7 2, chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, and myelodysplasia). IP was the initial presentation of malignancy in seven of the patients (64%). An abnormally low haemoglobin value (reference range 130\u2013180 g/dl) was found in 82% (n = 9) of the men with MP. The mean haemoglobin value in men with MP was 109.64 \u00b1 20.30 g/dl compared to the control of 131.87 \u00b1 g/dl. This difference was considered highly significant p = 0.0046. Men with MP also appear to have a very poor prognosis with an 18-month mortality of 64% (n = 7). Malignancy is a rare and important cause of IP. A low haemoglobin is a predictor of malignancy and warrants further investigation in IP.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Neoplasms", "Penis", "Priapism", "Retrospective Studies", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85064560035", "SubjectAreas": [["Urology", "MEDI", "2748"]], "AuthorData": {"57208339956": {"Name": "James Johnson M.", "AuthorID": "57208339956", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Andrology Department, University College"}, "57200331762": {"Name": "Hallerstrom M.", "AuthorID": "57200331762", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Andrology Department, University College"}, "35092062900": {"Name": "Alnajjar H.M.", "AuthorID": "35092062900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Andrology Department, University College"}, "57208342567": {"Name": "Frederick Johnson T.", "AuthorID": "57208342567", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Andrology Department, University College"}, "21934918700": {"Name": "Skrodzka M.", "AuthorID": "21934918700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Andrology Department, University College"}, "36956127200": {"Name": "Chiriaco G.", "AuthorID": "36956127200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Andrology Department, University College"}, "24339107700": {"Name": "Muneer A.", "AuthorID": "24339107700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Andrology Department, University College"}, "57203079224": {"Name": "Ralph D.J.", "AuthorID": "57203079224", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Andrology Department, University College"}}}
