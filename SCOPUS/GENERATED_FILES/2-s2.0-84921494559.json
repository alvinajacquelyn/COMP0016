To estimate the critical duration of temporal summation for achromatic Goldmann III stimuli under the conditions of standard automated perimetry (SAP) and quantify response variability for short-duration stimuli.Methods. Contrast thresholds were gathered using the method of constant stimuli for seven circular (0.48\u00b0 diameter) incremental stimuli of varying duration (sum-of-frames equivalent: 8.3\u2013198.3 ms), at an eccentricity of 8.8\u00b0 along the four principal meridians of the visual field in two healthy, psychophysically experienced observers. Stimuli were presented on a highresolution cathode ray tube display with a background luminance of 10 cd/m2. Psychometric functions were fitted using a probit model and nonparametric local-linear analysis. The critical duration was estimated using iterative two-phase regression analysis, the results also being compared with values produced using previously published methods of analysis.Results. The median critical duration estimated using iterative two-phase regression analysis was 27.7 ms (IQR 22.5\u201329.8). A slight steepening of the psychometric function slope (lower variability) was observed for longer stimulus durations, using both probit and local-linear analysis techniques, but this was not statistically significant.Conclusions:. Critical duration estimates in this study are substantially shorter than those previously reported for a Goldmann III stimulus, under the conditions of SAP. Further work is required to firmly establish the relationship between measurement variability and the degree of local temporal and spatial summation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Measurement variability", "Perimetry", "Temporal summation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Photic Stimulation", "Psychophysics", "Reference Values", "Sensory Thresholds", "Visual Field Tests", "Visual Fields", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84921494559", "SubjectAreas": [["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"], ["Sensory Systems", "NEUR", "2809"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"]], "AuthorData": {"55849337400": {"Name": "Mulholland P.J.", "AuthorID": "55849337400", "AffiliationID": "60020730", "AffiliationName": "Vision Science Research Group, School of Biomedical Sciences, University of Ulster"}, "7004460319": {"Name": "Garway-Heath D.F.", "AuthorID": "7004460319", "AffiliationID": "60016691, 60172638, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Biomedical Research Centre at Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "7406489589": {"Name": "Anderson R.S.", "AuthorID": "7406489589", "AffiliationID": "60020730", "AffiliationName": "Vision Science Research Group, School of Biomedical Sciences, University of Ulster"}, "31367573000": {"Name": "Redmond T.", "AuthorID": "31367573000", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "School of Optometry and Vision Sciences, Cardiff University"}}}
