Autonomic dysfunction has been reported in animal models and in several patients with types I and III SMA, these findings raising the question whether heart rate should be routinely investigated in all SMA patients. The aim of our study was to detect possible signs of autonomic dysfunction and, more generally, of cardiac involvement in types II and III SMA. Patients and Methods We retrospectively reviewed 24-hour electrocardiography (ECG) in 157 types II and III SMA patients (age range, 2-74 years). Of them, 82 also had echocardiography. Results None of the patients had signs of bradycardia, atrial fibrillation, or the other previously reported rhythm disturbances regardless of the age at examination or the type of SMA. Echocardiography was also normal. There were no signs of congenital cardiac defects with the exception of one patient with a history of ventricular septal defects. Conclusions Our results suggest that cardiac abnormalities are not common in type II and type III SMA. These findings provide no evidence to support a more accurate cardiac surveillance or changes in the existing standards of care.", "AuthorKeywords": ["cardiac function", "SMA", "standard of care"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Cohort Studies", "Electrocardiography", "Female", "Heart Diseases", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Spinal Muscular Atrophies of Childhood", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84929331745", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"14318972600": {"Name": "Bianco F.", "AuthorID": "14318972600", "AffiliationID": "60031984", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Neurology, Catholic University"}, "9244356700": {"Name": "Pane M.", "AuthorID": "9244356700", "AffiliationID": "60031984", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Neurology, Catholic University"}, "7004831940": {"Name": "Delogu A.B.", "AuthorID": "7004831940", "AffiliationID": "60031984", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Neurology, Catholic University"}, "55177172900": {"Name": "Pera M.C.", "AuthorID": "55177172900", "AffiliationID": "60031984", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Neurology, Catholic University"}, "57211220608": {"Name": "Mercuri E.", "AuthorID": "57211220608", "AffiliationID": "60031984", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Neurology, Catholic University"}, "55198550500": {"Name": "D'Amico A.", "AuthorID": "55198550500", "AffiliationID": "60017905", "AffiliationName": "Department of Laboratory Medicine, Unit of Molecular Medicine, Bambino Ges\u00f9 Hospital"}, "57204849414": {"Name": "Bertini E.", "AuthorID": "57204849414", "AffiliationID": "60017905", "AffiliationName": "Department of Laboratory Medicine, Unit of Molecular Medicine, Bambino Ges\u00f9 Hospital"}, "7006270325": {"Name": "Messina S.", "AuthorID": "7006270325", "AffiliationID": "60011576", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurosciences, Psychiatry and Anaesthesiology, University of Messina"}, "36477902800": {"Name": "Vita G.", "AuthorID": "36477902800", "AffiliationID": "60011576", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurosciences, Psychiatry and Anaesthesiology, University of Messina"}, "7005265173": {"Name": "Morandi L.", "AuthorID": "7005265173", "AffiliationID": "60017275", "AffiliationName": "Department of Myopathology and Neuroimmunolgy, Pediatric Neurology and Neuroradiology Units, Neurological Institute C.
