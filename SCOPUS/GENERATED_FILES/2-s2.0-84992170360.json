However, local contexts in low- and middle-income countries are very different from those in developed countries, and findings about the effectiveness of school inspections from Western studies are therefore not easily transferable to low- and middle-income countries. Existing literature portrays complex and varied links amongst governance context, policy, design of accountability systems, mechanisms of impact and school outcomes that make translation of conditions across studies challenging. This paper presents the results of a systematic review about the conditions under which school inspections lead to improvement in schools and to positive learning outcomes for schoolchildren in low- and middle-income countries, especially the poorest and most marginalised.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Accountability", "collaborative arrangements", "educational networks", "evaluation", "inspections", "multi-academy trusts"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84992170360", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"]], "AuthorData": {"8283638900": {"Name": "Ehren M.", "AuthorID": "8283638900", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Education, University College London"}, "36772734900": {"Name": "Eddy-Spicer D.", "AuthorID": "36772734900", "AffiliationID": "60021918", "AffiliationName": "University of Virginia"}, "55321437800": {"Name": "Bangpan M.", "AuthorID": "55321437800", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Education, University College London"}, "57191633276": {"Name": "Reid A.", "AuthorID": "57191633276", "AffiliationID": "113983723", "AffiliationName": "Independent consultant"}}}
