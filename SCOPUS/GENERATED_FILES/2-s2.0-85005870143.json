The report advocates a procedure for evaluation of forensic evidence that is a two-stage procedure in which the first stage is \u201cmatch\u201d/\u201cnon-match\u201d and the second stage is empirical assessment of sensitivity (correct acceptance) and false alarm (false acceptance) rates. Almost always, quantitative data from feature-comparison methods are continuously-valued and have within-source variability. We explain why a two-stage procedure is not appropriate for this type of data, and recommend use of statistical procedures which are appropriate.", "AuthorKeywords": ["False alarm", "Forensic statistics", "Likelihood ratio", "Match/non-match", "PCAST report", "Sensitivity"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85005870143", "SubjectAreas": [["Pathology and Forensic Medicine", "MEDI", "2734"]], "AuthorData": {"12778143300": {"Name": "Morrison G.S.", "AuthorID": "12778143300", "AffiliationID": "60159478", "AffiliationName": "Simons Foundation Visiting Fellow, Isaac Newton Institute for Mathematical Sciences"}, "7102512463": {"Name": "Kaye D.H.", "AuthorID": "7102512463", "AffiliationID": "60003892", "AffiliationName": "Regents\u2019 Professor Emeritus, Arizona State University College of Law and Department of Life Sciences"}, "7004169857": {"Name": "Balding D.J.", "AuthorID": "7004169857", "AffiliationID": "60118644, 60026553", "AffiliationName": "Professor of Statistical Genetics, Centre for Systems Genomics, School of Biomedical Sciences, School of Mathematics & Statistics, University of Melbourne"}, "57220940813": {"Name": "Taylor D.", "AuthorID": "57220940813", "AffiliationID": "60020828", "AffiliationName": "Associate Professor of Biology, School of Biological Sciences, Flinders University"}, "53872479400": {"Name": "Dawid P.", "AuthorID": "53872479400", "AffiliationID": "60119937, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Emeritus Professor of Statistics, Department of Pure Mathematics and Mathematical Statistics, University of Cambridge"}, "7004998506": {"Name": "Aitken C.G.G.", "AuthorID": "7004998506", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "Professor of Forensic Statistics, School of Mathematics, University of Edinburgh"}, "35762867100": {"Name": "Gittelson S.", "AuthorID": "35762867100", "AffiliationID": "60023053", "AffiliationName": "Forensic Statistician, Statistical Engineering Division, National Institute of Standards and Technology"}, "6603075450": {"Name": "Zadora G.", "AuthorID": "6603075450", "AffiliationID": "60006225", "AffiliationName": "Senior Lecturer, Chemometric Research Group, Institute of Chemistry, University of Silesia in Katowice"}, "7201834449": {"Name": "Robertson B.", "AuthorID": "7201834449", "AffiliationID": "102021099", "AffiliationName": "Barrister"}, "7103267465": {"Name": "Willis S.", "AuthorID": "7103267465", "AffiliationID": "60027891", "AffiliationName": "Director General, Forensic Science Ireland"}, "7102696741": {"Name": "Pope S.", "AuthorID": "7102696741", "AffiliationID": "117842066", "AffiliationName": "Independent Consultant, DNA Principal Forensics Ltd."}, "56211655200": {"Name": "Neil M.", "AuthorID": "56211655200", "AffiliationID": "60022109", "AffiliationName": "Professor of Computer Science and Statistics, Risk Assessment and Decision Analysis Research Group, Department of Computer Science, Queen Mary, University of London"}, "24437449400": {"Name": "Martire K.A.", "AuthorID": "24437449400", "AffiliationID": "60028333", "AffiliationName": "ARC DECRA Fellow & Senior Lecturer, School of Psychology, University of New South Wales"}, "14622391700": {"Name": "Hepler A.", "AuthorID": "14622391700", "AffiliationID": "106378989", "AffiliationName": "Senior Analyst, Innovative Decisions, Inc."}, "7201801743": {"Name": "Gill R.D.", "AuthorID": "7201801743", "AffiliationID": "60019816", "AffiliationName": "Professor of Mathematical Probability, Department of Mathematics, Leiden University"}, "7101999747": {"Name": "Jamieson A.", "AuthorID": "7101999747", "AffiliationID": "117643191", "AffiliationName": "Director and Consultant Scientist, The Forensic Institute"}, "56037205000": {"Name": "de Zoete J.", "AuthorID": "56037205000", "AffiliationID": "60002483", "AffiliationName": "PhD Candidate (ABD), Department of Mathematics, University of Amsterdam"}, "35485088400": {"Name": "Ostrum R.B.", "AuthorID": "35485088400", "AffiliationID": "100624460", "AffiliationName": "Senior Forensic Document Examiner, Forensic Document Examination Section, Science and Engineering Directorate, Canada Border Services Agency"}, "55135354800": {"Name": "Caliebe A.", "AuthorID": "55135354800", "AffiliationID": "60012345", "AffiliationName": "Forensic Statistician, Institute of Medical Informatics and Statistics, Kiel University"}}}
