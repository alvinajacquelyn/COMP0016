We prove that finite divisibility of stochastic matrices is an NP-complete problem, and extend this result to nonnegative matrices, and completely-positive trace-preserving maps, i.e. the quantum analogue of stochastic matrices. We further prove a complexity hierarchy for the divisibility and decomposability of probability distributions, showing that finite distribution divisibility is in P, but decomposability is NP-hard. For the former, we give an explicit polynomial-time algorithm. All results on distributions extend to weak-membership formulations, proving that the complexity of these problems is robust to perturbations.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Complexity theory", "cptpmaps", "Decomposability", "Divisibility", "Probability distributions", "Stochastic matrices"], "IndexKeywords": ["Complexity theory", "cptpmaps", "Decomposability", "Divisibility", "Stochastic matrices"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84964008570", "SubjectAreas": [["Algebra and Number Theory", "MATH", "2602"], ["Numerical Analysis", "MATH", "2612"], ["Geometry and Topology", "MATH", "2608"], ["Discrete Mathematics and Combinatorics", "MATH", "2607"]], "AuthorData": {"55949605100": {"Name": "Bausch J.", "AuthorID": "55949605100", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "DAMTP, Centre for Mathematical Sciences, University of Cambridge"}, "23768101300": {"Name": "Cubitt T.", "AuthorID": "23768101300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}}}
