In this work, we present a generalized and extended formulation of the boundary shift integral (gBSI) using probabilistic segmentations to estimate anatomic changes between 2 time points. This method adaptively estimates a non-binary exclusive OR region of interest from probabilistic brain segmentations of the baseline and repeat scans to better localize and capture the brain atrophy. We evaluate the proposed method by comparing the sample size requirements for a hypothetical clinical trial of Alzheimer's disease to that needed for the current implementation of BSI as well as a fuzzy implementation of BSI. The gBSI method results in a modest but reduced sample size, providing increased sensitivity to disease changes through the use of the probabilistic exclusive OR region.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alzheimer's disease", "Biomarker", "Boundary shift integral", "Clinical trials", "MRI"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Alzheimer Disease", "Atrophy", "Brain", "Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Neuroimaging"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84916613996", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Aging", "BIOC", "1302"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Developmental Biology", "BIOC", "1309"], ["Geriatrics and Gerontology", "MEDI", "2717"]], "AuthorData": {"57193550334": {"Name": "Prados F.", "AuthorID": "57193550334", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "NMR Research Unit, Queen Square MS Centre, Department of Neuroinflammation, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "57204636980": {"Name": "Cardoso M.J.", "AuthorID": "57204636980", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Image Computing (CMIC), Department of Medical Physics and Bioengineering, University College London"}, "56410615100": {"Name": "Cash D.M.", "AuthorID": "56410615100", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dementia Research Centre, Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "24376919100": {"Name": "Modat M.", "AuthorID": "24376919100", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dementia Research Centre, Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "6602233595": {"Name": "Ourselin S.", "AuthorID": "6602233595", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dementia Research Centre, Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "6602501665": {"Name": "Wheeler-Kingshott C.A.M.", "AuthorID": "6602501665", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "NMR Research Unit, Queen Square MS Centre, Department of Neuroinflammation, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "35275217400": {"Name": "Leung K.K.", "AuthorID": "35275217400", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dementia Research Centre, Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "7201444328": {"Name": "Fox N.C.", "AuthorID": "7201444328", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dementia Research Centre, Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "null": {"Name": null, "AuthorID": null, "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
