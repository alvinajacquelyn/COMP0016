Dysfunction in the cholinergic system has been described in a number of neuropsychiatric disorders. Levels of brain acetylcholine can be pharmacologically manipulated, but it is not possible to directly measure it in vivo in humans. However, key parts of its biochemical cascade in neural tissue, such as choline, can be measured using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). There is evidence that levels of choline may be an indirect but proportional measure of acetylcholine availability in brain tissue. In this study, we measured relative choline levels in the parietal cortex using functional (event-related) MRS (fMRS) during performance of a visuospatial attention task, with a modelling approach verified using simulated data. We describe a task-driven interaction effect on choline concentration, specifically driven by contralateral attention shifts. Our results suggest that choline MRS has the potential to serve as a proxy of brain acetylcholine function in humans.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Acetylcholine", "Adolescent", "Adult", "Analysis of Variance", "Attention", "Choline", "Female", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy", "Male", "Neurochemistry", "Parietal Lobe", "Photic Stimulation", "Space Perception", "Time Factors", "Visual Perception", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85012164060", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"57220523131": {"Name": "Lindner M.", "AuthorID": "57220523131", "AffiliationID": "60012197", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Integrative Neuroscience and Neurodynamics, School of Psychology and Clinical Language Sciences, University of Reading"}, "57193265879": {"Name": "Bell T.", "AuthorID": "57193265879", "AffiliationID": "60012197", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Integrative Neuroscience and Neurodynamics, School of Psychology and Clinical Language Sciences, University of Reading"}, "57193266586": {"Name": "Iqbal S.", "AuthorID": "57193266586", "AffiliationID": "60012197", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Integrative Neuroscience and Neurodynamics, School of Psychology and Clinical Language Sciences, University of Reading"}, "6506130967": {"Name": "Christakou A.", "AuthorID": "6506130967", "AffiliationID": "60012197", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Integrative Neuroscience and Neurodynamics, School of Psychology and Clinical Language Sciences, University of Reading"}, "7101838253": {"Name": "Mullins P.G.", "AuthorID": "7101838253", "AffiliationID": "60025779", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, Bangor University"}}}
