One of the interesting features of the Lambek calculus is the so-called \u201cLambek\u2019s restriction,\u201d that is, the antecedent of any provable sequent should be non-empty. In this paper we discuss ways of extending the Lambek calculus with the linear logic exponential modality while keeping Lambek\u2019s restriction. We present several versions of the Lambek calculus extended with exponential modalities and prove that those extensions are undecidable, even if we take only one of the two divisions provided by the Lambek calculus.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Exponential modalities", "Lambek calculus", "Lambek\u2019s restriction", "Linear logic", "Undecidability"], "IndexKeywords": ["Exponential modalities", "Intuitionistic linear logic", "Lambek calculus", "Linear logic", "Non-commutative", "Undecidability"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84952845823", "SubjectAreas": [["Theoretical Computer Science", "MATH", "2614"], ["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"]], "AuthorData": {"56117921300": {"Name": "Kanovich M.", "AuthorID": "56117921300", "AffiliationID": "60020513", "AffiliationName": "National Research University Higher School of Economics"}, "6701808416": {"Name": "Scedrov A.", "AuthorID": "6701808416", "AffiliationID": "60006297", "AffiliationName": "University of Pennsylvania"}, "54914981600": {"Name": "Kuznetsov S.", "AuthorID": "54914981600", "AffiliationID": "60029374, 60021331", "AffiliationName": "Steklov Mathematical Institute, RAS"}}}
