This research examined if and how the BlindAid that was integrated within an O&M training program could be of help when teaching those who are blind or visually impaired to develop O&M skills. Methods: Using qualitative and quantitative methods, this research focused on 16 participants during their O&M course, and studied virtual environment exploration and orientation tasks in virtual environments. Results: The encouraging results of the current study indicate the potential strengths of the BlindAid system as an O&M training device for visually impaired people. Discussion: Follow-up research evaluating transference of knowledge from virtual environments to real spaces could contribute to O&M training for people who are visually impaired. Implications for practitioners: BlindAid could play a central role in three potential applications: a training simulator for O&M, a diagnostic tool for O&M specialists to track and observe participants\u2019 spatial behavior, and a technique for advanced exploration of unknown spaces.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84921313383", "SubjectAreas": [["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"], ["Rehabilitation", "MEDI", "2742"]], "AuthorData": {"13607683400": {"Name": "Lahav O.", "AuthorID": "13607683400", "AffiliationID": "60005681", "AffiliationName": "School of Education, Tel Aviv University"}, "6506362590": {"Name": "Schloerb D.W.", "AuthorID": "6506362590", "AffiliationID": "60022195", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory for Human and Machine Haptic (The Touch Lab), Research Laboratory of Electronics, Massachusetts Institute of Technology"}, "7203044605": {"Name": "Srinivasan M.A.", "AuthorID": "7203044605", "AffiliationID": "60022195", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory for Human and Machine Haptic, (The Touch Lab), Research Laboratory of Electronics, Massachusetts Institute of Technology"}}}
