To advance knowledge of objective physical activity measurement during these periods, this study compares hip to wrist accelerometer compliance; assesses convergent validity (correlation) between hip- and wrist-worn accelerometry; and assesses change in physical activity from pregnancy to postpartum. Methods: We recruited women during pregnancy (n = 100; 2014\u20132015), asking them to wear hip and wrist accelerometers for 7 days during Trimester 2 (T2), Trimester 3 (T3), and 3-, 6-, 9- and 12-months postpartum. We assessed average wear-time and correlations (axis-specific counts/minute, vector magnitude counts/day and step counts/day) at T2, T3, and postpartum. Results: Compliance was higher for wrist-worn accelerometers. Hip and wrist accelerometers showed moderate to high correlations (Pearson's r 0.59 to 0.84). Hip-measured sedentary and active time differed little between T2 and T3. Moderate-to-vigorous physical activity decreased at T3 and remained low postpartum. Light physical activity increased and sedentary time decreased throughout the postpartum period. Conclusions: Wrist accelerometers may be preferable during pregnancy and appear comparable to hip accelerometers. As physical activity declines during later pregnancy and may not rebound post birth, support for re-engaging in physical activity earlier in the postpartum period may benefit women.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Measurement", "Physical activity", "Postpartum", "Pregnancy", "Sedentary behavior"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85046462399", "SubjectAreas": [["Health Informatics", "MEDI", "2718"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"55868344300": {"Name": "Hesketh K.R.", "AuthorID": "55868344300", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "16243910000": {"Name": "Benjamin-Neelon S.E.", "AuthorID": "16243910000", "AffiliationID": "60031101, 60009969", "AffiliationName": "CEDAR and MRC Epidemiology Unit, University of Cambridge"}, "7006414128": {"Name": "Evenson K.R.", "AuthorID": "7006414128", "AffiliationID": "60025111", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology, Gillings School of Global Public Health, University of North Carolina"}, "55303456300": {"Name": "Stroo M.", "AuthorID": "55303456300", "AffiliationID": "60113147", "AffiliationName": "Department of Community and Family Medicine, Duke University Medical Center"}, "57192183401": {"Name": "Clancy S.M.", "AuthorID": "57192183401", "AffiliationID": "60113147", "AffiliationName": "Department of Community and Family Medicine, Duke University Medical Center"}, "7005350099": {"Name": "\u00d8stbye T.", "AuthorID": "7005350099", "AffiliationID": "60113147", "AffiliationName": "Department of Community and Family Medicine, Duke University Medical Center"}}}
