Advances in sequencing technologies facilitate the establishment of a molecular diagnosis. Therefore, we determined the diagnostic yield of a next generation sequencing panel assessing relevant disease genes in children followed through three national networks with a clinical diagnosis of a renal tubulopathy. DNA was amplified with a kit provided by the European Consortium for High-Throughput Research in Rare Kidney Diseases with nine multiplex PCR reactions. This kit produced 571 amplicons covering 37 genes associated with tubulopathies followed by massive parallel sequencing and bioinformatic interpretation. Identified mutations were confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Overall, 384 index patients and 16 siblings were assessed. Most common clinical diagnoses were 174 patients with Bartter/Gitelman syndrome and 76 with distal renal tubular acidosis. A total of 269 different variants were identified in 27 genes, of which 95 variants were considered likely, 136 definitely pathogenic and 100 had not been described at annotation. These mutations established a genetic diagnosis in 245 of the index patients. Genetic testing changed the clinical diagnosis in 16 cases and provided insights into the phenotypic spectrum of the respective disorders. Our results demonstrate a high diagnostic yield of genetic testing in children with a clinical diagnosis of a renal tubulopathy, consistent with a predominantly genetic etiology in known disease genes. Thus, genetic testing helped establish a definitive diagnosis in almost two-thirds of patients thereby informing prognosis, management and genetic counseling.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bartter syndrome", "children", "genetic testing", "Gitelman syndrome", "next generation sequencing", "renal tubular acidosis", "tubulopathy"], "IndexKeywords": ["Acidosis, Renal Tubular", "Adolescent", "Age Factors", "Bartter Syndrome", "Case-Control Studies", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "DNA Mutational Analysis", "Europe", "Female", "Genetic Markers", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Gitelman Syndrome", "Heredity", "High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing", "Humans", "Infant", "Infant, Newborn", "Male", "Multiplex Polymerase Chain Reaction", "Mutation", "Pedigree", "Phenotype", "Predictive Value of Tests", "Reagent Kits, Diagnostic", "Renal Tubular Transport, Inborn Errors", "Risk Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85041622824", "SubjectAreas": [["Nephrology", "MEDI", "2727"]], "AuthorData": {"8644251700": {"Name": "Ashton E.J.", "AuthorID": "8644251700", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "North East Thames Regional Genetics Service Laboratories, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children National Health Service (NHS) Foundation Trust"}, "9535391900": {"Name": "Jenkins L.A.", "AuthorID": "9535391900", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "North East Thames Regional Genetics Service Laboratories, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children National Health Service (NHS) Foundation Trust"}, "57188696129": {"Name": "Legrand A.", "AuthorID": "57188696129", "AffiliationID": "60123796", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Medicine, Paris Sorbonne Cit\u00e9, Universit\u00e9 Paris Descartes"}, "23062248900": {"Name": "Roncelin I.", "AuthorID": "23062248900", "AffiliationID": "60030857, 60021567", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genetics, Assistance Publique H\u00f4pitaux de Paris, H\u00f4pital Europ\u00e9en Georges Pompidou"}, "26532132700": {"Name": "Venisse A.", "AuthorID": "26532132700", "AffiliationID": "60030857, 60021567", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genetics, Assistance Publique H\u00f4pitaux de Paris, H\u00f4pital Europ\u00e9en Georges Pompidou"}, "35515658700": {"Name": "Zennaro M.C.", "AuthorID": "35515658700", "AffiliationID": "60136279", "AffiliationName": "Institut National de la Sant\u00e9 et la Recherche M\u00e9dicale, Unit\u00e9 Mixte de Recherche en Sant\u00e9 970, Paris-Cardiovascular Research Center"}, "7005820228": {"Name": "Jeunemaitre X.", "AuthorID": "7005820228", "AffiliationID": "60136279", "AffiliationName": "Institut National de la Sant\u00e9 et la Recherche M\u00e9dicale, Unit\u00e9 Mixte de Recherche en Sant\u00e9 970, Paris-Cardiovascular Research Center"}, "6602601686": {"Name": "Vargas-Poussou R.", "AuthorID": "6602601686", "AffiliationID": "60123796", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Medicine, Paris Sorbonne Cit\u00e9, Universit\u00e9 Paris Descartes"}, "55788850000": {"Name": "Benoit V.", "AuthorID": "55788850000", "AffiliationID": "60069989", "AffiliationName": "Center of Human Genetics, Institut de Pathologie et G\u00e9n\u00e9tique"}, "55954231200": {"Name": "Dahan K.", "AuthorID": "55954231200", "AffiliationID": "60000874", "AffiliationName": "Division of Nephrology, Universit\u00e9 Catholique de Louvain Medical School"}, "55147829300": {"Name": "Iancu D.", "AuthorID": "55147829300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Nephrology, University College London"}, "24588277800": {"Name": "Walsh S.B.", "AuthorID": "24588277800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Nephrology, University College London"}, "57207559231": {"Name": "Kleta R.", "AuthorID": "57207559231", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatric Nephrology, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}, "6602980434": {"Name": "Bockenhauer D.", "AuthorID": "6602980434", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatric Nephrology, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7004098195": {"Name": "van't Hoff W.G.", "AuthorID": "7004098195", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatric Nephrology, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}, "25924049900": {"Name": "Rotthier A.", "AuthorID": "25924049900", "AffiliationID": "120185795", "AffiliationName": "Multiplicom N.V.
