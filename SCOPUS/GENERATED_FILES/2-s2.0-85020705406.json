This paper investigates the efficiency of four materials: powdered activated carbon (PAC) and carbon-doped titanium dioxide nanocatalyst with different concentrations of carbon (C-1.5, C-40, and C-80) for metaldehyde removal from aqueous solutions by adsorption and oxidation via photocatalysis. PAC was found to be the most effective material which showed almost over 90% removal. Adsorption data were well fitted to the Langmuir isotherm model, giving a qm (maximum/saturation adsorption capacity) value of 32.258 mg g\u22121 and a KL (Langmuir constant) value of 2.013 L mg\u22121. In terms of kinetic study, adsorption of metaldehyde by PAC fitted well with a pseudo-second-order equation, giving the adsorption rate constant k2 value of 0.023 g mg\u22121 min\u22121, implying rapid adsorption. The nanocatalysts were much less effective in oxidising metaldehyde than PAC with the same metaldehyde concentration and 0.2 g L\u22121 loading concentration of materials under UV light; the maximum removal achieved by carbon-doped titanium dioxide (C-1.5) nanocatalyst was around 15% for a 7.5 ppm metaldehyde solution.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Adsorption", "Metaldehyde", "Photocatalysis", "Photocatalysts", "Powdered activated carbon"], "IndexKeywords": ["Acetaldehyde", "Adsorption", "Carbon", "Charcoal", "Kinetics", "Nanoparticles", "Water", "Water Pollutants, Chemical", "Water Purification"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85020705406", "SubjectAreas": [["Environmental Chemistry", "ENVI", "2304"], ["Pollution", "ENVI", "2310"], ["Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis", "ENVI", "2307"]], "AuthorData": {"57194542177": {"Name": "Li Z.", "AuthorID": "57194542177", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil, Environmental and Geomatic Engineering, University College London"}, "14043273200": {"Name": "Campos L.", "AuthorID": "14043273200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil, Environmental and Geomatic Engineering, University College London"}, "55557006700": {"Name": "Kim J.", "AuthorID": "55557006700", "AffiliationID": "60004580", "AffiliationName": "Kyungnam University"}, "57194541337": {"Name": "Chaudhari V.", "AuthorID": "57194541337", "AffiliationID": "60012548", "AffiliationName": "Chemical Engineering & Process Development Division, CSIR-National Chemical Laboratory"}, "6602158993": {"Name": "Mayadevi S.", "AuthorID": "6602158993", "AffiliationID": "60012548", "AffiliationName": "Chemical Engineering & Process Development Division, CSIR-National Chemical Laboratory"}}}
