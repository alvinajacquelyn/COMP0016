Here we show that compensatory arm usage in individuals born without a hand (one-handers) reflects functional connectivity of spontaneous brain activity in the cortical hand region. Compared with two-handed controls, one-handers showed reduced symmetry of hand region inter-hemispheric resting-state functional connectivity and corticospinal white matter microstructure. Nevertheless, those one-handers who more frequently use their residual (handless) arm for typically bimanual daily tasks also showed more symmetrical functional connectivity of the hand region, demonstrating that adaptive behaviour drives long-range brain organisation. We therefore suggest that compensatory arm usage maintains symmetrical sensorimotor functional connectivity in one-handers. Since variability in spontaneous functional connectivity in our study reflects ecological behaviour, we propose that inter-hemispheric symmetry, typically observed in resting sensorimotor networks, depends on coordinated motor behaviour in daily life.", "AuthorKeywords": ["human", "neuroimaging", "neuroscience", "plasticity", "rehabilitation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Behavior", "Brain", "Demography", "Hand Deformities, Congenital", "Humans", "Middle Aged", "Nerve Net", "Pyramidal Tracts", "Rest", "Task Performance and Analysis", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85044692772", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Immunology and Microbiology (all)", "IMMU", "2400"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"55930624100": {"Name": "Hahamy A.", "AuthorID": "55930624100", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "FMRIB Centre, Nuffield Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Oxford"}, "16234548300": {"Name": "Sotiropoulos S.N.", "AuthorID": "16234548300", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "FMRIB Centre, Nuffield Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Oxford"}, "24461774900": {"Name": "Henderson Slater D.", "AuthorID": "24461774900", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "FMRIB Centre, Nuffield Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Oxford"}, "7005863798": {"Name": "Malach R.", "AuthorID": "7005863798", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "FMRIB Centre, Nuffield Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Oxford"}, "6701480981": {"Name": "Johansen-Berg H.", "AuthorID": "6701480981", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "FMRIB Centre, Nuffield Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Oxford"}, "15835219200": {"Name": "Makin T.R.", "AuthorID": "15835219200", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "FMRIB Centre, Nuffield Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Oxford"}}}
