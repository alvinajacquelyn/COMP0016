Foley et al.Objective. Reduced verbal fluency is a strikingly uniform finding following deep brain stimulation (DBS) for Parkinson's disease (PD). The precise cognitive mechanism underlying this reduction remains unclear, but theories have suggested reduced motivation, linguistic skill, and/or executive function. It is of note, however, that previous reports have failed to consider the potential role of any changes in speed of processing. Thus, the aim of this study was to examine verbal fluency changes with a particular focus on the role of cognitive speed. Method. In this study, 28 patients with PD completed measures of verbal fluency, motivation, language, executive functioning, and speed of processing, before and after DBS. Results. As expected, there was a marked decline in verbal fluency but also in a timed test of executive functions and two measures of speed of processing. Verbal fluency decline was associated with markers of linguistic and executive functioning, but not after speed of processing was statistically controlled for. In contrast, greater decline in verbal fluency was associated with higher levels of apathy at baseline, which was not associated with changes in cognitive speed. Discussion. Reduced generativity and processing speed may account for the marked reduction in verbal fluency commonly observed following DBS.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Apathy", "Cognition", "Deep Brain Stimulation", "Executive Function", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Neuropsychological Tests", "Parkinson Disease", "Speech Disorders", "Verbal Behavior"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85017144798", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuropsychology and Physiological Psychology", "PSYC", "3206"], ["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"35299073000": {"Name": "Foley J.A.", "AuthorID": "35299073000", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "8984550100": {"Name": "Foltynie T.", "AuthorID": "8984550100", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "17136524800": {"Name": "Zrinzo L.", "AuthorID": "17136524800", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "15072861200": {"Name": "Hyam J.A.", "AuthorID": "15072861200", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "7003880315": {"Name": "Limousin P.", "AuthorID": "7003880315", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "7004532494": {"Name": "Cipolotti L.", "AuthorID": "7004532494", "AffiliationID": "60017697", "AffiliationName": "Dipartimento di Scienze Psicologiche, Pedagogiche e della Formazione, Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Palermo"}}}
