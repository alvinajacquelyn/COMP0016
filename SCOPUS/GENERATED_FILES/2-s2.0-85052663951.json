Published by John Wiley & Sons LtdAim: This study aimed to assess associations between dental caries and anthropometric measures among a sample of children aged 5-9 years in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Methods: A cross-sectional observational study was conducted among 5- to 9-year-old children in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Data were collected from children and their parents attending the Dhaka Dental College Hospital and from three nearby primary schools. The outcome measures were as follows: age and sex adjusted height-z-scores (HAZ), weight-z-scores (WAZ) and BMI-z-scores (BAZ). Multiple linear regressions were used to assess the associations between caries and anthropometric measures, adjusted for maternal education, family income, study setting, birth weight and childhood diseases as potential confounders. Results: The final sample comprised 788 children, and the overall response rate was 96.7%. The majority (73.2%) had experience of dental caries. The mean dmft + DMFT score was 2.84 (95% CI 2.64, 3.03) and 35.8% experienced dental sepsis. Dental caries and sepsis were negatively associated with HAZ, WAZ and BAZ scores. After adjustment for potential confounders, children with severe levels of caries had lower HAZ scores (coefficient: \u22120.40; 95% CI \u22120.69, \u22120.10), lower WAZ scores (coefficient: \u22120.59; 95% CI \u22120.94, \u22120.24) and lower BAZ scores (coefficient: \u22120.50; 95% CI \u22120.87, \u22120.13) than those who were caries free. Children with moderate levels of caries also had lower WAZ scores (coefficient: \u22120.43; 95% CI \u22120.72, \u22120.15) and lower BAZ scores (coefficient: \u22120.43; 95% CI \u22120.72, \u22120.13) than caries-free children. Children with dental sepsis had lower HAZ (coefficient: \u22120.23; 95% CI \u22120.42, \u22120.03), WAZ (coefficient: \u22120.33; 95% CI \u22120.56, \u22120.10) and BAZ scores (coefficient: \u22120.29; 95% CI \u22120.53, \u22120.05) than dental sepsis-free children. Conclusions: Dental caries was associated with lower height, weight and BMI among this sample of Bangladeshi children, even after adjusting for age and sex and a number of potential confounders.", "AuthorKeywords": ["BMI", "children", "dental caries", "height", "weight"], "IndexKeywords": ["Anthropometry", "Bangladesh", "Body Height", "Body Mass Index", "Body Weight", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Dental Caries", "DMF Index", "Female", "Humans", "Linear Models", "Male", "Risk Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85052663951", "SubjectAreas": [["Dentistry (all)", "DENT", "3500"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"37015647400": {"Name": "Mishu M.P.", "AuthorID": "37015647400", "AffiliationID": "60016418", "AffiliationName": "Department of Health Science, Faculty of Sciences, University of York"}, "57204336866": {"Name": "Tsakos G.", "AuthorID": "57204336866", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London (UCL)"}, "56179387000": {"Name": "Heilmann A.", "AuthorID": "56179387000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London (UCL)"}, "7102907522": {"Name": "Watt R.G.", "AuthorID": "7102907522", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London (UCL)"}}}
