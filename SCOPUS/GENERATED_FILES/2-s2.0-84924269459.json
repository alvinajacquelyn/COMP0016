The high costs of building electric infrastructure are a major impediment to improved access, making stand-alone photovoltaic (PV) systems an attractive solution in remote areas. Here, we analyze the cost-effective electrification solution for Kenya comparing grid extension with stand-alone PV systems. We use micro-data from a national household survey to estimate electricity demand for households that are within reach of electricity infrastructure and to predict latent demand in unconnected households. These regional demands are used in a spatially explicit supply model to seek for a least cost electrification solution. Our results suggest that decentralized PV systems can make an important contribution in areas, with low demand and high connection costs. We find that up to 17% of the population can be reached cost-effectively by off-grid PV systems till 2020.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Electrification", "Exponential model", "Geographically explicit", "Optimization model", "Sub-Saharan Africa", "Tobit model"], "IndexKeywords": ["Electrification", "Exponential models", "Geographically explicit", "Optimization modeling", "Sub-saharan africa"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84924269459", "SubjectAreas": [["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"], ["Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment", "ENER", "2105"], ["Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law", "ENVI", "2308"]], "AuthorData": {"55368951400": {"Name": "Zeyringer M.", "AuthorID": "55368951400", "AffiliationID": "60024895", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Sustainable Economic Development, University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences (BOKU)"}, "7003316096": {"Name": "Worrell E.", "AuthorID": "7003316096", "AffiliationID": "60018815, 60007989", "AffiliationName": "Copernicus Institute of Sustainable Development, Utrecht University"}, "14120125900": {"Name": "Schmid E.", "AuthorID": "14120125900", "AffiliationID": "60024895", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Sustainable Economic Development, University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences (BOKU)"}, "7404659001": {"Name": "Schmidt J.", "AuthorID": "7404659001", "AffiliationID": "60024895", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Sustainable Economic Development, University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences (BOKU)"}, "36683018300": {"Name": "Morawetz U.B.", "AuthorID": "36683018300", "AffiliationID": "60024895", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Sustainable Economic Development, University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences (BOKU)"}, "7006691383": {"Name": "Pachauri S.", "AuthorID": "7006691383", "AffiliationID": "60019497", "AffiliationName": "International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA)"}}}
