VKAs constitute the conventional therapy for the treatment and secondary thromboprophylaxis of thrombotic antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), but are often problematic, owing to the variable sensitivity of thromboplastins to lupus anticoagulant. Thus, the International Normalized Ratio may not accurately reflect anticoagulation intensity, or be clinically effective. Definition of the current role of DOACs in the treatment of APS is based on limited clinical trial data and information from other sources, including manufacturers\u2019 data, case series or cohort studies, and expert consensus. The Rivaroxaban in Antiphospholipid Syndrome (RAPS) randomized controlled trial (RCT), which had a laboratory surrogate primary outcome measure, suggests that rivaroxaban has the potential to be an effective and convenient alternative to warfarin in thrombotic APS patients with a single venous thromboembolism event requiring standard-intensity anticoagulation. However, further studies, in particular to provide better long-term efficacy and safety data, are needed before it can be widely recommended. APS patients are clinically heterogeneous, with the risk of recurrent thrombosis and the intensity of anticoagulation being influenced by their clinical phenotype and risk profile. DOAC trials involving homogeneous thrombotic APS populations, with the antiphospholipid antibody status well defined, will help to optimize the appropriate treatment in APS patient subgroups. Ongoing and emerging DOAC RCTs should provide further information to guide the use of DOACs in APS patients. Optimal identification of APS patients is a key step in working towards improved therapeutic strategies in these individuals.", "AuthorKeywords": ["antiphospholipid syndrome", "direct oral anticoagulants", "ischemic stroke", "thrombin generation", "venous thromboembolism"], "IndexKeywords": ["Administration, Oral", "Antibodies, Antiphospholipid", "Anticoagulants", "Antiphospholipid Syndrome", "Biomarkers", "Blood Coagulation", "Clinical Decision-Making", "Evidence-Based Medicine", "Hemorrhage", "Humans", "Risk Assessment", "Risk Factors", "Thrombosis", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85047796964", "SubjectAreas": [["Hematology", "MEDI", "2720"]], "AuthorData": {"7402809618": {"Name": "Cohen H.", "AuthorID": "7402809618", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "24279560200": {"Name": "Efthymiou M.", "AuthorID": "24279560200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Haemostasis Research Unit, Department of Haematology, University College London"}, "57201108555": {"Name": "Isenberg D.A.", "AuthorID": "57201108555", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Rheumatology, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
