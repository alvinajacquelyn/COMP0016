Several clinical subtypes have been described, according to degree of muscle weakness, severity and age at onset. The course of nemaline myopathy is very slowly progressive, and death is usually due to respiratory failure. Cardiac involvement is rare and generally considered to be the result of ACTA1 mutations. Patient: We report the case of a 6 year old boy with typical congenital nemaline myopathy. Nemaline myopathy was confirmed at 3 years of age by muscle biopsy. No mutation of ACTA1, TPM2 and TNNT1 genes was detected. The child died suddenly of cardiac arrest and associated hypoxic-ischemic brain injury, in absence of acute respiratory failure or swallowing difficulties. Results: Nemaline cardiomyopathy was suspected, but post mortem cardiac biopsy did not show findings consistent with nemaline myopathy. Conclusions: Congenital typical nemaline myopathy is not necessarily a static or very slowly progressive disorder and acute cardiac deterioration can lead to early death.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cardiac arrest", "Child", "Hypoxic-ischemic brain injury", "Nemaline myopathy"], "IndexKeywords": ["Brain", "Child", "Death, Sudden, Cardiac", "Disease Progression", "Fatal Outcome", "Humans", "Hypoxia-Ischemia, Brain", "Male", "Myopathies, Nemaline", "Prognosis", "Tomography, X-Ray Computed"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84925587913", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"]], "AuthorData": {"8546874600": {"Name": "Marseglia L.", "AuthorID": "8546874600", "AffiliationID": "60011576", "AffiliationName": "Neonatal and Pediatric Intensive Care Unit, Department of Pediatrics, University of Messina, Italy"}, "55882998900": {"Name": "D'Angelo G.", "AuthorID": "55882998900", "AffiliationID": "60011576", "AffiliationName": "Neonatal and Pediatric Intensive Care Unit, Department of Pediatrics, University of Messina, Italy"}, "6603480679": {"Name": "Gitto E.", "AuthorID": "6603480679", "AffiliationID": "60011576", "AffiliationName": "Neonatal and Pediatric Intensive Care Unit, Department of Pediatrics, University of Messina, Italy"}, "55522578600": {"Name": "Manti S.", "AuthorID": "55522578600", "AffiliationID": "60011576", "AffiliationName": "Unit of Paediatric Genetics and Immunology, Department of Paediatrics, University of Messina"}, "6507973880": {"Name": "Salpietro V.", "AuthorID": "6507973880", "AffiliationID": "60011576", "AffiliationName": "Unit of Paediatric Genetics and Immunology, Department of Paediatrics, University of Messina"}, "55238749400": {"Name": "Arrigo T.", "AuthorID": "55238749400", "AffiliationID": "60011576", "AffiliationName": "Unit of Paediatric Genetics and Immunology, Department of Paediatrics, University of Messina"}, "7003797042": {"Name": "Cavallari V.", "AuthorID": "7003797042", "AffiliationID": "60011576", "AffiliationName": "Ultrastructural Pathology Unit, University of Messina"}}}
