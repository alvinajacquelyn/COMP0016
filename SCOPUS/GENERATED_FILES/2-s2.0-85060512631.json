Consequently, research effort is wasted and we are unable to use implants to reduce the costs of healthcare. The framework should be altered so that it is economically possible to get new devices for small patient groups into widespread use.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Implants/prosthetics", "innovation", "medical device regulations", "rehabilitation devices", "urinary incontinence"], "IndexKeywords": ["Impaired people", "Implanted medical devices", "Medical Devices", "New devices", "Regulatory frameworks", "Rehabilitation devices", "Research efforts", "Urinary incontinence", "Humans", "Nervous System", "Prostheses and Implants", "Urinary Incontinence"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85060512631", "SubjectAreas": [["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"]], "AuthorData": {"15723130500": {"Name": "Donaldson N.", "AuthorID": "15723130500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}}}
