However, experimental progress has been hindered by particle loss mechanisms, which have prevented levitation and cavity cooling in a vacuum. We overcome this problem with a new type of hybrid electro-optical trap formed from a Paul trap within a single-mode optical cavity. We demonstrate a factor of 100 cavity cooling of 400 nm diameter silica spheres trapped in vacuum. This paves the way for ground-state cooling in a smaller, higher finesse cavity, as we show that a novel feature of the hybrid trap is that the optomechanical cooling becomes actively driven by the Paul trap, even for singly charged nanospheres.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Cavity cooling", "Electro-optical", "Ground state cooling", "Laboratory investigations", "Macroscopic quantum", "Optical cavities", "Optomechanical", "Optomechanical cavities"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84925967761", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"22985827000": {"Name": "Millen J.", "AuthorID": "22985827000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "56576042000": {"Name": "Fonseca P.", "AuthorID": "56576042000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "36639844000": {"Name": "Mavrogordatos T.", "AuthorID": "36639844000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "55950044400": {"Name": "Monteiro T.", "AuthorID": "55950044400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "57203084776": {"Name": "Barker P.", "AuthorID": "57203084776", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}}}
