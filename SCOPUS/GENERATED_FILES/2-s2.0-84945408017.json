In this study, we examine the effect of extreme weather on hospital admissions in Cyprus, for inland and coastal areas, through the use of synoptic weather classifications (air mass types). In addition, the effect of particulate air pollution (PM10) on morbidity is examined. Our results show that two air mass types, namely (a) warm, rainy days with increased levels of water vapour in the atmosphere and (b) cold, cloudy days with increased levels of precipitation, were associated with increased morbidity in the form of hospital admissions. This was true both for cardiovascular and respiratory conditions, for all age groups, but particularly for the elderly, aged over 65. Particulate air pollution was also associated with increased morbidity in Cyprus, where the effect was more pronounced for cardiovascular diseases.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Air mass types", "Cardiovascular/respiratory diseases", "Heat waves", "Hospital admissions", "Particulate air pollution", "Public health"], "IndexKeywords": ["Air mass", "Air pollution effects", "Cardio-vascular disease", "Extreme temperatures", "Heat waves", "Hospital admissions", "Particulate air pollution", "Weather classification", "Air Pollution", "Cardiovascular Diseases", "Cyprus", "Environmental Exposure", "Hospitalization", "Humans", "Particulate Matter", "Respiratory Tract Diseases", "Weather"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84945408017", "SubjectAreas": [["Environmental Engineering", "ENVI", "2305"], ["Environmental Chemistry", "ENVI", "2304"], ["Waste Management and Disposal", "ENVI", "2311"], ["Pollution", "ENVI", "2310"]], "AuthorData": {"16317738400": {"Name": "Tsangari H.", "AuthorID": "16317738400", "AffiliationID": "60104028", "AffiliationName": "University of Nicosia Research Foundation, University of Nicosia"}, "7003673574": {"Name": "Yamasaki E.", "AuthorID": "7003673574", "AffiliationID": "60104028", "AffiliationName": "University of Nicosia Research Foundation, University of Nicosia"}, "16639000400": {"Name": "Paschalidou A.", "AuthorID": "16639000400", "AffiliationID": "60030988", "AffiliationName": "Department of Forestry and Management of the Environment and Natural Resources, Democritus University of Thrace"}, "7003482472": {"Name": "Kassomenos A.", "AuthorID": "7003482472", "AffiliationID": "60004716", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Meteorology, Department of Physics, University of Ioannina"}, "16835481000": {"Name": "Vardoulakis S.", "AuthorID": "16835481000", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Radiation, Chemical and Environmental Hazards, Public Health England"}, "55976888100": {"Name": "Heaviside C.", "AuthorID": "55976888100", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Radiation, Chemical and Environmental Hazards, Public Health England"}, "57189708001": {"Name": "Georgiou K.", "AuthorID": "57189708001", "AffiliationID": "60104028", "AffiliationName": "Cyprus Centre for European and International Affairs, University of Nicosia"}}}
