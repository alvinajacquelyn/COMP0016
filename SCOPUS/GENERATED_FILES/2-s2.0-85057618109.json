This was a qualitative prospective study using in-depth, semi-structured interviews. Ten patients who fulfilled the inclusion criteria were recruited during their attendance at the Adult Craniofacial Clinic at the Eastman Dental Hospital, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust. Interviews ceased when no new themes arose. A framework method of analysis was used to identify themes that related to QoL. Opinions varied and, although some were positive, the eight main themes that emerged were mainly negative. One of the main themes was that of emotional issues. Within this theme, subthemes included teasing, bullying and abuse, as well as low mood, anxiety, depression, and self-harm. Participants experienced a range of feelings as a result of their craniofacial conditions and expressed the need for further support. Healthcare professionals involved in the treatment of these patients, should be aware of these issues and give advice about how to access further support.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Craniofacial anomalies", "Framework Analysis", "Patient Perceptions", "Psychosocial", "Quality of Life"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Craniofacial Abnormalities", "Depression", "Humans", "London", "Prospective Studies", "Qualitative Research", "Quality of Life"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85057618109", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Oral Surgery", "DENT", "3504"], ["Otorhinolaryngology", "MEDI", "2733"]], "AuthorData": {"57204877475": {"Name": "Visram S.M.", "AuthorID": "57204877475", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60013985", "AffiliationName": "University College London Eastman Dental Institute"}, "7201937126": {"Name": "Cunningham S.J.", "AuthorID": "7201937126", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60013985", "AffiliationName": "University College London Eastman Dental Institute"}, "57220721420": {"Name": "Gill D.", "AuthorID": "57220721420", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60013985, 60024544, 60018207", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street NHS Foundation Trust and Eastman Dental Hospital, University College London Hospitals Foundation Trust"}, "14056940800": {"Name": "Shute J.T.", "AuthorID": "14056940800", "AffiliationID": "60013985, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "Eastman Dental Hospital, University College London Hospitals Foundation Trust"}}}
