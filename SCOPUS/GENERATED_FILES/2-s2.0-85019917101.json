By the virtual reality glasses, a geographical software can provide an immersive environment of geographic structure. The major functions of the software part this system are consisted of 3D space intersection detection, 3D topology analysis, Space convex decomposition, Space convex hull calculation, overlay analysis and buffer analysis. The multimodal technologies have been adopted by the system to promote users\u2019 perceptions.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Geography learning", "GIS", "Virtual reality", "VRGIS"], "IndexKeywords": ["Buffer analysis", "Computer interaction", "Convex decomposition", "Geographic structures", "Geography learning", "Immersive environment", "Overlay analysis", "VRGIS"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85019917101", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"], ["Artificial Intelligence", "COMP", "1702"]], "AuthorData": {"55925162500": {"Name": "Lv Z.", "AuthorID": "55925162500", "AffiliationID": "60030434", "AffiliationName": "Qingdao University"}, "56829171600": {"Name": "Li X.", "AuthorID": "56829171600", "AffiliationID": "60087824", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of Urban Land Resources Monitoring and Simulation"}, "57192673420": {"Name": "Li W.", "AuthorID": "57192673420", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}}}
