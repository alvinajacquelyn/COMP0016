Repairing damaged spinal motor circuits, in either SCI or ALS, currently remains an elusive goal. Therefore alternative strategies are needed to artificially control muscle function and thereby enable essential motor tasks. This review focuses on recent advances towards restoring motor function, with a particular focus on stem cell-derived neuronal engraftment strategies, optogenetic control of motor function and the potential future translational application of these approaches.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis", "Human behaviours", "Motor circuits", "Motor function", "Muscle function", "Muscle paralysis", "Quality of life", "Spinal cord injuries (SCI)", "Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis", "Animals", "Humans", "Motor Activity", "Neural Stem Cells", "Optogenetics", "Recovery of Function", "Spinal Cord Injuries"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84962570778", "SubjectAreas": [["Biotechnology", "BIOC", "1305"], ["Bioengineering", "CENG", "1502"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"]], "AuthorData": {"7103369132": {"Name": "Bryson J.B.", "AuthorID": "7103369132", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Sobell Department of Motor Neuroscience and Movement Disorders, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "57203069719": {"Name": "Greensmith L.", "AuthorID": "57203069719", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Neuromuscuar Diseases, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "56236379000": {"Name": "Machado C.B.", "AuthorID": "56236379000", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department for Developmental Neurobiology, King's College London"}, "8640560100": {"Name": "Lieberam I.", "AuthorID": "8640560100", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department for Developmental Neurobiology, King's College London"}}}
