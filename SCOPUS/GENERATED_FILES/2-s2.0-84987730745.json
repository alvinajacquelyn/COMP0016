Exon 2 of COL2A1 is alternatively spliced, expressed in the eye but not in mature cartilage and encodes a region that binds growth factors TGF\u03b21 and BMP-2. We investigated how both an apparently de novo variant and a polymorphism in intron 2 altered the efficiency of COL2A1 exon 2 splicing and how the latter may act as a predisposing risk factor for the occurrence of posterior vitreous detachment (PVD)-associated rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) in the general population. Using amplification of illegitimate transcripts and allele-specific minigenes expressed in cultured cells, we demonstrate variability in exon 2 inclusion not only between different control individuals, but also between different COL2A1 alleles. We identify transacting factors that bind to allele-specific RNA sequences, and investigate the effect of knockdown and overexpression of these factors on exon 2 splicing efficiency. Finally, using a specific cohort of patients with PVD-associated RRD and a control population, we demonstrate a significant difference in the frequency of the COL2A1 intronic variant rs1635532 between the two groups.", "AuthorKeywords": ["alternative splicing", "COL2A1", "giant retinal tear", "posterior vitreous detachment", "retinal detachment"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84987730745", "SubjectAreas": [["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Genetics (clinical)", "MEDI", "2716"]], "AuthorData": {"56596470600": {"Name": "Spickett C.", "AuthorID": "56596470600", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, University of Cambridge"}, "30467598900": {"Name": "Fincham G.S.", "AuthorID": "30467598900", "AffiliationID": "60016390", "AffiliationName": "Vitreoretinal Research Group, Cambridge University NHS Foundation Trust"}, "6603593431": {"Name": "Poulson A.V.", "AuthorID": "6603593431", "AffiliationID": "60016390", "AffiliationName": "Vitreoretinal Research Group, Cambridge University NHS Foundation Trust"}, "36546363900": {"Name": "McNinch A.M.", "AuthorID": "36546363900", "AffiliationID": "60016390", "AffiliationName": "Regional Molecular Genetics Laboratory, Cambridge University NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7402299938": {"Name": "Richards A.J.", "AuthorID": "7402299938", "AffiliationID": "60016390", "AffiliationName": "Regional Molecular Genetics Laboratory, Cambridge University NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7006657695": {"Name": "Snead M.P.", "AuthorID": "7006657695", "AffiliationID": "60016390", "AffiliationName": "Vitreoretinal Research Group, Cambridge University NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57203644841": {"Name": "Hysi P.", "AuthorID": "57203644841", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Academic Unit Ophthalmology, King's College London"}, "7102559046": {"Name": "Hammond C.J.", "AuthorID": "7102559046", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Academic Unit Ophthalmology, King's College London"}, "57205138085": {"Name": "Prescott A.", "AuthorID": "57205138085", "AffiliationID": "60008877", "AffiliationName": "College of Life Sciences, University of Dundee"}}}
