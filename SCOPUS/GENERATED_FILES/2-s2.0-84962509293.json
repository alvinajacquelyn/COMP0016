S. Maney & Son Ltd 2015.Universities increasingly demand high quality courses that are engaging, develop high level analytical skills and foster deep understanding of key disciplinary subject matter. We describe an approach to teaching ancient technology to undergraduate students that is successful in engaging students through hands-on learning, and develops familiarity with general scientific approaches to building knowledge, while also enabling deeper understanding of core archaeological skills and subject matter, such as artifact analysis and the evolution of technology. There is value in sharing approaches to teaching ancient technology and experimental archaeology and we hope others will find this discussion helpful in developing their own courses or comparing our approach with those which are already on offer.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Ancient technology", "Examples", "Experimental archaeology", "Hands-on learning", "Pedagogy", "Teaching"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84962509293", "SubjectAreas": [["Archeology (arts and humanities)", "ARTS", "1204"], ["Anthropology", "SOCI", "3314"], ["Archeology", "SOCI", "3302"]], "AuthorData": {"36885327100": {"Name": "Clarkson C.", "AuthorID": "36885327100", "AffiliationID": "60031004", "AffiliationName": "School of Social Science, The University of Queensland"}, "24778858900": {"Name": "Shipton C.", "AuthorID": "24778858900", "AffiliationID": "60031004", "AffiliationName": "School of Social Science, The University of Queensland"}}}
