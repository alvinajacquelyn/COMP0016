The Newtonian limit of the theory is formulated and applied to galactic rotation curves. By assuming that the additional structure of spacetime behaves like a Newtonian gravitational potential for small deviations from isotropy, we are able to recover the Navarro-Frenk-White profile of dark matter halos by a suitable identification of constants. We consider the Burkert profile in the context of our model and also discuss rotation curves more generally.", "AuthorKeywords": ["continuum mechanics", "Modified gravity", "Newtonian limit"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85031933022", "SubjectAreas": [["Mathematical Physics", "MATH", "2610"], ["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"56247935800": {"Name": "B\u00f6hmer C.", "AuthorID": "56247935800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University College London"}, "55015594800": {"Name": "Wright M.", "AuthorID": "55015594800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University College London"}, "37005969000": {"Name": "Tamanini N.", "AuthorID": "37005969000", "AffiliationID": "60019615, 60106131", "AffiliationName": "Institut de Physique Th\u00e9orique, CEA-Saclay"}}}
