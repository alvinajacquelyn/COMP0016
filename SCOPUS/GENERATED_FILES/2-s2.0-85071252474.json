Whether the implementation and corresponding learning curve of LDP have an impact on patient outcome is unknown. The aim was to investigate the temporal trends in practice across UK centres. Methods: This was a retrospective multicentre observational cohort study of LDP in 11 tertiary referral centres in the UK between 2006 and 2016. The learning curve was analysed by pooling data for the first 15 consecutive patients who had LDP and examining trends in surgical outcomes in subsequent patients. Results: In total, 570 patients underwent LDP, whereas 888 underwent open resection. For LDP the median duration of operation was 240 min, with 200 ml blood loss. The conversion rate was 12\u00b71 per cent. Neuroendocrine tumours (26\u00b77 per cent) and mucinous cystic neoplasms (19\u00b77 per cent) were commonest indications. The proportion of LDPs increased from 24\u00b74 per cent in 2006\u20132009 (P1) to 46\u00b70 per cent in 2014\u20132016 (P3) (P < 0\u00b7001). LDP was increasingly performed for patients aged 70 years or more (16 per cent in P1 versus 34\u00b74 per cent in P3; P = 0\u00b7002), pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (6 versus 19\u00b71 per cent; P = 0\u00b7005) and advanced malignant tumours (27 versus 52 per cent; P = 0\u00b7016). With increasing experience, there was a trend for a decrease in blood transfusion rate (14\u00b71 per cent for procedures 1\u201315 to 3\u00b75 per cent for procedures 46\u201375; P = 0\u00b7008), ICU admissions (32\u00b77 to 19\u00b72 per cent; P = 0\u00b7021) and median duration of hospital stay (7 (i.q.r. 5\u20139) to 6 (4\u20137) days; P = 0\u00b7002). After 30 procedures, a decrease was noted in rates of both overall morbidity (57\u00b77 versus 42\u00b72 per cent for procedures 16\u201330 versus 46\u201375 respectively; P = 0\u00b7009) and severe morbidity (18\u00b78 versus 9\u00b77 per cent; P = 0\u00b7031). Conclusion: LDP has increased as a treatment option for lesions of the distal pancreas as indications for the procedure have expanded. Perioperative outcomes improved with the number of procedures performed.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85071252474", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"]], "AuthorData": {"57204103379": {"Name": "Lof S.", "AuthorID": "57204103379", "AffiliationID": "60000703", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery, University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust"}, "56674630600": {"Name": "Moekotte A.L.", "AuthorID": "56674630600", "AffiliationID": "60000703", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery, University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57210378016": {"Name": "Abu Hilal M.", "AuthorID": "57210378016", "AffiliationID": "60000703", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery, University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust"}, "8740384800": {"Name": "Al-Sarireh B.", "AuthorID": "8740384800", "AffiliationID": "60031920", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery, Morriston Hospital"}, "7005750862": {"Name": "Ammori B.", "AuthorID": "7005750862", "AffiliationID": "60003771, 60008250", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery, University of Manchester and Salford University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "6506958935": {"Name": "Aroori S.", "AuthorID": "6506958935", "AffiliationID": "60005671", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery, Plymouth Hospitals NHS Trust"}, "6701601489": {"Name": "Durkin D.", "AuthorID": "6701601489", "AffiliationID": "60029028", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery, Royal Stoke University Hospital"}, "25629557900": {"Name": "Fusai G.K.", "AuthorID": "25629557900", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Hepatopancreatobiliary and Liver Transplant Unit, Royal Free London"}, "8063193800": {"Name": "French J.J.", "AuthorID": "8063193800", "AffiliationID": "60001239", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery, Newcastle Upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "35447245200": {"Name": "White S.A.", "AuthorID": "35447245200", "AffiliationID": "60001239", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery, Newcastle Upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "56375663400": {"Name": "Gomez D.", "AuthorID": "56375663400", "AffiliationID": "60025016", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery, Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust"}, "23492796400": {"Name": "Marangoni G.", "AuthorID": "23492796400", "AffiliationID": "60006343", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery, University Hospitals Coventry and Warwickshire NHS Trust"}, "55178110500": {"Name": "Sutcliffe R.", "AuthorID": "55178110500", "AffiliationID": "60026493", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery, University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust"}, "6603059226": {"Name": "Soonawalla Z.", "AuthorID": "6603059226", "AffiliationID": "60170323", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery, Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "22433578800": {"Name": "Marudanayagam R.", "AuthorID": "22433578800", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "57210699104": {"Name": "Spolentini G.", "AuthorID": "57210699104", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "57210705108": {"Name": "van der Heijde N.", "AuthorID": "57210705108", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "36155393200": {"Name": "Kanwar A.", "AuthorID": "36155393200", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "57211693823": {"Name": "Schlegel A.", "AuthorID": "57211693823", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "55651568800": {"Name": "Mowbray N.G.", "AuthorID": "55651568800", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "57201744144": {"Name": "Rahman S.", "AuthorID": "57201744144", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "57198163785": {"Name": "Kabir I.", "AuthorID": "57198163785", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "35268226900": {"Name": "Deakin M.", "AuthorID": "35268226900", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "57214477094": {"Name": "Bowling K.", "AuthorID": "57214477094", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "36910692100": {"Name": "Khaled Y.", "AuthorID": "36910692100", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
