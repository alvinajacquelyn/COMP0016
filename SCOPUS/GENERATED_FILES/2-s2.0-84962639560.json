To this end, the proposed RF prototype can support heterogeneous multi-band CA scenarios with up to 3-band CA including unlicensed bands. Among other features, cognitive radio capabilities are incorporated to this prototype like spectrum sensing using energy detectors and dynamic CA using switches among the RF chains. The proposed architecture is evaluated in this paper highlighting useful insights of the proposed design. Our future work is to develop the proposed architecture using particular hardware components as an implementation within the framework of SOLDER FP7 project.", "AuthorKeywords": ["carrier aggregation", "cognitive radio", "heterogeneous dispersed bands", "RF prototype"], "IndexKeywords": ["Carrier aggregations", "Design and simulation", "Hardware components", "Heterogeneous cellular networks", "heterogeneous dispersed bands", "Heterogeneous technology", "Proposed architectures", "RF prototype"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84962639560", "SubjectAreas": [["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"], ["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"], ["Radiation", "PHYS", "3108"]], "AuthorData": {"35199647500": {"Name": "Antonopoulos E.", "AuthorID": "35199647500", "AffiliationID": "60025812", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Thessaly"}, "23089042600": {"Name": "Plessas F.", "AuthorID": "23089042600", "AffiliationID": "60025812", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Thessaly"}, "55952568500": {"Name": "Foukalas F.", "AuthorID": "55952568500", "AffiliationID": "60042257", "AffiliationName": "Industrial Systems Institute, Athena Research and Innovation Center"}, "57188740676": {"Name": "Zographopoulos I.", "AuthorID": "57188740676", "AffiliationID": "60025812", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Thessaly"}}}
