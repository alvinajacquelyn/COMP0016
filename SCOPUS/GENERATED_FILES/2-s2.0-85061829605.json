Powerful tools in the field of genome editing, such as siRNA-mediated RNA interference for targeted suppression of gene expression and transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) and zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs) for DNA repair have been widely used for commercial purposes. However, in the last few years, the discovery of the CRISPR-Cas9 system has revolutionized genome editing and has attracted attention as a powerful tool for several industrial applications. Herein, we review current progresses in the utilization of the CRISPR-Cas9 system in the food and agricultural industry, particularly in the development of resistant crops with improved quality and productivity. We compare the CRISPR system with the TALEN and ZFN nucleases\u2013based methods and highlight potential advantages and shortcomings. In addition, we explore the state of the global market and discuss the safety and ethical concerns associated with the application of this technology in the food and agricultural industry.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Agriculture", "Bioactive compounds", "CRISPR-Cas9", "Food applications", "Plant genome editing", "Single guide RNA"], "IndexKeywords": ["Agricultural industries", "Bioactive compounds", "CRISPR-Cas9", "Essential characteristic", "Food applications", "Plant genomes", "Transcription activators", "Zinc finger nuclease"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85061829605", "SubjectAreas": [["Biotechnology", "BIOC", "1305"], ["Bioengineering", "CENG", "1502"], ["Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology", "IMMU", "2402"]], "AuthorData": {"56507330400": {"Name": "E\u015f I.", "AuthorID": "56507330400", "AffiliationID": "60029570", "AffiliationName": "Department of Material and Bioprocess Engineering, School of Chemical Engineering, University of Campinas (UNICAMP)"}, "52263473800": {"Name": "Gavahian M.", "AuthorID": "52263473800", "AffiliationID": "60072379", "AffiliationName": "Product and Process Research Center, Food Industry Research and Development Institute"}, "57204690469": {"Name": "Marti-Quijal F.", "AuthorID": "57204690469", "AffiliationID": "60002644", "AffiliationName": "Nutrition and Food Science Area, Preventive Medicine and Public Health, Food Science, Toxicology and Forensic Medicine Department, Faculty of Pharmacy, Universitat de Val\u00e8ncia"}, "36190434200": {"Name": "Barba F.", "AuthorID": "36190434200", "AffiliationID": "60002644", "AffiliationName": "Nutrition and Food Science Area, Preventive Medicine and Public Health, Food Science, Toxicology and Forensic Medicine Department, Faculty of Pharmacy, Universitat de Val\u00e8ncia"}, "57195195602": {"Name": "Lorenzo J.", "AuthorID": "57195195602", "AffiliationID": "60122054", "AffiliationName": "Centro Tecnol\u00f3gico de la Carne de Galicia"}, "57203634349": {"Name": "Mousavi Khaneghah A.", "AuthorID": "57203634349", "AffiliationID": "60029570", "AffiliationName": "Department of Food Science, Faculty of Food Engineering, University of Campinas (UNICAMP)"}, "6603925520": {"Name": "Tsatsanis C.", "AuthorID": "6603925520", "AffiliationID": "60012413, 60001524", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Clinical Chemistry, School of Medicine, University of Crete"}, "6602890241": {"Name": "Kampranis S.", "AuthorID": "6602890241", "AffiliationID": "60030840", "AffiliationName": "Biochemical Engineering group, Department of Plant and Environmental Sciences, University of Copenhagen"}}}
