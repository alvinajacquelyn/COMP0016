Further observations included resident males wiping eggs with greatly expanded anal glands, adult-type fighting between juveniles and unusual behaviour where a large male manipulated an empty mollusc shell for the attention of two smaller conspecifics.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Benthic ecology", "Competition", "Observations", "Reproductive behaviours"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aggression", "Animals", "Behavior, Animal", "Male", "Ovum", "Perciformes", "Photography", "Seasons", "Territoriality", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84959547929", "SubjectAreas": [["Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics", "AGRI", "1105"], ["Aquatic Science", "AGRI", "1104"]], "AuthorData": {"57150417000": {"Name": "Naylor P.", "AuthorID": "57150417000", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "36162010000": {"Name": "Jacoby D.", "AuthorID": "36162010000", "AffiliationID": "60005453, 60009498", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Zoology, Zoological Society of London"}}}
