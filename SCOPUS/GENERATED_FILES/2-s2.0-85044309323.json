The ice adhesion strength on 6061 aluminum alloy was measured using a dedicated strength testing apparatus, and the freezing process of water droplets at different initial temperatures of the alloy surface was examined with a microscope. The results of the experiments show that the ice adhesion strength on the aluminum alloy surface at ambient temperature was twice as large as that measured on a colder surface (e.g., \u22125 \u00b0C). Combining the experimental results with the microscopic observation of the freezing process revealed that at high initial surface temperature (i.e. equal to 18 \u00b0C), the water droplets thoroughly spread on the aluminum alloy surface at high temperature, formed a larger contact area. In addition, the initial surface temperature would influence the type of crystallization. Moreover, the advantages and disadvantages of thermal de-icing approaches, widely used in engineering (especially in the high-speed rail and aerospace fields), were discussed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Aluminum alloy", "Contact interface", "Ice adhesion strength", "Initial surface temperature", "Thermal de-icing"], "IndexKeywords": ["6061 aluminum alloys", "Contact interface", "Freezing process", "High temperature", "Ice adhesion strength", "Initial temperatures", "Microscopic observations", "Surface temperatures"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85044309323", "SubjectAreas": [["Geotechnical Engineering and Engineering Geology", "EART", "1909"], ["Earth and Planetary Sciences (all)", "EART", "1900"]], "AuthorData": {"55429884600": {"Name": "Chen T.", "AuthorID": "55429884600", "AffiliationID": "60007711, 60001604", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of Bionic Engineering, Ministry of Education, Jilin University"}, "6603446907": {"Name": "Cong Q.", "AuthorID": "6603446907", "AffiliationID": "60007711", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Automotive Simulation and Control, Jilin University"}, "56883433500": {"Name": "Sun C.", "AuthorID": "56883433500", "AffiliationID": "60007711, 60001604", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of Bionic Engineering, Ministry of Education, Jilin University"}, "55459476100": {"Name": "Jin J.", "AuthorID": "55459476100", "AffiliationID": "60007711, 60001604", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of Bionic Engineering, Ministry of Education, Jilin University"}, "57203183054": {"Name": "Choy K.", "AuthorID": "57203183054", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Materials Discovery, University College London"}}}
