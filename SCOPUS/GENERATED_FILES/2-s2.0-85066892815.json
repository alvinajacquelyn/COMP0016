This generates a paradox: (1) truth is necessary for epistemic acceptability; (2) the claims of science have to be taken literally; (3) much of what science produces is not literally true and yet it is acceptable. We frame Elgin\u2019s project in True Enough as being motivated by, and offering a particular resolution to, this paradox. We discuss the paradox with a focus on scientific models and argue that there is another resolution available which is compatible with retaining veritism: rejecting the idea that scientific models should be interpreted literally.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Elgin", "Epistemology of science", "Explanation", "Idealisation", "Literalism", "Scientific modelling", "Scientific representation", "Understanding", "Veritism"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85066892815", "SubjectAreas": [["Philosophy", "ARTS", "1211"], ["Social Sciences (all)", "SOCI", "3300"]], "AuthorData": {"56246032400": {"Name": "Frigg R.", "AuthorID": "56246032400", "AffiliationID": "60003059", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Philosophy of Natural and Social Science, LSE"}, "57186211800": {"Name": "Nguyen J.", "AuthorID": "57186211800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Philosophy, University College London and Institute of Philosophy, University of London"}}}
