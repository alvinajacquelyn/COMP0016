The selection contains a mixture of material, from essays that have appeared in major journals and books, to some harder-to-find publications. It spans issues from musical meaning, ideology, identity and gender in relation to music education, to changes and challenges in music curricula and pedagogy, and includes Green\u2019s highly influential work on bringing informal learning into formal music education settings. A newly-written introduction considers the relationship between theory and practice, and situates each essay in relation to some of the major influences, within and beyond the field of music education, which affected Green\u2019s own intellectual journey from the 1970s to the present day..", "AuthorKeywords": ["Children\u2019s musical development", "Classical music", "Formal music education", "Informal learning practices", "Informal music learning practices", "Informal popular music learning practices", "Inherent meanings", "Inherent musical meanings", "Large scale social groups", "Music classroom", "Music education", "Music learning practices", "Musical delineation", "Musical identities", "Musical meaning", "Musical practices", "Popular music", "School music classrooms", "Socio-musical group", "Western classical music"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85061468021", "SubjectAreas": [["Arts and Humanities (all)", "ARTS", "1200"]], "AuthorData": {"36771153500": {"Name": "Green L.", "AuthorID": "36771153500", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Education, University of London"}}}
