Several classes of self-assembling gelators have been studied and employ non-covalent bonds to direct assembly, but recently attention has come to focus on how the overall shape of the gelator molecule impacts its gelation. Here we study a new sub-family of low molecular weight organogelators and explore how steric rearrangement influences their gelation. The gels produced are characterised with X-ray diffraction and small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) to probe their ex situ and in situ gelation mechanisms. The best examples were then tested for environmental remediation applications, gelling petrol and oils in the presence of water and salts.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Environmental remediation", "Gelation process", "Gelator molecules", "Low molecular weight", "Organogelators", "Presence of water", "Self-assembling", "Soft material", "Carbamates", "Environmental Restoration and Remediation", "Gels", "Models, Molecular", "Molecular Conformation", "Molecular Weight", "Solvents", "Urea"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85056288912", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"]], "AuthorData": {"55659162000": {"Name": "Peveler W.J.", "AuthorID": "55659162000", "AffiliationID": "60001490", "AffiliationName": "Division of Biomedical Engineering, School of Engineering, University of Glasgow, Rankine Building"}, "57204584856": {"Name": "Packman H.", "AuthorID": "57204584856", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Science and Engineering, South Kensington Campus, Imperial College"}, "57204822068": {"Name": "Alexander S.", "AuthorID": "57204822068", "AffiliationID": "60004572", "AffiliationName": "Energy Safety Research Institute (ESRI), Swansea University, New Bay Campus"}, "57193124654": {"Name": "Chauhan R.R.", "AuthorID": "57193124654", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry Laboratory, University of Oxford"}, "6601987377": {"Name": "Aarts D.G.A.L.", "AuthorID": "6601987377", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry Laboratory, University of Oxford"}, "57189593596": {"Name": "Hayes L.M.", "AuthorID": "57189593596", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "56210619300": {"Name": "Macdonald T.J.", "AuthorID": "56210619300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "7005206877": {"Name": "Cockcroft J.K.", "AuthorID": "7005206877", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "7003437916": {"Name": "Carmalt C.J.", "AuthorID": "7003437916", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "56217400400": {"Name": "Parkin I.P.", "AuthorID": "56217400400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "8596224000": {"Name": "Rogers S.", "AuthorID": "8596224000", "AffiliationID": "60001724, 60009523, 60023254", "AffiliationName": "ISIS-STFC, Rutherford Appleton Laboratory"}, "51160971600": {"Name": "Bear J.C.", "AuthorID": "51160971600", "AffiliationID": "60033359", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Kingston University, Kingston Upon Thames"}}}
