Arguments that the therapy tested was not that routinely delivered in the UK have been fuelled by the arguably scant descriptions of therapy published to date. To inform the important debate about implications of findings, we provide a comprehensive description of therapy delivered in MATISSE. Drawing on accounts of therapists, their supervisors and participants and study documents, we articulate the three models used to deliver therapy. Described as modified studio, phased group and potentially interactive art therapy, the models were differentiated by structure and the degree of interpersonal and types of therapeutic interaction encouraged. Therapists, it seems, began with their \u2018usual\u2019 practice and while remaining true to their ethos, modified that to fit the trial context and participants' needs. Such adaptation is consistent with the principles of pragmatic trials which seek to test interventions in circumstances approximating the \u2018real world\u2019. MATISSE provides a piece of the puzzle but a plurality of evidence is needed before \u2018calling time\u2019 on the debate about the usefulness of art therapy for people diagnosed with schizophrenia.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Art therapy", "group", "models", "process evaluation", "qualitative", "randomised controlled trial"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84922419364", "SubjectAreas": [["Rehabilitation", "MEDI", "2742"], ["Clinical Psychology", "PSYC", "3203"]], "AuthorData": {"55434955000": {"Name": "Waller D.", "AuthorID": "55434955000", "AffiliationID": "60007919", "AffiliationName": "School of Applied Social Science, University of Brighton"}, "6602601081": {"Name": "Killaspy H.", "AuthorID": "6602601081", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "57203219698": {"Name": "Crawford M.", "AuthorID": "57203219698", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Imperial College London"}, "19337442000": {"Name": "Patterson S.", "AuthorID": "19337442000", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
