Published by Oxford University Press for the Infectious Diseases Society of America. All rights reserved.Background. Antiretrovirals (ARVs) affect bone density and turnover, but their effect on risk of fractures and osteonecrosis of the femoral head is less understood. We investigated if exposure to ARVs increases the risk of both bone outcomes. Methods. EuroSIDA participants were followed to assess fractures and osteonecrosis. Poisson regression identified clinical, laboratory and demographic predictors of either bone outcome. Ever, current, and cumulative exposures to ARVs were assessed. Results. During 86118 PYFU among 11820 included persons (median age 41y, 75% male, median baseline CD4 440/mm3, 70.4% virologically suppressed), there were 619 fractures (incidence/1000 PYFU 7.2; 95% CI 6.6-7.7) and 89 osteonecrosis (1.0; 0.8-1.3). Older age, white race, lower BMI, IV drug use, lower baseline CD4, HCV coinfection, prior osteonecrosis, prior fracture, cardiovascular disease, and recent non-AIDS cancer (last 12 months) were associated with fractures. After adjustment, persons who had ever used tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) (1.40; 1.15-1.70) or who were currently on TDF (1.25; 1.05-1.49) had higher incidence of fractures. There was no association between cumulative exposure to TDF and fractures (1.08/5 y exposure; 0.94-1.25). No other ARV was associated with fractures (all P > .1). Risk of osteonecrosis was associated with white race, lower nadir CD4, prior osteonecrosis, prior fracture, and prior AIDS. After mutual adjustment, no ARV was associated with osteonecrosis. Conclusions. In human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, host factors, HIV-specific variables, and comorbidities contribute to risk of fractures and osteonecrosis. Exposure to TDF, but not other ARVs, was an independent risk factor for fractures.", "AuthorKeywords": ["avascular necrosis", "bone", "Fractures", "HIV.", "Osteonecrosis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Anti-HIV Agents", "Bone Density", "CD4 Lymphocyte Count", "Cohort Studies", "Coinfection", "Data Collection", "Europe", "Female", "Femoral Fractures", "Fractures, Bone", "HIV Infections", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Osteonecrosis", "Regression Analysis", "Risk Factors", "Tenofovir"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85019104735", "SubjectAreas": [["Microbiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2726"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"54379858200": {"Name": "Borges \u00c1.H.", "AuthorID": "54379858200", "AffiliationID": "60030840", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Clinical Medicine, University of Copenhagen"}, "35307337700": {"Name": "Lundgren J.D.", "AuthorID": "35307337700", "AffiliationID": "118489361", "AffiliationName": "Centre of Excellence for Health, Immunity and Infections (CHIP), Department of Infectious Diseases"}, "7004417575": {"Name": "Hoy J.", "AuthorID": "7004417575", "AffiliationID": "60019578, 60008014", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infectious Diseases, Alfred Hospital and Monash University"}, "6701464872": {"Name": "Florence E.", "AuthorID": "6701464872", "AffiliationID": "60028863", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Tropical Medicine"}, "57202125317": {"Name": "Sedlacek D.", "AuthorID": "57202125317", "AffiliationID": "60016605", "AffiliationName": "Charles University Hospital Plzen"}, "7005433029": {"Name": "Stellbrink H.J.", "AuthorID": "7005433029", "AffiliationID": "60075812", "AffiliationName": "Infektionsmedizinisches Centrum Hamburg (ICH) Study Center, Innere Medizin"}, "56884779800": {"Name": "Uzdaviniene V.", "AuthorID": "56884779800", "AffiliationID": "60059987", "AffiliationName": "Vilnius University Hospital Santariskiu Klinikos"}, "6603749556": {"Name": "Tomazic J.", "AuthorID": "6603749556", "AffiliationID": "60021479, 60031106", "AffiliationName": "University Medical Centre Ljubljana, Clinic of Infectious Diseases Ljubljana, University of Ljubljana"}, "35069455900": {"Name": "Gargalianos-Kakolyris P.", "AuthorID": "35069455900", "AffiliationID": "60060583", "AffiliationName": "General Hospital of Athens G.
