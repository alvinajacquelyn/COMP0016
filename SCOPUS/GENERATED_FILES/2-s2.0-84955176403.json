KGaA, Weinheim.Structurally diverse natural products from unrelated sources typically require the development of individual synthetic routes. In a novel approach, we have shown that the epidithiodiketopiperazine-derived natural product (\u00b1)-hyalodendrin and the core structure of the unrelated pyrrolidine-derived natural product clausenamide can be synthesised from a common synthetic precursor in good yield by simple variation of the reaction conditions. Structurally unrelated natural products often require individual synthetic routes.
