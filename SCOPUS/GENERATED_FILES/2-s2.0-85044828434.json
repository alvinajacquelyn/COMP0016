Aim To evaluate the impact of provision of TTR results during clinic visits on anticoagulation management. Design Single-centred, randomised controlled study. Setting Fifteen arrhythmia clinics in Hong Kong. Patients AF patients prescribed warfarin. Interventions Provision of TTR or no provision of TTR. Main outcome measures A documented discussion between doctors and patients about switching warfarin to a non-vitamin K oral anticoagulant (NOAC). Results Four hundred and eighty one patients with AF prescribed warfarin were randomly assigned to (1) a TTR provision group or (2) control. Their mean age was 73.6\u00b112.0 years and 60.7% were men. The mean CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score was 3.2\u00b11.6 and the mean HASBLED score was 1.7\u00b11.2. The mean TTR was 63.9%\u00b129.9%. At the index clinic visit, 71 of 481 patients (14.8%) had a documented discussion about switching warfarin to a NOAC. Patients with provision of TTR results were more likely to discuss switching warfarin to a NOAC than controls (19.1% vs 10.6%, P=0.03), especially those with a TTR <65% (35.2% vs 10.6%, P<0.001). A higher proportion of patients with provision of TTR results switched to a NOAC (5.9% vs 4.1%, P=0.49). Conclusions The provision of TTR among patients on warfarin was associated with a discussion about switching from warfarin to a NOAC in those with TTR <65%, but did not result in actual switching to a NOAC, suggesting additional barriers.", "AuthorKeywords": ["atrial fibrillation", "international normalized ratio", "non-Vitamin K oral anticoagulants", "time in therapeutic range", "warfarin"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Anticoagulants", "Atrial Fibrillation", "Drug Administration Schedule", "Female", "Health Services Research", "Hong Kong", "Humans", "International Normalized Ratio", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Stroke", "Time Factors", "Treatment Outcome", "Warfarin"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85044828434", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"56729103800": {"Name": "Huang D.", "AuthorID": "56729103800", "AffiliationID": "60103563, 60006541", "AffiliationName": "Cardiology Division, Department of Medicine, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, University of Hong Kong"}, "52363304600": {"Name": "Chan P.", "AuthorID": "52363304600", "AffiliationID": "60103563, 60006541", "AffiliationName": "Cardiology Division, Department of Medicine, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, University of Hong Kong"}, "57192006871": {"Name": "Wong C.", "AuthorID": "57192006871", "AffiliationID": "60103563, 60006541", "AffiliationName": "Cardiology Division, Department of Medicine, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, University of Hong Kong"}, "56427313900": {"Name": "Ho C.", "AuthorID": "56427313900", "AffiliationID": "60103563, 60006541", "AffiliationName": "Cardiology Division, Department of Medicine, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, University of Hong Kong"}, "7006550690": {"Name": "Siu C.", "AuthorID": "7006550690", "AffiliationID": "60103563, 60006541", "AffiliationName": "Cardiology Division, Department of Medicine, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, University of Hong Kong"}, "57201442031": {"Name": "Wong C.", "AuthorID": "57201442031", "AffiliationID": "60103563, 60006541", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacology and Pharmacy, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, University of Hong Kong"}, "57201441334": {"Name": "Cheng K.", "AuthorID": "57201441334", "AffiliationID": "60103563, 60006541", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacology and Pharmacy, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, University of Hong Kong"}, "7102513915": {"Name": "Wong I.", "AuthorID": "7102513915", "AffiliationID": "60103563, 60006541", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacology and Pharmacy, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, University of Hong Kong"}, "14043219000": {"Name": "Chan E.", "AuthorID": "14043219000", "AffiliationID": "60103563, 60006541", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacology and Pharmacy, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, University of Hong Kong"}, "36106565300": {"Name": "Yue W.", "AuthorID": "36106565300", "AffiliationID": "60017636", "AffiliationName": "Affiliated Hospital of North Sichuan Medical College and Medical Imaging Key Laboratory"}}}
