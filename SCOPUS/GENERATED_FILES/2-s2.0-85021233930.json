Modern light sources have advanced many fields by providing extraordinarily bright, short X-ray pulses. Here we present a novel numerical study, demonstrating that existing third generation light sources can significantly enhance the brightness and photon energy of their X-ray pulses by undulating their beams within plasma wakefields. This study shows that a three order of magnitude increase in X-ray brightness and over an order of magnitude increase in X-ray photon energy is achieved by passing a 3 GeV electron beam through a two-stage plasma insertion device. The production mechanism micro-bunches the electron beam and ensures the pulses are radially polarised on creation. We also demonstrate that the micro-bunched electron beam is itself an effective wakefield driver that can potentially accelerate a witness electron beam up to 6 GeV.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85021233930", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"57192660305": {"Name": "Holloway J.A.", "AuthorID": "57192660305", "AffiliationID": "60023254, 60009523", "AffiliationName": "Central Laser Facility, STFC Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, Harwell Campus"}, "57194610240": {"Name": "Nydell J.", "AuthorID": "57194610240", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "35279041700": {"Name": "Wing M.", "AuthorID": "35279041700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "8351169200": {"Name": "Bartolini R.", "AuthorID": "8351169200", "AffiliationID": "60104663", "AffiliationName": "Diamond Light Source, Harwell Science and Innovation Campus"}, "7404928298": {"Name": "Walker R.", "AuthorID": "7404928298", "AffiliationID": "60104663", "AffiliationName": "Diamond Light Source, Harwell Science and Innovation Campus"}, "24528741800": {"Name": "Norreys P.A.", "AuthorID": "24528741800", "AffiliationID": "60023254, 60009523", "AffiliationName": "Central Laser Facility, STFC Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, Harwell Campus"}, "35475275200": {"Name": "Bingham R.", "AuthorID": "35475275200", "AffiliationID": "60024724", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of Strathclyde"}, "9636056500": {"Name": "Trines R.M.G.M.", "AuthorID": "9636056500", "AffiliationID": "60023254, 60009523", "AffiliationName": "Central Laser Facility, STFC Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, Harwell Campus"}, "9241106700": {"Name": "Thomas A.G.R.", "AuthorID": "9241106700", "AffiliationID": "60025778", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nuclear Engineering and Radiological Sciences, University of Michigan"}}}
