Molecular and murine studies strongly suggest that ACPs are simple tumours initiated by mutations in \u03b2-catenin leading to the over-activation of the WNT pathway. ACPs, mostly in case of tumours with hypothalamic involvement, are associated with a high degree of morbidity and reduced 20-year overall survival. Quality of survival in patients with hypothalamic involvement is impaired by severe obesity, physical fatigue, severe neuroendocrine deficits, and nonoptimal psychosocial development. Current treatments include surgery followed by radiotherapy, but these are not always curative and can also be associated with high morbidity. Long-term follow-up studies suggest that for favourably localized tumours, the preferred treatment of choice is to attempt complete resection with preservation of visual, hypothalamic, and pituitary function, whilst incomplete resection is recommended for tumours with invasion of optic and/or hypothalamic structures. Hypothalamic obesity has a significant impact on long-term quality of survival and is the most frequent sequelae in patients with hypothalamic involvement. However, no therapy for ACP patients with hypothalamic obesity has been proven to be effective in randomized trials. In this chapter, we present recent findings on the biology of human ACP and discuss clinical data of relevance for the physicians managing ACP patients.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Brain tumours", "Craniopharyngioma", "Hypothalamic obesity", "Irradiation", "Neurocognitive", "Neurosurgery", "Pituitary deficiency", "Quality of life", "Recurrence", "Sleep"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85064744071", "SubjectAreas": [["Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism", "MEDI", "2712"], ["Endocrinology", "BIOC", "1310"]], "AuthorData": {"7404944594": {"Name": "M\u00fcller H.L.", "AuthorID": "7404944594", "AffiliationID": "60020306, 60076291", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatrics and Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Klinikum Oldenburg A\u00f6R, Medical Campus University Oldenburg"}, "6603565499": {"Name": "Martinez-Barbera J.P.", "AuthorID": "6603565499", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, Developmental Biology and Cancer, Birth Defects Research Centre"}}}
