Methods: The sample comprised 6529 participants in the Whitehall II study who were measured serially between 1991\u20131994 and 2012\u20132013. Baseline weight (non-obese or obese; body mass index (BMI) \u226530 kg/m2) and health status (healthy or unhealthy; two or more of hypertension, low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), high triglycerides, high glucose, and high homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR)) were defined. The relationships of baseline weight/health status with 20-year trajectories summarizing ~25,000 observations of systolic and diastolic blood pressures, HDL-C, triglycerides, glucose, and HOMA-IR were investigated using multilevel models. Relationships of baseline weight/health status with all-cause mortality up until July 2015 were investigated using Cox proportional hazards regression. Results: Trajectories tended to be consistently worse for the MHO group compared to the healthy non-obese group (e.g., glucose by 0.21 (95% CI 0.09, 0.33; p < 0.001) mmol/L at 20-years of follow-up). Consequently, the MHO group had a greater risk of mortality (hazard ratio 2.11 (1.24, 3.58; p = 0.006)) when the referent group comprised a random sample of healthy non-obese individuals. This estimate, however, attenuated (1.34 (0.85, 2.13; p = 0.209)) when the referent group was matched to the MHO group on baseline risk factors. Conclusions: Worse baseline risk factors may explain any difference in mortality risk between obese and non-obese groups both labelled as healthy, further challenging the concept of MHO.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Body Weight", "Body-Weight Trajectory", "Case-Control Studies", "Female", "Health Status", "Healthy Volunteers", "Humans", "Longitudinal Studies", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Obesity, Metabolically Benign", "Proportional Hazards Models", "Risk Factors", "Surveys and Questionnaires"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85052524219", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (miscellaneous)", "MEDI", "2701"], ["Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism", "MEDI", "2712"], ["Nutrition and Dietetics", "NURS", "2916"]], "AuthorData": {"57192175387": {"Name": "Johnson W.", "AuthorID": "57192175387", "AffiliationID": "60000891", "AffiliationName": "School of Sport, Exercise and Health Sciences, Loughborough University"}, "57201353650": {"Name": "Robson E.", "AuthorID": "57201353650", "AffiliationID": "60000891", "AffiliationName": "School of Sport, Exercise and Health Sciences, Loughborough University"}, "8502496600": {"Name": "Hamer M.", "AuthorID": "8502496600", "AffiliationID": "60000891", "AffiliationName": "School of Sport, Exercise and Health Sciences, Loughborough University"}, "55762450800": {"Name": "Bell J.A.", "AuthorID": "55762450800", "AffiliationID": "60020650, 60172455", "AffiliationName": "MRC Integrative Epidemiology Unit at the University of Bristol"}, "55930436300": {"Name": "Norris T.", "AuthorID": "55930436300", "AffiliationID": "60033125", "AffiliationName": "Department of Health Sciences, University of Leicester"}, "7004391239": {"Name": "Kivim\u00e4ki M.", "AuthorID": "7004391239", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}}}
