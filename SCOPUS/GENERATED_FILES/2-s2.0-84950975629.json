Neurogranin and YKL-40 in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) are newly discovered markers indicating synaptic damage and microglial activation, respectively. Methods: CSF samples from 95 individuals including 39 patients with AD dementia (AD-D), 13 with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to AD (MCI-AD), 29 with MCI not due to AD (MCI-o) and 14 patients with non-AD dementias (non-AD-D) were analyzed for neurogranin and YKL-40. Results: Patients with dementia or MCI due to AD showed elevated levels of CSF neurogranin (p < 0.001 for AD-D and p < 0.05 for MCI-AD) and YKL-40 (p < 0.05 for AD-D and p = 0.15 for MCI-AD) compared to mildly cognitively impaired subjects not diagnosed with AD. CSF levels of neurogranin and YKL-40 did not differ between MCI not due to AD and non-AD dementias. In AD subjects no correlation between YKL-40 and neurogranin was found. The CSF neurogranin levels correlated moderately with tau and p-tau but not with A\u03b242 or the MMSE in AD samples. No relevant associations between YKL-40 and MMSE or the core AD biomarkers, A\u03b242, t-tau and p-tau were found in AD subjects. Conclusions: Neurogranin and YKL-40 are promising AD biomarkers, independent of and complementary to the established core AD biomarkers, reflecting additional pathological changes in the course of AD.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adipokines", "Aged", "Alzheimer Disease", "Amyloid beta-Peptides", "Biomarkers", "Chitinase-3-Like Protein 1", "Cognitive Dysfunction", "Disease Progression", "Female", "Humans", "Lectins", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Neurogranin", "tau Proteins"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84950975629", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"]], "AuthorData": {"56702388500": {"Name": "Hellwig K.", "AuthorID": "56702388500", "AffiliationID": "60029931, 60000765", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, University Clinic Erlangen, Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen-N\u00fcrnberg"}, "56192986900": {"Name": "Oberstein T.", "AuthorID": "56192986900", "AffiliationID": "60029931, 60000765", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, University Clinic Erlangen, Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen-N\u00fcrnberg"}, "55156917800": {"Name": "Lewczuk P.", "AuthorID": "55156917800", "AffiliationID": "60026724", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurodegeneration Diagnostics, Medical University of Bia\u0142ystok"}, "7007179429": {"Name": "Kornhuber J.", "AuthorID": "7007179429", "AffiliationID": "60029931, 60000765", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, University Clinic Erlangen, Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen-N\u00fcrnberg"}, "6601977908": {"Name": "Maler J.", "AuthorID": "6601977908", "AffiliationID": "60029931, 60000765", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, University Clinic Erlangen, Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen-N\u00fcrnberg"}, "22951538500": {"Name": "Spitzer P.", "AuthorID": "22951538500", "AffiliationID": "60029931, 60000765", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, University Clinic Erlangen, Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen-N\u00fcrnberg"}, "56520148100": {"Name": "Kvartsberg H.", "AuthorID": "56520148100", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "AlzeCure Foundation, Karolinska Institutet Science Park"}, "12806782700": {"Name": "Portelius E.", "AuthorID": "12806782700", "AffiliationID": "60027675, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Neurochemistry Laboratory, Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, Department of Psychiatry and Neurochemistry, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg"}, "6507790467": {"Name": "Andreasson U.", "AuthorID": "6507790467", "AffiliationID": "60027675, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Neurochemistry Laboratory, Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, Department of Psychiatry and Neurochemistry, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg"}, "56415176000": {"Name": "Blennow K.", "AuthorID": "56415176000", "AffiliationID": "60027675, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Neurochemistry Laboratory, Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, Department of Psychiatry and Neurochemistry, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg"}, "6701454676": {"Name": "Zetterberg H.", "AuthorID": "6701454676", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology"}}}
