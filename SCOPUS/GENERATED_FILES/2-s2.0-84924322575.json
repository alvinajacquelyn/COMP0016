Is there one brain system for all languages or are different languages subserved by different brain systems? The first view emphasizes commonality, whereas the second emphasizes specificity. We investigated the cortical dynamics involved in processing two very diverse languages: a tonal language (Chinese) and a nontonal language (English). We used functional MRI and dynamic causal modeling analysis to compute and compare brain network models exhaustively with all possible connections among nodes of language regions in temporal and frontal cortex and found that the information flow from the posterior to anterior portions of the temporal cortex was commonly shared by Chinese and English speakers during speech comprehension, whereas the inferior frontal gyrus received neural signals from the left posterior portion of the temporal cortex in English speakers and from the bilateral anterior portion of the temporal cortex in Chinese speakers. Our results revealed that, although speech processing is largely carried out in the common left hemisphere classical language areas (Broca's and Wernicke's areas) and anterior temporal cortex, speech comprehension across different language groups depends on how these brain regions interact with each other. Moreover, the right anterior temporal cortex, which is crucial for tone processing, is equally important as its left homolog, the left anterior temporal cortex, in modulating the cortical dynamics in tone language comprehension. The current study pinpoints the importance of the bilateral anterior temporal cortex in language comprehension that is downplayed or even ignored by popular contemporary models of speech comprehension.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cortical dynamics", "Functional MRI", "Speech perception", "Tonal language"], "IndexKeywords": ["Brain", "Humans", "Language", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Speech"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84924322575", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"23492143200": {"Name": "Ge J.", "AuthorID": "23492143200", "AffiliationID": "60014966", "AffiliationName": "Beijing City Key Lab for Medical Physics and Engineering, School of Physics, Peking University"}, "56541442600": {"Name": "Lyu B.", "AuthorID": "56541442600", "AffiliationID": "60014966", "AffiliationName": "Beijing City Key Lab for Medical Physics and Engineering, School of Physics, Peking University"}, "56305199400": {"Name": "Wang Y.", "AuthorID": "56305199400", "AffiliationID": "60014966", "AffiliationName": "Beijing City Key Lab for Medical Physics and Engineering, School of Physics, Peking University"}, "7404475674": {"Name": "Gao J.H.", "AuthorID": "7404475674", "AffiliationID": "60014966, 60100145", "AffiliationName": "McGovern Institute for Brain Research, Peking University"}, "26540540500": {"Name": "Peng G.", "AuthorID": "26540540500", "AffiliationID": "60102083, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "7005221392": {"Name": "Zhuo Y.", "AuthorID": "7005221392", "AffiliationID": "60019499", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Brain and Cognitive Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "23393033800": {"Name": "Niu Z.", "AuthorID": "23393033800", "AffiliationID": "60016835", "AffiliationName": "School of Computer Science and Technology, Beijing Institute of Technology"}, "7402233462": {"Name": "Tan L.H.", "AuthorID": "7402233462", "AffiliationID": "60000937", "AffiliationName": "Guangdong Key Laboratory of Biomedical Information Detection and Ultrasound Imaging"}, "57216595043": {"Name": "Leff A.P.", "AuthorID": "57216595043", "AffiliationID": "60109771, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, University College London"}}}
