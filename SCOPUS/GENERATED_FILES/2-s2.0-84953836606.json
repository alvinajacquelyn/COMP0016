Published by Taylor & Francis.This article critically analyses the debates which have unfolded in the aftermath of the Scottish independence referendum of 18 September 2014 concerning the constitutional arrangements of the UK as a plurinational state and the internal governmental structure of England. The debates unfolding in the UK reflect and illustrate two central themes in planning, territorial development and public policy. First, they highlight the contested distribution of power across multiple layers of government in states with an inherited centralized pattern of governance that are now facing strengthening regionalist and nationalist claims. Second, they illustrate the linked growth in the demand for new governance and strategic planning arrangements in large metropolitan areas with fragmented administrative and institutional boundaries. The article first discusses what the outcome of the Scottish referendum (and its aftermath) means for planning in Scotland. It then turns to the debates on devolution in the rest of UK which were stoked in the wake of the referendum, looking at the planning implications of further devolution in Northern Ireland and Wales, and at the possible consequences of the various options currently being aired to solve the \u2018English question\u2019. Finally, ongoing debates on decentralization to regions and city-regions in England are briefly considered.", "AuthorKeywords": ["city-regions", "decentralization", "devolution", "England", "Northern Ireland", "regionalism", "Scotland", "spatial planning", "strategic planning", "sub-state nationalism", "UK", "Wales"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84953836606", "SubjectAreas": [["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"]], "AuthorData": {"20733551300": {"Name": "Colomb C.", "AuthorID": "20733551300", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "The Bartlett School of Planning, University College London (UCL)"}, "6602813676": {"Name": "Tomaney J.", "AuthorID": "6602813676", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "The Bartlett School of Planning, University College London (UCL)"}}}
