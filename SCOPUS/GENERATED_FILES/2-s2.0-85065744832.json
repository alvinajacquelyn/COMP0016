Host immune- and stromal-cell genetic and epigenetic signatures in response to the invading pathogen shape disease pathophysiology and disease outcomes. Directly linked to the immunometabolic axis is the role of the host microbiome, which is also discussed here in the context of productive immune responses to lung infections. We also present host-directed therapies (HDT) as a clinically viable strategy to refocus dysregulated immunometabolism in patients with infectious diseases, which requires validation in early phase clinical trials as adjuncts to conventional antimicrobial therapy. These efforts are expected to be continuously supported by newly generated basic and translational research data to gain a better understanding of disease pathology while devising new molecularly defined platforms and therapeutic options to improve the treatment of patients with pulmonary infections, particularly in relation to multidrug-resistant pathogens.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Immunological memory", "Immunometabolism", "Inflammation", "Lung infections", "Protective immune responses"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85065744832", "SubjectAreas": [["Microbiology", "IMMU", "2404"], ["Microbiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2726"]], "AuthorData": {"57216111663": {"Name": "Rao M.", "AuthorID": "57216111663", "AffiliationID": "60113882", "AffiliationName": "ImmunoSurgery Unit, Champalimaud Centre for the Unknown"}, "7004422039": {"Name": "Maeurer M.", "AuthorID": "7004422039", "AffiliationID": "60010405", "AffiliationName": "Department of Oncology and Haematology, Krankenhaus Nordwest"}, "55546020300": {"Name": "Dodoo E.", "AuthorID": "55546020300", "AffiliationID": "60010405", "AffiliationName": "Department of Oncology and Haematology, Krankenhaus Nordwest"}, "7006170723": {"Name": "Zumla A.", "AuthorID": "7006170723", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London, NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
