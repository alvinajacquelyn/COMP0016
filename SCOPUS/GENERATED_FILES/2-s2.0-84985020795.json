The motivation was a realization that most of the conferences and events that we currently organize are inherently retrospective - that is to say, they are reporting on work that has already been performed. There seemed, therefore, to be a niche for an event that encourages participants to look forward, to speculate and even to argue on the advances that will need to be made over the next ten, twenty years or even further into the future, and what the key challenges might be. This should be more than an academic exercise, of course - the results would be of interest to many parties, including governments, funding agencies, and research program managers.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Funding agencies", "Look-forward", "News information", "Professional meetings", "Radar technology", "Research programs", "University College London"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84985020795", "SubjectAreas": [["Aerospace Engineering", "ENGI", "2202"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"7202821654": {"Name": "Griffiths H.", "AuthorID": "7202821654", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "57190985285": {"Name": "Stewart C.", "AuthorID": "57190985285", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
