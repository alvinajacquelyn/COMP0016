Objective/methods: We assessed the presence and avidity of TFPI IgG antibodies, associations with protein C IgG antibodies and associations with clinical disease severity, in 50 patients with thrombotic APS and 50 thrombotic control patients, on long term anticoagulation with warfarin. Results: Thrombotic APS patients had a significantly higher prevalence of TFPI IgG antibodies (40%; 20/50) compared to thrombotic controls (18%; 9/50). TFPI antibodies were predominantly high avidity in APS (50%, 10/20 of positive patients) and strongly associated with a severe thrombotic phenotype (venous and arterial thromboembolism or recurrent thromboembolic episodes despite therapeutic anticoagulation) (odds ratio (OR): 12.0, 95%CI: 2.2\u201366.1, p = 0.004), while thrombotic control patients mainly showed low avidity antibodies (78%, 7/9 of positive patients). Coexistence of TFPI and protein C IgG antibodies, regardless of their avidity, was strongly associated with a more severe thrombotic phenotype in APS patients (OR: 20.2, 95%CI: 2.0\u201347.0, p < 0.0001) and also in thrombotic controls (OR: 75.0, 95%CI 1.2\u2013195, p = 0.02). Conclusions: Coexistent TFPI and protein C IgG antibodies, irrespective of their avidity, may be a useful marker for a severe thrombotic phenotype in thrombotic patients. This suggests a possibly pathophysiological relationship between the two antibodies, predisposing to thrombosis with a possibly more general role in the development of thrombotic complications.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Antibodies", "Antiphospholipid syndrome", "Protein C", "TFPI", "Thrombosis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Antiphospholipid Syndrome", "Blood Coagulation Tests", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Female", "Humans", "Lipoproteins", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Phenotype", "Protein C"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85051479518", "SubjectAreas": [["Hematology", "MEDI", "2720"]], "AuthorData": {"24279560200": {"Name": "Efthymiou M.", "AuthorID": "24279560200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Haemostasis Research Unit, Department of Haematology, University College London"}, "55670326600": {"Name": "Arachchillage D.R.J.", "AuthorID": "55670326600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Haemostasis Research Unit, Department of Haematology, University College London"}, "56591726900": {"Name": "Lane P.J.", "AuthorID": "56591726900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Haemostasis Research Unit, Department of Haematology, University College London"}, "7402809618": {"Name": "Cohen H.", "AuthorID": "7402809618", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7101821252": {"Name": "Mackie I.J.", "AuthorID": "7101821252", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Haemostasis Research Unit, Department of Haematology, University College London"}, "52164155000": {"Name": "O'Keeffe A.G.", "AuthorID": "52164155000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Statistical Science, University College London"}, "56042622600": {"Name": "McDonnell T.", "AuthorID": "56042622600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Rheumatology, Division of Medicine, University College London, Rayne Institute"}}}
