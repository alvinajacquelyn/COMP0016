Aberrant awareness of externally applied stimuli in terms of altered sensory perception thresholds might contribute to these sensory phenomena in GTS. Methods: We used the well-established and standardized \"Quantitative Sensory Testing\" (QST) battery (German Research Network on Neuropathic Pain) to investigate 13 sensory parameters including thermal, mechanical/tactile and pain thresholds in 14 GTS patients without clinically significant comorbidities and 14 healthy controls matched for age and gender. Results: There were no relevant group differences in any of the 13 QST parameters and no specific QST pattern in GTS patients. There was no correlation between QST parameters and \"Premonitory Urge for Tics scale\" (PUTS) scores. Conclusion: Our data show that the perceptual threshold detection of externally applied sensory stimuli is normal in adults with GTS. This indicates that other perceptual mechanisms, such as abnormal central sensorimotor processing and/or aberrant interoceptive awareness might underlie the clinically significant sensory abnormalities in GTS.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Premonitory sensations", "Quantitative Sensory Testing", "Sensory", "Thresholds", "Tourette syndrome"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Case-Control Studies", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Sensation Disorders", "Sensory Thresholds", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "Tourette Syndrome", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84958866571", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Geriatrics and Gerontology", "MEDI", "2717"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"55320683500": {"Name": "Schunke O.", "AuthorID": "55320683500", "AffiliationID": "60005036", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf"}, "55866013600": {"Name": "Grashorn W.", "AuthorID": "55866013600", "AffiliationID": "60005036", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf"}, "55321056300": {"Name": "Kahl U.", "AuthorID": "55321056300", "AffiliationID": "60005036", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf"}, "37101265800": {"Name": "Ganos C.", "AuthorID": "37101265800", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Sobell Department of Motor Neuroscience and Movement Disorders, UCL Institute of Neurology Queen Square"}, "7005933195": {"Name": "Haggard P.", "AuthorID": "7005933195", "AffiliationID": "60109771, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, University College London"}, "55230575800": {"Name": "M\u00fcnchau A.", "AuthorID": "55230575800", "AffiliationID": "60012408", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric and Adult Movement Disorders and Neuropsychiatry, Institute of Neurogenetics, University of Luebeck"}, "11240417300": {"Name": "Bingel U.", "AuthorID": "11240417300", "AffiliationID": "60007896, 60014264", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, University Hospital Essen, University Duisburg-Essen"}, "12788396100": {"Name": "Sch\u00f6ttle D.", "AuthorID": "12788396100", "AffiliationID": "60005036", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf"}}}
