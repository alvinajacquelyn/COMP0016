In order to enhance galaxy features buried in the noise, we use a noise reduction filter based on the total generalized variation regularizator. This method allows us to detect and resolve very faint morphological features, including spiral arms, with a high visual contrast. For the first time, we can appreciate an optical image of Malin 1 and its morphology in full view. The images provide unprecedented detail, compared to those obtained in the past with photographic plates and CCD, including Hubble Space Telescope imaging. We detect two peculiar features in the disk/spiral arms. The analysis suggests that the first one is possibly a background galaxy, and the second is an apparent stream without a clear nature, but could be related to the claimed past interaction between Malin 1 and the galaxy SDSSJ123708.91+142253.2. Malin 1 exhibits features suggesting the presence of stellar associations and clumps of molecular gas, not seen before with such a clarity. Using these images, we obtain a diameter for Malin 1 of 160 kpc, \u223c50 kpc larger than previous estimates. A simple analysis shows that the observed spiral arms reach very low luminosity and mass surface densities, to levels much lower than the corresponding values for the Milky Way.", "AuthorKeywords": ["galaxies: general", "galaxies: spiral", "techniques: image processing"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84951766889", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"6602362744": {"Name": "Galaz G.", "AuthorID": "6602362744", "AffiliationID": "60029681", "AffiliationName": "Instituto de Astrof\u00edsica, Pontificia Universidad Cat\u00f3lica de Chile"}, "55504918400": {"Name": "Suc V.", "AuthorID": "55504918400", "AffiliationID": "60007592", "AffiliationName": "Centre for the Development of Sensors, Instruments and Systems, UPC-BarcelonaTech"}, "57021673500": {"Name": "Lizana G.", "AuthorID": "57021673500", "AffiliationID": "60029681", "AffiliationName": "Instituto de Astrof\u00edsica, Pontificia Universidad Cat\u00f3lica de Chile"}, "7003990308": {"Name": "Infante L.", "AuthorID": "7003990308", "AffiliationID": "60029681", "AffiliationName": "Centro de Astro-Ingenier\u00eda, Pontificia Universidad Cat\u00f3lica de Chile"}, "55751317800": {"Name": "Milovic C.", "AuthorID": "55751317800", "AffiliationID": "113645895", "AffiliationName": "PixInsight Development Team, Pleiades Astrophoto S.L."}, "6701720058": {"Name": "Royo S.", "AuthorID": "6701720058", "AffiliationID": "60007592", "AffiliationName": "Centre for the Development of Sensors, Instruments and Systems, UPC-BarcelonaTech"}, "57021863500": {"Name": "Busta L.", "AuthorID": "57021863500", "AffiliationID": "60009999", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Astro and Particle Physics, Universitat Innsbruck"}}}
