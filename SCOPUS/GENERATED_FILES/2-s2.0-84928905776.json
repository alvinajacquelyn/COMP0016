Experiments were performed using deformed metal specimens heated in-situ while mounted at the sample position of the High Resolution Powder Diffractometer, HRPD (ISIS Facility), UK. Monitoring the breadth of the resulting Bragg lines during heating not only allows the time-dependence (or temperature-dependence) of the stored energy to be determined but also the recrystallized fraction. The analysis method presented here was developed using pure nickel (Ni270) specimens with different deformation levels from 0.29 to 0.94. In situ temperature ramping as well as isothermal annealing was undertaken. The method developed in this work allows accurate and quantitative monitoring of the recrystallization process. The results from neutron diffraction are satisfactorily compared to data obtained from calorimetry and hardness measurements.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Elastic energy release", "Hardness measurement", "High resolution powder diffractometer", "In-situ measurement", "In-situ temperature", "Quantitative monitoring", "Recrystallization process", "Temperature dependence"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84928905776", "SubjectAreas": [["Instrumentation", "PHYS", "3105"]], "AuthorData": {"6603486280": {"Name": "Christien F.", "AuthorID": "6603486280", "AffiliationID": "60032006, 60020658, 60008134", "AffiliationName": "Institut des Mat\u00e9riaux Jean Rouxel (IMN), Universit\u00e9 de Nantes, CNRS"}, "7003682737": {"Name": "Le Gall R.", "AuthorID": "7003682737", "AffiliationID": "60032006, 60020658, 60008134", "AffiliationName": "Institut des Mat\u00e9riaux Jean Rouxel (IMN), Universit\u00e9 de Nantes, CNRS"}, "6603956536": {"Name": "Telling M.T.F.", "AuthorID": "6603956536", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials, University of Oxford"}, "7202745497": {"Name": "Knight K.S.", "AuthorID": "7202745497", "AffiliationID": "60025352", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, Natural History Museum"}}}
