All rights reserved.Background In the UK, free smoking cessation support is available to pregnant women; only a minority accesses this. \u2018Opt-out\u2019 referrals to stop smoking services (SSS) are recommended by UK guidelines. These involve identifying pregnant smokers using exhaled carbon monoxide (CO) and referring them for support unless they object. Methods To assess the impact of \u2018opt-out\u2019 referrals for pregnant smokers on SSS uptake and effectiveness, we conducted a \u2018before\u2013after\u2019 service development evaluation. In the 6-month \u2018before\u2019 period, there was a routine \u2018opt-in\u2019 referral system for self-reported smokers at antenatal \u2018booking\u2019 appointments. In the 6-month \u2018after\u2019 period, additional \u2018opt-out\u2019 referrals were introduced at the 12-week ultrasound appointments; women with CO\u22654 ppm were referred to, and outcome data were collected from, local SSS. Results Approximately 2300 women attended antenatal care in each period. Before the implementation, 536 (23.4%) women reported smoking at \u2018booking\u2019 and 290 (12.7%) were referred to SSS. After the implementation, 524 (22.9%) women reported smoking at \u2018booking\u2019, an additional 156 smokers (6.8%) were identified via the \u2018opt-out\u2019 referrals and, in total, 421 (18.4%) were referred to SSS. Over twice as many women set a quit date with the SSS after \u2018opt-out\u2019 referrals were implemented (121 (5.3%, 95% CI 4.4% to 6.3%) compared to 57 (2.5%, 95% CI 1.9% to 3.2%) before implementation) and reported being abstinent 4 weeks later (93 (4.1%, 95% CI 3.3% to 4.9%) compared to 46 (2.0%, 1.5% to 2.7%) before implementation). Conclusions In a hospital with an \u2018opt-in\u2019 referral system, adding CO screening with \u2018opt-out\u2019 referrals as women attended ultrasound examinations doubled the numbers of pregnant smokers setting quit dates and reporting smoking cessation.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Carbon Monoxide", "Female", "Humans", "Pregnancy", "Pregnancy Complications", "Prenatal Care", "Referral and Consultation", "Smoking", "Smoking Cessation", "United Kingdom", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84971553958", "SubjectAreas": [["Health (social science)", "SOCI", "3306"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"56995548800": {"Name": "Campbell K.A.", "AuthorID": "56995548800", "AffiliationID": "60015138, 60115380", "AffiliationName": "Division of Primary Care, School of Medicine, UK Centre for Tobacco and Alcohol Studies, University of Nottingham"}, "14419818900": {"Name": "Cooper S.", "AuthorID": "14419818900", "AffiliationID": "60015138, 60115380", "AffiliationName": "Division of Primary Care, School of Medicine, UK Centre for Tobacco and Alcohol Studies, University of Nottingham"}, "36604282600": {"Name": "Fahy S.J.", "AuthorID": "36604282600", "AffiliationID": "60015138, 60115380", "AffiliationName": "Division of Primary Care, School of Medicine, UK Centre for Tobacco and Alcohol Studies, University of Nottingham"}, "56152664400": {"Name": "Bowker K.", "AuthorID": "56152664400", "AffiliationID": "60015138, 60115380", "AffiliationName": "Division of Primary Care, School of Medicine, UK Centre for Tobacco and Alcohol Studies, University of Nottingham"}, "56312180800": {"Name": "Whitemore R.", "AuthorID": "56312180800", "AffiliationID": "60015138, 60115380", "AffiliationName": "Division of Primary Care, School of Medicine, UK Centre for Tobacco and Alcohol Studies, University of Nottingham"}, "7202770226": {"Name": "Coleman T.", "AuthorID": "7202770226", "AffiliationID": "60015138, 60115380", "AffiliationName": "Division of Primary Care, School of Medicine, UK Centre for Tobacco and Alcohol Studies, University of Nottingham"}, "6507135163": {"Name": "Leonardi-Bee J.", "AuthorID": "6507135163", "AffiliationID": "60015138, 60115380", "AffiliationName": "Division of Epidemiology and Public Health, School of Medicine, UK Centre for Tobacco and Alcohol Studies, University of Nottingham"}, "57216283722": {"Name": "McEwen A.", "AuthorID": "57216283722", "AffiliationID": "109896616", "AffiliationName": "National Centre for Smoking Cessation and Training (NCSCT)"}}}
