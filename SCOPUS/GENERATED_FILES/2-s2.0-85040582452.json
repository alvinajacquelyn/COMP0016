Currently, little is known about the neural correlates of risk-taking in children exposed to maltreatment, nor whether their risk-taking is atypically modulated by peer influence. Seventy-five 10-to 14-year-old children [maltreated (MT) group: N=41; non-maltreated Group (NMT): N=34] performed a Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART), under three different peer influence conditions: while alone, while being observed by a peer and while being encouraged by a peer to take risks. The MT group engaged in less risk-taking irrespective of peer influence. There was no differential effect of peer influence on risk-taking behaviour across groups. At the neural level, the right anterior insula (rAI) exhibited altered risk sensitivity across conditions in the MT group. Across groups and conditions, rAI risk sensitivity was negatively associated with risk-taking and within the MT group greater rAI risk sensitivity was related to more anxiety symptoms. These findings suggest that children with a history of maltreatment show reduced risk-taking but typical responses to peer influence. Abnormal rAI functioning contributes to the pattern of reduced risk-taking and may predispose children exposed to maltreatment to develop future psychopathology.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Childhood maltreatment", "FMRI", "Risk-taking, peer influence"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Anxiety", "Cerebral Cortex", "Child", "Child Abuse", "Female", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Peer Influence", "Psychopathology", "Risk Factors", "Risk-Taking", "Ventral Striatum"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85040582452", "SubjectAreas": [["Experimental and Cognitive Psychology", "PSYC", "3205"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"]], "AuthorData": {"56494150200": {"Name": "Hoffmann F.", "AuthorID": "56494150200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychology and Language Sciences, University College London"}, "56177889700": {"Name": "Puetz V.B.", "AuthorID": "56177889700", "AffiliationID": "60170329", "AffiliationName": "Anna Freud National Centre for Children and Families"}, "23091807800": {"Name": "Viding E.", "AuthorID": "23091807800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychology and Language Sciences, University College London"}, "57189028228": {"Name": "Sethi A.", "AuthorID": "57189028228", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychology and Language Sciences, University College London"}, "54179599700": {"Name": "Palmer A.", "AuthorID": "54179599700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychology and Language Sciences, University College London"}, "6602910723": {"Name": "McCrory E.J.", "AuthorID": "6602910723", "AffiliationID": "60170329", "AffiliationName": "Anna Freud National Centre for Children and Families"}}}
