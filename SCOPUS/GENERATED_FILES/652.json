Synthetic primary and secondary transit spectra for a range of planets are passed through EChOSim [13] to obtain the expected level of noise for different observational scenarios; these are then used as inputs for the NEMESIS atmospheric retrieval code and the retrieved atmospheric properties (temperature structure, composition and cloud properties) compared with the known input values, following the method of [1]. To correctly retrieve the temperature structure and composition of the atmosphere to within 2 \u03c3, we find that we require: a single transit or eclipse of a hot Jupiter orbiting a sun-like (G2) star at 35 pc to constrain the terminator and dayside atmospheres; 20 transits or eclipses of a warm Jupiter orbiting a similar star; 10 transits/eclipses of a hot Neptune orbiting an M dwarf at 6 pc; and 30 transits or eclipses of a GJ1214b-like planet.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Atmospheric remote sensing", "Exoplanets", "Retrieval", "Spectroscopy"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84952986116", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"55660948300": {"Name": "Barstow J.", "AuthorID": "55660948300", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of Oxford"}, "8372115100": {"Name": "Bowles N.", "AuthorID": "8372115100", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of Oxford"}, "17345076900": {"Name": "Aigrain S.", "AuthorID": "17345076900", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of Oxford"}, "12647363200": {"Name": "Fletcher L.", "AuthorID": "12647363200", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of Oxford"}, "7101824727": {"Name": "Irwin P.", "AuthorID": "7101824727", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of Oxford"}, "56201717600": {"Name": "Varley R.", "AuthorID": "56201717600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University College London"}, "7004264570": {"Name": "Pascale E.", "AuthorID": "7004264570", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "School of Physics and Astronomy, University of Cardiff"}}}
