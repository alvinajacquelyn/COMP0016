This has been in four main areas in ophthalmology: ocular surface reconstruction, lens replacement, vitreous replacement and structural support and cell transplantation in the retina. Corneal replacement therapies have been developed using both synthetic acrylic-based materials and more recently naturally derived materials such as amniotic membrane. Intraocular lenses as a replacement for the natural lens post cataract surgery has been used for many years. Newer developments include the opportunity to use gels so that the lenses can accommodate but these need improving in terms of the cross-linking chemistry. Silicone oils have been used as long-term tamponade agents as vitreous replacements but recent developments in their properties has enhanced the clinical outcomes and further research into their use as drug delivery vehicles will be a major advancement. Regenerative medicine therapies to repopulate the retina to repair and replace specific cell layers require the optimisation of synthetic scaffolds and this is a major area for development. Recent developments in biomaterials have emphasised the importance of the physical, chemical and mechanical properties specific to a particular ophthalmic application. Materials science has a critical role in developing strategies to overcome vision loss.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Cataract surgeries", "Cell transplantation", "Developing strategy", "Drug delivery vehicles", "Regenerative medicine", "Structural support", "Synthetic materials", "Synthetic scaffolds"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84988286084", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Mechanics of Materials", "ENGI", "2211"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"]], "AuthorData": {"55915044300": {"Name": "Lace R.", "AuthorID": "55915044300", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Department of Eye and Vision Science, University of Liverpool"}, "55481156800": {"Name": "Williams R.", "AuthorID": "55481156800", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Department of Eye and Vision Science, University of Liverpool"}, "36559857200": {"Name": "Murray-Dunning C.", "AuthorID": "36559857200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomaterials & Tissue Engineering, University College London"}}}
