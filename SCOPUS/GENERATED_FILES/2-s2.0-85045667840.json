Published by John Wiley & Sons LtdThe generation and maintenance of CD8+ T cell memory is crucial to long-term host survival, yet the basic tenets of CD8+ T cell immunity are still being established. Recent work has led to the discovery of tissue-resident memory cells and refined our understanding of the transcriptional and epigenetic basis of CD8+ T cell differentiation and dysregulation. In parallel, the unprecedented clinical success of immunotherapy has galvanized an intense, global research effort to decipher and de-repress the anti-tumor response. However, the progress of immunotherapy is at a critical juncture, since the efficacy of immuno-oncology agents remains confined to a fraction of patients and often fails to provide durable benefit. Unlocking the potential of immunotherapy requires the design of strategies that both induce a potent effector response and reliably forge stable, functional memory T cell pools capable of protecting from recurrence or relapse. It is therefore essential that basic and emerging concepts of memory T cell biology are rapidly and faithfully transposed to advance therapeutic development in cancer immunotherapy. This review highlights seminal and recent reports in CD8+ T cell memory and tumor immunology, and evaluates recent data from solid cancer specimens in the context of the key paradigms from preclinical models. We elucidate the potential significance of circulating effector cells poised downstream of neoantigen recognition and upstream of T cell dysfunction and propose that cells in this immunological \u2018sweet spot\u2019 may be key anti-tumor effectors.", "AuthorKeywords": ["cancer", "checkpoint blockade", "immunotherapy", "memory T cell", "oncology", "tumor immunology"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes", "Disease Models, Animal", "Disease Susceptibility", "Homeostasis", "Humans", "Immunity, Cellular", "Immunologic Memory", "Immunomodulation", "Lymphocyte Activation", "Lymphocyte Count", "Neoplasms", "Organ Specificity", "T-Lymphocyte Subsets"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85045667840", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"]], "AuthorData": {"57206292773": {"Name": "Reading J.L.", "AuthorID": "57206292773", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Haematology, University College London Cancer Institute, University College London"}, "35416735200": {"Name": "Peggs K.S.", "AuthorID": "35416735200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Haematology, University College London Cancer Institute, University College London"}, "12762916100": {"Name": "Quezada S.A.", "AuthorID": "12762916100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Haematology, University College London Cancer Institute, University College London"}, "57192929671": {"Name": "G\u00e1lvez-Cancino F.", "AuthorID": "57192929671", "AffiliationID": "60012442", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Gene Immunotherapy, Fundaci\u00f3n Ciencia & Vida"}, "12039864500": {"Name": "Lladser A.", "AuthorID": "12039864500", "AffiliationID": "60012442", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Gene Immunotherapy, Fundaci\u00f3n Ciencia & Vida"}, "7005912775": {"Name": "Swanton C.", "AuthorID": "7005912775", "AffiliationID": "60107285", "AffiliationName": "The Francis Crick Institute"}}}
