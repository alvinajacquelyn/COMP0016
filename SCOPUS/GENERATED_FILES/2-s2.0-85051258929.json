The sensitivity with which B cells detect antigen, and the quality and quantity of antigen that B cells acquire, depend upon mechanical properties of the immune synapse including interfacial tension, the strength of intermolecular bonds, and the compliance of the molecules and membranes that participate in antigen presentation. In this review, we discuss our current understanding of how these various physical parameters influence B cell antigen extraction in the immune synapse and how a more comprehensive understanding of B cell mechanics may promote the development of new approaches to stimulate the production of desired antibodies.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Antigen extraction", "Antigen presentation", "B cell activation", "Immune synapse", "Mechanobiology"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Antigen Presentation", "Antigen-Presenting Cells", "Antigens", "B-Lymphocytes", "Biophysical Phenomena", "Humans", "Immunological Synapses"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85051258929", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"]], "AuthorData": {"35113983700": {"Name": "Spillane K.M.", "AuthorID": "35113983700", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Division of Immunology and Inflammation, Imperial College London"}, "6603645423": {"Name": "Tolar P.", "AuthorID": "6603645423", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Division of Immunology and Inflammation, Imperial College London"}}}
