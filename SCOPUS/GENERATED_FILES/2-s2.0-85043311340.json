Design: A literature search of PubMed, Embase, PsychINFO, Web of Science, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library databases for human and animal studies that evaluated the use of TNF\u2010\u03b1I was performed on 26 October 2016. Results: The main outcomes assessed were cognition and behaviour, reduction in brain tissue mass, presence of plaques and tangles, and synaptic function. Risk of bias was assessed regarding blinding, statistical model, outcome reporting, and other biases. Sixteen studies were included, 13 of which were animal studies and 3 of which were human. All animal studies found that treatment with TNF\u2010\u03b1I leads to an improvement in cognition and behaviour. None of the studies measured change in brain tissue mass. The majority of studies documented a beneficial effect in other areas, including the presence of plaques and tangles and synaptic function. The amount of data from human studies was limited. Two out of 3 studies concluded that TNF\u2010\u03b1I are beneficial in Alzheimer's disease patients, with one being an observational study and the latter being a small pilot study, with a high risk of bias. Conclusion: It was concluded that a large\u2010scale randomized controlled trial assessing the effectiveness of TNF\u2010\u03b1I on humans is warranted.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alzheimer\u2019s disease", "Dementia", "Tumour\u2010necrosis factor alpha"], "IndexKeywords": ["Alzheimer Disease", "Animals", "Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal", "Cognition", "Humans", "Immunologic Factors", "Pilot Projects", "Plaque, Amyloid", "Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85043311340", "SubjectAreas": [["Geriatrics and Gerontology", "MEDI", "2717"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"57201070788": {"Name": "Ekert J.O.", "AuthorID": "57201070788", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, University College London"}, "35452972800": {"Name": "Gould R.L.", "AuthorID": "35452972800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, University College London"}, "34769841900": {"Name": "Howard R.J.", "AuthorID": "34769841900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, University College London"}, "36806655600": {"Name": "Reynolds G.", "AuthorID": "36806655600", "AffiliationID": "60014105", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Middlesex University"}}}
