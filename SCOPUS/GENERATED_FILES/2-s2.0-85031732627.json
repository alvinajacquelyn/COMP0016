Recent work suggests that they play a key role in regulating brain energy supply by increasing blood flow to regions where neurons are active, and setting the baseline level of blood flow. Controversy persists over whether lactate derived from astrocyte glycolysis is used to power oxidative phosphorylation in neurons, but astrocytes sustain neuronal ATP production by recycling neurotransmitter glutamate that would otherwise need to be resynthesised from glucose, and by providing a short-term energy store in the form of glycogen that can be mobilised when neurons are active.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Astrocytes", "Brain", "Cerebrovascular Circulation", "Energy Metabolism", "Humans", "Neurons"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85031732627", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"]], "AuthorData": {"56122639900": {"Name": "Nortley R.", "AuthorID": "56122639900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Physiology & Pharmacology, University College London"}, "7006296522": {"Name": "Attwell D.", "AuthorID": "7006296522", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Physiology & Pharmacology, University College London"}}}
