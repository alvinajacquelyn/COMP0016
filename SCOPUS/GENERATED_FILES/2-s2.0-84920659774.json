High frequency guided ultrasonic waves allow for the monitoring of critical areas without direct access to the defect location. During cyclic loading of tensile, aluminum specimens fatigue crack growth at the side of a fastener hole was monitored. The changes in the energy ratio of the baseline subtracted reflected guided wave signal due to the fatigue damage were monitored from a stand-off distance using standard ultrasonic pulse-echo measurement equipment. Good sensitivity for the detection and monitoring of fatigue crack growth was found.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Fatigue crack", "High frequency guided ultrasonic waves", "Lamb wave modes", "Monitoring", "P/E measurement"], "IndexKeywords": ["Fatigue cracks", "Guided ultrasonic waves", "High frequency guided waves", "High frequency HF", "In- situ monitoring", "Lamb wave mode", "Maintenance Problem", "Stand-off distance (SoD)"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84920659774", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"]], "AuthorData": {"6505811171": {"Name": "Masserey B.", "AuthorID": "6505811171", "AffiliationID": "60024631", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Applied Sciences"}, "23977809500": {"Name": "Fromme P.", "AuthorID": "23977809500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}}}
