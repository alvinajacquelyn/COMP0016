Atmospheric signatures typically require a photometric precision of 1\u00d710\u22124 in flux over several hours. Such precision demands high instrument stability as well as an understanding of stellar variability and an optimal data reduction and removal of systematic noise. In the context of the EChO mission concept, we here discuss the data reduction and analysis pipeline developed for the EChO end-to-end simulator EChOSim. We present and discuss the step by step procedures required in order to obtain the final exoplanetary spectrum from the EChOSim \u2018raw data\u2019 using a simulated observation of the secondary eclipse of the hot-Neptune 55 Cnc e.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Astronomical data reduction", "Atmospheric spectroscopy", "EChO space-mission", "EChOSim", "Time resolved spectroscopy"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85027928899", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"36467405700": {"Name": "Waldmann I.", "AuthorID": "36467405700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department Physics & Astronomy, University College London"}, "7004264570": {"Name": "Pascale E.", "AuthorID": "7004264570", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "School of Physics & Astronomy, Cardiff University"}}}
