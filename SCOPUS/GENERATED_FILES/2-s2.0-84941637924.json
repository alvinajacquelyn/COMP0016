This paper examines Michael Faraday\u2019s contributions to this nascent field, drawing on his published correspondence and the works of his antiquarian collaborators, and focusing in particular on his analyses of Romano-British and ancient Egyptian artefacts. Faraday examined the materials used in ancient Egyptian mummification, and provided the first proof of the use of lead glazes on Roman ceramics. Beginning with an assessment of Faraday\u2019s personal interests and early work on antiquities with Humphry Davy, this paper critically examines the historiography of archaeological chemistry and attempts to place Faraday\u2019s work within its institutional, intellectual, and economic contexts.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Archaeology", "Chemistry", "History, 19th Century"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84941637924", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (miscellaneous)", "CHEM", "1601"], ["History and Philosophy of Science", "ARTS", "1207"]], "AuthorData": {"23768402400": {"Name": "Moshenska G.", "AuthorID": "23768402400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Archaeology"}}}
