Previous studies in stroke patients have shown that lesions in the dominant hemisphere often seem to produce changes in ear advantage. In this study six Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) patients treated for motor symptoms with deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the left subthalamic nucleus (STN) were tested preoperatively and at approximately 6 and 18 months postoperatively with a dichotic listening task. Results show a significant decline of the right ear advantage over time. In three of the patients a right ear advantage preoperativley changed to a left ear advantage 18 months postoperatively. This suggests the possibility that additional longitudinal studies of this phenomenon could serve as a model for understanding changes in indirect measures of speech lateralization in stroke patients.", "AuthorKeywords": ["aphasia", "deep brain stimulation", "dichotic listening", "hemispheric dominance", "subthalamic nucleus"], "IndexKeywords": ["Attention", "Auditory Perception", "Deep Brain Stimulation", "Dichotic Listening Tests", "Female", "Functional Laterality", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Parkinson Disease", "Subthalamic Nucleus"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84931041453", "SubjectAreas": [["Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)", "ARTS", "1201"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"7005169574": {"Name": "Sj\u00f6berg R.", "AuthorID": "7005169574", "AffiliationID": "60031040", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacology and Clinical Neuroscience, Ume\u00e5 University"}, "55217594100": {"Name": "H\u00e4ggstr\u00f6m B.", "AuthorID": "55217594100", "AffiliationID": "60031040", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacology and Clinical Neuroscience, Ume\u00e5 University"}, "56684918100": {"Name": "Philipsson J.", "AuthorID": "56684918100", "AffiliationID": "60031040", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacology and Clinical Neuroscience, Ume\u00e5 University"}, "35332326400": {"Name": "Linder J.", "AuthorID": "35332326400", "AffiliationID": "60031040", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacology and Clinical Neuroscience, Ume\u00e5 University"}, "7005641179": {"Name": "Hariz M.", "AuthorID": "7005641179", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "55928136000": {"Name": "Blomstedt P.", "AuthorID": "55928136000", "AffiliationID": "60031040", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacology and Clinical Neuroscience, Ume\u00e5 University"}}}
