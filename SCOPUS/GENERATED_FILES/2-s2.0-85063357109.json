Working-class students tend to choose the strategy of \u2018compartmentalising\u2019 to manage their experience of university\u2013engaging primarily academically and sideling the social aspects of university life. This paper offers a very complex account of such compartmentalising, in which the lack of appropriate capitals, emotional injuries, habitual dispositions and the application of instrumental rationality are fused together to make up the university experience for working-class students. The analysis demonstrates the \u2018conspiracy\u2019 of reflexivity. Reflexivity does not necessarily bring changes in and challenges to an existing habitus; rather reflexivity conspires with and tends to reinforce it. This demonstrates the continuing role of habitus in maintaining class domination in elite settings and raises questions about the effects and effectiveness of the widening participation agenda in HE.", "AuthorKeywords": ["college experience", "meritocracy", "reflexivity and habitus", "upward social mobility", "working-class students at elite universities", "\u2018habitus transformation\u2019"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85063357109", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"]], "AuthorData": {"57207946367": {"Name": "Jin J.", "AuthorID": "57207946367", "AffiliationID": "60021200", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Education, East China Normal University"}, "7202536805": {"Name": "Ball S.", "AuthorID": "7202536805", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "Department of Education, Practice and Society, UCL Institute of Education"}}}
