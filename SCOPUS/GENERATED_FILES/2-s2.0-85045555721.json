However, progress is promoting a shift in perspective from environmental impacts to resource recovery. Municipal solid waste incineration (MSWI) has been increasing in developed countries, thus the amount of air pollution control residues (APCr) and fly ashes (FA) have followed the same upward trend. APCr from MSWI is classified as hazardous waste in the List of Waste (LoW) and as an absolute entry (19 01 07*), but FA may be classified as a mirror entry (19 0 13*/19 01 14). These properties arise mainly from their content in soluble salts, potentially toxic metals, trace organic pollutants and high pH in contact with water. Since these residues have been mostly disposed of in underground and landfills, other possibilities must be investigated to recover secondary raw materials and products. According to the literature, four additional routes of recovery have been found: detoxification (e.g. washing), product manufacturing (e.g. ceramic products and cement), practical applications (e.g. CO2 sequestration) and recovery of materials (e.g. Zn and salts). This work aims to identify the best available technologies for material recovery in order to avoid landfill solutions. Within this scope, six case studies are presented and discussed: recycling in lightweight aggregates, glass-ceramics, cement, recovery of zinc, rare metals and salts. Finally, future perspectives are provided to advance understanding of this anthropogenic waste as a source of resources, yet tied to safeguards for the environment.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Air pollution control residues", "Fly ash", "Incineration", "Municipal solid waste", "Recovery", "Toxic metals"], "IndexKeywords": ["Air pollution control residues", "Best available technologies", "Environmental policy", "Light weight aggregate", "Potentially toxic metals", "Product manufacturing", "Secondary Raw Materials", "Toxic metals"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85045555721", "SubjectAreas": [["Environmental Engineering", "ENVI", "2305"], ["Environmental Chemistry", "ENVI", "2304"], ["Waste Management and Disposal", "ENVI", "2311"], ["Pollution", "ENVI", "2310"]], "AuthorData": {"23135614100": {"Name": "Quina M.J.", "AuthorID": "23135614100", "AffiliationID": "60106442, 60020985", "AffiliationName": "CIEPQPF - Research Centre on Chemical Processes Engineering and Forest Products, Department of Chemical Engineering, University of Coimbra"}, "57213004303": {"Name": "Bontempi E.", "AuthorID": "57213004303", "AffiliationID": "60015300", "AffiliationName": "INSTM and Chemistry for Technologies Laboratory, University of Brescia"}, "22952845400": {"Name": "Bogush A.", "AuthorID": "22952845400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Resource Efficiency & the Environment (CREE), Department of Civil, Environmental & Geomatic Engineering (CEGE), University College London (UCL)"}, "23052275100": {"Name": "Schlumberger S.", "AuthorID": "23052275100", "AffiliationID": "120544595", "AffiliationName": "Development Center for Sustainable Management of Recyclable Waste and Resources (ZAR)"}, "57188568837": {"Name": "Weibel G.", "AuthorID": "57188568837", "AffiliationID": "120544595", "AffiliationName": "Development Center for Sustainable Management of Recyclable Waste and Resources (ZAR)"}, "13410007400": {"Name": "Braga R.", "AuthorID": "13410007400", "AffiliationID": "60028218", "AffiliationName": "Dipartimento di Scienze Biologiche, Geologiche e Ambientali, Universit\u00e0 di Bologna"}, "55948977800": {"Name": "Funari V.", "AuthorID": "55948977800", "AffiliationID": "60028218", "AffiliationName": "Dipartimento di Scienze Biologiche, Geologiche e Ambientali, Universit\u00e0 di Bologna"}, "22234469400": {"Name": "Hyks J.", "AuthorID": "22234469400", "AffiliationID": "119075398", "AffiliationName": "Danish Waste Solutions ApS"}, "57196530239": {"Name": "Rasmussen E.", "AuthorID": "57196530239", "AffiliationID": "120544531", "AffiliationName": "Stena Recycling AS"}, "36150862900": {"Name": "Lederer J.", "AuthorID": "36150862900", "AffiliationID": "60018163, 60121828", "AffiliationName": "TU Wien, Christian-Doppler-Laboratory for Anthropogenic Resources"}}}
