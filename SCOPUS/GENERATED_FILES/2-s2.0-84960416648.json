The aim was to determine whether What Were We Thinking (WWWT) a gender-informed, psychoeducational programme for couples and babies can prevent PCMD among primiparous women 6 months postpartum. Design: Cluster-randomised controlled trial. Setting: 48 Maternal and Child Health Centres (MCHCs) from 6 Local Government Areas in Melbourne, Australia were allocated randomly to usual care (24) or usual care plus WWWT (24). Participants: English-speaking primiparous women receiving primary care at trial MCHCs were recruited to the intervention (204) and control (196) conditions. Of these, 187 (91.7%) and 177 (90.3%) provided complete data. Intervention: WWWT is a manualised programme comprising primary care from a trained nurse, print materials and a face-to-face seminar. Main outcome measures: Data sources were standardised and study-specific measures collected in blinded computer-assisted telephone interviews at 6 and 26 weeks postpartum. The primary outcome was PCMD assessed by Composite International Diagnostic Interviews and Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) Depression and Generalised Anxiety Disorder modules. Results: In intention-to-treat analyses the adjusted OR (AOR) of PCMD in the intervention compared to the usual care group was 0.78 (95% CI 0.38 to 1.63, ns), but mild to moderate anxiety symptoms (AOR 0.58, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.97) and poor self-rated health (AOR 0.46, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.97) were significantly lower. In a per protocol analysis, comparing the full (three component) intervention and usual care groups, the AOR of PCMD was 0.36, (95% CI 0.14 to 0.95). The WWWT seminar was appraised as salient, comprehensible and useful by >85% participants. No harms were detected. Conclusions: WWWT is readily integrated into primary care, enables inclusion of fathers and addresses modifiable risks for PCMD directly. The full intervention appears a promising programme for preventing PCMD, optimising family functioning, and as the first component of a stepped approach to mental healthcare.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Anxiety", "Australia", "Family Characteristics", "Female", "Humans", "Logistic Models", "Male", "Mental Disorders", "Parity", "Patient Education as Topic", "Primary Health Care", "Psychiatric Status Rating Scales", "Puerperal Disorders", "Self Report", "Severity of Illness Index"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84960416648", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"7404016774": {"Name": "Fisher J.", "AuthorID": "7404016774", "AffiliationID": "60019578", "AffiliationName": "Jean Hailes Research Unit, School of Public Health and Preventive Medicine, Monash University"}, "35293556100": {"Name": "Rowe H.", "AuthorID": "35293556100", "AffiliationID": "60019578", "AffiliationName": "Jean Hailes Research Unit, School of Public Health and Preventive Medicine, Monash University"}, "24578160000": {"Name": "Wynter K.", "AuthorID": "24578160000", "AffiliationID": "60019578", "AffiliationName": "Jean Hailes Research Unit, School of Public Health and Preventive Medicine, Monash University"}, "37040900900": {"Name": "Tran T.", "AuthorID": "37040900900", "AffiliationID": "60019578", "AffiliationName": "Jean Hailes Research Unit, School of Public Health and Preventive Medicine, Monash University"}, "14038950500": {"Name": "Lorgelly P.", "AuthorID": "14038950500", "AffiliationID": "60116267, 60019578", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Health Economics, Monash Business School, Monash University"}, "7003711968": {"Name": "Amir L.H.", "AuthorID": "7003711968", "AffiliationID": "60006925", "AffiliationName": "Judith Lumley Centre, La Trobe University"}, "8333157200": {"Name": "Proimos J.", "AuthorID": "8333157200", "AffiliationID": "112675038", "AffiliationName": "Victorian Department of Education and Training"}, "55463144900": {"Name": "Ranasinha S.", "AuthorID": "55463144900", "AffiliationID": "60012932, 60019578", "AffiliationName": "Monash Centre for Health Research and Implementation, School of Public Health and Preventive Medicine, Monash University"}, "6602446868": {"Name": "Hiscock H.", "AuthorID": "6602446868", "AffiliationID": "60026553, 60026489", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatrics, Centre for Community Child Health, Royal Children's Hospital, University of Melbourne"}, "13907875000": {"Name": "Bayer J.", "AuthorID": "13907875000", "AffiliationID": "60006925", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychological Science, La Trobe University"}, "8127778900": {"Name": "Cann W.", "AuthorID": "8127778900", "AffiliationID": "112563876", "AffiliationName": "Parenting Research Centre"}}}
