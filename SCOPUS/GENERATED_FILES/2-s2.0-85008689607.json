We aimed to improve upon our previous model by using a novel oral mucosal surface organ at risk (OAR) in place of an oral cavity OAR. Materials and methods Predictive models of severe acute mucositis were generated using radiotherapy dose to the oral cavity OAR or mucosal surface OAR and clinical data. Penalised logistic regression and random forest classification (RFC) models were generated for both OARs and compared. Internal validation was carried out with 100-iteration stratified shuffle split cross-validation, using multiple metrics to assess different aspects of model performance. Associations between treatment covariates and severe mucositis were explored using RFC feature importance. Results Penalised logistic regression and RFC models using the oral cavity OAR performed at least as well as the models using mucosal surface OAR. Associations between dose metrics and severe mucositis were similar between the mucosal surface and oral cavity models. The volumes of oral cavity or mucosal surface receiving intermediate and high doses were most strongly associated with severe mucositis. Conclusions The simpler oral cavity OAR should be preferred over the mucosal surface OAR for NTCP modelling of severe mucositis. We recommend minimising the volume of mucosa receiving intermediate and high doses, where possible.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Head and neck radiotherapy", "machine learning", "mucositis", "NTCP modelling", "OAR delineation", "oral mucosa"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Head and Neck Neoplasms", "Humans", "Logistic Models", "Middle Aged", "Models, Biological", "Mouth Mucosa", "Mucositis", "Probability", "Radiotherapy", "Radiotherapy Dosage", "Reproducibility of Results", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85008689607", "SubjectAreas": [["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"56548093700": {"Name": "Dean J.A.", "AuthorID": "56548093700", "AffiliationID": "60017166, 60010337", "AffiliationName": "Joint Department of Physics at The Institute of Cancer Research and The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust"}, "19034231400": {"Name": "Gulliford S.L.", "AuthorID": "19034231400", "AffiliationID": "60017166, 60010337", "AffiliationName": "Joint Department of Physics at The Institute of Cancer Research and The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust"}, "55697021900": {"Name": "Welsh L.C.", "AuthorID": "55697021900", "AffiliationID": "60017166", "AffiliationName": "Head and Neck Unit, The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust"}, "56645354800": {"Name": "Wong K.H.", "AuthorID": "56645354800", "AffiliationID": "60017166", "AffiliationName": "Head and Neck Unit, The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57156168500": {"Name": "Aleksic A.", "AuthorID": "57156168500", "AffiliationID": "60017166", "AffiliationName": "Head and Neck Unit, The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57156051100": {"Name": "Dunne E.", "AuthorID": "57156051100", "AffiliationID": "60017166", "AffiliationName": "Head and Neck Unit, The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57155600700": {"Name": "Islam M.R.", "AuthorID": "57155600700", "AffiliationID": "60017166", "AffiliationName": "Head and Neck Unit, The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7403524909": {"Name": "Patel A.", "AuthorID": "7403524909", "AffiliationID": "60017166", "AffiliationName": "Head and Neck Unit, The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57155688600": {"Name": "Patel P.", "AuthorID": "57155688600", "AffiliationID": "60017166", "AffiliationName": "Head and Neck Unit, The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust"}, "36107204000": {"Name": "Petkar I.", "AuthorID": "36107204000", "AffiliationID": "60017166", "AffiliationName": "Head and Neck Unit, The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57155898900": {"Name": "Phillips I.", "AuthorID": "57155898900", "AffiliationID": "60017166", "AffiliationName": "Head and Neck Unit, The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57156020900": {"Name": "Sham J.", "AuthorID": "57156020900", "AffiliationID": "60017166", "AffiliationName": "Head and Neck Unit, The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust"}, "54923259100": {"Name": "Schick U.", "AuthorID": "54923259100", "AffiliationID": "60017166", "AffiliationName": "Head and Neck Unit, The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust"}, "35240629900": {"Name": "Newbold K.L.", "AuthorID": "35240629900", "AffiliationID": "60010337", "AffiliationName": "Division of Radiotherapy and Imaging, The Institute of Cancer Research"}, "35184942800": {"Name": "Bhide S.A.", "AuthorID": "35184942800", "AffiliationID": "60010337", "AffiliationName": "Division of Radiotherapy and Imaging, The Institute of Cancer Research"}, "57203069901": {"Name": "Harrington K.J.", "AuthorID": "57203069901", "AffiliationID": "60010337", "AffiliationName": "Division of Radiotherapy and Imaging, The Institute of Cancer Research"}, "7004557622": {"Name": "Nutting C.M.", "AuthorID": "7004557622", "AffiliationID": "60010337", "AffiliationName": "Division of Radiotherapy and Imaging, The Institute of Cancer Research"}}}
