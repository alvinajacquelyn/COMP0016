The aim of this article is to explore how the state expresses its agency over the Cultural Institutes of six European countries: the UK, Germany, France, Spain, Sweden, and Greece. Agency presents varying modalities, making instrumentalism more multifaceted than has been implied so far. The authors are introducing here a framework of five \u201ctouchpoints\u201d to capture and analyze instrumentalism in cultural diplomacy. Funding, agenda setting, evaluation, hierarchy, and appointment power constitute the typical system of interactions between the Cultural Institutes and their reporting authorities.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Agency", "arms' length principle", "cultural diplomacy", "Cultural Institutes", "instrumentalism", "international cultural relations"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85038633104", "SubjectAreas": [["Visual Arts and Performing Arts", "ARTS", "1213"], ["Strategy and Management", "BUSI", "1408"], ["Law", "SOCI", "3308"]], "AuthorData": {"57200004064": {"Name": "Kizlari D.", "AuthorID": "57200004064", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Sustainable Heritage, University College London"}, "38961158600": {"Name": "Fouseki K.", "AuthorID": "38961158600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Sustainable Heritage, University College London"}}}
