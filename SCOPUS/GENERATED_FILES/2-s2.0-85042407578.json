Motivated by this need, a next-generation integrated bridge inspection system, called SeeBridge, has been proposed. An Information Delivery Manual (IDM) was compiled to specify the technical components, activities and information exchanges in the SeeBridge process, and a Model View Definition (MVD) was prepared to specify the data exchange schema to serve the IDM. The MVD was bound to the IFC4 Add2 data schema standard. The IDM and MVD support research and development of the system by rigorously defining the information and data that structure bridge engineers' knowledge. The SeeBridge process is mapped, parts of the data repositories are presented, and the future use of the IDM is discussed. The development underlines the real potential for automated inspection of infrastructure at large, because it demonstrates that the hurdles in the way of automated acquisition of detailed and semantically rich models of existing infrastructure are computational in nature, not instrumental, and are surmountable with existing technologies.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bridge inspection", "Building Information Modeling", "Information Delivery Manual", "Model View Definition", "Remote sensing", "Semantic enrichment"], "IndexKeywords": ["Bridge inspection", "Building Information Model - BIM", "Information delivery", "Model view definitions", "Semantic enrichment"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85042407578", "SubjectAreas": [["Control and Systems Engineering", "ENGI", "2207"], ["Civil and Structural Engineering", "ENGI", "2205"], ["Building and Construction", "ENGI", "2215"]], "AuthorData": {"7102941790": {"Name": "Sacks R.", "AuthorID": "7102941790", "AffiliationID": "60022403", "AffiliationName": "Virtual Construction Lab, Civil and Environmental Engineering, Technion\u2013Israel Institute of Technology"}, "57191856996": {"Name": "Kattel U.", "AuthorID": "57191856996", "AffiliationID": "60022403", "AffiliationName": "Virtual Construction Lab, Civil and Environmental Engineering, Technion\u2013Israel Institute of Technology"}, "57209034905": {"Name": "Yosef R.", "AuthorID": "57209034905", "AffiliationID": "60022403", "AffiliationName": "Virtual Construction Lab, Civil and Environmental Engineering, Technion\u2013Israel Institute of Technology"}, "57191869466": {"Name": "Kedar A.", "AuthorID": "57191869466", "AffiliationID": "117632538", "AffiliationName": "Kedmor Engineers"}, "14824718700": {"Name": "Borrmann A.", "AuthorID": "14824718700", "AffiliationID": "60019722", "AffiliationName": "Computational Modeling and Simulation, Technical University Munich"}, "55923265500": {"Name": "Daum S.", "AuthorID": "55923265500", "AffiliationID": "60019722", "AffiliationName": "Computational Modeling and Simulation, Technical University Munich"}, "55720988200": {"Name": "Ma L.", "AuthorID": "55720988200", "AffiliationID": "60032343", "AffiliationName": "University of Huddersfield"}, "8837673400": {"Name": "Brilakis I.", "AuthorID": "8837673400", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "University of Cambridge"}, "57200694382": {"Name": "H\u00fcthwohl P.", "AuthorID": "57200694382", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "University of Cambridge"}, "6602294346": {"Name": "Liebich T.", "AuthorID": "6602294346", "AffiliationID": "60112821", "AffiliationName": "AEC 3"}, "57200800466": {"Name": "Barutcu B.E.", "AuthorID": "57200800466", "AffiliationID": "60112821", "AffiliationName": "AEC 3"}, "57191468011": {"Name": "Muhic S.", "AuthorID": "57191468011", "AffiliationID": "60112821", "AffiliationName": "AEC 3"}}}
