While they are well-established, and reliable, they are also associated with large expenses (both in terms of time and actual cost). With the emergence of social media and alternative data sources, researchers and practitioners often wonder if such data sources can supplement (or obviate the need for) conventional data collection efforts. In this research, we empirically examine of the use of different social media data for such applications. Data from three popular Social Media is examined and compared with data from conventional travel-diary surveys for the city of Thessaloniki, Greece. Both spatial and temporal aspects of the activities' representation are considered. The findings of this research contribute towards the identification of methodologies that can support the inference of meaningful travel information from Social Media, which could in turn improve ITS applications.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Data collection", "ITS applications", "Social media datum", "Temporal aspects", "Thessaloniki , Greece", "Travel demand", "Travel information", "Travel surveys"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85010073637", "SubjectAreas": [["Automotive Engineering", "ENGI", "2203"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"]], "AuthorData": {"57060622700": {"Name": "Chaniotakis E.", "AuthorID": "57060622700", "AffiliationID": "60026208", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Research and Technology Hellas, Hellenic Institute of Transport Thessaloniki"}, "55809661600": {"Name": "Grau J.", "AuthorID": "55809661600", "AffiliationID": "60026208", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Research and Technology Hellas, Hellenic Institute of Transport Thessaloniki"}, "7004031914": {"Name": "Antoniou C.", "AuthorID": "7004031914", "AffiliationID": "60019722", "AffiliationName": "Technical University of Munich"}, "19638446400": {"Name": "Dimitriou L.", "AuthorID": "19638446400", "AffiliationID": "60071343", "AffiliationName": "University of Cyprus"}}}
