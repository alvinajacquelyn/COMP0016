However, the previously reported pillar arrays, suitable for obtaining pancake bouncing, have a diameter \u2264100 \u03bcm and height-diameter ratio >10, which are difficult to fabricate over a large area. Here, we have systematically studied the influence of the dimension of the superhydrophobic pillar arrays on the bouncing dynamics of water droplets. We show that the typical pancake bouncing with 57.8% reduction in contact time with the surface was observed on the superhydrophobic pillar arrays with 1.05 mm diameter, 0.8 mm height, and 0.25 mm space. Such pillar arrays with millimeter diameter and <1 height-diameter ratio can be easily fabricated over large areas. Further, a simple replication-spraying method was developed for the large-area fabrication of the superhydrophobic pillar arrays to induce pancake bouncing. No sacrificial layer was needed to reduce the adhesion in the replication processes. Since the bouncing dynamics were rather sensitive to the space between the pillars, a method to control the contact time, bouncing shape, horizontal bouncing direction, and reversible switch between pancake bouncing and conventional bouncing was realized by adjusting the inclination angle of the shape memory polymer pillars.", "AuthorKeywords": ["large-area", "millimeter diameter", "pancake bouncing", "pillar arrays", "superhydrophobic"], "IndexKeywords": ["large-area", "millimeter diameter", "pancake bouncing", "Pillar arrays", "Superhydrophobic"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85029929943", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Engineering (all)", "ENGI", "2200"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"37077947000": {"Name": "Song J.", "AuthorID": "37077947000", "AffiliationID": "60004538", "AffiliationName": "Collaborative Innovation Center, Major Machine Manufacturing in Liaoning, Dalian University of Technology"}, "56984995600": {"Name": "Gao M.", "AuthorID": "56984995600", "AffiliationID": "60004538", "AffiliationName": "Collaborative Innovation Center, Major Machine Manufacturing in Liaoning, Dalian University of Technology"}, "57201577745": {"Name": "Zhao C.", "AuthorID": "57201577745", "AffiliationID": "60004538", "AffiliationName": "Collaborative Innovation Center, Major Machine Manufacturing in Liaoning, Dalian University of Technology"}, "57190946733": {"Name": "Huang L.", "AuthorID": "57190946733", "AffiliationID": "60004538", "AffiliationName": "Collaborative Innovation Center, Major Machine Manufacturing in Liaoning, Dalian University of Technology"}, "57221421947": {"Name": "Liu X.", "AuthorID": "57221421947", "AffiliationID": "60004538", "AffiliationName": "Collaborative Innovation Center, Major Machine Manufacturing in Liaoning, Dalian University of Technology"}, "57206597914": {"Name": "Lu Y.", "AuthorID": "57206597914", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Nanoengineered Systems Laboratory, UCL Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "7003437916": {"Name": "Carmalt C.J.", "AuthorID": "7003437916", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "56217400400": {"Name": "Parkin I.P.", "AuthorID": "56217400400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "36197988900": {"Name": "Deng X.", "AuthorID": "36197988900", "AffiliationID": "60005465", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Fundamental and Frontier Sciences, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China"}}}
