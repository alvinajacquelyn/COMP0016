In the current work we present a means of improving the technique by using references tracts derived from dMRI data acquired from 80 healthy volunteers aged 25\u201364 years. The reference tracts were tested on the segmentation of 16 major white matter tracts in 50 healthy older people, aged 71.8 (\u00b10.4) years. We found that data-generated reference tracts improved the automatic white matter tract segmentations compared to results from atlas-generated reference tracts. We also obtained higher percentages of visually acceptable segmented tracts and lower variation in water diffusion parameters using this approach.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Brain", "MRI", "Tractography", "Unsupervised segmentation", "White matter"], "IndexKeywords": ["Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging", "Healthy volunteers", "Tractography", "Unsupervised segmentation", "Water diffusion", "White matter", "White matter tractography", "White matter tracts"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85022189769", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"], ["Mathematics (all)", "MATH", "2600"]], "AuthorData": {"57194785401": {"Name": "Susana Mu\u00f1oz M.", "AuthorID": "57194785401", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cognitive Ageing and Cognitive Epidemiology, University of Edinburgh"}, "7006141241": {"Name": "Bastin M.E.", "AuthorID": "7006141241", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cognitive Ageing and Cognitive Epidemiology, University of Edinburgh"}, "35417533500": {"Name": "Wardlaw J.M.", "AuthorID": "35417533500", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cognitive Ageing and Cognitive Epidemiology, University of Edinburgh"}, "57193752767": {"Name": "Deary I.J.", "AuthorID": "57193752767", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, University of Edinburgh"}, "57202638198": {"Name": "Clayden J.D.", "AuthorID": "57202638198", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, University College London"}}}
