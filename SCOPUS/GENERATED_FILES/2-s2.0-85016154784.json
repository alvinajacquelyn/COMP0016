Although many recipes have been produced for generating solid phantoms with specified absorption and transport scattering coefficients at visible and near-infrared wavelengths, the construction methods are generally timeconsuming and are unable to create complex geometries. We present a method of generating phantoms using a standard 3D printer. A simple recipe was devised which enables printed phantoms to be produced with precisely known optical properties. To illustrate the capability of the method, we describe the creation of an anatomically accurate, tissue-equivalent premature infant head optical phantom with a hollow brain space based on MRI atlas data. A diffuse optical image of the phantom is acquired when a high contrast target is inserted into the hollow space filled with an aqueous scattering solution.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Complex geometries", "Construction method", "Diffuse optical imaging", "Image reconstruction methods", "Premature infants", "Tissue equivalent phantom", "Transport scattering coefficients", "Visible and near infrared"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85016154784", "SubjectAreas": [["Biotechnology", "BIOC", "1305"], ["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"]], "AuthorData": {"56303480500": {"Name": "Dempsey L.", "AuthorID": "56303480500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering Department, University College London"}, "57193728548": {"Name": "Persad M.", "AuthorID": "57193728548", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering Department, University College London"}, "7201575253": {"Name": "Powell S.", "AuthorID": "7201575253", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering Department, University College London"}, "36466214300": {"Name": "Chitnis D.", "AuthorID": "36466214300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering Department, University College London"}, "7004407749": {"Name": "Hebden J.", "AuthorID": "7004407749", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering Department, University College London"}}}
