The molecular events that lead to B cell lymphoma are only partially defined. Here, we have provided evidence that deficiency of tetraspanin superfamily member CD37, which is important for B cell function, induces the development of B cell lymphoma. Mice lacking CD37 developed germinal center-derived B cell lymphoma in lymph nodes and spleens with a higher incidence than Bcl2 transgenic mice. We discovered that CD37 interacts with suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3); therefore, absence of CD37 drives tumor development through constitutive activation of the IL-6 signaling pathway. Moreover, animals deficient for both Cd37 and Il6 were fully protected against lymphoma development, confirming the involvement of the IL-6 pathway in driving tumorigenesis. Loss of CD37 on neoplastic cells in patients with diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) directly correlated with activation of the IL-6 signaling pathway and with worse progressionfree and overall survival. Together, this study identifies CD37 as a tumor suppressor that directly protects against B cell lymphomagenesis and provides a strong rationale for blocking the IL-6 pathway in patients with CD37- B cell malignancies as a possible therapeutic intervention.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Antigens, CD", "Antigens, Neoplasm", "Cell Transformation, Neoplastic", "Germinal Center", "Interleukin-6", "Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred BALB C", "Mice, Knockout", "Tetraspanins", "Tumor Suppressor Proteins"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84956872754", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"56087635600": {"Name": "De Winde C.M.", "AuthorID": "56087635600", "AffiliationID": "60002573", "AffiliationName": "Department of Tumor Immunology, Radboud Institute for Molecular Life Sciences, Radboud University Medical Center"}, "23037447700": {"Name": "Veenbergen S.", "AuthorID": "23037447700", "AffiliationID": "60002573", "AffiliationName": "Department of Tumor Immunology, Radboud Institute for Molecular Life Sciences, Radboud University Medical Center"}, "26536894500": {"Name": "Van Der Schaaf A.", "AuthorID": "26536894500", "AffiliationID": "60002573", "AffiliationName": "Department of Tumor Immunology, Radboud Institute for Molecular Life Sciences, Radboud University Medical Center"}, "57093998800": {"Name": "Elfrink S.", "AuthorID": "57093998800", "AffiliationID": "60002573", "AffiliationName": "Department of Tumor Immunology, Radboud Institute for Molecular Life Sciences, Radboud University Medical Center"}, "8281840000": {"Name": "Van Houdt I.S.", "AuthorID": "8281840000", "AffiliationID": "60002573", "AffiliationName": "Department of Tumor Immunology, Radboud Institute for Molecular Life Sciences, Radboud University Medical Center"}, "7005947752": {"Name": "Figdor C.G.", "AuthorID": "7005947752", "AffiliationID": "60002573", "AffiliationName": "Department of Tumor Immunology, Radboud Institute for Molecular Life Sciences, Radboud University Medical Center"}, "57203935521": {"Name": "Van Spriel A.B.", "AuthorID": "57203935521", "AffiliationID": "60002573", "AffiliationName": "Department of Tumor Immunology, Radboud Institute for Molecular Life Sciences, Radboud University Medical Center"}, "36687576100": {"Name": "Young K.H.", "AuthorID": "36687576100", "AffiliationID": "60015023", "AffiliationName": "Department of Hematopathology, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center"}, "37038805900": {"Name": "Xu-Monette Z.Y.", "AuthorID": "37038805900", "AffiliationID": "60015023", "AffiliationName": "Department of Hematopathology, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center"}, "55165009300": {"Name": "Wang X.X.", "AuthorID": "55165009300", "AffiliationID": "60015023", "AffiliationName": "Department of Hematopathology, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center"}, "36459343900": {"Name": "Xia Y.", "AuthorID": "36459343900", "AffiliationID": "60015023", "AffiliationName": "Department of Hematopathology, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center"}, "6506290271": {"Name": "Jabbar K.J.", "AuthorID": "6506290271", "AffiliationID": "60015023", "AffiliationName": "Department of Hematopathology, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center"}, "35323044000": {"Name": "Van Den Brand M.", "AuthorID": "35323044000", "AffiliationID": "60002573", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, Radboud University Medical Center"}, "6603366227": {"Name": "Hebeda K.M.", "AuthorID": "6603366227", "AffiliationID": "60002573", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, Radboud University Medical Center"}, "7006290744": {"Name": "Groenen P.J.T.A.", "AuthorID": "7006290744", "AffiliationID": "60002573", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, Radboud University Medical Center"}, "6603632727": {"Name": "Van Krieken J.H.", "AuthorID": "6603632727", "AffiliationID": "60002573", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, Radboud University Medical Center"}, "35512381800": {"Name": "Gijbels M.J.", "AuthorID": "35512381800", "AffiliationID": "60001157", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Biochemistry, Academic Medical Center"}, "35415579600": {"Name": "Van De Loo F.A.J.", "AuthorID": "35415579600", "AffiliationID": "60002573", "AffiliationName": "Department of Rheumatology, Radboud University Medical Center"}, "7004056225": {"Name": "Bennink M.B.", "AuthorID": "7004056225", "AffiliationID": "60002573", "AffiliationName": "Department of Rheumatology, Radboud University Medical Center"}}}
