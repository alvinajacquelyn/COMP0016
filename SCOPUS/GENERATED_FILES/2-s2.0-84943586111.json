For the purpose of this exercise, the ORA output was put in the form k1P1+k2P2 where k1 and k2 were variables and P1 and P2 were ORAs measured applanation pressures. Two separate clinical datasets involving Moorfields Eye Hospital, London and the University of New South Wales, Sydney participants, respectively, were used to validate the numerical results.Results: The numerical study results show a strong association between (k1P1 + k2P2) and the true IOP over a wide range of k1 and k2 values apart from a narrow region approximately extending from (k1 = +2, k2 = -2) to (k1 = -2, k2 = +2). On the other hand, (k1\u00b7 P1 + k2\u00b7 P2) was found to have a strong association with CCT, R and age (the stiffness parameters) over the same narrow region, beyond which the association was weak. Similar trends were found with the two clinical datasets.Conclusions: The results of this study show the potential of the ORA to provide reliable IOP measurements with weak dependence on the corneas stiffness parameters and the considerably reduced reliability in producing stiffness estimates that are unaffected by IOP values.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cornea", "intraocular pressure", "ocular biomechanics", "ocular response analyzer", "tonometry"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Biomechanical Phenomena", "Cornea", "Corneal Pachymetry", "Elasticity", "Female", "Glaucoma", "Humans", "Intraocular Pressure", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Ocular Hypertension", "Reproducibility of Results", "Tonometry, Ocular", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84943586111", "SubjectAreas": [["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"], ["Sensory Systems", "NEUR", "2809"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"]], "AuthorData": {"15847557600": {"Name": "Elsheikh A.", "AuthorID": "15847557600", "AffiliationID": "60016691, 60172638, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health Research (NIHR), Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "55212360700": {"Name": "Joda A.", "AuthorID": "55212360700", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering, University of Liverpool"}, "7004460319": {"Name": "Garway-Heath D.", "AuthorID": "7004460319", "AffiliationID": "60016691, 60172638, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health Research (NIHR), Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "55791933400": {"Name": "Abass A.", "AuthorID": "55791933400", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "Structural Biophysics Group, School of Optometry and Vision Sciences, Cardiff University"}}}
