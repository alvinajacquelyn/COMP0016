Whilst there is no \u2018one size fits all\u2019 recommended behavioural solution for improving antimicrobial stewardship, the behavioural and social sciences offer a range of theories, frameworks, methods and evidence-based principles that can help inform the design of behaviour change interventions that are context-specific and thus more likely to be effective. However, the state-of-the-art in antimicrobial stewardship research and practice suggests that behavioural and social influences are often not given due consideration in the design and evaluation of interventions to improve antimicrobial prescribing. In this paper, we discuss four potential areas where the behavioural and social sciences can help drive more effective and sustained behaviour change in antimicrobial stewardship: (i) defining the problem in behavioural terms and understanding current behaviour in context; (ii) adopting a theory-driven, systematic approach to intervention design; (iii) investigating implementation and sustainability of interventions in practice; and (iv) maximizing learning through evidence synthesis and detailed intervention reporting.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Antimicrobial Stewardship", "Behavioral Sciences", "Humans", "Inappropriate Prescribing", "Practice Patterns, Physicians'", "Social Sciences"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85052525796", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"], ["Microbiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2726"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"55361024100": {"Name": "Lorencatto F.", "AuthorID": "55361024100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Behaviour Change, University College London"}, "57208140595": {"Name": "Charani E.", "AuthorID": "57208140595", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Health Protection Research Unit in Healthcare Acquired Infection and Antimicrobial Resistance, Imperial College London, Hammersmith Campus"}, "35293409500": {"Name": "Sevdalis N.", "AuthorID": "35293409500", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Implementation Science, Health Service and Population Research Department, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King\u2019s College London"}, "7004060437": {"Name": "Tarrant C.", "AuthorID": "7004060437", "AffiliationID": "60033125", "AffiliationName": "Department of Health Sciences, University of Leicester"}, "7103281485": {"Name": "Davey P.", "AuthorID": "7103281485", "AffiliationID": "60008877", "AffiliationName": "Division of Population Health Sciences, School of Medicine, University of Dundee"}}}
