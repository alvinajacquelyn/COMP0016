As it represents the balance between local oxygen delivery and consumption at any given time, it offers a ready monitoring capability to assess the adequacy of tissue perfusion relative to local demands. This review covers the various methodologies used to measure tissue oxygen tension, describes the underlying physiological and pathophysiological principles, and summarizes human and laboratory data published to date.", "AuthorKeywords": ["intensive care", "intraoperative", "monitoring", "monitoring", "monitoring", "oxygen", "oxygen", "tissue"], "IndexKeywords": ["Blood Gas Analysis", "Humans", "Monitoring, Intraoperative", "Oximetry", "Oxygen", "Oxygen Consumption", "Partial Pressure", "Regional Blood Flow"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84942236119", "SubjectAreas": [["Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine", "MEDI", "2703"]], "AuthorData": {"35263525700": {"Name": "De Santis V.", "AuthorID": "35263525700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Bloomsbury Institute of Intensive Care Medicine, Division of Medicine, University College London"}, "7401654716": {"Name": "Singer M.", "AuthorID": "7401654716", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Bloomsbury Institute of Intensive Care Medicine, Division of Medicine, University College London"}}}
