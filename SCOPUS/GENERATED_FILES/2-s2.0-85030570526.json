The article addresses the affirmation of usefulness and \u2018use values\u2019 within these case studies and beyond in relation to Marxist, post-Marxist, and feminist theories of social reproduction and the state. By attending to issues of citizenship, race, and migration, the article asks how we should approach the aesthetic and political stakes of artworks that strive to be \u2018useful\u2019 through performing tasks associated with social reproduction as they have historically taken place in the home or via the welfare state.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Accelerationism", "Arte util", "Larne abse gogarty", "Marxism", "Race", "Simone leigh", "Social practice", "Social reproduction", "Tania bruguera", "The avant-garde"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85030570526", "SubjectAreas": [["Cultural Studies", "SOCI", "3316"], ["Visual Arts and Performing Arts", "ARTS", "1213"]], "AuthorData": {"56543759200": {"Name": "Gogarty L.", "AuthorID": "56543759200", "AffiliationID": "60000762", "AffiliationName": "Institut f\u00fcr Kunst- und Bildgeschichte, Humboldt University"}}}
