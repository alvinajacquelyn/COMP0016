Variable clinical features include iris coloboma, congenital heart defects and central nervous system abnormalities, in particular polymicrogyria. GOSHS has been attributed to recessive mutations in KIAA1279, encoding kinesin family member (KIF)-binding protein (KBP) with a crucial role in neuronal microtubule dynamics. Here we report on a 7-year-old girl with GOSHS as a result of a homozygous deletion of exons 5 and 6 of the KIAA1279 gene. She had been referred with the suspicion of an underlying neuromuscular disorder before the genetic diagnosis was established, prompted by the findings of motor developmental delay, hypotonia, ptosis and absent reflexes. Neurophysiological studies revealed unequivocal evidence of a peripheral axonal sensory motor neuropathy. We hypothesize that an axonal sensory motor neuropathy may be part of the phenotypical spectrum of KIAA1279-related GOSHS, probably reflecting the effects of reduced KBP protein expression on peripheral neuronal function.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Goldberg-Shprintzen megacolon syndrome (GOSHS)", "KIAA1279 gene", "Neurocristopathies", "Sensory motor axonal neuropathy"], "IndexKeywords": ["Base Sequence", "Child", "Craniofacial Abnormalities", "Exons", "Female", "Gene Expression", "Hereditary Sensory and Motor Neuropathy", "Hirschsprung Disease", "Humans", "Molecular Sequence Data", "Nerve Tissue Proteins", "Sensory Receptor Cells", "Sequence Deletion"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84929943094", "SubjectAreas": [["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Genetics (clinical)", "MEDI", "2716"]], "AuthorData": {"57199180909": {"Name": "Dafsari H.S.", "AuthorID": "57199180909", "AffiliationID": "60107269, 60005518", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Neurology, Evelina's Children Hospital, Guy's and St. Thomas' Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "36082415500": {"Name": "Byrne S.", "AuthorID": "36082415500", "AffiliationID": "60107269, 60005518", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Neurology, Evelina's Children Hospital, Guy's and St. Thomas' Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "50461740800": {"Name": "Lin J.P.", "AuthorID": "50461740800", "AffiliationID": "60107269, 60005518", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Neurology, Evelina's Children Hospital, Guy's and St. Thomas' Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7006738404": {"Name": "Jungbluth H.", "AuthorID": "7006738404", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Basic and Clinical Neuroscience, IoPPN, King's College"}, "7102280708": {"Name": "Pitt M.", "AuthorID": "7102280708", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurophysiology, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children"}, "6602792436": {"Name": "Jongbloed J.D.", "AuthorID": "6602792436", "AffiliationID": "60006027, 60010023", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genetics, University of Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen"}, "35974506900": {"Name": "Flinter F.", "AuthorID": "35974506900", "AffiliationID": "60009797", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Genetics, Guy's Hospital"}}}
