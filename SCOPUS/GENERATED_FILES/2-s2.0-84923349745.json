The Strategic Timing of AntiRetroviral Therapy (START) study provides a unique opportunity to study the effect of length and complexity of informed consent documents on understanding and satisfaction among geographically diverse participants. Methods: Interested START sites were randomized to use either the standard consent form or the concise consent form for all of the site's participants. Results: A total of 4473 HIV-positive participants at 154 sites world-wide took part in the Informed Consent Substudy, with consent given in 11 primary languages. Most sites sent written information to potential participants in advance of clinic visits, usually including the consent form. At about half the sites, staff reported spending less than an hour per participant in the consent process. The vast majority of sites assessed participant understanding using informal nonspecific questions or clinical judgment. Conclusions: These data reflect the interest of START research staff in evaluating the consent process and improving informed consent. The START Informed Consent Substudy is by far the largest study of informed consent intervention ever conducted. Its results have the potential to impact how consent forms are written around the world.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Informed consent", "START trial"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Anti-Retroviral Agents", "Antiretroviral Therapy, Highly Active", "CD4 Lymphocyte Count", "Cohort Studies", "Female", "HIV Infections", "Humans", "Informed Consent", "Male", "Time Factors", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84923349745", "SubjectAreas": [["Health Policy", "MEDI", "2719"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"19643197200": {"Name": "Denning E.", "AuthorID": "19643197200", "AffiliationID": "60013223, 60029445", "AffiliationName": "Coordinating Centers for Biometric Research, Division of Biostatistics, School of Public Health, University of Minnesota"}, "55356235300": {"Name": "Sharma S.", "AuthorID": "55356235300", "AffiliationID": "60013223, 60029445", "AffiliationName": "Coordinating Centers for Biometric Research, Division of Biostatistics, School of Public Health, University of Minnesota"}, "6508304782": {"Name": "Smolskis M.", "AuthorID": "6508304782", "AffiliationID": "60017336", "AffiliationName": "National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID)"}, "56252921300": {"Name": "Touloumi G.", "AuthorID": "56252921300", "AffiliationID": "60067083", "AffiliationName": "Department of Hygiene, Epidemiology and Medical Statistics, Athens University Medical School"}, "7403745869": {"Name": "Walker S.", "AuthorID": "7403745869", "AffiliationID": "60003108, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council (MRC) Clinical Trials Unit"}, "57200797852": {"Name": "Babiker A.", "AuthorID": "57200797852", "AffiliationID": "60003108, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council (MRC) Clinical Trials Unit"}, "56527289500": {"Name": "Clewett M.", "AuthorID": "56527289500", "AffiliationID": "60026655, 60011463, 60028333", "AffiliationName": "Therapeutic and Vaccine Research Program, The Kirby Institute, Faculty of Medicine, University of New South Wales"}, "56457863700": {"Name": "Emanuel E.", "AuthorID": "56457863700", "AffiliationID": "60003711, 60006297", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Ethics and Health Policy, Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania"}, "6701464872": {"Name": "Florence E.", "AuthorID": "6701464872", "AffiliationID": "60028863", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Tropical Medicine"}, "7101944704": {"Name": "Papadopoulos A.", "AuthorID": "7101944704", "AffiliationID": "60015528, 60067083", "AffiliationName": "4th Department of Internal Medicine, Athens Medical School, Attikon University General Hospital"}, "55941824300": {"Name": "S\u00e1nchez A.", "AuthorID": "55941824300", "AffiliationID": "60020147", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Clinical Research, Inc., Veterans Affairs Medical Center"}, "6602703408": {"Name": "Tavel J.", "AuthorID": "6602703408", "AffiliationID": "60026209", "AffiliationName": "Genentech"}, "35430414200": {"Name": "Grady C.", "AuthorID": "35430414200", "AffiliationID": "60006577", "AffiliationName": "Department of Bioethics, The Clinical Center, National Institutes of Health"}}}
