The Thiel embalmed tissue can be a promising, pre-clinical model to study liver treatment with Magnetic Resonance-guided Focused Ultrasound (MRgFUS). Material and methods: Using a single-element transducer and the contact pulse-echo method, the acoustic parameters, i.e., acoustic impedance, reflection coefficient and attenuation coefficient of Thiel embalmed human and animal liver were measured. Results: The Thiel embalmed livers had higher impedance, similar reflection and lower attenuation compared to the fresh tissue. Conclusions: Embalming liver with Thiel fluid affects its acoustic properties. During MRgFUS sonication of a Thiel organ, more focused ultrasound (FUS) will be backscattered by the organ, and higher acoustic powers are required to reach coagulation levels (temperatures >56 \u00b0C).", "AuthorKeywords": ["Acoustic parameters", "focused ultrasound ablation", "pre-clinical model", "Thiel embalming"], "IndexKeywords": ["Acoustics", "Animals", "Cadaver", "Embalming", "High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound Ablation", "Humans", "Liver", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Interventional", "Models, Biological", "Sheep"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84995477011", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"]], "AuthorData": {"56121484200": {"Name": "Karakitsios I.", "AuthorID": "56121484200", "AffiliationID": "60008877", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Medical Science and Technology, University of Dundee"}, "55540895600": {"Name": "Joy J.", "AuthorID": "55540895600", "AffiliationID": "60008877", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Medical Science and Technology, University of Dundee"}, "57185637300": {"Name": "Mihcin S.", "AuthorID": "57185637300", "AffiliationID": "60008877", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Medical Science and Technology, University of Dundee"}, "55574358400": {"Name": "Melzer A.", "AuthorID": "55574358400", "AffiliationID": "60008877", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Medical Science and Technology, University of Dundee"}}}
