Of particular note is its role in establishing the evolutionary conservation of reduced insulin and IGF-1-like signaling in promoting healthy ageing. Capitalizing on its many advantages for experimentation, more recent work has revealed how precise nutritional and genetic interventions can improve fly lifespan without obvious detrimental side effects. We give a brief summary of these recent findings as well as examples of how they may modify ageing via actions in the gut and muscle. These discoveries highlight how expanding our understanding of metabolic and signaling interconnections will provide even greater insight into how these benefits may be harnessed for anti-ageing interventions.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Ageing", "Dietary restriction", "Drosophila", "Insulin signaling", "Tissue control of ageing", "TOR"], "IndexKeywords": ["Activating Transcription Factor 4", "Aging", "AMP-Activated Protein Kinases", "Animals", "Diet", "Drosophila melanogaster", "Drosophila Proteins", "Gastrointestinal Tract", "Genetic Engineering", "Insulin", "Insulin-Like Growth Factor I", "Longevity", "Metabolic Networks and Pathways", "Models, Animal", "Muscles", "Nutrition Assessment", "Protein Kinases", "Research", "Signal Transduction", "TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85030645563", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Medicine", "BIOC", "1313"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"]], "AuthorData": {"7005784113": {"Name": "Piper M.", "AuthorID": "7005784113", "AffiliationID": "60019578", "AffiliationName": "School of Biological Sciences, Monash University"}, "57202667589": {"Name": "Partridge L.", "AuthorID": "57202667589", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Healthy Ageing, Department GEE, UCL"}}}
