Size effects exhibit a non-linear trend with 45 and 85 nm particles resulting in a faster pro-thrombotic response. Clot strength decreased with AuNP size with the greatest reduction with 28 nm particles. We assessed AuNP interactions in the blood focusing on their biological activity. AuNP-RGD possessed pro-coagulant activities, while PEG-thiol, human fibrinogen and clopidogrel prevented blood clot formation and influenced platelet activity, and were more efficient when bound to nanocarriers than unbound ligands. Such tests could fill the knowledge gaps in thrombogenicity of NPs between in vitro test methods and predict in vivo haemocompatibility.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Blood coagulation", "Gold nanoparticles", "Haemocompatibility", "Protein corona", "Thromboelastography", "Thrombogenicity"], "IndexKeywords": ["Blood coagulation", "Gold Nanoparticles", "Haemocompatibility", "Protein coronas", "Thromboelastography", "Thrombogenicity", "Anticoagulants", "Blood Platelets", "Coagulants", "Gold", "Humans", "Ligands", "Metal Nanoparticles", "Particle Size", "Thrombelastography"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85017440345", "SubjectAreas": [["Bioengineering", "CENG", "1502"], ["Medicine (miscellaneous)", "MEDI", "2701"], ["Molecular Medicine", "BIOC", "1313"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Pharmaceutical Science", "PHAR", "3003"]], "AuthorData": {"57193899803": {"Name": "Ajdari N.", "AuthorID": "57193899803", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, Imperial College London"}, "57193900687": {"Name": "Vyas C.", "AuthorID": "57193900687", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "School of Mechanical, Aerospace & Civil Engineering, University of Manchester"}, "57188816299": {"Name": "Bogan S.", "AuthorID": "57188816299", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nanotechnology, University College London"}, "36717270400": {"Name": "Cousins B.", "AuthorID": "36717270400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nanotechnology, University College London"}, "6701762628": {"Name": "Lwaleed B.", "AuthorID": "6701762628", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Surgery & Interventional Science, University College London"}}}
