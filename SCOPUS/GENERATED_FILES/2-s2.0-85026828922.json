Bioinformatics groups have exploited the repositories of known structures to predict high-quality structural models with high efficiency at low cost. This article provides an overview of comparative modelling, reviews recent developments and describes resources dedicated to large-scale comparative modelling of genome sequences. The value of subclustering protein domain superfamilies to guide the template-selection process is investigated. Some recent cases in which structural modelling has aided experimental work to determine very large macromolecular complexes are also cited. This paper reviews the recent advances in computational template-based structural modelling and proposes the subclustering of protein domain superfamilies to guide the template-selection process.", "AuthorKeywords": ["comparative modelling", "protein structure prediction", "template selection", "template-based modelling"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Databases, Genetic", "Genome", "Genomics", "Humans", "Protein Conformation", "Proteins", "Structural Homology, Protein"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85026828922", "SubjectAreas": [["Structural Biology", "BIOC", "1315"]], "AuthorData": {"57190045143": {"Name": "Lam S.", "AuthorID": "57190045143", "AffiliationID": "60001821", "AffiliationName": "School of Biosciences and Biotechnology, Faculty of Science and Technology, University Kebangsaan Malaysia"}, "55991242500": {"Name": "Das S.", "AuthorID": "55991242500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, UCL, Darwin Building"}, "36913138800": {"Name": "Sillitoe I.", "AuthorID": "36913138800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, UCL, Darwin Building"}, "7006781333": {"Name": "Orengo C.", "AuthorID": "7006781333", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, UCL, Darwin Building"}}}
