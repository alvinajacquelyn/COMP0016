However, most previous PAE probes employ a combination of mechanical scanning and piezoelectric transducers at the distal end which can be technically complex and pose challenges in achieving the required level of miniaturisation and acoustic performance. To overcome these limitations, we present two novel all-optical forward-viewing endoscopic probes that use coherent fibre bundles to address a Fabry-P\u00e9rot polymer film ultrasound sensor.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Coherent fibre bundle", "Fabry-Perot sensors", "Image bundle", "Photoacoustic endoscopy", "Photoacoustic tomography"], "IndexKeywords": ["Acoustic performance", "Fabry Perot sensors", "Fibre bundle", "Fibre optic bundles", "Image bundles", "Mechanical scanning", "Photoacoustic tomography", "Ultrasound sensors"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85019514186", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Mechanics of Materials", "ENGI", "2211"]], "AuthorData": {"24069910700": {"Name": "Ansari R.", "AuthorID": "24069910700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "7102686951": {"Name": "Zhang E.", "AuthorID": "7102686951", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "56785433400": {"Name": "Mathews S.", "AuthorID": "56785433400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "57204519454": {"Name": "Desjardins A.", "AuthorID": "57204519454", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "7006238023": {"Name": "Beard P.", "AuthorID": "7006238023", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}}}
