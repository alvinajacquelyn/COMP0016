A facile and controllable low-Temperature (450 \u00b0C) route is reported to produce ultra-small Co 3 O 4 /Co nanoparticles in nitrogen-doped hyperporous graphenic networks (Co 3 O 4 /Co@N-G-450). Firstly, a monolayer of ZIF-67 nanocrystals is directly grown in thermal-shock exfoliated graphene networks (EGO) of suitable porosity and pore-widths. Later, the ZIF-67 is etched by targeting the small concentrations of residual oxygen functionalities on EGO (\u224813 atom%) under a nitrogen atmosphere at 450 \u00b0C. Therefore, the partial gasification of ZIF-67 followed by oxidation of the resultant open cobalt metal centres produces a highly active nanophase of Co 3 O 4 /Co@N-G in a mass yield of >65 wt%. The as-synthesised Co 3 O 4 /Co@N-G-450 catalyst, without any further acid washing or oxidation process, exhibits an outstanding ORR performance with a high onset (0.962 V vs. RHE) and half-wave (0.808 V vs. RHE) potential as well as limiting current density (5.2 mA cm -2 ) in 0.1 M KOH solution. These merits are comparable to those of commercial Pt/C and many ZIF-derived catalysts, synthesised under extended and complex chemical treatment. Moreover, the catalyst also exhibits fast reaction kinetics with a dominant 4-electron reaction pathway and high durability.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Cobalt nanoparticles", "Complex chemicals", "Exfoliated graphene", "Fast reaction kinetics", "Limiting current density", "Nitrogen atmospheres", "Partial gasification", "Small concentration"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85061933672", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment", "ENER", "2105"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"]], "AuthorData": {"56456916900": {"Name": "Guo J.", "AuthorID": "56456916900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "36664352000": {"Name": "Gadipelli S.", "AuthorID": "36664352000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electrochemical Innovation Lab, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "57196046471": {"Name": "Yang Y.", "AuthorID": "57196046471", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "57196047611": {"Name": "Li Z.", "AuthorID": "57196047611", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "57221220026": {"Name": "Lu Y.", "AuthorID": "57221220026", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "57198560184": {"Name": "Guo Z.", "AuthorID": "57198560184", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "13805905800": {"Name": "Brett D.J.L.", "AuthorID": "13805905800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electrochemical Innovation Lab, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}}}
