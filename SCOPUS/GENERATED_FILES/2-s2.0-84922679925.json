Although historically the human body has been perceived primarily as a tool for actions, there is now increased understanding that the body is also an important medium for emotional expression. Indeed, research on emotional body language is rapidly emerging as a new field in cognitive and affective neuroscience. This article reviews how whole-body signals are processed and understood, at the behavioral and neural levels, with specific reference to their role in emotional communication. The first part of this review outlines brain regions and spectrotemporal dynamics underlying perception of isolated neutral and affective bodies, the second part details the contextual effects on body emotion recognition, and final part discusses body processing on a subconscious level. More specifically, research has shown that body expressions as compared with neutral bodies draw upon a larger network of regions responsible for action observation and preparation, emotion processing, body processing, and integrative processes. Results from neurotypical populations and masking paradigms suggest that subconscious processing of affective bodies relies on a specific subset of these regions. Moreover, recent evidence has shown that emotional information from the face, voice, and body all interact, with body motion and posture often highlighting and intensifying the emotion expressed in the face and voice.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Brain Mapping", "Cognitive Science", "Emotions", "Facial Expression", "Humans", "Kinesics", "Visual Perception", "Voice"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84922679925", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Psychology (all)", "PSYC", "3200"]], "AuthorData": {"55172605400": {"Name": "de Gelder B.", "AuthorID": "55172605400", "AffiliationID": "60018869", "AffiliationName": "Brain and Emotion Laboratory Maastricht, Department of Cognitive Neuroscience, Faculty of Psychology and Neuroscience, Maastricht University"}, "35317540100": {"Name": "de Borst A.", "AuthorID": "35317540100", "AffiliationID": "60018869", "AffiliationName": "Brain and Emotion Laboratory Maastricht, Department of Cognitive Neuroscience, Faculty of Psychology and Neuroscience, Maastricht University"}, "55456693200": {"Name": "Watson R.", "AuthorID": "55456693200", "AffiliationID": "60018869", "AffiliationName": "Brain and Emotion Laboratory Maastricht, Department of Cognitive Neuroscience, Faculty of Psychology and Neuroscience, Maastricht University"}}}
