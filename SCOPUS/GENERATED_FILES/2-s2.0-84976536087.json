Barriers are identified in the ways in which catalog data can be output and the technical skills researchers currently need to download, ingest, and manipulate data. Research tools and datasets created by, or in collaboration with, the library community are identified.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bibliographic data", "Catalog design", "Catalog display", "Catalog indexing", "Information retrieval", "Interoperability", "Library catalogs", "OPACs"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84976536087", "SubjectAreas": [["Library and Information Sciences", "SOCI", "3309"]], "AuthorData": {"37010031900": {"Name": "Welsh A.", "AuthorID": "37010031900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Information Studies, University College London"}}}
