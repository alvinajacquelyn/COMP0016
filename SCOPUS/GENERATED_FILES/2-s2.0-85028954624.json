The Authors.Instrumental records showing increases in surface temperature are some of the robust and iconic evidence of climate change. But how much should we trust regional temperature estimates interpolated from sparse observations? Here we quantify the uncertainty in the instrumental record by applying multiresolution lattice kriging, a recently developed interpolation technique that leverages the multiple spatial scales of temperature anomalies. The probability of monthly anomalies across the globe is represented by an ensemble, based on HadCRUT4 and accounting for observational and coverage uncertainties. To demonstrate the potential of these new data, we investigate the area-averaged temperature anomalies over the Ni\u00f1o 3.4 region in the equatorial Pacific. Having developed a definition of the El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation (ENSO) able to cope with probability distribution functions, we classify the ENSO state for each year since 1851. We find that for many years it is ambiguous as to whether there was an El Ni\u00f1o or not from the Ni\u00f1o 3.4 region alone. These years are mainly before 1920, but also just after World War II.", "AuthorKeywords": ["ENSO", "interpolation", "temperature", "uncertainties"], "IndexKeywords": ["ENSO", "Interpolation techniques", "Multiresolution lattices", "Probabilistic classification", "Southern oscillation", "Surface temperatures", "Temperature anomaly", "Uncertainties"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85028954624", "SubjectAreas": [["Geophysics", "EART", "1908"], ["Earth and Planetary Sciences (all)", "EART", "1900"]], "AuthorData": {"57195591610": {"Name": "Ilyas M.", "AuthorID": "57195591610", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Statistical Science, University College London"}, "6602921518": {"Name": "Guillas S.", "AuthorID": "6602921518", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Statistical Science, University College London"}, "25635521800": {"Name": "Brierley C.", "AuthorID": "25635521800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography, University College London"}}}
