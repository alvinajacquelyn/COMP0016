All rights reserved.A hierarchy of a group is a rooted tree of groups obtained by iteratively passing to vertex groups of graphs of groups decompositions. We define a (relative) slender JSJ hierarchy for (almost) finitely presented groups and show that it is finite, provided the group in question doesn\u2019t contain any slender subgroups with infinite dihedral quotients and satisfies an ascending chain condition on certain chains of subgroups of edge groups. As a corollary, slender JSJ hierarchies of finitely presented subgroups of SLn(\u2124) or of hyperbolic groups which are (virtually) without 2-torsion are finite.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Graph of groups", "Hierarchy", "Strong accessibility"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85019601196", "SubjectAreas": [["Geometry and Topology", "MATH", "2608"]], "AuthorData": {"35248444100": {"Name": "Louder L.", "AuthorID": "35248444100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University College London"}, "15756517800": {"Name": "Touikan N.", "AuthorID": "15756517800", "AffiliationID": "60027392", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematical Sciences, Stevens Institute of Technology"}}}
