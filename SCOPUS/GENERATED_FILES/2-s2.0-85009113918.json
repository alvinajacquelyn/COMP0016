To address this issue, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis investigating the benefits of exercise compared to usual treatment or control conditions in people with an anxiety and/or stress-related disorders. Major electronic databases were searched from inception until December/2015 and a random effect meta-analysis conducted. Altogether, six randomized control trials (RCTs) including 262 adults (exercise n=132, 34.74 [9.6] years; control n=130, 37.34 [10.0] years) were included. Exercise significantly decreased anxiety symptoms more than control conditions, with a moderate effect size (Standardized Mean Difference=\u22120.582, 95%CI \u22121.0 to \u22120.76, p=0.02). Our data suggest that exercise is effective in improving anxiety symptoms in people with a current diagnosis of anxiety and/ or stress-related disorders. Taken together with the wider benefits of exercise on wellbeing and cardiovascular health, these findings reinforce exercise as an important treatment option in people with anxiety/stress disorders.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Anxiety", "Exercise", "Physical activity", "Stress"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Anti-Anxiety Agents", "Anxiety", "Exercise", "Exercise Therapy", "Humans", "Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic", "Stress, Psychological", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85009113918", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"], ["Biological Psychiatry", "NEUR", "2803"]], "AuthorData": {"57204891343": {"Name": "Stubbs B.", "AuthorID": "57204891343", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Health Service and Population Research Department, Institute of Psychiatry, King's College London"}, "26326634000": {"Name": "Vancampfort D.", "AuthorID": "26326634000", "AffiliationID": "60121208, 60025063", "AffiliationName": "KU Leuven \u2013 University of Leuven Department of Rehabilitation Sciences"}, "45761309400": {"Name": "Rosenbaum S.", "AuthorID": "45761309400", "AffiliationID": "60025063", "AffiliationName": "KU Leuven \u2013 University of Leuven"}, "56503241000": {"Name": "Firth J.", "AuthorID": "56503241000", "AffiliationID": "60028333", "AffiliationName": "Department of Exercise Physiology, School of Medical Sciences, University of New South Wales"}, "55948960700": {"Name": "Cosco T.", "AuthorID": "55948960700", "AffiliationID": "60172345, 60003771", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Brain, Behaviour and Mental Health, University of Manchester"}, "36998781200": {"Name": "Veronese N.", "AuthorID": "36998781200", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Unit for Lifelong Health and Ageing at UCL"}, "16550910800": {"Name": "Salum G.A.", "AuthorID": "16550910800", "AffiliationID": "60006726", "AffiliationName": "Programa de P\u00f3s Gradua\u00e7\u00e3o em Ci\u00eancias M\u00e9dicas: Psiquiatria, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul"}, "14016488400": {"Name": "Schuch F.B.", "AuthorID": "14016488400", "AffiliationID": "111165730", "AffiliationName": "Centro Universit\u00e1rio La Salle"}}}
