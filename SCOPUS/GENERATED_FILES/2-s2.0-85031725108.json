The enzyme has also shown great potential as a biocatalyst for the formation of chiral isoquinolines. Here we present new high-resolution X-ray crystallography data describing Thalictrum flavum NCS bound to a mechanism-inspired ligand. The structure supports two key features of the NCS \"dopamine-first\" mechanism: the binding of dopamine catechol to Lys-122 and the position of the carbonyl substrate binding site at the active site entrance. The catalytically vital residue Glu-110 occupies a previously unobserved ligand-bound conformation that may be catalytically significant. The potential roles of inhibitory binding and alternative amino acid conformations in the mechanism have also been revealed. This work significantly advances our understanding of the NCS mechanism and will aid future efforts to engineer the substrate scope and catalytic properties of this useful biocatalyst.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Active site", "Benzylisoquinoline alkaloids", "Carbonyl substrates", "Catalytic properties", "Isoquinolines", "Key feature", "Natural products", "Structural evidence", "Carbon-Nitrogen Ligases", "Catalytic Domain", "Crystallography, X-Ray", "Dopamine", "Models, Molecular", "Thalictrum"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85031725108", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"]], "AuthorData": {"37037726200": {"Name": "Lichman B.R.", "AuthorID": "37037726200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemical Engineering, University College London"}, "55547113393": {"Name": "Ward J.M.", "AuthorID": "55547113393", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemical Engineering, University College London"}, "56003983700": {"Name": "Sula A.", "AuthorID": "56003983700", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Structural and Molecular Biology, Department of Biological Sciences, Birk Beck, University of London"}, "7003604750": {"Name": "Keep N.H.", "AuthorID": "7003604750", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Structural and Molecular Biology, Department of Biological Sciences, Birk Beck, University of London"}, "23489862800": {"Name": "Pesnot T.", "AuthorID": "23489862800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London, Christopher Ingold Building"}, "6603904305": {"Name": "Hailes H.C.", "AuthorID": "6603904305", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London, Christopher Ingold Building"}}}
