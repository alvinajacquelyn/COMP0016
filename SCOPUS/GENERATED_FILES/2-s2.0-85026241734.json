An important point is how to manipulate the incident light so that more light can be efficiently scattered and absorbed within the semiconductors. Here, by using a tunable three-dimensional Au pillar/truncated-pyramid (PTP) array as a plasmonic coupler, a superior optical absorption of about 95% within a wide wavelength range is demonstrated from an assembled CdS/Au PTP photoanode. Based on incident photon to current efficiency measurements and the corresponding finite difference time domain simulations, it is concluded that the enhancement is mainly attributed to an appropriate spectral complementation between surface plasmon resonance modes and photonic modes in the Au PTP structure over the operational spectrum. Because both of them are wavelength-dependent, the Au PTP profile and CdS thickness are further adjusted to take full advantage of the complementary effect, and subsequently, an angle-independent photocurrent with an enhancement of about 400% was obtained. The designed plasmonic PTP nanostructure of Au is highly robust, and it could be easily extended to other plasmonic metals equipped with semiconductor thin films for photovoltaic and photoelectrochemical cells.", "AuthorKeywords": ["CdS/Au", "photoelectrochemical", "photonic mode", "surface plasmon resonance", "three-dimensional nanostructure"], "IndexKeywords": ["Angle-independent", "Finite difference time domain simulations", "Incident photon-to-current efficiencies", "Photoelectrochemicals", "Photonic modes", "Plasmonic nanostructures", "Semiconductor thin films", "Three-dimensional nanostructures"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85026241734", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Engineering (all)", "ENGI", "2200"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"56609608700": {"Name": "Xu R.", "AuthorID": "56609608700", "AffiliationID": "60030040", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Physics and IMN MacroNano (ZIK), Ilmenau University of Technology"}, "36062114200": {"Name": "Wen L.", "AuthorID": "36062114200", "AffiliationID": "60030040", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Physics and IMN MacroNano (ZIK), Ilmenau University of Technology"}, "16641740300": {"Name": "Zhao H.", "AuthorID": "16641740300", "AffiliationID": "60030040", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Physics and IMN MacroNano (ZIK), Ilmenau University of Technology"}, "56014315100": {"Name": "Xu S.", "AuthorID": "56014315100", "AffiliationID": "60030040", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Physics and IMN MacroNano (ZIK), Ilmenau University of Technology"}, "55940636800": {"Name": "Mi Y.", "AuthorID": "55940636800", "AffiliationID": "60030040", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Physics and IMN MacroNano (ZIK), Ilmenau University of Technology"}, "57192592509": {"Name": "Xu Y.", "AuthorID": "57192592509", "AffiliationID": "60030040", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Physics and IMN MacroNano (ZIK), Ilmenau University of Technology"}, "57195204875": {"Name": "Sommerfeld M.", "AuthorID": "57195204875", "AffiliationID": "60030040", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Physics and IMN MacroNano (ZIK), Ilmenau University of Technology"}, "36457445600": {"Name": "Fang Y.", "AuthorID": "36457445600", "AffiliationID": "60030040", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Physics and IMN MacroNano (ZIK), Ilmenau University of Technology"}, "56152354500": {"Name": "Lei Y.", "AuthorID": "56152354500", "AffiliationID": "60030040", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Physics and IMN MacroNano (ZIK), Ilmenau University of Technology"}, "55719675000": {"Name": "Wang Z.", "AuthorID": "55719675000", "AffiliationID": "60021170, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of Semiconductor Materials Science, Institute of Semiconductors, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}}}
