Psychophysiology published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. on behalf of Society for Psychophysiological ResearchOptimism is thought to be beneficial for health, and these effects may be mediated through modifications in psychophysiological stress reactivity. Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is associated with reduced cardiovascular responses to stress and heightened cortisol over the day. This study assessed the relationships between optimism, stress responsivity, and daily cortisol output in people with T2D. A total of 140 participants with T2D were exposed to laboratory stress. Heart rate (HR), systolic (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and cortisol were measured throughout the session. Cortisol output over the day was also assessed. Optimism and self-reported health were measured using the revised Life Orientation Test and the Short Form Health Survey. Optimism was associated with heightened SBP and DBP stress reactivity (ps <.047) and lower daily cortisol output (p =.04). Optimism was not related to HR, cortisol stress responses, or the cortisol awakening response (ps >.180). Low optimism was related to poorer self-reported physical and mental health (ps <.01). Optimism could have a protective role in modulating stress-related autonomic and neuroendocrine dysregulation in people with T2D.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Blood pressure", "Cortisol", "Optimism", "Psychological stress", "Type 2 diabetes"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Blood Pressure", "Cardiovascular System", "Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2", "Female", "Heart Rate", "Humans", "Hydrocortisone", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Optimism", "Saliva", "Stress, Psychological"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85007288477", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Neuropsychology and Physiological Psychology", "PSYC", "3206"], ["Experimental and Cognitive Psychology", "PSYC", "3205"], ["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Endocrine and Autonomic Systems", "NEUR", "2807"], ["Developmental Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2806"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"], ["Biological Psychiatry", "NEUR", "2803"]], "AuthorData": {"55747226800": {"Name": "Puig-Perez S.", "AuthorID": "55747226800", "AffiliationID": "60002644", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychobiology and IDOCAL, Laboratory of Social Cognitive Neuroscience, University of Valencia"}, "7103138329": {"Name": "Salvador A.", "AuthorID": "7103138329", "AffiliationID": "60002644", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychobiology and IDOCAL, Laboratory of Social Cognitive Neuroscience, University of Valencia"}, "55177075200": {"Name": "Hackett R.", "AuthorID": "55177075200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "7102289942": {"Name": "Steptoe A.", "AuthorID": "7102289942", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}}}
