The experimental solubility data, combined with published infinite dilution activity coefficients and Henry\u2019s law constants, are used to derive Abraham model correlations for predicting molar solubility ratios, gas-to-liquid partition coefficients, and water-to-liquid partition coefficients of organic solutes and inorganic gases dissolved in tributyl phosphate. The derived Abraham model equations describe the measured experimental values to within 0.15 log units or less.", "AuthorKeywords": ["infinite dilution activity coefficients", "nonelectrolyte solutes", "partition coefficients", "solubility", "tributyl phosphate"], "IndexKeywords": ["2-Methylbenzoic acids", "4-Chlorobenzoic acids", "4-Nitrobenzoic acids", "Experimental solubility datum", "Infinite dilution activity coefficients", "Nonelectrolyte solutes", "Partition coefficient", "Tri-butyl phosphate"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84926108107", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"], ["Materials Chemistry", "MATE", "2505"]], "AuthorData": {"56320564500": {"Name": "Brumfield M.", "AuthorID": "56320564500", "AffiliationID": "60024438", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of North Texas"}, "56221718600": {"Name": "Wadawadigi A.", "AuthorID": "56221718600", "AffiliationID": "60024438", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of North Texas"}, "56222314000": {"Name": "Kuprasertkul N.", "AuthorID": "56222314000", "AffiliationID": "60024438", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of North Texas"}, "56221968300": {"Name": "Mehta S.", "AuthorID": "56221968300", "AffiliationID": "60024438", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of North Texas"}, "35496753700": {"Name": "Acree W.", "AuthorID": "35496753700", "AffiliationID": "60024438", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of North Texas"}, "7202901240": {"Name": "Abraham M.", "AuthorID": "7202901240", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}}}
