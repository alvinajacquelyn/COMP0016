All rights reserved.Purpose of review: Eastern Europe and Central Asia (EECA) has experienced large-scale epidemics of syphilis, hepatitis C virus (HCV) and HIV over the past few decades. Here, we review recent evidence on the epidemiology of and the response to these intersecting epidemics. Recent findings: The HIV epidemic in EECA continues to expand, with new infections increasing by more than 50% between 2010 and 2015. HCV is now in the top 10 causes of death in EECA, with Russia accounting for more than half of the global burden of HCV infections, but access to direct-acting antivirals remains a major obstacle for control of the epidemic. Although syphilis incidence is generally declining, high prevalence is reported in key populations, particularly sex workers and people who inject drugs. Recent epidemiological studies have highlighted very high prevalence of HIV, syphilis and HCV in prison populations, alongside poor access to prevention and treatment. Summary: Multiple factors are contributing to the ongoing and overlapping HIV, HCV and syphilis epidemics in EECA, including low coverage with antiretroviral therapy and insufficient scale of prevention services. Further research is required to estimate the burden of infections and identify effective prevention and treatment strategies in hard-to-reach key populations, particularly men who have sex with men.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Eastern Europe", "Epidemiology", "Hepatitis C virus", "HIV", "Syphilis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Europe, Eastern", "Female", "Hepacivirus", "Hepatitis C", "HIV Infections", "Humans", "Incidence", "Male", "Prevalence", "Sexual and Gender Minorities", "Syphilis"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84991442399", "SubjectAreas": [["Microbiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2726"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"37109433600": {"Name": "Bailey H.", "AuthorID": "37109433600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Population, Policy and Practice Programme, University College London (UCL) Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, UCL"}, "7101873678": {"Name": "Thorne C.", "AuthorID": "7101873678", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Population, Policy and Practice Programme, University College London (UCL) Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, UCL"}, "26031175500": {"Name": "Turkova A.", "AuthorID": "26031175500", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council Clinical Trials Unit, University College London"}}}
