Unauthorized reproduction of this article is prohibited.Objective: To test blood and CSF neurofilament light chain (NfL) levels in relation to disease progression and survival in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Methods: Using an electrochemiluminescence immunoassay, NfL levels were measured in samples from 2 cohorts of patients with sporadic ALS and healthy controls, recruited in London (ALS/control, plasma: n = 103/42) and Oxford (ALS/control, serum: n = 64/36; paired CSF: n = 38/20). NfL levels in patients were measured at regular intervals for up to 3 years. Change in ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised score was used to assess disease progression. Survival was evaluated using Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier analysis. Results: CSF, serum, and plasma NfL discriminated patients with ALS from healthy controls with high sensitivity (97%, 89%, 90%, respectively) and specificity (95%, 75%, 71%, respectively). CSF NfL was highly correlated with serum levels (r = 0.78, p < 0.0001). Blood NfL levels were approximately 4 times as high in patients with ALS compared with controls in both cohorts, and maintained a relatively constant expression during follow-up. Blood NfL levels at recruitment were strong, independent predictors of survival. The highest tertile of blood NfL at baseline had a mortality hazard ratio of 3.91 (95% confidence interval 1.98- 7.94, p < 0.001). Conclusion: Blood-derived NfL level is an easily accessible biomarker with prognostic value in ALS. The individually relatively stable levels longitudinally offer potential for NfL as a pharmacodynamic biomarker in future therapeutic trials. Classification of evidence: This report provides Class III evidence that the NfL electrochemiluminescence immunoassay accurately distinguishes patients with sporadic ALS from healthy controls.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis", "Biomarkers", "Cohort Studies", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Disease Progression", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Humans", "Longitudinal Studies", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Neurofilament Proteins", "Prognosis"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84930342939", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"7404804808": {"Name": "Lu C.H.", "AuthorID": "7404804808", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Sobell Department of Motor Neuroscience and Movement Disorders, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "34770127900": {"Name": "Giovannoni G.", "AuthorID": "34770127900", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Neuroscience and Trauma, Blizard Institute, Queen Mary University of London"}, "8937520800": {"Name": "Kuhle J.", "AuthorID": "8937520800", "AffiliationID": "60028287", "AffiliationName": "Neurology, University Hospital Basel"}, "7003290890": {"Name": "Malaspina A.", "AuthorID": "7003290890", "AffiliationID": "60170321", "AffiliationName": "Basildon and Thurrock University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57203069719": {"Name": "Greensmith L.", "AuthorID": "57203069719", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Neuromuscular Diseases, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "7006826396": {"Name": "Petzold A.", "AuthorID": "7006826396", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Neuroinflammation, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "12802595400": {"Name": "Fratta P.", "AuthorID": "12802595400", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Neurodegenerative Disease, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "57221060388": {"Name": "Sidle K.", "AuthorID": "57221060388", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Molecular Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "7005900136": {"Name": "Orrell R.", "AuthorID": "7005900136", "AffiliationID": "60020736", "AffiliationName": "National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "36105102100": {"Name": "Macdonald-Wallis C.", "AuthorID": "36105102100", "AffiliationID": "60020650, 60172455", "AffiliationName": "MRC Integrative Epidemiology Unit, University of Bristol"}, "56666865600": {"Name": "Gray E.", "AuthorID": "56666865600", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Nuffield Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Oxford"}, "55624775700": {"Name": "Talbot K.", "AuthorID": "55624775700", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Nuffield Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Oxford"}, "56988366900": {"Name": "Turner M.R.", "AuthorID": "56988366900", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Nuffield Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Oxford"}, "56491440700": {"Name": "Pearce N.", "AuthorID": "56491440700", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Statistics, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "6507640983": {"Name": "Norgren N.", "AuthorID": "6507640983", "AffiliationID": "60112896", "AffiliationName": "UmanDiagnostics"}, "7006461325": {"Name": "Fish M.", "AuthorID": "7006461325", "AffiliationID": "60006737", "AffiliationName": "Medicine Clinical Trial Unit, Musgrove Park Hospital"}, "7403674316": {"Name": "Howard R.", "AuthorID": "7403674316", "AffiliationID": "60020736", "AffiliationName": "National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}}}
