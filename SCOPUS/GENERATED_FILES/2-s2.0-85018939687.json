In this article we first posit that from an analysis of a snapshot of today's centralized and regional data center infrastructure, there is a sufficient number of candidate sites for deploying many services while meeting latency and bandwidth constraints. We then provide quantitative arguments why both network and hardware performance needs to be taken into account when selecting candidate sites to deploy a given service. Finally, we propose a novel architectural solution for service-centric networking. The resulting system exploits the availability of fine-grained execution nodes across the Internet and uses knowledge of available computational and network resources for deploying, replicating and selecting instances to optimize quality of experience for a wide range of services.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Application requirements", "Architectural solutions", "Bandwidth constraint", "Hardware performance", "Optimal placements", "Quality of experience (QoE)", "Resource capabilities", "Service instances"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85018939687", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"13104080000": {"Name": "Simoens P.", "AuthorID": "13104080000", "AffiliationID": "60033316, 60070034", "AffiliationName": "Ghent University, Imec"}, "57212692328": {"Name": "Griffin D.", "AuthorID": "57212692328", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "56026546300": {"Name": "Maini E.", "AuthorID": "56026546300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "55234792400": {"Name": "Phan T.", "AuthorID": "55234792400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "15124049200": {"Name": "Rio M.", "AuthorID": "15124049200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "57194161228": {"Name": "Burstzynowski D.", "AuthorID": "57194161228", "AffiliationID": "60003675", "AffiliationName": "Orange Polska Labs, Warsaw University of Technology"}, "56352592900": {"Name": "Vermoesen L.", "AuthorID": "56352592900", "AffiliationID": "60021378", "AffiliationName": "Nokia Bell Labs"}, "8944918900": {"Name": "Vandeputte F.", "AuthorID": "8944918900", "AffiliationID": "60021378", "AffiliationName": "Nokia Bell Labs"}, "56352085500": {"Name": "Schamel F.", "AuthorID": "56352085500", "AffiliationID": "119132019", "AffiliationName": "Spinor GmbH."}}}
