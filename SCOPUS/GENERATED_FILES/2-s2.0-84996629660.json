One of the great challenges of current designs is to enhance the SH signal and simultaneously tune its radiation direction with a high directivity. In contrast to the linear plasmonic scattering dominated by a bulk dipolar mode, a complex surface-induced multipolar source at the doubled frequency sets a fundamental limit to control the SH radiation from metallic nanostructures. In this work, we harness a plasmonic hybridization mechanism together with a special selection rule governing the SH radiation to achieve the high-intensity and tunable-direction emission by a metallic particle-in-cavity nanoantenna (PIC-NA). The nanoantenna is modelled with a first-principle, self-consistent boundary element method, which considers the depletion of pump waves. The giant SH enhancement arises from a hybridized gap plasmon resonance between the small particle and the large cavity that functions as a concentrator and reflector. Centrosymmetry breaking of the PIC-NA not only modifies the gap plasmon mode boosting the SH signal, but also redirects the SH wave with a unidirectional emission. The PIC-NA has a significantly larger SH conversion efficiency compared to existing literature. The main beam of the radiation pattern can be steered over a wide angle by tuning the particle's position.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Doubled frequencies", "First principles", "Hybridization mechanism", "Metallic nanostructure", "Metallic particles", "Plasmonic particles", "Radiation direction", "Second-harmonic radiation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84996629660", "SubjectAreas": [["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"]], "AuthorData": {"55510328500": {"Name": "Xiong X.", "AuthorID": "55510328500", "AffiliationID": "60006541", "AffiliationName": "Department of EEE, University of Hong Kong"}, "56353178500": {"Name": "Jiang L.", "AuthorID": "56353178500", "AffiliationID": "60006541", "AffiliationName": "Department of EEE, University of Hong Kong"}, "56419475000": {"Name": "Sha W.", "AuthorID": "56419475000", "AffiliationID": "60006541", "AffiliationName": "Department of EEE, University of Hong Kong"}, "53880066900": {"Name": "Lo Y.", "AuthorID": "53880066900", "AffiliationID": "60006541", "AffiliationName": "Department of EEE, University of Hong Kong"}, "26643168800": {"Name": "Chew W.", "AuthorID": "26643168800", "AffiliationID": "60000745", "AffiliationName": "Department of ECE, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign"}, "7006202371": {"Name": "Choy W.", "AuthorID": "7006202371", "AffiliationID": "60006541", "AffiliationName": "Department of EEE, University of Hong Kong"}, "57201198869": {"Name": "Fang M.", "AuthorID": "57201198869", "AffiliationID": "60008023, 60004354", "AffiliationName": "Ames Laboratory, Department of Physics and Astronomy, Iowa State University"}}}
