Here we made single-cell recordings targeted to the K layers of diurnal New World monkeys (marmosets). A subset of recorded cells was excited by both increments and decrements of light intensity (on/off-cells). Histological reconstruction of the location of these cells confirmed that they are segregated to K layers; we therefore refer to these cells as K-on/off cells. The K-on/off cells show high contrast sensitivity, strong bandpass spatial frequency tuning, and their response magnitude is strongly reduced by stimuli larger than the excitatory receptive field (silent suppressive surrounds). Stationary counterphase gratings evoke unmodulated spike rate increases or frequency-doubled responses in K-on/off cells; such responses are largely independent of grating spatial phase. The K-on/off cells are not orientation or direction selective. Some (but not all) properties of K-on/off cells are consistent with those of local-edge-detector/impressed-by-contrast cells reported in studies of cat retina and geniculate, and broad-thorny ganglion cells recorded in macaque monkey retina. The receptive field properties of K-on/off cells and their preferential location in the ventral K layers (K1 and K2) make them good candidates for the direct projection from geniculate to extrastriate cortical area MT/V5. If so, they could contribute to visual information processing in the dorsal (\u201cwhere\u201d or \u201caction\u201d) visual stream.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Lateral geniculate nucleus", "Primate", "Vision"], "IndexKeywords": ["Action Potentials", "Animals", "Callithrix", "Geniculate Bodies", "Neurons", "Photic Stimulation", "Visual Cortex", "Visual Fields"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85057415253", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"]], "AuthorData": {"55901198400": {"Name": "Eiber C.", "AuthorID": "55901198400", "AffiliationID": "60025709", "AffiliationName": "Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Integrative Brain Function, University of Sydney"}, "25639977700": {"Name": "Pietersen A.", "AuthorID": "25639977700", "AffiliationID": "60025709", "AffiliationName": "Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Integrative Brain Function, University of Sydney"}, "53265245000": {"Name": "Zeater N.", "AuthorID": "53265245000", "AffiliationID": "60025709", "AffiliationName": "Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Integrative Brain Function, University of Sydney"}, "7406040488": {"Name": "Martin P.", "AuthorID": "7406040488", "AffiliationID": "60025709", "AffiliationName": "Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Integrative Brain Function, University of Sydney"}, "57204826561": {"Name": "Rahman A.", "AuthorID": "57204826561", "AffiliationID": "60025709", "AffiliationName": "School of Medical Sciences, University of Sydney"}, "24404126600": {"Name": "Dreher B.", "AuthorID": "24404126600", "AffiliationID": "60025709", "AffiliationName": "School of Medical Sciences, University of Sydney"}, "7401460528": {"Name": "Solomon S.", "AuthorID": "7401460528", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Experimental Psychology, University College London"}}}
