All rights reserved 0007 - 0920/15.Background:With growing concerns about risk of harm from cancer screening, particularly from overdiagnosis, this study aimed to assess public attitudes to cancer screening in Great Britain.Methods:We used a population-based survey to assess attitudes to cancer screening, screening history and demographic characteristics, in men and women aged 50-80 years. Data were collected using face-to-face computer-assisted interviews in 2012.Results:In our sample of 2024, attitudes to cancer screening were overwhelmingly positive with almost 90% believing that screening is 'almost always a good idea' and 49% saying they would be tested for cancer even if it was untreatable. Attitudes were particularly positive among those who had previously taken part in breast or colorectal screening.Conclusions:Our findings suggest that attitudes to cancer screening are very positive in Great Britain. Widespread enthusiasm for cancer screening may hamper attempts to encourage a greater appreciation of the limitations and potential harms of screening.", "AuthorKeywords": ["beliefs about screening", "cancer screening", "mass screening/psychology", "screening attitudes"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Attitude to Health", "Breast Neoplasms", "Colorectal Neoplasms", "Consumer Participation", "Data Collection", "Early Detection of Cancer", "Female", "Great Britain", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Motivation", "Neoplasms"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84922261081", "SubjectAreas": [["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Cancer Research", "BIOC", "1306"]], "AuthorData": {"57191898211": {"Name": "Waller J.", "AuthorID": "57191898211", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Health Behaviour Research Centre, Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "7102146930": {"Name": "Wardle J.", "AuthorID": "7102146930", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Health Behaviour Research Centre, Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "56463777600": {"Name": "Osborne K.", "AuthorID": "56463777600", "AffiliationID": "60012754", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Research UK, Angel Building"}}}
