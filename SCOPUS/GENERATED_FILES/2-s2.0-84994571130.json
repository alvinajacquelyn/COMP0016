Both MATLAB integration projects appear to be successful, despite the fact that the two institutions in question are quite different, with one being a well-established research intensive institution and the other a teaching-oriented institution that gained university status in 1992. Despite these differences common themes emerge from the analysis that suggest the minimum requirements that have to be in place for CAS-assisted learning to be successfully introduced.", "AuthorKeywords": ["computer algebra system", "engineering mathematics", "mathematical modelling and analysis component", "MATLAB", "undergraduate mathematics"], "IndexKeywords": ["Computer algebra systems", "Engineering mathematics", "Integration projects", "Mathematical modules", "Mathematics teachings", "Minimum requirements", "Systematic integration"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84994571130", "SubjectAreas": [["Engineering (all)", "ENGI", "2200"], ["Information Systems and Management", "DECI", "1802"], ["Education", "SOCI", "3304"]], "AuthorData": {"23470352700": {"Name": "Nyamapfene A.", "AuthorID": "23470352700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Engineering Sciences, University College London"}, "7202591387": {"Name": "Lynch S.", "AuthorID": "7202591387", "AffiliationID": "60022046", "AffiliationName": "School of Computing, Mathematics and Digital Technology, Manchester Metropolitan University"}}}
