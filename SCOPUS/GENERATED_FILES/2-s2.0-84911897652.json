Preproglucagon (PPG) neurons, located mainly in the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) and medullary reticular formation, produce GLP-1. In transgenic mice expressing glucagon promoter-driven yellow fluorescent protein (YFP), these brainstem PPG neurons project to many central autonomic regions where GLP-1 receptors are expressed. The spinal cord also contains GLP-1 receptor mRNA but the distribution of spinal PPG axons is unknown.Here, we used two-color immunoperoxidase labeling to examine PPG innervation of spinal segments T1-S4 in YFP-PPG mice. Immunoreactivity for YFP identified spinal PPG axons and perikarya. We classified spinal neurons receiving PPG input by immunoreactivity for choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and/or Fluorogold (FG) retrogradely transported from the peritoneal cavity. FG microinjected at T9 defined cell bodies that supplied spinal PPG innervation.The deep dorsal horn of lower lumbar cord contained YFP-immunoreactive neurons. Non-varicose, YFP-immunoreactive axons were prominent in the lateral funiculus, ventral white commissure and around the ventral median fissure. In T1-L2, varicose, YFP-containing axons closely apposed many ChAT-immunoreactive sympathetic preganglionic neurons (SPN) in the intermediolateral cell column (IML) and dorsal lamina X. In the sacral parasympathetic nucleus, about 10% of ChAT-immunoreactive preganglionic neurons received YFP appositions, as did occasional ChAT-positive motor neurons throughout the rostrocaudal extent of the ventral horn. YFP appositions also occurred on NOS-immunoreactive spinal interneurons and on spinal YFP-immunoreactive neurons. Injecting FG at T9 retrogradely labeled many YFP-PPG cell bodies in the medulla but none of the spinal YFP-immunoreactive neurons.These results show that brainstem PPG neurons innervate spinal autonomic and somatic motor neurons. The distributions of spinal PPG axons and spinal GLP-1 receptors correlate well. SPN receive the densest PPG innervation. Brainstem PPG neurons could directly modulate sympathetic outflow through their spinal inputs to SPN or interneurons.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Choline acetyltransferase", "Glucagon-like peptide-1", "Green fluorescent protein", "Nucleus of the solitary tract", "Parasympathetic preganglionic neurons", "Retrograde tracing"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adrenergic Fibers", "Animals", "Axons", "Bacterial Proteins", "Choline O-Acetyltransferase", "Female", "Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Receptor", "Immunoenzyme Techniques", "Interneurons", "Luminescent Proteins", "Male", "Medulla Oblongata", "Mice, Transgenic", "Motor Neurons", "Neuroanatomical Tract-Tracing Techniques", "Nitric Oxide Synthase", "Peritoneal Cavity", "Posterior Horn Cells", "Proglucagon", "Sacrum", "Stilbamidines", "Thoracic Vertebrae"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84911897652", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"]], "AuthorData": {"7005921605": {"Name": "Llewellyn-Smith I.", "AuthorID": "7005921605", "AffiliationID": "60020828", "AffiliationName": "Cardiovascular Medicine, Physiology, Centre for Neuroscience, Flinders University"}, "13004689900": {"Name": "Marina N.", "AuthorID": "13004689900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Metabolism and Experimental Therapeutics, University College London"}, "56426232500": {"Name": "Manton R.", "AuthorID": "56426232500", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery and Cancer, Cell Biology Section, Imperial College"}, "56441808800": {"Name": "Trapp S.", "AuthorID": "56441808800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology, University College London"}, "57203082682": {"Name": "Reimann F.", "AuthorID": "57203082682", "AffiliationID": "60031101, 60017488, 60120909", "AffiliationName": "Metabolic Research Laboratories, Wellcome Trust-MRC Institute of Metabolic Science, University of Cambridge, Addenbrooke's Hospital"}, "7004733731": {"Name": "Gribble F.", "AuthorID": "7004733731", "AffiliationID": "60031101, 60017488, 60120909", "AffiliationName": "Metabolic Research Laboratories, Wellcome Trust-MRC Institute of Metabolic Science, University of Cambridge, Addenbrooke's Hospital"}}}
