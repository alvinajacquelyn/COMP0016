Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.This paper considers whether subject choice at 14\u201316 influences post-16 transitions, taking into account prior academic attainment and school characteristics, and if so, whether this accounts for socioeconomic, gender, and ethnic differences in access to post-16 education. We consider post-16 progression to full-time education, A-levels, and studying two or more facilitating subjects at A-level. We use \u2018Next Steps\u2019, a study of 16,000 people born in England in 1989\u20131990, linked to administrative education records (the National Pupil Database). We find that students pursuing an EBacc-eligible curriculum at 14\u201316 had a greater probability of progression to all post-16 educational outcomes, while the reverse was true for students taking an applied GCSE subject. Curriculum differences did not explain the social class differences in post-16 progression, but an academic curriculum was equally valuable for working-class as for middle-class pupils. Pursuing an EBacc-eligible curriculum particularly strongly increased the chances of girls and white young people staying in the educational pipeline, whereas applied subjects were particularly detrimental for girls. An EBacc-eligible curriculum at age 14\u201316 increased the chances of studying subjects preferred by Russell Group universities at A-level.", "AuthorKeywords": ["applied subjects", "curriculum", "EBacc", "post-16 transitions", "Subject choice"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85041909452", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"]], "AuthorData": {"56500181500": {"Name": "Moulton V.", "AuthorID": "56500181500", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Education"}, "56467722000": {"Name": "Sullivan A.", "AuthorID": "56467722000", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Education"}, "57193543556": {"Name": "Henderson M.", "AuthorID": "57193543556", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Education"}, "56960008800": {"Name": "Anders J.", "AuthorID": "56960008800", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Education"}}}
