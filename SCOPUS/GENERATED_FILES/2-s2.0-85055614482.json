PPI is defined as research being carried out \u2018with\u2019 or \u2018by\u2019 patients and members of the public rather than \u2018to\u2019, \u2018about\u2019 or \u2018for\u2019 them (http://www.invo.org.uk/). Patient involvement is different from collecting data from patients as participants. Ethical considerations also differ. PPI is about patients actively contributing through discussion to decisions about research design, acceptability, relevance, conduct and governance from study conception to dissemination. Occasionally patients lead or do research. The research methods of PPI range from informal discussions to partnership research approaches such as action research, co-production and co-learning. This article discusses how researchers can involve patients when they are applying for research funding and considers some opportunities and pitfalls. It reviews research funder requirements, draws on the literature and our collective experiences as clinicians, patients, academics and members of UK funding panels.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Co-production", "Partnership approaches", "Public and Patient Involvement", "Public Engagement", "Qualitative research", "Research Methods"], "IndexKeywords": ["Decision Making", "Health Services Research", "Humans", "Patient Participation", "Research Design", "Research Personnel"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85055614482", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Immunology and Microbiology (all)", "IMMU", "2400"], ["Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics (all)", "PHAR", "3000"]], "AuthorData": {"6603560550": {"Name": "Hoddinott P.", "AuthorID": "6603560550", "AffiliationID": "60025200", "AffiliationName": "Nursing, Midwifery and Allied Health Professions Research Unit, University of Stirling"}, "7201613828": {"Name": "Pollock A.", "AuthorID": "7201613828", "AffiliationID": "60007573", "AffiliationName": "Nursing, Midwifery and Allied Health Professions Research Unit, Glasgow Caledonian University"}, "7004887052": {"Name": "O'cathain A.", "AuthorID": "7004887052", "AffiliationID": "60176589, 60001881", "AffiliationName": "Medical Care Research Unit, School of Health and Related Research, University of Sheffield"}, "57204446707": {"Name": "Boyer I.", "AuthorID": "57204446707", "AffiliationID": "121509569", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Evaluation, Trials and Studies Coordinating Centre"}, "57204447401": {"Name": "Taylor J.", "AuthorID": "57204447401", "AffiliationID": "109188768", "AffiliationName": "Arthritis Research UK"}, "57204450022": {"Name": "Macdonald C.", "AuthorID": "57204450022", "AffiliationID": "109188768", "AffiliationName": "Arthritis Research UK"}, "57220732075": {"Name": "Oliver S.", "AuthorID": "57220732075", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Social Science, Social Science Research Unit, UCL Institute of Education, University College London"}, "7201817264": {"Name": "Donovan J.L.", "AuthorID": "7201817264", "AffiliationID": "60170515", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Collaboration for Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care West (CLAHRC West), University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
