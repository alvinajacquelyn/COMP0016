We quantify the impact of the Urban Heat Island (UHI) and selected adaptation measures made to dwellings on temperature exposure and mortality in the West Midlands region of the UK. We used 1) building physics models to assess indoor temperatures, initially in the existing housing stock and then following adaptation measures (energy efficiency building fabric upgrades and/or window shutters), of representative dwelling archetypes using data from the English Housing Survey (EHS), and 2) modelled UHI effect on outdoor temperatures. The ages of residents were combined with evidence on the heat-mortality relationship to estimate mortality risk and to quantify population-level changes in risk following adaptations to reduce summertime heat exposure. Results indicate that the UHI effect accounts for an estimated 21% of mortality. External shutters may reduce heat-related mortality by 30\u201360% depending on weather conditions, while shutters in conjunction with energy-efficient retrofitting may reduce risk by up to 52%. The use of shutters appears to be one of the most effective measures providing protection against heat-related mortality during periods of high summer temperatures, although their effectiveness may be limited under extreme temperatures. Energy efficiency adaptations to the dwellings and measures to increase green space in the urban environment to combat the UHI effect appear to be less beneficial for reducing heat-related mortality.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Adaptation", "Dwellings", "Heat", "Indoor temperature", "Mortality", "Urban Heat Island"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adaptation", "Dwellings", "Indoor temperature", "Mortality", "Urban heat island", "Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Climate Change", "Environment Design", "Hot Temperature", "Housing", "Humans", "Infant", "Middle Aged", "Mortality", "Temperature", "United Kingdom", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85034217631", "SubjectAreas": [["Environmental Science (all)", "ENVI", "2300"]], "AuthorData": {"7405402740": {"Name": "Taylor J.", "AuthorID": "7405402740", "AffiliationID": "60084282", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute for Environmental Design and Engineering"}, "56844908400": {"Name": "Symonds P.", "AuthorID": "56844908400", "AffiliationID": "60084282", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute for Environmental Design and Engineering"}, "57202098246": {"Name": "Davies M.", "AuthorID": "57202098246", "AffiliationID": "60084282", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute for Environmental Design and Engineering"}, "35077188000": {"Name": "Mavrogianni A.", "AuthorID": "35077188000", "AffiliationID": "60084282", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute for Environmental Design and Engineering"}, "7201434649": {"Name": "Wilkinson P.", "AuthorID": "7201434649", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Social and Environmental Health Research, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "6603354486": {"Name": "Picetti R.", "AuthorID": "6603354486", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Social and Environmental Health Research, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "55976888100": {"Name": "Heaviside C.", "AuthorID": "55976888100", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "School of Geography, Earth and Environmental Sciences, University of Birmingham"}, "7004386185": {"Name": "Hutchinson E.", "AuthorID": "7004386185", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Social and Environmental Health Research, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "57090329000": {"Name": "Macintyre H.L.", "AuthorID": "57090329000", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Radiation, Chemical and Environmental Hazards, Public Health England"}}}
