It is unclear to what extent this association is confounded by maternal characteristics. To test whether advanced maternal age at birth independently increases the risk of low birth weight (<2,500 g) and preterm birth (<37 weeks' gestation), we compared between-family models (children born to different mothers at different ages) with within-family models (children born to the same mother at different ages). The latter procedure reduces confounding by unobserved parental characteristics that are shared by siblings. We used Finnish population registers, including 124,098 children born during 1987-2000. When compared with maternal ages 25-29 years in between-family models, maternal ages of 35-39 years and \u226540 years were associated with percentage increases of 1.1 points (95% confidence intervals: 0.8, 1.4) and 2.2 points (95% confidence intervals: 1.4, 2.9), respectively, in the probability of low birth weight. The associations are similar for the risk of preterm delivery. In within-family models, the relationship between advanced maternal age and low birth weight or preterm birth is statistically and substantively negligible. In Finland, advanced maternal age is not independently associated with the risk of low birth weight or preterm delivery among mothers who have had at least 2 live births.", "AuthorKeywords": ["low birth weight", "maternal age", "preterm delivery"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Birth Certificates", "Family", "Female", "Finland", "Humans", "Infant, Low Birth Weight", "Infant, Newborn", "Male", "Maternal Age", "Pregnancy", "Pregnancy Outcome", "Premature Birth", "Risk Assessment", "Siblings", "Social Class", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85038230527", "SubjectAreas": [["Epidemiology", "MEDI", "2713"]], "AuthorData": {"37008928100": {"Name": "Goisis A.", "AuthorID": "37008928100", "AffiliationID": "60007470", "AffiliationName": "Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research"}, "55838251400": {"Name": "Barclay K.", "AuthorID": "55838251400", "AffiliationID": "60028378", "AffiliationName": "Department of Sociology, Stockholm University"}, "31967805100": {"Name": "Myrskyl\u00e4 M.", "AuthorID": "31967805100", "AffiliationID": "60002952", "AffiliationName": "Department of Social Research, University of Helsinki"}, "7103195317": {"Name": "Martikainen P.", "AuthorID": "7103195317", "AffiliationID": "60028378, 60012311", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Health Equity Studies (CHESS), Stockholm University and Karolinska Institutet"}, "35335150300": {"Name": "Remes H.", "AuthorID": "35335150300", "AffiliationID": "60002952", "AffiliationName": "Department of Social Research, University of Helsinki"}}}
