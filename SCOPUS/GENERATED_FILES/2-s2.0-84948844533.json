While ultrasound (US) imaging is increasingly used as a guidance modality, it often provides insufficient contrast for identifying nerves from surrounding tissues such as tendons. Electrical nerve stimulators can be used in conjunction with US imaging for discriminating nerves from surrounding tissues, but they are insufficient to reliably prevent neural punctures, so that alternative methods are highly desirable. In this study, an interventional multispectral photoacoustic (PA) imaging system was used to directly compare the signal amplitudes and spectra acquired from nerves and tendons ex vivo, for the first time. The results indicate that the system can provide significantly higher image contrast for discriminating nerves and tendons than that provided by US imaging. As such, photoacoustic imaging could be valuable as an adjunct to US for guiding peripheral nerve blocks.", "AuthorKeywords": ["interventional devices", "Medical and biological imaging", "nerve", "photoacoustic imaging", "tendon", "ultrasound imaging"], "IndexKeywords": ["Interventional", "Medical and biological imaging", "nerve", "Photo-acoustic imaging", "Ultrasound imaging", "Animals", "Equipment Design", "Equipment Failure Analysis", "Image Enhancement", "In Vitro Techniques", "Peripheral Nerves", "Photoacoustic Techniques", "Reproducibility of Results", "Sensitivity and Specificity", "Swine", "Tendons", "Transducers", "Ultrasonography, Interventional"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84948844533", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Biomaterials", "MATE", "2502"], ["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"]], "AuthorData": {"24344561500": {"Name": "Mari J.M.", "AuthorID": "24344561500", "AffiliationID": "60072725", "AffiliationName": "University of French Polynesia, GePaSud"}, "36337500900": {"Name": "Xia W.", "AuthorID": "36337500900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering"}, "55840844300": {"Name": "Desjardins A.E.", "AuthorID": "55840844300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering"}, "55820371500": {"Name": "West S.J.", "AuthorID": "55820371500", "AffiliationID": "60027403", "AffiliationName": "University College Hospital, Department of Anaesthesia"}}}
