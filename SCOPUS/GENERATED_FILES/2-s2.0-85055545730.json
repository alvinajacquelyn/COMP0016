Objective: To examine the associations between 10-year mortality risk with both BMI and body composition, as well as to establish whether these relationships are modified by age and gender, using data from community-dwelling older Brazilian adults. Methods: We used data from two waves i.e., 2000 and 2010 of the SABE (Health, Well-being, and Aging) study conducted in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, involving a probabilistic sample of community-dwelling older adults aged 60 years and older. The variables of the study were: mortality (in 10-year follow-up period), body mass index (BMI), body composition (waist circumference, waist hip ratio, triceps skinfold thickness, mid-upper arm circumference, calf circumference, and arm muscle area) and covariables (sociodemographic characteristics, life style, self-reported health conditions, number of chronic diseases, Mini mental state exam, and Geriatric depression scale). Poisson regression estimates with STATA statistical software were used for statistical analyses, considering all p-values < 0.05. Results: Over the 10-year follow-up period, there were 769 deaths (40.2%). The mortality rate was 61.0 for men and 111.8 for the \u226580 age group. In the fully adjusted model, statistically significant hazard ratios were found for low muscle mass (IRR: 1.33), underweight (IRR: 1.29), and low fat mass (IRR: 1.31) with mortality. Men in extreme BMI categories (underweight - IRR: 1.47; obesity I - IRR: 1.66; and obesity II - IRR: 1.91) and women with low muscle and low fat mass were significantly associated with mortality risk. In the \u226580 age group it was observed that low muscle mass (IRR: 168.7), inadequate body reserves (IRR: 1.63), low fat mass (IRR: 140.7), and underweight (IRR: 142.9) were associated with mortality risk. Waist circumference demonstrated protection for mortality in the high-risk categorization for the \u226580 age group. Conclusion: Our results showed that underweight, low fat mass, and low muscle mass were associated with mortality risk, presenting different roles considering gender and age in older Brazilian adults over a 10-year follow-up period.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Aging", "body composition", "community-dwelling", "mortality"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Aging", "Body Composition", "Brazil", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Mortality", "Prospective Studies", "Time Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85055545730", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (miscellaneous)", "MEDI", "2701"], ["Nutrition and Dietetics", "NURS", "2916"], ["Geriatrics and Gerontology", "MEDI", "2717"]], "AuthorData": {"57193696242": {"Name": "de Almeida Roediger M.", "AuthorID": "57193696242", "AffiliationID": "60008088", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nutrition, Faculty of Public Health (FSP), University of Sao Paulo (USP)"}, "6506195650": {"Name": "de F\u00e1tima Nunes Marucci M.", "AuthorID": "6506195650", "AffiliationID": "60008088", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nutrition, School of Public Health, University of S\u00e3o Paulo"}, "57204427121": {"Name": "Quintiliano Scarpelli Dourado D.A.", "AuthorID": "57204427121", "AffiliationID": "60006469", "AffiliationName": "Nutrition and Dietetics School, Universidad del Desarrollo (UDD)"}, "7102223177": {"Name": "de Oliveira C.", "AuthorID": "7102223177", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology & Public Health, University College London"}, "57204433358": {"Name": "Licio Ferreira Santos J.", "AuthorID": "57204433358", "AffiliationID": "60008088", "AffiliationName": "Department of Social Medicine, University of S\u00e3o Paulo"}, "16233162200": {"Name": "de Oliveira Duarte Y.A.", "AuthorID": "16233162200", "AffiliationID": "60008088", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nursing Medical Surgical, University of S\u00e3o Paulo"}}}
