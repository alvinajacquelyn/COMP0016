Recent efforts to address these challenges at a European level include the Social Investment Package, which emphasizes the importance of social innovation and technologies for improving the efficiency of social policies and their effectiveness in meeting societal needs. By analysing well-documented ICT-enabled social innovation initiatives, this article contributes to capturing the state of technological and social innovations for social services in a more systematic way. Quality, quantity, and sustainability of social services are the starting point of our analysis, which points us to investigate further the role of partnerships and the role of the civil sector as a leading force for driving innovative social service delivery.", "AuthorKeywords": ["innovation partnerships", "social innovation", "technological innovation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Demographic changes", "Emerging technologies", "European levels", "Global economies", "Social innovations", "Social service delivery", "Technological innovation", "Welfare systems"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85010465799", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Information Systems", "COMP", "1710"]], "AuthorData": {"16231931600": {"Name": "Voigt C.", "AuthorID": "16231931600", "AffiliationID": "100590000", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Social Innovation (ZSI)"}, "16643425600": {"Name": "Misuraca G.", "AuthorID": "16643425600", "AffiliationID": "60103695", "AffiliationName": "European Commission, JRC-IPTS"}, "6506572500": {"Name": "Kucsera C.", "AuthorID": "6506572500", "AffiliationID": "60103695", "AffiliationName": "European Commission, JRC-IPTS"}, "57193062578": {"Name": "Lipparini F.", "AuthorID": "57193062578", "AffiliationID": "118997578", "AffiliationName": "PlusValue"}}}
