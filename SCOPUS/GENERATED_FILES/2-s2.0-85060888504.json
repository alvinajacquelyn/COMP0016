Real time control of the quality factor is highly useful for a number of sensing applications, not least dual mode ultrasound systems. This paper reports a new methodology whereby a resonant sensor is coupled to an external electrical resonator making the system a collective coupled system to reduce the quality factor of a high-Q resonant sensor. By suitably controlling the parameters of the external circuit, one can control the quality factor of the resonant sensor. This offers the potential of an ultrasound resonator to be used for both therapeutic (narrowband) and diagnostic (broadband) modalities in real-time.", "AuthorKeywords": ["damping ratio", "electrical resonator coupling", "Ultrasound imaging and therapy"], "IndexKeywords": ["Damping ratio", "Electrical resonators", "External circuits", "Quality-factor controls", "Sensing applications", "Ultrasound imaging", "Ultrasound system", "Ultrasound transducers"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85060888504", "SubjectAreas": [["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"56323409900": {"Name": "Chen C.", "AuthorID": "56323409900", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Engineering, Science University of Oxford"}, "6603472961": {"Name": "Choubey B.", "AuthorID": "6603472961", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Engineering, Science University of Oxford"}}}
