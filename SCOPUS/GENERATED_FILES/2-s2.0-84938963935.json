Self-association of the di-O-caffeoylquinic acid isomers has been studied as well. Caffeine-di-O-caffeoylquinic acid isomers association constants were measured. The value of the association constant of the caffeine-di-O-caffeoylquinic acid complexes is compatible with previous studies and within the typical range of reported association constants for other caffeine-polyphenols complexes. Structural features of the three different complexes have also been investigated by NMR spectroscopy combined with quantum chemical calculations, and the complex conformation is discussed. Our results show that stacking interactions drive the formation of the complexes and that multiple equilibria are present in the interaction of caffeine with 3,4-di-O-caffeoylquinic acid and 4,5-di-O-caffeoylquinic acid while the complex with 3,5-di-O-caffeoylquinic acid seems to be better defined.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Caffeine", "Caffeine heteroassociation", "Density functional theory", "Di-O-caffeoylquinic acid isomers", "NMR"], "IndexKeywords": ["Association constant", "Caffeoylquinic acids", "Complex conformation", "Multiple equilibrium", "Quantum chemical calculations", "Self-associations", "Stacking interaction", "Structural feature"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84938963935", "SubjectAreas": [["Analytical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1602"], ["Food Science", "AGRI", "1106"], ["Biophysics", "BIOC", "1304"], ["Bioengineering", "CENG", "1502"], ["Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology", "IMMU", "2402"]], "AuthorData": {"56376561100": {"Name": "D\u2019Amelio N.", "AuthorID": "56376561100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London"}, "6507459091": {"Name": "Papamokos G.", "AuthorID": "6507459091", "AffiliationID": "60012227", "AffiliationName": "International School for Advanced Studies"}, "57203069952": {"Name": "Dreyer J.", "AuthorID": "57203069952", "AffiliationID": "107863878", "AffiliationName": "German Research School for Simulation Sciences"}, "35466109800": {"Name": "Carloni P.", "AuthorID": "35466109800", "AffiliationID": "107863878", "AffiliationName": "German Research School for Simulation Sciences"}, "7004615833": {"Name": "Navarini L.", "AuthorID": "7004615833", "AffiliationID": "101425928", "AffiliationName": "illycaff\u00e8 S.p.A"}}}
