This study aims to identify and analyse risks associated with potential drug administration errors made by informal carers at home. We mapped medication administration at home with a multidisciplinary team that included carers, health care professionals and patients. Evidence-based risk-analysis methodologies were applied: Healthcare Failure Modes and Effect Analysis (HFMEA), Systematic Human Error Reduction and Prediction Analysis (SHERPA) and Systems-Theoretic Accident Model and Processes (STAMP). The process of administration comprises seven sub-processes. Thirty-four possible failure modes were identified and six of these were rated as high risk. These highlighted that medications may be given with a wrong dose, stored incorrectly, not discontinued as instructed, not recorded, or not ordered on time, and often caused by communication and support problems. Combined risk analyses contributed unique information helpful to better understand the medication administration risks and causes within homecare. Practitioner Summary: Increasingly, medication is being administered at home by family and friends of the care-recipient. This study identifies risks associated with potential drug administration errors made by informal carers at home through consensus-based quantitative techniques. The different analyses contribute unique information helpful to better understand the administration risks and causes.", "AuthorKeywords": ["HFMEA, SHERPA, risk assessment", "medication errors", "Patient safety"], "IndexKeywords": ["Accident models", "Effect analysis", "Evidence-based", "Health care professionals", "Medication errors", "Multi-disciplinary teams", "Patient safety", "Quantitative techniques", "Caregivers", "Home Care Services", "Humans", "Medication Errors", "Prospective Studies", "Risk Assessment"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85020648697", "SubjectAreas": [["Human Factors and Ergonomics", "SOCI", "3307"], ["Physical Therapy, Sports Therapy and Rehabilitation", "HEAL", "3612"]], "AuthorData": {"35076298000": {"Name": "Parand A.", "AuthorID": "35076298000", "AffiliationID": "60184415, 60172638, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "The National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Imperial Patient Safety Translational Research Centre, Imperial College London"}, "56115624100": {"Name": "Johnston M.", "AuthorID": "56115624100", "AffiliationID": "60184415, 60172638, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "The National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Imperial Patient Safety Translational Research Centre, Imperial College London"}, "56031701000": {"Name": "Faiella G.", "AuthorID": "56031701000", "AffiliationID": "60017293", "AffiliationName": "National Centre of Research, Institute of Bio-structure and Bio-imaging, University of Naples"}, "7006674970": {"Name": "Clemente F.", "AuthorID": "7006674970", "AffiliationID": "60017293", "AffiliationName": "National Centre of Research, Institute of Bio-structure and Bio-imaging, University of Naples"}, "57194222242": {"Name": "Franklin B.D.", "AuthorID": "57194222242", "AffiliationID": "60111785, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medication Safety and Service Quality, Pharmacy Department, Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust/UCL School of Pharmacy"}, "57214327779": {"Name": "Stanton N.A.", "AuthorID": "57214327779", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "Engineering and the Environment, University of Southampton"}, "35293409500": {"Name": "Sevdalis N.", "AuthorID": "35293409500", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Implementation Science, King\u2019s College London"}}}
