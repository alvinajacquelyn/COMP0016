To date, most hepatocyte maintenance and differentiation systems have relied upon the use of animal derived components. This serves as a significant barrier to large scale production and application of stem cell derived hepatocytes. Recently, the use of defined biologics has overcome those limitations in two-dimensional monolayer culture. In order to improve the cell phenotype further, three-dimensional culture systems have been employed to better mimic the in vivo situation, drawing upon materials chemistry, engineering and biology. In this review we discuss efforts in the field, to differentiate pluripotent stem cells towards hepatocytes under defined conditions.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Cell phenotype", "Cellular differentiation", "Clinical application", "Large scale productions", "Materials chemistry", "Monolayer culture", "Pluripotent stem cells", "Three-dimensional culture system"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84971299219", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"]], "AuthorData": {"55221835900": {"Name": "Lucendo-Villarin B.", "AuthorID": "55221835900", "AffiliationID": "60014873, 60015879, 60027272", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council Centre for Regenerative Medicine, University of Edinburgh"}, "26535019500": {"Name": "Rashidi H.", "AuthorID": "26535019500", "AffiliationID": "60014873, 60015879, 60027272", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council Centre for Regenerative Medicine, University of Edinburgh"}, "57203069268": {"Name": "Cameron K.", "AuthorID": "57203069268", "AffiliationID": "60014873, 60015879, 60027272", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council Centre for Regenerative Medicine, University of Edinburgh"}, "26657949400": {"Name": "Hay D.", "AuthorID": "26657949400", "AffiliationID": "60014873, 60015879, 60027272", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council Centre for Regenerative Medicine, University of Edinburgh"}}}
