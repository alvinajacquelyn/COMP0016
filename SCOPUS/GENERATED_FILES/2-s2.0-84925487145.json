Investment in preventive strategies and extending the support from the acute health care setting into the community are invaluable for optimising pharmacotherapy.Results: Two hundred and sixty-seven MRPs were identified from 266 prescription chart reviews. The incidence was 51.2 % (203 MRPs, 166 charts; 95 % CI 43.2\u201360.6 %) of hospitalised patients and 32 % (64 MRPs, 100 charts; 95 % CI 22.9\u201341.1 %) in outpatients. The number of prescribed medications was the only independent predictor during inpatient treatment (OR 1.06, 95 % CI 1.02\u20131.10, p = 0.002) with no significant predictors identified at outpatient clinics. The severity level of the MRPs was minor: 53.9 %, (144 out of 267); or moderate: 46.1 %, (123 out of 267). Sub-optimal drug effect was the predominant MRP (inpatient: 68 %; outpatient: 39 %). Prescribing error and patients' medicine-taking behaviour were the main contributory factors. The majority of the MRPs in the inpatient setting were resolved.Background: Medication-related problems (MRPs) are the undesirable effects of pharmacotherapy that can potentially lead to harm. The epidemiology of MRPs in paediatric renal patients is unknown. We aimed to characterise MRPs in this population at two tertiary care hospitals in the UK.Methods: Prescription charts for children (\u226418 years) were reviewed to identify MRPs, and characterised using a specific proforma with a standard operational definition. MRP predictors were evaluated by logistic regression and severity was assessed using a validated scale.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Drug-related problems", "Medication safety", "Paediatric nephrology", "Pharmacotherapy", "Prescribing errors"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Cohort Studies", "Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions", "Female", "Great Britain", "Humans", "Infant", "Kidney Diseases", "Male", "Tertiary Care Centers"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84925487145", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Nephrology", "MEDI", "2727"]], "AuthorData": {"55509217500": {"Name": "Ibrahim N.", "AuthorID": "55509217500", "AffiliationID": "60025530", "AffiliationName": "Pharmacy Department, Paediatric Institute, General Hospital Kuala Lumpur"}, "7102513915": {"Name": "Wong I.C.K.", "AuthorID": "7102513915", "AffiliationID": "60103563, 60006541", "AffiliationName": "Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, University of Hong Kong"}, "6603352762": {"Name": "Jani Y.", "AuthorID": "6603352762", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Pharmacy Department, University College London Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "55404681700": {"Name": "Tomlin S.", "AuthorID": "55404681700", "AffiliationID": "60109217, 60107269, 60005518", "AffiliationName": "Pharmacy Department, Evelina London Children\u2019s Hospital, Guy\u2019s and St. Thomas\u2019 Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, King\u2019s Health Partners"}, "55509589000": {"Name": "Sinha M.D.", "AuthorID": "55509589000", "AffiliationID": "60109217, 60107269, 60005518", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Nephrology, Evelina London Children\u2019s Hospital, Guy\u2019s and St. Thomas\u2019 Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, King\u2019s Health Partners"}, "16146771300": {"Name": "Rees L.", "AuthorID": "16146771300", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nephrology, Great Ormond Street Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
