Both the parietal-opercular (SII) and posterior insula have been consistently implicated in thermosensory processing, but neither region has yet been identified as the locus of fine temperature discrimination. Using a perceptual learning paradigm in male and female humans, we show improvement in discrimination accuracy for subdegree changes in both warmth and cool detection over 5 d of repetitive training. We found that increases in discriminative accuracy were specific to the temperature (cold or warm) being trained. Using structural imaging to look for plastic changes associated with perceptual learning, we identified symmetrical increases in gray matter volume in the SII cortex. Furthermore, we observed distinct, adjacent regions for cold and warm discrimination, with cold discrimination having a more anterior locus than warm. The results suggest that thermosensory discrimination is supported by functionally and anatomically distinct temperature-specific modules in the SII cortex.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Interoception", "Pain", "Perceptual learning", "Thermal", "Thermosensory", "VBM"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Discrimination Learning", "Female", "Frontal Lobe", "Gray Matter", "Hot Temperature", "Humans", "Male", "Parietal Lobe", "Thermosensing"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85030166525", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"]], "AuthorData": {"56503230500": {"Name": "Mano H.", "AuthorID": "56503230500", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Computational and Biological Learning Laboratory, Department of Engineering, University of Cambridge"}, "7006358579": {"Name": "Yoshida W.", "AuthorID": "7006358579", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Computational and Biological Learning Laboratory, Department of Engineering, University of Cambridge"}, "7004347773": {"Name": "Kawato M.", "AuthorID": "7004347773", "AffiliationID": "60001271", "AffiliationName": "Advanced Telecommunications Research Institute International"}, "8609317000": {"Name": "Seymour B.", "AuthorID": "8609317000", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Computational and Biological Learning Laboratory, Department of Engineering, University of Cambridge"}, "24401980900": {"Name": "Shibata K.", "AuthorID": "24401980900", "AffiliationID": "60000264", "AffiliationName": "Graduate School of Environmental Studies, Nagoya University"}, "57195894225": {"Name": "Koltzenburg M.", "AuthorID": "57195894225", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "56103262700": {"Name": "Zhang S.", "AuthorID": "56103262700", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Computational and Biological Learning Laboratory, Department of Engineering, University of Cambridge"}}}
