For PCI to be developed further, it is important to understand whether nerve damage is an impending side effect when treating cancers within or adjacent to nervous system tissue. Dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons and their associated satellite glia were subjected to PCI treatment in a 3D co-culture system following incubation with photosensitisers: meso-tetraphenylporphine (TPPS2a) or tetraphenylchlorin disulfonate (TPCS2a) and Bleomycin. Results from the use of 3D co-culture models demonstrate that a cancer cell line PCI30 and satellite glia were more sensitive to PCI than neurons and mixed glial cells, athough neurite length was affected. Neurons in culture survived PCI treatment under conditions sufficient to kill tumour cells, suggesting cancers within or adjacent to nervous system tissue could be treated with this novel technology.", "AuthorKeywords": ["3D culture models", "Bleomycin", "Nervous system", "Photochemical Internalisation", "Photosensitisers"], "IndexKeywords": ["Bleomycin", "Cell Line, Tumor", "Coculture Techniques", "Drug Delivery Systems", "Ganglia, Spinal", "Humans", "Neoplasms", "Neuroglia", "Neurons", "Photochemotherapy", "Photosensitizing Agents", "Porphyrins"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85020268684", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmaceutical Science", "PHAR", "3003"]], "AuthorData": {"56989039500": {"Name": "O'Rourke C.", "AuthorID": "56989039500", "AffiliationID": "60013985, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomaterials & Tissue Engineering, UCL Eastman Dental Institute, University College London"}, "26643365600": {"Name": "MacRobert A.J.", "AuthorID": "26643365600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Surgery & Interventional Science, University College London"}, "6602368084": {"Name": "Woodhams J.H.", "AuthorID": "6602368084", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Surgery & Interventional Science, University College London"}, "9240949100": {"Name": "Phillips J.B.", "AuthorID": "9240949100", "AffiliationID": "60013985, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomaterials & Tissue Engineering, UCL Eastman Dental Institute, University College London"}, "7006171950": {"Name": "Hopper C.", "AuthorID": "7006171950", "AffiliationID": "60013985", "AffiliationName": "Academic Unit of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, UCL Eastman Dental Institute"}}}
