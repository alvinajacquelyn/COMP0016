Protocols for ecosystem risk assessment are uniquely suited to this task, providing objective syntheses of a wide range of data to estimate the likelihood of ecosystem collapse. Satellite remote sensing can deliver ecologically relevant, long-term datasets suitable for analysing changes in ecosystem area, structure and function at temporal and spatial scales relevant to risk assessment protocols. However, there is considerable uncertainty about how to select and effectively utilise remotely sensed variables for risk assessment. Here, we review the use of satellite remote sensing for assessing spatial and functional changes of ecosystems, with the aim of providing guidance on the use of these data in ecosystem risk assessment. We suggest that decisions on the use of satellite remote sensing should be made a priori and deductively with the assistance of conceptual ecosystem models that identify the primary indicators representing the dynamics of a focal ecosystem.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Biodiversity monitoring", "Earth observation", "Ecological indicators", "Ecosystem status", "Risk assessment", "Satellite remote sensing"], "IndexKeywords": ["Biodiversity monitoring", "Earth observations", "Ecological indicators", "Ecosystem status", "Satellite remote sensing", "Conservation of Natural Resources", "Ecosystem", "Remote Sensing Technology", "Risk Assessment"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85034111139", "SubjectAreas": [["Environmental Engineering", "ENVI", "2305"], ["Environmental Chemistry", "ENVI", "2304"], ["Waste Management and Disposal", "ENVI", "2311"], ["Pollution", "ENVI", "2310"]], "AuthorData": {"55516662500": {"Name": "Murray N.", "AuthorID": "55516662500", "AffiliationID": "60031004", "AffiliationName": "School of Biological Sciences, University of Queensland"}, "7102144937": {"Name": "Keith D.", "AuthorID": "7102144937", "AffiliationID": "60112807", "AffiliationName": "New South Wales Office of Environment and Heritage"}, "36816111900": {"Name": "Lyons M.", "AuthorID": "36816111900", "AffiliationID": "60028333", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Ecosystem Science, School of Biological, Earth and Environmental Sciences, University of New South Wales"}, "55816939900": {"Name": "Lucas R.", "AuthorID": "55816939900", "AffiliationID": "60028333", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Ecosystem Science, School of Biological, Earth and Environmental Sciences, University of New South Wales"}, "55213540900": {"Name": "Bland L.", "AuthorID": "55213540900", "AffiliationID": "60018805", "AffiliationName": "Deakin University, School of Life and Environmental Sciences, Centre for Integrative Ecology (Burwood Campus)"}, "14018465400": {"Name": "Nicholson E.", "AuthorID": "14018465400", "AffiliationID": "60018805", "AffiliationName": "Deakin University, School of Life and Environmental Sciences, Centre for Integrative Ecology (Burwood Campus)"}, "56320859000": {"Name": "Ferrari R.", "AuthorID": "56320859000", "AffiliationID": "60014975", "AffiliationName": "Australian Institute of Marine Science"}, "8536629700": {"Name": "Pettorelli N.", "AuthorID": "8536629700", "AffiliationID": "60005453, 60009498", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Zoology, Zoological Society of London"}}}
