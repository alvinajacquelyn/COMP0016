For an air-cooled open-cathode polymer electrolyte fuel cell (PEFC) the air blowers form the largest parasitic load and have a direct influence of the performance of the stack and its temperature; increasing air flow often leading to improved performance at the expense of increasing parasitic load. Here, electro-thermal performance maps are used to characterise stack operation with varying air flow rate (for both cooling and cathode oxygen supply). The non-linear power requirement of air blowers is used to modify stack-level electro-thermal maps to give system-level performance maps capable of identifying the optimum air flow rate to maximise net power output and consequently efficiency at a given operating point. The electro-thermal map concept is invoked in the consideration of dynamics of fuel cell system operation with issues pertaining to speed of response, durability and system self-sustainable operation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Electro-thermal performance maps", "Experimental optimisation", "Forced convection", "Polymer electrolyte fuel cell (PEFC)"], "IndexKeywords": ["Dynamic operations", "Net power outputs", "Optimisations", "Polymer electrolyte fuel cells", "Power requirement", "Speed of response", "System-level performance", "Thermal Performance"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84955328628", "SubjectAreas": [["Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment", "ENER", "2105"], ["Fuel Technology", "ENER", "2103"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Energy Engineering and Power Technology", "ENER", "2102"]], "AuthorData": {"57202240331": {"Name": "Meyer Q.", "AuthorID": "57202240331", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electrochemical Innovation Lab, Department of Chemical Engineering, UCL"}, "24178516700": {"Name": "Shearing P.R.", "AuthorID": "24178516700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electrochemical Innovation Lab, Department of Chemical Engineering, UCL"}, "13805905800": {"Name": "Brett D.J.L.", "AuthorID": "13805905800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electrochemical Innovation Lab, Department of Chemical Engineering, UCL"}, "56734465000": {"Name": "Himeur A.", "AuthorID": "56734465000", "AffiliationID": "60009236", "AffiliationName": "Phelma Grenoble INP"}, "24365904000": {"Name": "Ashton S.", "AuthorID": "24365904000", "AffiliationID": "60100349, 60170287", "AffiliationName": "Intelligent Energy, Charnwood Building"}, "36902842100": {"Name": "Curnick O.", "AuthorID": "36902842100", "AffiliationID": "60100349, 60170287", "AffiliationName": "Intelligent Energy, Charnwood Building"}, "16027639500": {"Name": "Clague R.", "AuthorID": "16027639500", "AffiliationID": "60100349, 60170287", "AffiliationName": "Intelligent Energy, Charnwood Building"}, "55945068500": {"Name": "Reisch T.", "AuthorID": "55945068500", "AffiliationID": "60100349, 60170287", "AffiliationName": "Intelligent Energy, Charnwood Building"}, "23388612100": {"Name": "Adcock P.", "AuthorID": "23388612100", "AffiliationID": "60100349, 60170287", "AffiliationName": "Intelligent Energy, Charnwood Building"}}}
