Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.Genuine engagement about how best to achieve liveable urban futures should be part of planning\u2019s raison-d\u2019etre but it has a chequered history of delivery. Exhibitions harnessing the communicative power of mixed media and linked to a progressive and responsive programme of focused discussion and debate remain relevant to community consultation and civic engagement. Terry Farrell\u2019s concept of the \u2018urban room\u2019 to involve citizens in engaging with the past, present, and future of towns and cities offers a contemporary refreshment of the approach propounded by Patrick Geddes from the early 1900s. The possibilities of creating novel and compelling opportunities for civic discourse in this guise are explored in this review article though the Newcastle City Futures pop-up exhibition and events held in Newcastle upon Tyne, UK in 2014. This event carries lessons for imagining how planners, developers, governments, and community groups may come together to critically and creatively forge future propositions for the urban condition.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Newcastle upon Tyne", "planning exhibitions", "public participation", "Sir Patrick Geddes", "Sir Terry Farrell", "Urban rooms"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85060652317", "SubjectAreas": [["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"]], "AuthorData": {"7003292806": {"Name": "Tewdwr-Jones M.", "AuthorID": "7003292806", "AffiliationID": "60162625, 60006222", "AffiliationName": "Global Urban Research Unit, Newcastle University School of Architecture Planning and Landscape"}, "57217887796": {"Name": "Sookhoo D.", "AuthorID": "57217887796", "AffiliationID": "60162625, 60006222", "AffiliationName": "Global Urban Research Unit, Newcastle University School of Architecture Planning and Landscape"}, "7003776355": {"Name": "Freestone R.", "AuthorID": "7003776355", "AffiliationID": "60028333", "AffiliationName": "Built Environment, University of New South Wales"}}}
