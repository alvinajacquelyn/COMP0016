However, assembling evidence for this hypothesis has proved difficult. Here, by combining brain size information for over 1,200 bird species with remote-sensing analyses to estimate temporal variation in ecosystem productivity, we show that larger brains (relative to body size) are more likely to occur in species exposed to larger environmental variation throughout their geographic range. Our reconstructions of evolutionary trajectories are consistent with the hypothesis that larger brains (relative to body size) evolved when the species invaded more seasonal regions. However, the alternative - that the species already possessed larger brains when they invaded more seasonal regions - cannot be completely ruled out. Regardless of the exact mechanism, our findings provide strong empirical support for the association between large brains and environmental variability.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animal Migration", "Animals", "Behavior, Animal", "Biological Evolution", "Birds", "Body Size", "Brain", "Cognition", "Ecosystem", "Environment", "Models, Biological", "Organ Size", "Phylogeny", "Principal Component Analysis", "Selection, Genetic", "Species Specificity"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85006850808", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"57148498300": {"Name": "Sayol F.", "AuthorID": "57148498300", "AffiliationID": "60022367", "AffiliationName": "CREAF, Cerdanyola Del Vall\u00e8s"}, "55330911800": {"Name": "Maspons J.", "AuthorID": "55330911800", "AffiliationID": "60022367", "AffiliationName": "CREAF, Cerdanyola Del Vall\u00e8s"}, "8928241600": {"Name": "Sol D.", "AuthorID": "8928241600", "AffiliationID": "60006754", "AffiliationName": "CSIC, Cerdanyola Del Vall\u00e8s"}, "55614249100": {"Name": "Lapiedra O.", "AuthorID": "55614249100", "AffiliationID": "60009982", "AffiliationName": "Department of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology, Harvard University"}, "7004070479": {"Name": "Iwaniuk A.N.", "AuthorID": "7004070479", "AffiliationID": "60189748, 60024776", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Canadian Centre for Behavioural Neuroscience, University of Lethbridge"}, "57206169205": {"Name": "Sz\u00e9kely T.", "AuthorID": "57206169205", "AffiliationID": "60030480", "AffiliationName": "Milner Centre of Evolution, Department of Biology AndBiochemistry, University of Bath"}}}
