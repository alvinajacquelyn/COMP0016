However, most of the previous work was based on mechanically exfoliated graphene, which is not compatible with wafer-scale production. To overcome this limitation, we have used graphene grown by chemical vapour deposition (CVD) as the weak link of Josephson junctions. We demonstrate that very short, wide CVD-graphene-based Josephson junctions with Nb electrodes can work without any undesirable hysteresis in their electrical characteristics from 1.5 K down to a base temperature of 320 mK, and their gate-tuneable critical current shows an ideal Fraunhofer-like interference pattern in a perpendicular magnetic field. Furthermore, for our shortest junctions (50 nm in length), we find that the normal state resistance oscillates with the gate voltage, consistent with the junctions being in the ballistic regime, a feature not previously observed in CVD-graphene-based Josephson junctions.", "AuthorKeywords": ["ballistic", "CVD", "graphene", "hybrid structure", "Josephson junction", "SGS junction"], "IndexKeywords": ["Chemical vapour deposition", "Electrical characteristic", "Hybrid structure", "Interference patterns", "Josephson-junction", "Normal-state resistance", "Perpendicular magnetic fields", "SGS junction"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85044197830", "SubjectAreas": [["Ceramics and Composites", "MATE", "2503"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Metals and Alloys", "MATE", "2506"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"], ["Materials Chemistry", "MATE", "2505"]], "AuthorData": {"55767739200": {"Name": "Li T.", "AuthorID": "55767739200", "AffiliationID": "60010785", "AffiliationName": "National Physical Laboratory, Teddington"}, "6701351606": {"Name": "Romans E.", "AuthorID": "6701351606", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "16218796100": {"Name": "Gallop J.", "AuthorID": "16218796100", "AffiliationID": "60010785", "AffiliationName": "National Physical Laboratory, Teddington"}, "34769536200": {"Name": "Hao L.", "AuthorID": "34769536200", "AffiliationID": "60010785", "AffiliationName": "National Physical Laboratory, Teddington"}}}
