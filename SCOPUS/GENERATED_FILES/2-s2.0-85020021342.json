By focussing on the work of Minnette de Silva, an early pioneer of Sri Lankan tropical architecture, and on the stylistic and aesthetic influences on her work, and hence on contemporary manifestations of the genre, the paper traces the connections between a conscious desire amongst tropical modernists to build with Sri Lanka\u2019s superabundant tropical nature\u2013rather than guarding against it\u2013and emergent aesthetic constitutions of an avowedly \u201cpost-colonial\u201d politics. It goes on to demonstrate how the fluid spatialities, and historical and cultural narrativisations of de Silva\u2019s work have been drawn into hegemonic articulations of Sinhala Buddhist nationalism in the last few decades, despite her more secular modernist intentions. The paper argues for a situated geopolitical understanding of de Silva\u2019s pathbreaking tropical modern architecture.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85020021342", "SubjectAreas": [["Visual Arts and Performing Arts", "ARTS", "1213"], ["Urban Studies", "SOCI", "3322"]], "AuthorData": {"14019662300": {"Name": "Jazeel T.", "AuthorID": "14019662300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography, University College London"}}}
