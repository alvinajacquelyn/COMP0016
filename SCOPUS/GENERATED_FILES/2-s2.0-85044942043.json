The mixed findings may be explained by the general process of disinhibition. In this view, gender may moderate the effect of darkness on ethical behaviors. The results of two experiments support this prediction. In Experiment 1, male participants in dimly lit streets exhibited lower levels of prosocial behaviors than those in well-lit streets, whereas women in dimly lit streets exhibited significantly higher levels of prosocial behaviors than those in well-lit streets. In Experiment 2, male college students in a dimly lit room exhibited significantly lower levels of trustworthiness in a trust game than those in a well-lit room, whereas there was no significant difference between the trustworthiness levels of women in rooms with varying levels of illumination; Experiment 2 also revealed that darkness did not affect participants\u2019 trust. In summary, gender moderates the effect of darkness on ethical and prosocial behaviors.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Darkness", "Disinhibition", "Ethical behaviors", "Trust", "Trustworthiness"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85044942043", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychology (all)", "PSYC", "3200"]], "AuthorData": {"55888738600": {"Name": "Liu G.", "AuthorID": "55888738600", "AffiliationID": "112930529", "AffiliationName": "College of Politics, National Defence University"}, "57205181448": {"Name": "Niu X.", "AuthorID": "57205181448", "AffiliationID": "115402459", "AffiliationName": "Center of Collaborative Innovation for Assessment and Promotion of Mental Health"}, "56461738100": {"Name": "Lin L.", "AuthorID": "56461738100", "AffiliationID": "115402459", "AffiliationName": "Center of Collaborative Innovation for Assessment and Promotion of Mental Health"}}}
