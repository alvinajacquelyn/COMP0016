The fabricated narrow-ridge-waveguide Fabry\u2013Perot (FP) lasers have achieved a room-temperature continuous-wave (CW) threshold current of 12.5 mA and high CW temperature tolerance up to 90\u00b0C. An ultra-low relative intensity noise of less than \u2212150 dB\u2215Hz is measured in the 4\u201316 GHz range. Using this low-noise Si-based laser, we then demonstrate 25.6 Gb/s data transmission over 13.5 km SMF-28. These low-cost FP laser devices are promising candidates to provide cost-effective solutions for use in uncooled Si photonics transmitters in inter/hyper data centers and metropolitan data links.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Continuous waves", "Cost-effective solutions", "Low relative intensity noise", "Si based lasers", "Si photonics", "Single transverse modes", "Temperature tolerance", "Threshold currents"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85056361884", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"]], "AuthorData": {"57190436073": {"Name": "Liao M.", "AuthorID": "57190436073", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "54939079100": {"Name": "Chen S.", "AuthorID": "54939079100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "56115496300": {"Name": "Liu Z.", "AuthorID": "56115496300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "8276654100": {"Name": "Ponnampalam L.", "AuthorID": "8276654100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "57204608011": {"Name": "Zhou Z.", "AuthorID": "57204608011", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "10141185300": {"Name": "Wu J.", "AuthorID": "10141185300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "55365959800": {"Name": "Tang M.", "AuthorID": "55365959800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "57202133987": {"Name": "Liu Z.", "AuthorID": "57202133987", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "7004751445": {"Name": "Seeds A.", "AuthorID": "7004751445", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "15765485000": {"Name": "Liu H.", "AuthorID": "15765485000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "57216714934": {"Name": "Wang Y.I.", "AuthorID": "57216714934", "AffiliationID": "60021182", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Optoelectronic Materials and Technologies, Sun Yat-sen University"}, "57199322085": {"Name": "Yu S.", "AuthorID": "57199322085", "AffiliationID": "60021182", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Optoelectronic Materials and Technologies, Sun Yat-sen University"}, "35194710600": {"Name": "Shutts S.", "AuthorID": "35194710600", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, Cardiff University"}, "7005402256": {"Name": "Smowton P.M.", "AuthorID": "7005402256", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, Cardiff University"}}}
