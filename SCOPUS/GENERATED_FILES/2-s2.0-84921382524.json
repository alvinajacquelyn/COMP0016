Kinetics of the photolyses were followed by UV spectrophotometry at 220 nm, and the products were characterized by HPLC, XPS, and 13C-SSNMR. The ratio of the initial rates of photolysis in the presence and absence of mNTO, k/ko, showed a systematic decrease. The photolytic decay of Phe occurs with minor formation of tyrosine. The mass of nanotubes produced an exponential attenuation of the photolytic decomposition of Phe. Total carbon analyses (TCA) showed no inorganic carbon formation after the photolyses. The first-order rate constant of photofunctionalization of mNTO by the insertion of phenylalanine onto the nanotube matrix was calculated from TCA to be kin = 30.1 min-1. Comparison of the XPS spectra of the mNTO before and after the photolysis, using the atom inventory technique, suggests the insertion of Phe along with the extrusion of a sulfide radical anion (\u2022S-) which undergo subsequent oxidation to SO42-. The obtained results show the effects of mNTO on the photolysis of Phe and provide a new method of photofunctionalization of carbon materials, modified by the intermediates of the reduction of SO2, with an organic moiety.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Carbon material", "Exponential attenuation", "First-order rate constants", "Inorganic carbon", "Oxidized carbons", "Photolytic decay", "Photolytic decomposition", "UV spectrophotometry", "Kinetics", "Nanotubes, Carbon", "Oxidation-Reduction", "Phenylalanine", "Photolysis", "Silicon Dioxide"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84921382524", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Surfaces and Interfaces", "PHYS", "3110"], ["Spectroscopy", "CHEM", "1607"], ["Electrochemistry", "CHEM", "1603"]], "AuthorData": {"6603894246": {"Name": "Humeres E.", "AuthorID": "6603894246", "AffiliationID": "60017609", "AffiliationName": "Departamento de Qu\u00edmica, Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina"}, "56131802800": {"Name": "De Souza E.P.", "AuthorID": "56131802800", "AffiliationID": "60017609", "AffiliationName": "Departamento de Qu\u00edmica, Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina"}, "6602695119": {"Name": "Debacher N.A.", "AuthorID": "6602695119", "AffiliationID": "60017609", "AffiliationName": "Departamento de Qu\u00edmica, Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina"}, "35561721100": {"Name": "Moreira R.D.F.P.M.", "AuthorID": "35561721100", "AffiliationID": "60017609", "AffiliationName": "Departamento de Engenharia Qu\u00edmica e Engenharia de Alimentos, Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina"}, "10039323800": {"Name": "Lopes C.N.", "AuthorID": "10039323800", "AffiliationID": "60017609", "AffiliationName": "Departamento de Engenharia Qu\u00edmica e Engenharia de Alimentos, Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina"}, "36716028800": {"Name": "Fern\u00e1ndez M.I.", "AuthorID": "36716028800", "AffiliationID": "60023610", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physical Chemistry and Chemical Engineering i, Faculty of Sciences, University of A Coru\u00f1a"}, "6701476302": {"Name": "Santaballa J.A.", "AuthorID": "6701476302", "AffiliationID": "60023610", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physical Chemistry and Chemical Engineering i, Faculty of Sciences, University of A Coru\u00f1a"}, "55667283500": {"Name": "Canle M.L.", "AuthorID": "55667283500", "AffiliationID": "60023610", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physical Chemistry and Chemical Engineering i, Faculty of Sciences, University of A Coru\u00f1a"}, "34768990400": {"Name": "Schreiner W.H.", "AuthorID": "34768990400", "AffiliationID": "60015043", "AffiliationName": "Departamento de F\u00edsica, Universidade Federal Do Paran\u00e1"}, "7102384385": {"Name": "Aliev A.E.", "AuthorID": "7102384385", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}}}
