We used this opportunity to assess the relationship between its use and the attitudes and behaviours of antimicrobial prescribers. Methods We used 2 structured cross-sectional questionnaires issued just prior to and 3 months following the launch of the smartphone app. Ordinal Likert scale responses to both frequencies of use and agreement statements permitted quantitative assessment of the relationship between variables. Results The smartphone app was used more frequently than the pocket guide it replaced (p < 0.01), and its increased use was associated with sentiments that the app was useful, easy to navigate and its content relevant. Users who used the app more frequently were more likely to agree that the app encouraged them to challenge inappropriate prescribing by their colleagues (p = 0.001) and were more aware of the importance of antimicrobial stewardship (p = 0.005). Reduced use of the app was associated with agreement that senior physicians' preferences for antimicrobial prescribing would irrespectively overrule guideline recommendations (p = 0.0002). Conclusions Smartphone apps are an effective and acceptable format to deliver guidance on antimicrobial prescribing. Our findings suggest that they may empower users to challenge incorrect prescribing, breaking well-established behaviours, and thus supporting vital stewardship efforts in an era of increased antimicrobial resistance. Future work will need to focus on the direct impact on drug prescriptions as well as identifying barriers to implementing smartphone apps in other clinical settings.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Anti-Infective Agents", "Attitude of Health Personnel", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Drug Prescriptions", "Humans", "Inappropriate Prescribing", "Mobile Applications", "Physicians", "Practice Guidelines as Topic", "Practice Patterns, Physicians'", "Smartphone", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84964794763", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"8210764700": {"Name": "Panesar P.", "AuthorID": "8210764700", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacy, University College London Hospitals"}, "57189030911": {"Name": "Jones A.", "AuthorID": "57189030911", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacy, University College London Hospitals"}, "57189027094": {"Name": "Aldous A.", "AuthorID": "57189027094", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacy, University College London Hospitals"}, "23008694200": {"Name": "Kranzer K.", "AuthorID": "23008694200", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Microbiology, University College London Hospitals"}, "57221747529": {"Name": "Fifer H.", "AuthorID": "57221747529", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Microbiology, University College London Hospitals"}, "23976350200": {"Name": "Macrae B.", "AuthorID": "23976350200", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Microbiology, University College London Hospitals"}, "24511900500": {"Name": "Curtis C.", "AuthorID": "24511900500", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Microbiology, University College London Hospitals"}, "57203626240": {"Name": "Pollara G.", "AuthorID": "57203626240", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London"}, "57189027650": {"Name": "Halpin E.", "AuthorID": "57189027650", "AffiliationID": "116598790", "AffiliationName": "Horizon Strategic Partners"}}}
