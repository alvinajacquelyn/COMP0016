We investigated the association of a range of objectively and subjectively assessed oral health markers with disability and physical function in older age. Design, Setting, and Participants: Cross-sectional analyses were based on the British Regional Heart Study (BRHS) comprising men aged 71 to 92 years (n = 2147) from 24 British towns, and the Health, Aging, and Body Composition (HABC) Study comprising men and women aged 71 to 80 years (n = 3075) from the United States. Assessments included oral health (periodontal disease, tooth count, dry mouth, and self-rated oral health), disability, and physical function (grip strength, gait speed, and chair stand test). Results: In the BRHS, dry mouth, tooth loss, and cumulative oral health problems (\u22653 problems) were associated with mobility limitations and problems with activities of daily living and instrumental activities of daily living; these remained significant after adjustment for confounding variables (for \u22653 dry mouth symptoms, odds ratio (OR) 2.68, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.94\u20133.69; OR 1.76, 95% CI 1.15\u20132.69; OR 2.90, 95% CI 2.01, 4.18, respectively). Similar results were observed in the HABC Study. Dry mouth was associated with the slowest gait speed in the BRHS, and the weakest grip strength in the HABC Study (OR 1.75, 95% CI 1.22, 2.50; OR 2.43, 95% CI 1.47\u20134.01, respectively). Conclusions and Implications: Markers of poor oral health, particularly dry mouth, poor self-rated oral health, and the presence of more than 1 oral health problem, were associated with disability and poor physical function in older populations. Prospective investigations of these associations and underlying pathways are needed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["disability", "older", "Oral health", "physical function"], "IndexKeywords": ["Activities of Daily Living", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Cohort Studies", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Dental Care", "Disability Evaluation", "Exercise Test", "Female", "Hand Strength", "Humans", "Jaw, Edentulous", "Male", "Mobility Limitation", "Oral Health", "Periodontal Pocket", "Tooth Loss", "United Kingdom", "United States", "Walking Speed", "Xerostomia"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85070262471", "SubjectAreas": [["Nursing (all)", "NURS", "2900"], ["Health Policy", "MEDI", "2719"], ["Geriatrics and Gerontology", "MEDI", "2717"]], "AuthorData": {"57210323996": {"Name": "Kotronia E.", "AuthorID": "57210323996", "AffiliationID": "60026712, 60006222", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Health and Society, Newcastle University"}, "9743612700": {"Name": "Ramsay S.E.", "AuthorID": "9743612700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Primary Care and Population Health, University College London"}, "7006543768": {"Name": "Wannamethee S.G.", "AuthorID": "7006543768", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Primary Care and Population Health, University College London"}, "56592813200": {"Name": "Papacosta A.O.", "AuthorID": "56592813200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Primary Care and Population Health, University College London"}, "6603033975": {"Name": "Lennon L.T.", "AuthorID": "6603033975", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Primary Care and Population Health, University College London"}, "7006237290": {"Name": "Whincup P.H.", "AuthorID": "7006237290", "AffiliationID": "60029329", "AffiliationName": "Population Health Research Institute, St George's University of London"}, "7102107053": {"Name": "Visser M.", "AuthorID": "7102107053", "AffiliationID": "60008734, 60117142", "AffiliationName": "Department of Health Sciences, Faculty of Earth and Life Sciences, Amsterdam Public Health Research Institute, Vrije Universiteit"}, "7007029377": {"Name": "Weyant R.J.", "AuthorID": "7007029377", "AffiliationID": "60015543", "AffiliationName": "Department of Dental Public Health, School of Dental Medicine, University of Pittsburgh"}, "57220774479": {"Name": "Harris T.B.", "AuthorID": "57220774479", "AffiliationID": "60017252", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Epidemiology and Population Sciences, Intramural Research Program, National Institute on Aging"}}}
