We show that for any finitely generated subgroup, there is a finite dimensional representation of the free or surface group that separates the subgroup in the induced Zariski topology. As a corollary, we establish a polynomial upper bound on the size of the quotients used to separate a finitely generated subgroup in a free or surface group.", "AuthorKeywords": ["20E05", "20E26"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85011805296", "SubjectAreas": [["Mathematics (all)", "MATH", "2600"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"35248444100": {"Name": "Louder L.", "AuthorID": "35248444100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University College London"}, "6603723069": {"Name": "McReynolds D.B.", "AuthorID": "6603723069", "AffiliationID": "60028629, 60009254", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, Purdue University"}, "56027834200": {"Name": "Patel P.", "AuthorID": "56027834200", "AffiliationID": "60029241", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University of California, Santa Barbara"}}}
