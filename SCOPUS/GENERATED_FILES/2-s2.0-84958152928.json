Published by Elsevier Ltd.This study provides an introduction into the concept of the resource nexus, general limitations of energy systems modelling tools and an overview of specific tools that have been or could potentially be used in addressing the nexus. Initially, the thinking behind the resource nexus is presented, and how it could be used to highlight the interlinkages among energy, water, food, land and materials, which constitute an important aspect in managing potential future dangers. Different types of tools and their specific limitations are discussed, followed by a categorization of different top-down and bottom-up tools. Finally, a short review of specific tools and their ability of addressing the nexus is presented. The information within this paper gives the necessary information for a first screening process as to which tool would be most appropriate to use, using the resource nexus as a concept.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Energy models", "Overview", "Resource nexus"], "IndexKeywords": ["Energy model", "Energy systems", "Energy-systems models", "Interlinkages", "Overview", "Resource nexus", "Screening process", "Specific tool"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84958152928", "SubjectAreas": [["Energy (all)", "ENER", "2100"]], "AuthorData": {"57193433736": {"Name": "Semertzidis T.", "AuthorID": "57193433736", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Energy Institute, UCL, Central House"}}}
