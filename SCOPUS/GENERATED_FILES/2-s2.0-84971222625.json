Increased WMH volume is associated with risk and progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). These observations are typically interpreted as evidence that vascular abnormalities play an additive, independent role contributing to symptom presentation, but not core features of AD. We examined the severity and distribution of WMH in presymptomatic PSEN1, PSEN2, and APP mutation carriers to determine the extent to which WMH manifest in individuals genetically determined to develop AD. Methods The study comprised participants (n = 299; age = 39.03 \u00b1 10.13) from the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network, including 184 (61.5%) with a mutation that results in AD and 115 (38.5%) first-degree relatives who were noncarrier controls. We calculated the estimated years from expected symptom onset (EYO) by subtracting the affected parent's symptom onset age from the participant's age. Baseline MRI data were analyzed for total and regional WMH. Mixed-effects piece-wise linear regression was used to examine WMH differences between carriers and noncarriers with respect to EYO. Results Mutation carriers had greater total WMH volumes, which appeared to increase approximately 6 years before expected symptom onset. Effects were most prominent for the parietal and occipital lobe, which showed divergent effects as early as 22 years before estimated onset. Interpretation Autosomal-dominant AD is associated with increased WMH well before expected symptom onset. The findings suggest the possibility that WMHs are a core feature of AD, a potential therapeutic target, and a factor that should be integrated into pathogenic models of the disease.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Alzheimer Disease", "Amyloid beta-Peptides", "Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor", "Biomarkers", "Case-Control Studies", "Female", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Heterozygote", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Neuroimaging", "Peptide Fragments", "Presenilin-1", "Presenilin-2", "tau Proteins", "White Matter", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84971222625", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"56267815500": {"Name": "Lee S.", "AuthorID": "56267815500", "AffiliationID": "60029358", "AffiliationName": "Division of Biostatistics, New York State Psychiatric Institute"}, "57189458131": {"Name": "Viqar F.", "AuthorID": "57189458131", "AffiliationID": "60015095", "AffiliationName": "Psychology Department, Fordham University"}, "55599664800": {"Name": "Narkhede A.", "AuthorID": "55599664800", "AffiliationID": "60011605, 60030162", "AffiliationName": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University"}, "25226032200": {"Name": "Tosto G.", "AuthorID": "25226032200", "AffiliationID": "60027565, 60030162, 60018043", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York Presbyterian Hospital, Columbia University"}, "7101793222": {"Name": "Mayeux R.", "AuthorID": "7101793222", "AffiliationID": "60014211, 60030162, 60011605", "AffiliationName": "Gertrude H.
