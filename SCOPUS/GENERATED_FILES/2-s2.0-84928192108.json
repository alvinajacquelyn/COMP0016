All rights reserved: reproduction in whole or part not permitted.Sonodynamic therapy (SDT) has emerged as a promising option for the minimally invasive treatment of solid cancerous tumours. SDT requires the combination of three distinct components: a sensitising drug, ultrasound, and molecular oxygen. Individually, these components are non-toxic but when combined together generate cytotoxic reactive oxygen species (ROS). The major advantage of SDT over its close relative photodynamic therapy (PDT), is the increased penetration of ultrasound through mammalian tissue compared to light. As a result, SDT can be used to treat a wider array of deeper and less accessible tumours than PDT. In this article, we critically review the current literature on SDT and discuss strategies that have been developed in combination with SDT to enhance the therapeutic outcome.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cancer", "Photodynamic therapy", "Reactive oxygen species", "Sonodynamic therapy", "Sonosensitiser", "Ultrasound"], "IndexKeywords": ["Humans", "Neoplasms", "Reactive Oxygen Species", "Ultrasonic Therapy"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84928192108", "SubjectAreas": [["Physiology", "BIOC", "1314"], ["Physiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2737"], ["Cancer Research", "BIOC", "1306"]], "AuthorData": {"56601416800": {"Name": "Costley D.", "AuthorID": "56601416800", "AffiliationID": "60020730", "AffiliationName": "Biomedical Sciences Research Institute, University of Ulster"}, "56601347000": {"Name": "Mc Ewan C.", "AuthorID": "56601347000", "AffiliationID": "60020730", "AffiliationName": "Biomedical Sciences Research Institute, University of Ulster"}, "51665005200": {"Name": "Fowley C.", "AuthorID": "51665005200", "AffiliationID": "60020730", "AffiliationName": "Biomedical Sciences Research Institute, University of Ulster"}, "7007102532": {"Name": "McHale A.P.", "AuthorID": "7007102532", "AffiliationID": "60020730", "AffiliationName": "Biomedical Sciences Research Institute, University of Ulster"}, "56601221100": {"Name": "Atchison J.", "AuthorID": "56601221100", "AffiliationID": "60020730", "AffiliationName": "Biomedical Sciences Research Institute, University of Ulster"}, "7007084127": {"Name": "Callan J.F.", "AuthorID": "7007084127", "AffiliationID": "60020730", "AffiliationName": "Biomedical Sciences Research Institute, University of Ulster"}, "14071677100": {"Name": "Nomikou N.", "AuthorID": "14071677100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Surgery and Interventional Science, Medical School, University College"}}}
