We investigated whether these may be explained by ethnic disparities in socioeconomic deprivation (SED). Data on all diagnoses made in sexual health clinics in England in 2013 were obtained from the mandatory STI surveillance system. Poisson regression was used to calculate incidence rate ratios (IRRs) of STIs, by ethnicity, with and without adjustment for index of multiple deprivation (IMD) a measure of area-level deprivation. Unadjusted IRRs (95% confidence intervals) were highest for gonorrhoea [8\u00b718 (7\u00b777-8\u00b761) and 5\u00b776 (5\u00b728-6\u00b729)] and genital herpes [4\u00b724 (3\u00b799-4\u00b751) and 3\u00b758 (3\u00b723-3\u00b798)] for people of black Caribbean and non-Caribbean/non-African black ethnicity and IRRs were highest for syphilis [8\u00b776 (7\u00b797-9\u00b763)] and genital warts [2\u00b723 (2\u00b717-2\u00b729)] for people of non-British/non-Irish white ethnicity compared to white British ethnicity. After adjustment for IMD, IRRs for gonorrhoea [5\u00b776 (5\u00b747-6\u00b707)] and genital herpes [3\u00b773 (3\u00b750-3\u00b797)] declined but remained highest for black Caribbeans and IRRs for syphilis [7\u00b735 (6\u00b768-8\u00b709)] and genital warts [2\u00b710 (2\u00b704-2\u00b716)] declined but remained highest for non-British/non-Irish white compared to white British. In England, ethnic disparities in STI diagnosis rates are partially explained by SED, but behavioural and contextual factors likely contribute. Clinic and community-based interventions should involve social peer networks to ensure they are targeted and culturally sensitive.", "AuthorKeywords": ["ethnicity", "IMD", "socioeconomic deprivation", "STI"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "England", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Population Surveillance", "Risk Factors", "Sexually Transmitted Diseases", "Socioeconomic Factors", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84981495617", "SubjectAreas": [["Epidemiology", "MEDI", "2713"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"36027423400": {"Name": "Furegato M.", "AuthorID": "36027423400", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "National Infection Service, Public Health England"}, "56459672100": {"Name": "Mohammed H.", "AuthorID": "56459672100", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "National Infection Service, Public Health England"}, "15023559500": {"Name": "Savage E.", "AuthorID": "15023559500", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "National Infection Service, Public Health England"}, "7402326764": {"Name": "Hughes G.", "AuthorID": "7402326764", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "National Infection Service, Public Health England"}, "57190609890": {"Name": "Chen Y.", "AuthorID": "57190609890", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Sexual Health and HIV Research, University College London"}, "7103014246": {"Name": "Mercer C.", "AuthorID": "7103014246", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Sexual Health and HIV Research, University College London"}}}
