Published by Taylor & Francis Group.OpenStreetMap (OSM) data are widely used but their reliability is still variable. Many contributors to OSM have not been trained in geography or surveying and consequently their contributions, including geometry and attribute data inserts, deletions, and updates, can be inaccurate, incomplete, inconsistent, or vague. There are some mechanisms and applications dedicated to discovering bugs and errors in OSM data. Such systems can remove errors through user-checks and applying predefined rules but they need an extra control process to check the real-world validity of suspected errors and bugs. This paper focuses on finding bugs and errors based on patterns and rules extracted from the tracking data of users. The underlying idea is that certain characteristics of user trajectories are directly linked to the type of feature. Using such rules, some sets of potential bugs and errors can be identified and stored for further investigations.", "AuthorKeywords": ["OpenStreetMap (OSM)", "Spatial data quality", "trajectory data mining"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84961755358", "SubjectAreas": [["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"], ["Computers in Earth Sciences", "EART", "1903"]], "AuthorData": {"55626206500": {"Name": "Basiri A.", "AuthorID": "55626206500", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "The Nottingham Geospatial Institute, The University of Nottingham"}, "7404069350": {"Name": "Jackson M.", "AuthorID": "7404069350", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "The Nottingham Geospatial Institute, The University of Nottingham"}, "23393650400": {"Name": "Pourabdollah A.", "AuthorID": "23393650400", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "The School of Computer Science, The University of Nottingham"}, "36010915700": {"Name": "Moore T.", "AuthorID": "36010915700", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "The Nottingham Geospatial Institute, The University of Nottingham"}, "24066500100": {"Name": "Amirian P.", "AuthorID": "24066500100", "AffiliationID": "60004334", "AffiliationName": "Ordnance Survey"}, "21735637400": {"Name": "Sester M.", "AuthorID": "21735637400", "AffiliationID": "60004935", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cartography and Geoinformatics (IKG), Leibniz Universit\u00e4t"}, "55900295200": {"Name": "Winstanley A.", "AuthorID": "55900295200", "AffiliationID": "60026281", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, Maynooth University"}, "56528627900": {"Name": "Zhang L.", "AuthorID": "56528627900", "AffiliationID": "60022403", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Civil and Environmental Engineering, The Technion-Israel Institute of Technology"}}}
