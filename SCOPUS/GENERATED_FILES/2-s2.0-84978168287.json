In this study, we assess the assumption that the maximum cancer Gleason grade (Gleason grade hotspot) lies within the maximum dimension (volume hotspot) of a prostate cancer lesion.Methods:3-D histopathological models were reconstructed using the outputs of the 5-mm transperineal mapping (TPM) biopsies used as the reference test in the pilot phase of Prostate Mri Imaging Study (PROMIS), a paired validating cohort study investigating the performance of multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) against transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) biopsies. The prostate was fully sampled with 5 mm intervals; each core was separately labelled, inked and orientated in space to register 3-D cancer lesions location. The data from the histopathology results were used to create a 3-D interpolated reconstruction of each lesion and identify the spatial coordinates of the largest dimension (volume hot spot) and highest Gleason grade (Gleason grade hotspot) and assess their concordance.Results:Ninety-four men, with median age 62 years (interquartile range, IQR= 58-68) and median PSA 6.5 ng ml -1 (4.6-8.8), had a median of 80 (I69-89) cores each with a median of 4.5 positive cores (0-12). In the primary analysis, the prevalence of homogeneous lesions was 148 (76%; 95% confidence interval (CI) \u00b16.0%). In all, 184 (94\u00b13.2%) lesions showed concordant hotspots and 11/47 (23\u00b112.1%) of heterogeneous lesions showed discordant hotspots. The median 3-D distance between discordant hotspots was 12.8 mm (9.9-15.5). These figures remained stable on secondary analyses using alternative reconstructive assumptions. Limitations include a certain degree of error within reconstructed models.Conclusions:Guiding one biopsy needle to the maximum cancer diameter would lead to correct Gleason grade attribution in 94% of all lesions and 79% of heterogeneous ones if a true hit was obtained. Further correlation of histological lesions, their MRI appearance and the detectability of these hotspots on MRI will be undertaken once PROMIS results are released.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Biomarkers, Tumor", "Humans", "Image-Guided Biopsy", "Imaging, Three-Dimensional", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Neoplasm Grading", "Prostatic Neoplasms", "Tumor Burden"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84978168287", "SubjectAreas": [["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Urology", "MEDI", "2748"], ["Cancer Research", "BIOC", "1306"]], "AuthorData": {"55954124400": {"Name": "El-Shater Bosaily A.", "AuthorID": "55954124400", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, University College London, Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "35301144700": {"Name": "Valerio M.", "AuthorID": "35301144700", "AffiliationID": "60023561", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Vaudois"}, "7004667094": {"Name": "Emberton M.", "AuthorID": "7004667094", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, University College London, Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "8147855500": {"Name": "Ahmed H.U.", "AuthorID": "8147855500", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, University College London, Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "24512208500": {"Name": "Hu Y.", "AuthorID": "24512208500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Image Computing, University College London"}, "8972541300": {"Name": "Freeman A.", "AuthorID": "8972541300", "AffiliationID": "60010088", "AffiliationName": "Department of Histopathology, College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "23566729200": {"Name": "Jameson C.", "AuthorID": "23566729200", "AffiliationID": "60010088", "AffiliationName": "Department of Histopathology, College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "8547250200": {"Name": "Brown L.", "AuthorID": "8547250200", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council Clinical Trials Unit, University College London"}, "7403162716": {"Name": "Kaplan R.", "AuthorID": "7403162716", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council Clinical Trials Unit, University College London"}, "6603779879": {"Name": "Hindley R.G.", "AuthorID": "6603779879", "AffiliationID": "60170281", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, Basingstoke Hospital, Hampshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7005201740": {"Name": "Barratt D.", "AuthorID": "7005201740", "AffiliationID": "60170281", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, Basingstoke Hospital, Hampshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
