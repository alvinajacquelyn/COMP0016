We discuss the importance of quantifying skeletal muscle in the intensive care unit setting. We also identify the merits and limitations of various modalities that are capable of accurately and precisely measuring muscularity. Ultrasound is emerging as a potentially powerful tool for skeletal muscle quantification; however, there are key challenges that need to be addressed in future work to ensure useful interpretation and comparability of results across diverse observational and interventional studies. Ultrasound presents several methodological challenges, and ultimately muscle quantification combined with metabolic, nutritional, and functional markers will allow optimal patient assessment and prognosis. Moving forward, we recommend that publications include greater detail on landmarking, repeated measures, identification of muscle that was not assessable, and reproducible protocols to more effectively compare results across different studies.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Critical illness", "Intensive care", "Muscle atrophy", "Muscle cross-sectional area", "Muscle thickness"], "IndexKeywords": ["Critical Care", "Critical Illness", "Humans", "Muscle, Skeletal", "Muscular Atrophy", "Ultrasonography"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85030465507", "SubjectAreas": [["Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine", "MEDI", "2740"]], "AuthorData": {"6506116342": {"Name": "Mourtzakis M.", "AuthorID": "6506116342", "AffiliationID": "60014171", "AffiliationName": "Department of Kinesiology, Faculty of Applied Health Sciences, University of Waterloo"}, "55624923600": {"Name": "Parry S.", "AuthorID": "55624923600", "AffiliationID": "60026553", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physiotherapy, School of Health Sciences, University of Melbourne"}, "55044436900": {"Name": "Connolly B.", "AuthorID": "55044436900", "AffiliationID": "60005518, 60011520, 60171763", "AffiliationName": "National Institute of Health Research Biomedical Research Centre, Guy\u2019s and St. Thomas\u2019 NHS Foundation Trust, King\u2019s College London"}, "6508205361": {"Name": "Puthucheary Z.", "AuthorID": "6508205361", "AffiliationID": "60009009", "AffiliationName": "Adult, Intensive Care Unit, Royal Brompton Hospital"}}}
