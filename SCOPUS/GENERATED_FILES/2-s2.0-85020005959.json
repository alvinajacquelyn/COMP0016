However, the influence of ions present in solution on the 2D- and 3D-AFM measurements has not been well understood. In this study, we perform atomic-scale 2D- and 3D-AFM measurements at fluorite-water interfaces in pure water and a supersaturated solution of fluorite. The images obtained in these two environments are compared to understand the influence of the ions in solution on these measurements. In the 2D images, we found clear difference in the nanoscale structures but no significant difference in the atomic-scale contrasts. However, the 3D force images show clear difference in the subnanometer-scale contrasts. The force contrasts measured in pure water largely agree with those expected from the molecular dynamics simulation and the solvent tip approximation model. In the supersaturated solution, an additional force peak is observed over the negatively charged fluorine ion site. This location suggests that the observed force peak may originate from cations adsorbed on the fluorite surface. These results demonstrate that the ions can significantly alter the subnanometer-scale force contrasts in the 3D-AFM images.", "AuthorKeywords": ["atomicresolution imaging", "fluorite-water interface", "frequency modulation atomic force microscopy", "hydration structures", "molecular dynamics simulation", "solvent tip approximation model", "three-dimensional scanning force microscopy"], "IndexKeywords": ["Approximation model", "Atomic-resolution imaging", "Force microscopy", "Frequency modulation atomic force microscopy", "Hydration structure", "Molecular dynamics simulations", "Water interface"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85020005959", "SubjectAreas": [["Bioengineering", "CENG", "1502"], ["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Mechanics of Materials", "ENGI", "2211"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"56533237000": {"Name": "Miyazawa K.", "AuthorID": "56533237000", "AffiliationID": "60024784", "AffiliationName": "Division of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Kanazawa University"}, "7006634114": {"Name": "Fukuma T.", "AuthorID": "7006634114", "AffiliationID": "60015682", "AffiliationName": "ACT-C, Japan Science and Technology Agency"}, "7202553462": {"Name": "Watkins M.", "AuthorID": "7202553462", "AffiliationID": "60026830", "AffiliationName": "School of Mathematics and Physics, University of Lincoln"}, "7007118546": {"Name": "Shluger A.L.", "AuthorID": "7007118546", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, London Centre for Nanotechnology, University College London"}}}
