A single, low-cost gyroscopic unit and three independent compasses are used to acquire data onboard the vehicle. The gyroscope data, prone to sporadic bias drifts, are fused individually with readings from each of the compasses via a weighted interval Kalman filter. Unlike the standard Kalman filter, the weighted interval Kalman filter is able to provide a robust heading estimate even when subject to such gyroscope bias drifts. The three ensuing weighted interval Kalman filter estimates of the vehicle's heading are then fused via a fuzzy logic algorithm designed to provide an accurate heading estimate even when two of the three compasses develop a fault at any time. Simulations and real-time trials demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "AuthorKeywords": ["autonomous surface vehicle", "fuzzy logic", "interval Kalman filtering", "Multi-sensor data fusion"], "IndexKeywords": ["Autonomous surface vehicles", "Fault-tolerant", "Fuzzy logic algorithms", "Interval Kalman filtering", "Multi-sensor fusion", "Multisensor data fusion", "Standard Kalman filters", "Weighted intervals"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84978481191", "SubjectAreas": [["Ocean Engineering", "ENGI", "2212"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"]], "AuthorData": {"55940575500": {"Name": "Motwani A.", "AuthorID": "55940575500", "AffiliationID": "60024779", "AffiliationName": "Marine and Industrial Dynamic Analysis (MIDAS), Research Group, School of Marine Science and Engineering, Plymouth University"}, "55628583710": {"Name": "Sharma S.", "AuthorID": "55628583710", "AffiliationID": "60024779", "AffiliationName": "Marine and Industrial Dynamic Analysis (MIDAS), Research Group, School of Marine Science and Engineering, Plymouth University"}, "7402401622": {"Name": "Sutton R.", "AuthorID": "7402401622", "AffiliationID": "60024779", "AffiliationName": "Marine and Industrial Dynamic Analysis (MIDAS), Research Group, School of Marine Science and Engineering, Plymouth University"}, "56612461100": {"Name": "Liu W.", "AuthorID": "56612461100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Marine Research Group, Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "7005111389": {"Name": "Bucknall R.", "AuthorID": "7005111389", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Marine Research Group, Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}}}
