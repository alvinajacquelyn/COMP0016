However, sine-waves fail to mimic the broad spread of excitation produced by a CI and noise-bands contain intrinsic modulations that are absent in CIs. The present study proposes pulse-spreading harmonic complexes (PSHCs) as an alternative acoustic carrier in vocoders. Sentence-in-noise recognition was measured in 12 normal-hearing subjects for noise-, sine-, and PSHC-vocoders. Consistent with the amount of intrinsic modulations present in each vocoder condition, the average speech reception threshold obtained with the PSHC-vocoder was higher than with sine-vocoding but lower than with noise-vocoding.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Harmonic complexes", "Noise bands", "Normal hearing", "Sine-wave", "Speech reception threshold", "Acoustic Stimulation", "Cochlear Implantation", "Cochlear Implants", "Electric Stimulation", "Humans", "Noise", "Perceptual Masking", "Persons With Hearing Impairments", "Recognition (Psychology)", "Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted", "Speech Intelligibility", "Speech Perception", "Speech Reception Threshold Test"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84959457831", "SubjectAreas": [["Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)", "ARTS", "1201"], ["Acoustics and Ultrasonics", "PHYS", "3102"]], "AuthorData": {"56433630000": {"Name": "Mesnildrey Q.", "AuthorID": "56433630000", "AffiliationID": "60102127, 60073354", "AffiliationName": "LMA-CNRS, UPR 7051, Aix-Marseille Universit\u00e9, Centrale Marseille"}, "6508182495": {"Name": "Hilkhuysen G.", "AuthorID": "6508182495", "AffiliationID": "60102127, 60073354", "AffiliationName": "LMA-CNRS, UPR 7051, Aix-Marseille Universit\u00e9, Centrale Marseille"}, "14063597700": {"Name": "MacHerey O.", "AuthorID": "14063597700", "AffiliationID": "60102127, 60073354", "AffiliationName": "LMA-CNRS, UPR 7051, Aix-Marseille Universit\u00e9, Centrale Marseille"}}}
