Aims: This cross-syndrome comparison explored the specific and general difficulties that parents of children with neurodevelopmental disorders experience about their child's educational provision. Methods and procedures: Parents of children aged 4\u201318;11 years old, including 99 with WS, 88 with DS, and 82 with ASD completed a survey. Outcomes and results: Children with DS were more likely to access mainstream settings and 1-to-1 support compared to those with WS and ASD. Parental satisfaction was lowest for those with ASD but all parents mentioned concerns about professionals\u2019 knowledge of how to support children with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND). There were also group differences for access to specialist support but overall access to occupational therapy and mental health was low. Conclusions and implications: In contrast to previous studies, educational provision and satisfaction with educational provision are syndrome-specific. These results also highlight the need for training and raising awareness about the specific needs of children with neurodevelopmental disorders. In addition, our findings suggest improved communication between parents and the school is required about the type of support children with SEND are receiving.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Autism spectrum disorders", "Down syndrome", "Educational provision", "Special Educational Needs and Disabilities (SEND) support", "Williams syndrome"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Autism Spectrum Disorder", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Communication", "Down Syndrome", "Education, Special", "Female", "Health Services Accessibility", "Health Services Needs and Demand", "Humans", "Mainstreaming (Education)", "Male", "Occupational Therapy", "Parents", "Personal Satisfaction", "Schools", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "Williams Syndrome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85056482161", "SubjectAreas": [["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"], ["Clinical Psychology", "PSYC", "3203"]], "AuthorData": {"14631196700": {"Name": "Van Herwegen J.", "AuthorID": "14631196700", "AffiliationID": "60033359", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Kingston University London"}, "57201557313": {"Name": "Ashworth M.", "AuthorID": "57201557313", "AffiliationID": "60033359", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Kingston University London"}, "26031680000": {"Name": "Palikara O.", "AuthorID": "26031680000", "AffiliationID": "60026761", "AffiliationName": "School of Education, University of Roehampton"}}}
