Like mammals, the ears of insects, such as those of Drosophila melanogaster, mechanically amplify sound stimuli and have also been reported to express Prestin homologs. To determine whether the D. melanogaster Prestin homolog (dpres) is required for auditory amplification, we generated and analyzed dpres mutant flies. We found that dpres is robustly expressed in the fly\u2019s antennal ear. However, dpres mutant flies show normal auditory nerve responses, and intact non-linear amplification. Thus we conclude that, in D. melanogaster, auditory amplification is independent of Prestin. This finding resonates with prior phylogenetic analyses, which suggest that the derived motor function of mammalian Prestin replaced, or amended, an ancestral transport function. Indeed, we show that dpres encodes a functional anion transporter. Interestingly, the acquired new motor function in the phylogenetic lineage leading to birds and mammals coincides with loss of the mechanotransducer channel NompC (=TRPN1), which has been shown to be required for auditory amplification in flies. The advent of Prestin (or loss of NompC, respectively) may thus mark an evolutionary transition from a transducer-based to a Prestin-based mechanism of auditory amplification.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Auditory amplification", "Drosophila hearing", "Mechanical amplification of sound", "NompC", "Prestin"], "IndexKeywords": ["Acoustic Stimulation", "Animals", "Animals, Genetically Modified", "Anion Transport Proteins", "Anions", "Arthropod Antennae", "CHO Cells", "Cricetulus", "Drosophila melanogaster", "Drosophila Proteins", "Evoked Potentials, Auditory", "Hearing", "Mechanotransduction, Cellular", "Microscopy, Confocal", "Patch-Clamp Techniques", "Polymerase Chain Reaction", "Sensory Receptor Cells", "Transfection", "Vocalization, Animal"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84920492866", "SubjectAreas": [["Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics", "AGRI", "1105"], ["Physiology", "BIOC", "1314"], ["Animal Science and Zoology", "AGRI", "1103"], ["Behavioral Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2802"]], "AuthorData": {"36477199600": {"Name": "Kavlie R.G.", "AuthorID": "36477199600", "AffiliationID": "60011326, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "The Ear Institute, University College London"}, "7201985729": {"Name": "Albert J.T.", "AuthorID": "7201985729", "AffiliationID": "60011326, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "The Ear Institute, University College London"}, "7201989785": {"Name": "Fritz J.L.", "AuthorID": "7201989785", "AffiliationID": "60024324", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biology, University of Iowa"}, "55851635100": {"Name": "Nies F.", "AuthorID": "55851635100", "AffiliationID": "60012556", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Physiology and Pathophysiology, Philipps University"}, "7202761307": {"Name": "Oliver D.", "AuthorID": "7202761307", "AffiliationID": "60012556", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Physiology and Pathophysiology, Philipps University"}, "6701765825": {"Name": "G\u00f6pfert M.C.", "AuthorID": "6701765825", "AffiliationID": "60031514", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cellular Neurobiology, Georg-August-Universit\u00e4t G\u00f6ttingen"}, "7004945066": {"Name": "Eberl D.F.", "AuthorID": "7004945066", "AffiliationID": "60024324", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biology, University of Iowa"}}}
