The aim of this position paper is to define the condition, describe the prevalence, discuss current prophylaxis practices and outcomes, and to provide recommendations for the prevention of VKDB in healthy term newborns and infants. All newborn infants should receive vitamin K prophylaxis and the date, dose, and mode of administration should be documented. Parental refusal of vitamin K prophylaxis after adequate information is provided should be recorded especially because of the risk of late VKDB. Healthy newborn infants should either receive 1 mg of vitamin K 1 by intramuscular injection at birth; or 3\u00d72 mg vitamin K 1 orally at birth, at 4 to 6 days and at 4 to 6 weeks; or 2 mg vitamin K 1 orally at birth, and a weekly dose of 1 mg orally for 3 months. Intramuscular application is the preferred route for efficiency and reliability of administration. The success of an oral policy depends on compliance with the protocol and this may vary between populations and healthcare settings. If the infant vomits or regurgitates the formulation within 1 hour of administration, repeating the oral dose may be appropriate. The oral route is not appropriate for preterm infants and for newborns who have cholestasis or impaired intestinal absorption or are too unwell to take oral vitamin K 1, or those whose mothers have taken medications that interfere with vitamin K metabolism. Parents who receive prenatal education about the importance of vitamin K prophylaxis may be more likely to comply with local procedures.", "AuthorKeywords": ["newborn infant", "Vitamin K", "Vitamin K deficiency bleeding"], "IndexKeywords": ["Dose-Response Relationship, Drug", "Drug Administration Schedule", "Europe", "Female", "Humans", "Infant Nutritional Physiological Phenomena", "Infant, Newborn", "Injections, Intramuscular", "Male", "Practice Guidelines as Topic", "Societies, Medical", "Vitamin K", "Vitamin K Deficiency Bleeding"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84962343512", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Gastroenterology", "MEDI", "2715"]], "AuthorData": {"6701736868": {"Name": "Mihatsch W.A.", "AuthorID": "6701736868", "AffiliationID": "100977587", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatrics Harlaching, Munich Municipal Hospitals"}, "7004464897": {"Name": "Braegger C.", "AuthorID": "7004464897", "AffiliationID": "60002695", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatric Gastroenterology, University Children's Hospital"}, "6603234228": {"Name": "Bronsky J.", "AuthorID": "6603234228", "AffiliationID": "60023469", "AffiliationName": "Department Pediatrics, University Hospital Motol"}, "55881021700": {"Name": "Campoy C.", "AuthorID": "55881021700", "AffiliationID": "60027844", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatrics, University of Granada"}, "6508129151": {"Name": "Domell\u00f6f M.", "AuthorID": "6508129151", "AffiliationID": "60031040", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Sciences, Pediatrics, Umea University"}, "7004016103": {"Name": "Fewtrell M.", "AuthorID": "7004016103", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Childhood Nutrition Research Centre, UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "13611736500": {"Name": "Mis N.F.", "AuthorID": "13611736500", "AffiliationID": "60073906, 60021479", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition, University Children's Hospital, University Medical Centre Ljubljana"}, "7801459343": {"Name": "Hojsak I.", "AuthorID": "7801459343", "AffiliationID": "60006461", "AffiliationName": "University Children's Hospital Zagreb"}, "8564872100": {"Name": "Hulst J.", "AuthorID": "8564872100", "AffiliationID": "60015627, 60032114", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatrics, Erasmus Medical Center, Sophia Children's Hospital"}, "6507823589": {"Name": "Indrio F.", "AuthorID": "6507823589", "AffiliationID": "60031123", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatrics, University Hospital Giovanni XXIII, University Aldo Moro"}, "7005582079": {"Name": "Lapillonne A.", "AuthorID": "7005582079", "AffiliationID": "60002441, 60008135", "AffiliationName": "CNRC, Baylor College of Medicine"}, "7005027256": {"Name": "Molgaard C.", "AuthorID": "7005027256", "AffiliationID": "60015591", "AffiliationName": "Hans Christian Andersen Children's Hospital, Odense University Hospital"}, "6603170617": {"Name": "Embleton N.", "AuthorID": "6603170617", "AffiliationID": "60001239", "AffiliationName": "Newcastle Neonatal Service, Newcastle Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7004219656": {"Name": "Van Goudoever J.", "AuthorID": "7004219656", "AffiliationID": "60070178", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatrics, Emma Children's Hospital-AMC"}}}
