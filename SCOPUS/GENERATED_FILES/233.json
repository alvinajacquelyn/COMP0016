The paper constructs an alternative approach to thinking about the twin challenges of research governance and reflexive research practice through reframing ideas of public value and rejecting a public harm model. We use the insights of coproduction as a way of positively rethinking the relationship between researchers and \u2018the researched\u2019 to create new ways of thinking about public value. We argue that reflexive research practice should draw upon the principles and examples of empowerment within governance. These aspire to work \u2018with\u2019 communities and create space for greater community control in defining and creating publically valuable research.", "AuthorKeywords": ["community", "coproduction", "empowerment", "governance", "marginalisation", "public value", "research ethics"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84940048239", "SubjectAreas": [["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"], ["Environmental Science (miscellaneous)", "ENVI", "2301"], ["Public Administration", "SOCI", "3321"], ["Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law", "ENVI", "2308"]], "AuthorData": {"6507111346": {"Name": "Beebeejaun Y.", "AuthorID": "6507111346", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Bartlett School of Planning, University College London"}, "23060408500": {"Name": "Durose C.", "AuthorID": "23060408500", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Local Government Studies (INLOGOV), University of Birmingham"}, "55432394400": {"Name": "Rees J.", "AuthorID": "55432394400", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "Third Sector Research Centre, University of Birmingham"}, "55463098500": {"Name": "Richardson J.", "AuthorID": "55463098500", "AffiliationID": "60017098", "AffiliationName": "Department of Politics and Public Policy, De Montfort University"}, "35727077400": {"Name": "Richardson L.", "AuthorID": "35727077400", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "Politics, School of Social Sciences, University of Manchester"}}}
