One of the first questions patients with inflammatory bowel disease ask is if diet has anything to do with the cause or the treatment of the disease. There is increasing evidence that nutrition does have a major role to play; whether it has primary or an adjunctive role is not clear. Malnutrition is common in patients with inflammatory bowel disease in patients of all ages. It is much more marked in patients with Crohn\u2019s disease. Recent surveys show that up to 80% of patients with Crohn\u2019s disease have weight loss, and in children growth retardation may be the presenting complaint. Many patients have hypoalbuminemia, which some experts consider the most reliable index of disease activity. Malnutrition is not a major feature in patients who have ulcerative colitis, and only 30% of patients have weight loss.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85054290411", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"36236879300": {"Name": "O\u2019Morain C.", "AuthorID": "36236879300", "AffiliationID": "60011149", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gastroenterology, Trinity College, Meath/ Adelaide Hospitals"}}}
