Here we consider a task between two players, Alice and Bob where quantum resources are infinitely more powerful than their classical counterpart. Alice is given a string of length n, and Bob's task is to exclude certain combinations of bits that Alice might have. If Alice must send classical messages, then she must reveal nearly n bits of information to Bob, but if she is allowed to send quantum bits, the amount of information she must reveal goes to zero with increasing n. Next, we consider a version of the task where the parties may have access to entanglement. With this assistance, Alice only needs to send a constant number of bits, while without entanglement, the number of bits Alice must send grows linearly with n. The task is related to the Pusey-Barrett-Rudolph theorem which arises in the context of the foundations of quantum theory.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Amount of information", "Classical counterpart", "Classical messages", "Communication task", "Quantum bits", "Quantum messages", "Quantum resources", "Quantum-classical"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84937830663", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"56102945500": {"Name": "Perry C.", "AuthorID": "56102945500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "7102137778": {"Name": "Oppenheim J.", "AuthorID": "7102137778", "AffiliationID": "60095887, 60017161", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, Centre for Quantum Technologies, National University of Singapore"}, "22034907700": {"Name": "Jain R.", "AuthorID": "22034907700", "AffiliationID": "60095887, 60017161", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, Centre for Quantum Technologies, National University of Singapore"}}}
