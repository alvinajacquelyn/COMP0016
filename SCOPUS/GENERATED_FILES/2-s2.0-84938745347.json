It reflects on the place of informed consent in the history of bioethics in North America in contrast to the development of bioethics in Brazil and the particular social cultural context in which consent is sought in Brazilian public health care. Making use of empirical research with families and individuals receiving genetic counselling related to increased genetic risk for cancer, in genetic clinics in southern Brazil, it examines how informed consent is linked to the necessary movement between personal and relational privacy. The paper illustrates the value of a particular tool known as a \u2018sociogram\u2019 to examine the complex interpersonal dynamics that arise in negotiating informed consent at the interface between the family and the individual in Brazil. The paper, therefore, points to the scope of further interdisciplinary exchanges between anthropology and bioethics, confronting the new challenges that arise in the context of medical genetics in developing country.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bioethics", "Cancer", "Genetic counselling", "Informed consent", "Privacy"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84938745347", "SubjectAreas": [["Epidemiology", "MEDI", "2713"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"], ["Genetics (clinical)", "MEDI", "2716"]], "AuthorData": {"6603044090": {"Name": "Goldim J.", "AuthorID": "6603044090", "AffiliationID": "60015760, 60006726", "AffiliationName": "Medical School Pontif\u00edcia Universidade Cat\u00f3lica do Rio Grande do Sul, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul"}, "14031617000": {"Name": "Gibbon S.", "AuthorID": "14031617000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Anthropology Department, University College London"}}}
