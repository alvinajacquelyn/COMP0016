Objective: The work presented in this study details the development of an in silico model that combines all the salient, clinically relevant features of cerebral aneurysm clotting. A comprehensive computational model of clotting that accounts for biochemical complexity coupled with three-dimensional hemodynamics in image-derived patient aneurysms and in the presence of virtually implanted interventional devices is presented. Methods: The model is developed and presented in two stages. First, a two-dimensional computational model of clotting is presented for an idealized geometry. This enables verification of the methods with existing, physiological data before the pathological state is considered. This model is used to compare the results predicted by two different underlying biochemical cascades. The two-dimensional model is then extended to image-derived, three-dimensional aneurysmal topologies by incorporating level set methods, demonstrating the potential use of this model. Results and conclusion: As a proof of concept, comparisons are then made between treated and untreated aneurysms. The prediction of different clotting outcomes for different patients demonstrates that with further development, refinement and validation, this methodology could be used for patient-specific interventional planning.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Blood coagulation", "Blood vessel prosthesis", "Computer simulation", "Intracranial aneurysm", "Patient-specific modeling"], "IndexKeywords": ["Blood Coagulation", "Cerebrovascular Circulation", "Computer Simulation", "Decision Support Techniques", "Hemodynamics", "Humans", "Intracranial Aneurysm", "Intracranial Thrombosis", "Kinetics", "Models, Cardiovascular", "Numerical Analysis, Computer-Assisted", "Predictive Value of Tests", "Prognosis", "Risk Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84958167593", "SubjectAreas": [["Hematology", "MEDI", "2720"]], "AuthorData": {"49461706300": {"Name": "Ngoepe M.", "AuthorID": "49461706300", "AffiliationID": "60013272, 60094843", "AffiliationName": "Centre for High Performance Computing, CSIR"}, "6603704133": {"Name": "Ventikos Y.", "AuthorID": "6603704133", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}}}
