The total subsidy\u2014determined by sales to participating buyers\u2014is divided among workers based on their relative output: a worker who produces more gets a larger share of the bonus. Although seemingly mimicking the existing piece-rate pay scheme, the mechanism associated with the bonus payment is really a relative performance evaluation, as the size of total bonus is exogenous and invariant to workers\u2019 effort. Therefore, for a given sized subsidy, the combined total (or per worker average) utility gains would become the largest if the workers keep their efforts at the pre-program level. Empirical analysis shows that worker effort (and hence productivity) increases substantially in response to the program, suggesting that currently, workers\u2019 combined gains per dollar of subsidy are not being maximized.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Fairness", "Natural experiment", "Piece rate", "Subsidy", "Tragedy of the commons"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85063032591", "SubjectAreas": [["Development", "SOCI", "3303"], ["Economics and Econometrics", "ECON", "2002"]], "AuthorData": {"55425266900": {"Name": "Ku H.", "AuthorID": "55425266900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Economics, University College London"}}}
