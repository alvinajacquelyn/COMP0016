To present guidelines on rapid efficacy readouts for disease-modifying trials. Methods: 40 controls and 61 patients with HD, recruited from four EU sites, underwent 3 T MRI and standard clinical and cognitive assessments at baseline, 6 and 15 months. Neuroimaging analysis included global and regional change in macrostructure (atrophy and cortical thinning), and microstructure (diffusion metrics). The main outcome was longitudinal effect size (ES) for each outcome. Such ESs can be used to calculate sample-size requirements for clinical trials for hypothesised treatment efficacies. Results: Longitudinal changes in macrostructural neuroimaging measures such as caudate atrophy and ventricular expansion were significantly larger in HD than controls, giving rise to consistently large ES over the 6-month, 9-month and 15-month intervals. Analogous ESs for cortical metrics were smaller with wide CIs. Microstructural (diffusion) neuroimaging metrics ESs were also typically smaller over the shorter intervals, although caudate diffusivity metrics performed strongly over 9 and 15 months. Clinical and cognitive outcomes exhibited small longitudinal ESs, particularly over 6-month and 9-month intervals, with wide CIs, indicating a lack of precision. Conclusions: To exploit the potential power of specific neuroimaging measures such as caudate atrophy in disease-modifying trials, we propose their use as (1) initial short-term readouts in early phase/proof-ofconcept studies over 6 or 9 months, and (2) secondary end points in efficacy studies over longer periods such as 15 months.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Case-Control Studies", "Cerebral Cortex", "Cognition", "Disease Progression", "Female", "Humans", "Huntington Disease", "Image Processing, Computer-Assisted", "Longitudinal Studies", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Neuropsychological Tests", "Research Design"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84956592214", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"24067123600": {"Name": "Hobbs N.Z.", "AuthorID": "24067123600", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, UCL Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "55587191000": {"Name": "Rees E.M.", "AuthorID": "55587191000", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, UCL Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "7403376270": {"Name": "Cole J.H.", "AuthorID": "7403376270", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, UCL Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "55378518700": {"Name": "Haider S.", "AuthorID": "55378518700", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, UCL Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "6602959028": {"Name": "Scahill R.I.", "AuthorID": "6602959028", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, UCL Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "7006745684": {"Name": "Tabrizi S.J.", "AuthorID": "7006745684", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, UCL Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "8523363200": {"Name": "Farmer R.E.", "AuthorID": "8523363200", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Statistics, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "7101816884": {"Name": "Frost C.", "AuthorID": "7101816884", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Statistics, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "16637997400": {"Name": "Malone I.B.", "AuthorID": "16637997400", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dementia Research Centre, UCL Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "6603538561": {"Name": "Sprengelmeyer R.", "AuthorID": "6603538561", "AffiliationID": "60010586", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Ulm University"}, "23393265200": {"Name": "Mueller H.P.", "AuthorID": "23393265200", "AffiliationID": "60010586", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Ulm University"}, "8632849400": {"Name": "Sussmuth S.D.", "AuthorID": "8632849400", "AffiliationID": "60010586", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Ulm University"}, "23004886100": {"Name": "Landwehrmeyer B.", "AuthorID": "23004886100", "AffiliationID": "60010586", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Ulm University"}, "57158367900": {"Name": "Johnson H.", "AuthorID": "57158367900", "AffiliationID": "60024324", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, University of Iowa"}, "7203053136": {"Name": "Roos R.A.C.", "AuthorID": "7203053136", "AffiliationID": "60015618", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Leiden University Medical Centre"}, "24741153500": {"Name": "Durr A.", "AuthorID": "24741153500", "AffiliationID": "60015622, 60120341, 60000905, 60021567", "AffiliationName": "APHP, Department of Genetics, INSERM UMR S679, ICM (Brain and Spine Institute), Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re University Hospital"}}}
