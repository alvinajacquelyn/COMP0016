Methods: Dynamic 18F-flutemetamol PET scans were acquired using a coffee-break protocol (a 0- to 30-min scan and a 90- to 110-min scan) on 190 cognitively normal elderly individuals (mean age, 70.4 y; 60% female). Parametric images were generated from SUV ratio (SUVr) and nondisplaceable binding potential (BPND) methods, with cerebellar gray matter as a reference region, and were visually assessed by 3 trained readers. Interreader agreement was calculated using \u03ba-statistics, and semiquantitative values were obtained. Global cutoffs were calculated for both SUVr and BPND using a receiver-operating-characteristic analysis and the Youden index. Visual assessment was related to semiquantitative classifications. Results: Interreader agreement in visual assessment was moderate for SUVr (\u03ba 5 0.57) and good for BPND images (\u03ba 5 0.77). There was discordance between readers for 35 cases (18%) using SUVr and for 15 cases (8%) using BPND, with 9 overlapping cases. For the total cohort, the mean (\u00b1SD) SUVr and BPND were 1.33 (\u00b10.21) and 0.16 (\u00b10.12), respectively. Most of the 35 cases (91%) for which SUVr image assessment was discordant between readers were classified as negative based on semiquantitative measurements. Conclusion: The use of parametric BPND images for visual assessment of 18F-flutemetamol in a population with low amyloid burden improves interreader agreement. Implementing semiquantification in addition to visual assessment of SUVr images can reduce false-positive classification in this population.", "AuthorKeywords": ["18F-flutemetamol PET", "Amyloid pathology", "Preclinical Alzheimer disease", "Visual assessment"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Alzheimer Disease", "Aniline Compounds", "Benzothiazoles", "Cognition", "Female", "Humans", "Image Processing, Computer-Assisted", "Male", "Positron-Emission Tomography"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85064189230", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"57189223511": {"Name": "Konijnenberg E.", "AuthorID": "57189223511", "AffiliationID": "60013779, 60001997", "AffiliationName": "Alzheimer Center, Department of Neurology, VU Medical Center"}, "57208248196": {"Name": "Kate M.t.", "AuthorID": "57208248196", "AffiliationID": "60013779, 60001997", "AffiliationName": "Alzheimer Center, Department of Neurology, VU Medical Center"}, "23969951700": {"Name": "den Braber A.", "AuthorID": "23969951700", "AffiliationID": "60008734", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biological Psychology"}, "55274168400": {"Name": "Zwan M.", "AuthorID": "55274168400", "AffiliationID": "60013779, 60001997", "AffiliationName": "Alzheimer Center, Department of Neurology, VU Medical Center"}, "57204745168": {"Name": "Scheltens P.", "AuthorID": "57204745168", "AffiliationID": "60013779, 60001997", "AffiliationName": "Alzheimer Center, Department of Neurology, VU Medical Center"}, "57204822298": {"Name": "Visser P.J.", "AuthorID": "57204822298", "AffiliationID": "60013779, 60001997", "AffiliationName": "Alzheimer Center, Department of Neurology, VU Medical Center"}, "57208244090": {"Name": "Reimand J.", "AuthorID": "57208244090", "AffiliationID": "60001997", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology and Nuclear Medicine, VU Medical Center"}, "54960892900": {"Name": "van Assema D.M.E.", "AuthorID": "54960892900", "AffiliationID": "60032114", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology and Nuclear Medicine, Erasmus Medical Center"}, "7102989379": {"Name": "Barkhof F.", "AuthorID": "7102989379", "AffiliationID": "60001997", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology and Nuclear Medicine, VU Medical Center"}, "57192180298": {"Name": "Collij L.E.", "AuthorID": "57192180298", "AffiliationID": "60001997", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology and Nuclear Medicine, VU Medical Center"}, "57208237784": {"Name": "Alves I.L.", "AuthorID": "57208237784", "AffiliationID": "60001997", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology and Nuclear Medicine, VU Medical Center"}, "23010938700": {"Name": "Yaqub M.", "AuthorID": "23010938700", "AffiliationID": "60001997", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology and Nuclear Medicine, VU Medical Center"}, "6601993367": {"Name": "Wink A.M.", "AuthorID": "6601993367", "AffiliationID": "60001997", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology and Nuclear Medicine, VU Medical Center"}, "57204744632": {"Name": "Lammertsma A.A.", "AuthorID": "57204744632", "AffiliationID": "60001997", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology and Nuclear Medicine, VU Medical Center"}, "57208893449": {"Name": "van Berckel B.N.M.", "AuthorID": "57208893449", "AffiliationID": "60001997", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology and Nuclear Medicine, VU Medical Center"}}}
