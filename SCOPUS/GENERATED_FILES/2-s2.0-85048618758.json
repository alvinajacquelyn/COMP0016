This observation stood the test of time until 2012 when it was demonstrated that NDUFA4, a polypeptide previously attributed to mitochondrial Complex I, was a 14th subunit of COX. In his recent opinion article, Kadenbach argued that NDUFA4 is not a subunit of COX. However, based on the findings that NDUFA4 deficiency results in a severe loss of COX activity and that NDUFA4 represents a stoichiometric component of the individual COX complex, we reason that NDUFA4 is a bona fide COX subunit and propose renaming it as COX subunit FA4 (COXFA4).", "AuthorKeywords": ["COXFA4", "cytochrome-c oxidase", "detergent", "electron transport chain", "mitochondria", "NDUFA4"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Electron Transport Complex IV", "Mammals", "Mitochondria", "Oxidoreductases"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85048618758", "SubjectAreas": [["Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism", "MEDI", "2712"], ["Endocrinology", "BIOC", "1310"]], "AuthorData": {"24475469100": {"Name": "Pitceathly R.D.S.", "AuthorID": "24475469100", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60019953, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Neuromuscular Diseases, UCL Institute of Neurology and National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "7004248673": {"Name": "Taanman J.W.", "AuthorID": "7004248673", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Neurosciences, UCL Institute of Neurology"}}}
