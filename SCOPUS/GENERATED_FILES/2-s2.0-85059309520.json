A series of experiments are undertaken on [\u00b1\u03b8/90] FW filament-wound-type composite cylindrical-shell models subjected to collapse pressure loads. A total of 20 composite cylindrical-shell models are tested to derive the empirical formula, which is validated by comparison with experimental data, existing design formulas of ASME 2007 and NASA SP-8700, and solutions of the nonlinear finite element method. It is concluded that the proposed formula accurately predicts the collapse pressure loads of filament-wound composite cylinders and will thus aid the safety design of composite cylindrical shell-structures under external pressure loads.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Collapse strength", "Composites", "Cylindrical-shell structure", "External hydrostatic pressure load", "Filament-wound cylinder"], "IndexKeywords": ["Collapse strength", "Composite cylindrical shell", "Cylindrical shell", "External hydrostatic pressures", "Filament wound", "Geometric dimensions", "Manufacturing imperfections", "Nonlinear finite element method"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85059309520", "SubjectAreas": [["Environmental Engineering", "ENVI", "2305"], ["Ocean Engineering", "ENGI", "2212"]], "AuthorData": {"56311537000": {"Name": "Cho Y.", "AuthorID": "56311537000", "AffiliationID": "60008783", "AffiliationName": "Department of Naval Architecture and Ocean Engineering, Pusan National University"}, "35821146600": {"Name": "Paik J.", "AuthorID": "35821146600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "57205259292": {"Name": "Oh D.", "AuthorID": "57205259292", "AffiliationID": "60024724", "AffiliationName": "Department of Naval Architecture, Ocean & Marine Engineering, University of Strathclyde"}}}
