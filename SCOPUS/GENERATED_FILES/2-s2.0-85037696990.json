Small angle neutron scattering (SANS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were employed to characterize the precipitates and their size distributions in Fe-0.047C-0.2V-1.6Mn (in wt.%) alloy samples which had been austenitized, isothermally transformed at 700 \u00b0C for between 3 and 600 min and water quenched. TEM confirms that, following heat treatment, rows of vanadium-containing nanoscale interphase precipitates were present. Model-independent analysis of the nuclear SANS signal and model fitting calculations, using oblate spheroid and disc-shapes, were performed. The major axis diameter increased from 18 nm after 3 min to 35 nm after 600 min. Precipitate volume percent increased from 0.09 to 0.22 vol% over the same period and number density fell from 2 \u00d7 1021 to 5 \u00d7 1020 m\u22123. A limited number of measurements of precipitate maximum diameters from TEM images showed the mean value increased from 8 nm after 5 min to 28 nm after 600 min which is in reasonable agreement with the SANS data.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Microalloyed steel", "Precipitation", "Small angle scattering", "Transmission electron microscopy"], "IndexKeywords": ["High strength low alloy steel (HSLA)", "Interphase precipitation", "Measurements of", "Micro-alloyed steels", "Model independent", "Nano precipitations", "Oblate spheroid", "Small angle scattering"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85037696990", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Ceramics and Composites", "MATE", "2503"], ["Polymers and Plastics", "MATE", "2507"], ["Metals and Alloys", "MATE", "2506"]], "AuthorData": {"57209347972": {"Name": "Wang Y.Q.", "AuthorID": "57209347972", "AffiliationID": "60023254", "AffiliationName": "Research Complex at Harwell, Rutherford Appleton Laboratory"}, "34882417100": {"Name": "Yan K.", "AuthorID": "34882417100", "AffiliationID": "60023254", "AffiliationName": "Research Complex at Harwell, Rutherford Appleton Laboratory"}, "8504683300": {"Name": "Lee P.D.", "AuthorID": "8504683300", "AffiliationID": "60023254", "AffiliationName": "Research Complex at Harwell, Rutherford Appleton Laboratory"}, "57188878779": {"Name": "Clark S.J.", "AuthorID": "57188878779", "AffiliationID": "60022020", "AffiliationName": "WMG, University of Warwick"}, "7102079888": {"Name": "McCartney D.G.", "AuthorID": "7102079888", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "Advanced Materials Group, University of Nottingham"}, "24344055600": {"Name": "Janik V.", "AuthorID": "24344055600", "AffiliationID": "60017326", "AffiliationName": "Faculty Research Centre for Manufacturing and Materials Engineering, Coventry University"}, "7102170153": {"Name": "Sridhar S.", "AuthorID": "7102170153", "AffiliationID": "60014965", "AffiliationName": "George S.
