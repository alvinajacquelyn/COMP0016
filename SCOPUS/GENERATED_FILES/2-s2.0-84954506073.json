The complexity of the proposed model is such that an extensive experimentation is required for a statistically sound estimation of the relevant model parameters, including solute (tB) and water (tW) transport numbers through the ion-selective membranes; solute (LB) and water (LW) transport rate by diffusion; average electro-membrane resistance (R). A model-based design of experiments (MBDoE) approach is proposed in this paper to minimise the number of trials and resources required for model identification. The use of this approach in an experimental case study allowed for a dramatic reduction of the experimentation time from 1080min (corresponding to a classical experimentation with multiple batch desalination trials) to 30-60min corresponding to a single optimal batch desalination experiment. The results obtained show the potential of MBDoE for quick development and assessment of electrodialysis models, where highly predictive capability can be achieved with the minimum experimental time and waste of resources.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Electric resistance", "Electrodialysis modelling", "Optimal model-based experimental design", "Osmotic and diffusion contribution", "Water and solute transport number"], "IndexKeywords": ["Concentrated brines", "Diffusion contributions", "Electro-membrane resistance", "Model identification", "Model-based design of experiments", "NaCl concentration", "Optimal model", "Predictive capabilities"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84954506073", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"]], "AuthorData": {"25029440500": {"Name": "Galvanin F.", "AuthorID": "25029440500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "57062287600": {"Name": "Marchesini R.", "AuthorID": "57062287600", "AffiliationID": "60000481", "AffiliationName": "CAPE-Lab-Computer-Aided Process Engineering Laboratory, Department of Industrial Engineering, University of Padova"}, "7004172198": {"Name": "Barolo M.", "AuthorID": "7004172198", "AffiliationID": "60000481", "AffiliationName": "CAPE-Lab-Computer-Aided Process Engineering Laboratory, Department of Industrial Engineering, University of Padova"}, "6602450288": {"Name": "Bezzo F.", "AuthorID": "6602450288", "AffiliationID": "60000481", "AffiliationName": "CAPE-Lab-Computer-Aided Process Engineering Laboratory, Department of Industrial Engineering, University of Padova"}, "6506815767": {"Name": "Fidaleo M.", "AuthorID": "6506815767", "AffiliationID": "60050715", "AffiliationName": "Department for Innovation in Biological, Agro-Food and Forest Systems, University of Tuscia"}}}
