For all these tasks, we need to determine the optimal point-to-point rates that are achievable by two remote parties at the ends of a quantum channel, without restrictions on their local operations and classical communication, which can be unlimited and two-way. These two-way assisted capacities represent the ultimate rates that are reachable without quantum repeaters. Here, by constructing an upper bound based on the relative entropy of entanglement and devising a dimension-independent technique dubbed 'teleportation stretching', we establish these capacities for many fundamental channels, namely bosonic lossy channels, quantum-limited amplifiers, dephasing and erasure channels in arbitrary dimension. In particular, we exactly determine the fundamental rate-loss tradeoff affecting any protocol of quantum key distribution. Our findings set the limits of point-to-point quantum communications and provide precise and general benchmarks for quantum repeaters.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85018315051", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"57202956317": {"Name": "Pirandola S.", "AuthorID": "57202956317", "AffiliationID": "60016418", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, York Centre for Quantum Technologies, University of York"}, "57193141059": {"Name": "Laurenza R.", "AuthorID": "57193141059", "AffiliationID": "60016418", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, York Centre for Quantum Technologies, University of York"}, "7003921978": {"Name": "Ottaviani C.", "AuthorID": "7003921978", "AffiliationID": "60016418", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, York Centre for Quantum Technologies, University of York"}, "8910867800": {"Name": "Banchi L.", "AuthorID": "8910867800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}}}
