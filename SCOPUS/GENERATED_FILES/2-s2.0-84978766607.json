Important risk factors in this are smoking, alcohol misuse, excessive weight gain and diabetes. Weight gain also reinforces service users' negative views of themselves and is a factor in poor adherence with treatment. Monitoring of relevant physical health risk factors is frequently inadequate, as is provision of interventions to modify these. These guidelines review issues surrounding monitoring of physical health risk factors and make recommendations about an appropriate approach. Overweight and obesity, partly driven by antipsychotic drug treatment, are important factors contributing to the development of diabetes and cardiovascular disease in people with schizophrenia. There have been clinical trials of many interventions for people experiencing weight gain when taking antipsychotic medications but there is a lack of clear consensus regarding which may be appropriate in usual clinical practice. These guidelines review these trials and make recommendations regarding appropriate interventions. Interventions for smoking and alcohol misuse are reviewed, but more briefly as these are similar to those recommended for the general population. The management of impaired fasting glycaemia and impaired glucose tolerance ('pre-diabetes'), diabetes and other cardiovascular risks, such as dyslipidaemia, are also reviewed with respect to other currently available guidelines. These guidelines were compiled following a consensus meeting of experts involved in various aspects of these problems. They reviewed key areas of evidence and their clinical implications. Wider issues relating to primary care/secondary care interfaces are discussed but cannot be resolved within guidelines such as these.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alcohol misuse", "antipsychotic", "aripiprazole", "cardiovascular disease", "diabetes", "dyslipidaemia", "guidelines", "interventions for weight gain", "lifestyle", "metformin", "obesity", "overweight", "psychosis", "risk assessment", "schizophrenia", "smoking cessation", "switching"], "IndexKeywords": ["Antipsychotic Agents", "Cardiovascular Diseases", "Humans", "Metabolic Diseases", "Obesity", "Overweight", "Psychotic Disorders", "Risk Factors", "Schizophrenia", "Weight Gain"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84978766607", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"35309696900": {"Name": "Cooper S.J.", "AuthorID": "35309696900", "AffiliationID": "60026447", "AffiliationName": "College Centre for Quality Improvement, Royal College of Psychiatrists"}, "7201487920": {"Name": "Reynolds G.P.", "AuthorID": "7201487920", "AffiliationID": "60032204", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Sheffield Hallam University"}, "15071858800": {"Name": "Shiers D.", "AuthorID": "15071858800", "AffiliationID": "60026447", "AffiliationName": "College Centre for Quality Improvement, Royal College of Psychiatrists"}, "14524043100": {"Name": "Barnes T.R.E.", "AuthorID": "14524043100", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, Centre for Mental Health, Imperial College London"}, "57205609670": {"Name": "England E.", "AuthorID": "57205609670", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Laurie Pike Health Centre"}, "7102888761": {"Name": "Haddad P.M.", "AuthorID": "7102888761", "AffiliationID": "60122796", "AffiliationName": "Greater Manchester West Mental Health NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57202958705": {"Name": "Heald A.", "AuthorID": "57202958705", "AffiliationID": "113930918", "AffiliationName": "Leighton and Macclesfield Hospitals"}, "8736780500": {"Name": "Holt R.I.G.", "AuthorID": "8736780500", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "Department of Diabetes and Endocrinology, Human Development and Health Academic Unit, University of Southampton"}, "57204025688": {"Name": "Lingford-Hughes A.", "AuthorID": "57204025688", "AffiliationID": "60162114", "AffiliationName": "CNWL NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7101639320": {"Name": "Osborn D.", "AuthorID": "7101639320", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatric Epidemiology, Division of Psychiatry, UCL"}, "56106114000": {"Name": "McGowan O.", "AuthorID": "56106114000", "AffiliationID": "60000228", "AffiliationName": "Hairmyres Hospital"}, "7403721548": {"Name": "Patel M.X.", "AuthorID": "7403721548", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "King's College London, IOPPN, Department of Psychosis Studies PO68"}, "35566745100": {"Name": "Paton C.", "AuthorID": "35566745100", "AffiliationID": "60026447", "AffiliationName": "Prescribing Observatory for Mental Health, CCQI, Royal College of Psychiatrists"}, "57200770734": {"Name": "Reid P.", "AuthorID": "57200770734", "AffiliationID": "60120881", "AffiliationName": "Rethink Mental Illness"}, "15063571500": {"Name": "Smith J.", "AuthorID": "15063571500", "AffiliationID": "60000972", "AffiliationName": "Department of Early Intervention and Psychosis, University of Worcester"}}}
