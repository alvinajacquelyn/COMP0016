However, trials in Catalonia have been unsuccessful. This study was aimed at researching professionals\u2019 perceptions regarding the usefulness of digital brief interventions in overcoming traditional barriers of face-to-face Screening, Brief Intervention and Referral to Treatment and new barriers posed by the use of digital brief interventions. Professionals who participated in the Effectiveness of primary care based Facilitated Access to alcohol Reduction website (EFAR)digital brief intervention clinical trial were surveyed on April 2017 on the following areas: (1) satisfaction, (2) usefulness, (3) perceived ability of digital interventions on overcoming traditional barriers and (4) perceived new barriers of digital interventions. Sixty-eight professionals completed the survey. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed using the level of professional engagement with the project as the dependent variable, barriers as independent variables and socio-demographic characteristics as covariables. Of all professionals, 79.4 percent were satisfied with their participation in the project, but only 26.5 percent perceived the website as useful. Low engagement was associated with the perceived lack of feedback (0.22; 95% confidence interval: 0.05 -0.88), perception that it was difficult to use among the elderly(0.22; 95 confidence interval: 0.05 -0.091) and among low socioeconomic population (0.14; 95% confidence interval: 0.03 -0.64). The majority of the participants indicated that digital brief intervention for risky drinkers succeeded in overcoming most of the traditional barriers. However, new barriers emerged as difficulties for implementing digital brief interventions in the Catalan Primary Health Care System. Usefulness perception is a key factor, which must be addressed in any proposed intervention in primary care.", "AuthorKeywords": ["alcohol", "brief interventions", "e-health", "implementation", "risky drinkers"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85068082104", "SubjectAreas": [["Health Informatics", "MEDI", "2718"]], "AuthorData": {"57209535947": {"Name": "Caballeria E.", "AuthorID": "57209535947", "AffiliationID": "114682272", "AffiliationName": "Institut d\u2019Investigacions Biom\u00e8diques August Pi i Sunyer"}, "7004414444": {"Name": "Colom J.", "AuthorID": "7004414444", "AffiliationID": "122759893", "AffiliationName": "Publich Health Agency of Catalonia"}, "7201787424": {"Name": "Wallace P.", "AuthorID": "7201787424", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "7005911727": {"Name": "Gual A.", "AuthorID": "7005911727", "AffiliationID": "60001576", "AffiliationName": "University of Barcelona"}, "55817244600": {"Name": "L\u00f3pez-Pelayo H.", "AuthorID": "55817244600", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "36774369400": {"Name": "D\u00edaz E.", "AuthorID": "36774369400", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "57209541902": {"Name": "S\u00e1nchez A.", "AuthorID": "57209541902", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "6701789489": {"Name": "Segura L.", "AuthorID": "6701789489", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
