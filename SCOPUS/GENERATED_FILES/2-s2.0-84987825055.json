CD spectroscopy has special relevance for the study of membrane proteins, which are difficult to crystallise and largely ignored in structural genomics projects. However, the requirement for membrane proteins to be embedded in amphipathic environments such as membranes, lipid vesicles, detergent micelles, bicelles, oriented bilayers, or nanodiscs, in order for them to be soluble or dispersed in solution whilst maintaining their structure and function, necessitates the use of different experimental and analytical approaches than those employed for soluble proteins. This review discusses specialised methods for collecting and analysing membrane protein CD data, highlighting where protocols for soluble and membrane proteins diverge.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Circular Dichroism", "Lipids", "Membrane Proteins", "Protein Stability", "Protein Unfolding", "Solubility", "Solvents", "Synchrotrons"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84987825055", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"]], "AuthorData": {"24605487500": {"Name": "Miles A.J.", "AuthorID": "24605487500", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, Birkbeck College, University of London"}, "7202576274": {"Name": "Wallace B.A.", "AuthorID": "7202576274", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, Birkbeck College, University of London"}}}
