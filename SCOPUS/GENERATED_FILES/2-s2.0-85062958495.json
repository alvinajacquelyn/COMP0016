Five-year survival rates exceed 80% for the 45,000 children with cancer in high-income countries (HICs) but are less than 30% for the 384,000 children in lower-middle-income countries (LMICs). Improved survival rates in HICs have been achieved through multidisciplinary care and research, with treatment regimens using mostly generic medicines and optimized risk stratification. Children\u2019s outcomes in LMICs can be improved through global collaborative partnerships that help local leaders adapt effective treatments to local resources and clinical needs, as well as address common problems such as delayed diagnosis and treatment abandonment. Together, these approaches may bring within reach the global survival target recently set by the World Health Organization: 60% survival for all children with cancer by 2030.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Delayed Diagnosis", "Developed Countries", "Developing Countries", "Drug Development", "Global Health", "Health Resources", "Health Services Accessibility", "Humans", "Incidence", "Infant", "Infant, Newborn", "Neoplasms", "World Health Organization", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85062958495", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"7402990811": {"Name": "Lam C.G.", "AuthorID": "7402990811", "AffiliationID": "60002194", "AffiliationName": "University of Tennessee Health Sciences Center"}, "7202813210": {"Name": "Howard S.C.", "AuthorID": "7202813210", "AffiliationID": "122264044", "AffiliationName": "Board, International Society of Paediatric Oncology (SIOP)"}, "57203082668": {"Name": "Bouffet E.", "AuthorID": "57203082668", "AffiliationID": "60030319, 60016849", "AffiliationName": "Division of Haematology/ Oncology, Hospital for Sick Children, University of Toronto"}, "7005535741": {"Name": "Pritchard-Jones K.", "AuthorID": "7005535741", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, University College London"}}}
