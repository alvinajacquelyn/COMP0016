In this paper, we investigate the physical relations among those phenomena with measurements during a substorm event on January 29, 2008. We present conjugate measurements from ground-based high-temporal resolution all-sky imagers and in situ THEMIS measurements. An auroral streamer (north\u2013south aligned thin auroral layer) was formed and propagated equatorward, which usually implies an earthward propagating plasma flow in the magnetotail. At the most equatorward part of the auroral streamer, a wave-like auroral band was formed aligning in the east\u2013west direction. The wave-like auroral structure is usually explained as a consequence of instability development. Using AM03 model, we trace the auroral structure to magnetotail and estimate a wavelength of ~0.5 RE. The scale is comparable to the drift mode wavelength determined by the in situ measurements from THEMIS-A, whose footpoint is on the wave-like auroral arc. We also present similar wave-like aurora observations from Cassini ultraviolet imaging spectrograph at Saturn and from Hubble space telescope at Jupiter, suggesting that the wave-like aurora structure is likely a result of fundamental plasma dynamics in the solar system planetary magnetospheres.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85017500403", "SubjectAreas": [["Earth and Planetary Sciences (all)", "EART", "1900"]], "AuthorData": {"57197843335": {"Name": "Yao Z.", "AuthorID": "57197843335", "AffiliationID": "60084281", "AffiliationName": "UCL Mullard Space Science Laboratory"}, "14048953800": {"Name": "Radioti A.", "AuthorID": "14048953800", "AffiliationID": "60000964", "AffiliationName": "Laboratoire de Physique Atmosph\u00e9rique et Plan\u00e9taire, STAR institute, Universit\u00e9 de Li\u00e8ge"}, "7006788329": {"Name": "Pu Z.Y.", "AuthorID": "7006788329", "AffiliationID": "60014966", "AffiliationName": "School of Earth and Space Sciences, Peking University"}, "7003431703": {"Name": "Rae I.J.", "AuthorID": "7003431703", "AffiliationID": "60084281", "AffiliationName": "UCL Mullard Space Science Laboratory"}, "8883130600": {"Name": "Kubyshkina M.V.", "AuthorID": "8883130600", "AffiliationID": "60031888", "AffiliationName": "Physics Faculty, St. Petersburg State University"}}}
