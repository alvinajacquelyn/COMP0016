Stress-related alterations in endoplasmic reticulum (ER), such as the unfolded protein response (UPR), are associated with obesity. The aim of this study was to investigate ER imbalance in the pancreas of a mice model of adult and perinatal diet-induced obesity. Twenty female C57BL/6J mice were assigned to control (Con) or obesogenic (Ob) diets prior to and during pregnancy and lactation. Their offspring were weaned onto Con or Ob diets up to 6 months post-partum. Then, after sacrifice, plasma biochemical analyses, gene expression, and protein concentrations were measured in pancreata. Offspring of Ob-fed mice had significantly increased body weight (p < 0.001) and plasma leptin (p < 0.001) and decreased insulin (p < 0.01) levels. Maternal obesogenic diet decreased the total and phosphorylated Eif2\u03b1 and increased spliced X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1). Pancreatic gene expression of downstream regulators of UPR (EDEM, homocysteine-responsive endoplasmic reticulum-resident (HERP), activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4), and C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP)) and autophagy-related proteins (LC3BI/LC3BII) were differently disrupted by obesogenic feeding in both mothers and offspring (from p < 0.1 to p < 0.001). Maternal obesity and Ob feeding in their offspring alter UPR in NAFPD, with involvement of proapoptotic and autophagy-related markers. Upstream and downstream regulators of PERK, IRE1\u03b1, and ATF6 pathways were affected differently following the obesogenic insults.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Autophagy", "ER stress", "Fatty pancreas", "Obesity", "Perinatal programming", "UPR"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Autophagy", "Biomarkers", "Diet, High-Fat", "Dietary Sucrose", "Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress", "Female", "Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental", "Insulin", "Lactation", "Leptin", "Maternal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Obesity", "Pancreas", "Pancreatitis", "Pregnancy", "Pregnancy Complications", "Unfolded Protein Response", "Weaning"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84961141619", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Physiology", "BIOC", "1314"]], "AuthorData": {"6701667926": {"Name": "Soeda J.", "AuthorID": "6701667926", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Liver and Digestive Health, University College London"}, "35746945900": {"Name": "Mouralidarane A.", "AuthorID": "35746945900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Liver and Digestive Health, University College London"}, "23492108400": {"Name": "Cordero P.", "AuthorID": "23492108400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Liver and Digestive Health, University College London"}, "56879862800": {"Name": "Li J.", "AuthorID": "56879862800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Liver and Digestive Health, University College London"}, "56978643100": {"Name": "Nguyen V.", "AuthorID": "56978643100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Liver and Digestive Health, University College London"}, "56672378500": {"Name": "Carter R.", "AuthorID": "56672378500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Liver and Digestive Health, University College London"}, "57183724300": {"Name": "Kapur S.R.", "AuthorID": "57183724300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Liver and Digestive Health, University College London"}, "6603555514": {"Name": "Vinciguerra M.", "AuthorID": "6603555514", "AffiliationID": "100920265", "AffiliationName": "Centro Studi Fegato (CSF)-Liver Research Center, Fondazione Italiana Fegato"}, "6602606185": {"Name": "Oben J.A.", "AuthorID": "6602606185", "AffiliationID": "60005518", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Guy\u2019s and St Thomas\u2019 Hospital, NHS Foundation Trust"}, "35410029200": {"Name": "Pombo J.", "AuthorID": "35410029200", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Division of Women\u2019s Health, King\u2019s College London"}, "55791911200": {"Name": "Poston L.", "AuthorID": "55791911200", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Division of Women\u2019s Health, King\u2019s College London"}, "55233536600": {"Name": "Taylor P.D.", "AuthorID": "55233536600", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Division of Women\u2019s Health, King\u2019s College London"}}}
