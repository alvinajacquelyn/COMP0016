Serum IGF-1 levels at 31, 32 and 33 weeks were measured and risk factor data collected including gestational age (GA), birth weight (BW), absolute weight gain (AWG) and maternal ethnicity. The eventual ROP outcome was divided into two groups: minimal ROP (Stages 0 and 1) and severe ROP (Stage 2 or worse including Type 1 ROP).RESULTS: 36 patients were recruited: 14 had minimal ROP and 22 severe ROP. Significant differences between the groups were found in GA, BW, AWG and IGF-1 at 32 and 33 weeks. There was minimal rise in IGF-1 in Stage 2 patients and/or black patients (p=0.0013) between 32 and 33 weeks but no pragmatic threshold level of IGF-1 that could distinguish between minimal or severe ROP.CONCLUSIONS: There were significant differences in GA, BW, AWG and IGF-1 at 32 and 33 weeks between those babies with severe ROP and those with minimal ROP. However, there was no threshold level of IGF-1 at a time point between 31 and 33 weeks that can be used to exclude a large proportion of babies from screening. We also found ethnic differences in IGF-1 levels with infants born to black mothers having significantly lower IGF-1 levels at 32 and 33 weeks gestation. The determination of ROP risk using IGF-1 is a race-specific phenomenon.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Biochemistry", "Child health (paediatrics)", "Retina", "Treatment Lasers"], "IndexKeywords": ["African Continental Ancestry Group", "Asian Continental Ancestry Group", "Birth Weight", "Cohort Studies", "Ethnic Groups", "European Continental Ancestry Group", "Female", "Gestational Age", "Humans", "Immunoenzyme Techniques", "Insulin-Like Growth Factor I", "Intensive Care Units, Neonatal", "Mothers", "Prospective Studies", "Retinopathy of Prematurity", "Risk Factors", "Weight Gain"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85028236102", "SubjectAreas": [["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"], ["Sensory Systems", "NEUR", "2809"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"]], "AuthorData": {"7402242349": {"Name": "Reddy M.A.", "AuthorID": "7402242349", "AffiliationID": "60010088, 60021435, 60159931", "AffiliationName": "The Royal London Hospital, Barts Health NHS Trust, UK Blizard Institute, Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry"}, "36171924300": {"Name": "Patel H.I.", "AuthorID": "36171924300", "AffiliationID": "60010088, 60021435, 60159931", "AffiliationName": "The Royal London Hospital, Barts Health NHS Trust, UK Blizard Institute, Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry"}, "56800024700": {"Name": "Karim S.M.", "AuthorID": "56800024700", "AffiliationID": "60010088, 60021435, 60159931", "AffiliationName": "The Royal London Hospital, Barts Health NHS Trust, UK Blizard Institute, Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry"}, "56800608200": {"Name": "Lock H.", "AuthorID": "56800608200", "AffiliationID": "60010088, 60021435, 60159931", "AffiliationName": "The Royal London Hospital, Barts Health NHS Trust, UK Blizard Institute, Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry"}, "57206325938": {"Name": "Perry L.", "AuthorID": "57206325938", "AffiliationID": "60010088, 60021435, 60159931", "AffiliationName": "The Royal London Hospital, Barts Health NHS Trust, UK Blizard Institute, Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry"}, "7005268305": {"Name": "Bunce C.", "AuthorID": "7005268305", "AffiliationID": "60010088, 60021435, 60159931", "AffiliationName": "The Royal London Hospital, Barts Health NHS Trust, UK Blizard Institute, Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry"}, "55403509100": {"Name": "Kempley S.", "AuthorID": "55403509100", "AffiliationID": "60010088, 60021435, 60159931", "AffiliationName": "The Royal London Hospital, Barts Health NHS Trust, UK Blizard Institute, Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry"}, "57197877225": {"Name": "Sinha A.K.", "AuthorID": "57197877225", "AffiliationID": "60010088, 60021435, 60159931", "AffiliationName": "The Royal London Hospital, Barts Health NHS Trust, UK Blizard Institute, Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry"}}}
