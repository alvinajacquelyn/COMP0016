Digital image correlation (DIC) and digital volume correlation (DVC) were used to measure the near-tip material responses on the surfaces (DIC) and the interior (DVC) of the specimens. Materials with elastic-plastic and large plastic characteristics were chosen for the study, where plasticity-induced premature contact between the crack flanks is known to occur. Displacement maps around the cracks were obtained using DIC and DVC at selected load increments and were introduced as boundary conditions into the finite element (FE) models to obtain the \u201ceffective\u201d crack driving force in terms of J-integral, and the results were compared with those \u201cnominal\u201d from the standard FE analysis. Both visual observation and compliance curves were used to determine the \u201ccrack opening\u201d levels; whilst the impacts of the crack opening on the crack driving force J and the normal strains ahead of the crack tip were evaluated in 2D and 3D. The results from the study indicate that, crack closure, although clearly identifiable in the compliance curves, does not appear to impact on global crack driving force, such as J-integral, or strains ahead of the crack tip; hence, it may well be a misconception.", "AuthorKeywords": ["crack closure", "DIC", "DVC", "fatigue crack", "J-integral", "strain"], "IndexKeywords": ["Crack opening displacements", "D. digital image correlation (DIC)", "Digital volume correlations", "Fatigue crack closure", "Fatigue cracks", "Finite element modelling", "J integral", "Plastic characteristics"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85070318918", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Mechanics of Materials", "ENGI", "2211"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"]], "AuthorData": {"7202724363": {"Name": "Tong J.", "AuthorID": "7202724363", "AffiliationID": "60025475", "AffiliationName": "Mechanical Behaviour of Materials Laboratory, School of Mechanical and Design Engineering, University of Portsmouth"}, "57200327510": {"Name": "Alshammrei S.", "AuthorID": "57200327510", "AffiliationID": "60025475", "AffiliationName": "Mechanical Behaviour of Materials Laboratory, School of Mechanical and Design Engineering, University of Portsmouth"}, "55572667400": {"Name": "Lin B.", "AuthorID": "55572667400", "AffiliationID": "60025475", "AffiliationName": "Mechanical Behaviour of Materials Laboratory, School of Mechanical and Design Engineering, University of Portsmouth"}, "57200328573": {"Name": "Wigger T.", "AuthorID": "57200328573", "AffiliationID": "60025475", "AffiliationName": "Mechanical Behaviour of Materials Laboratory, School of Mechanical and Design Engineering, University of Portsmouth"}, "55887390400": {"Name": "Marrow T.", "AuthorID": "55887390400", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials, University of Oxford"}}}
