All rights reserved.Background and Objectives: The potential link between dissociative symptoms and symptom over-reporting has been given little attention. In two student samples (N\u2019s = 139 and 113) and a clinical sample (N = 21), we examined whether self-reported dissociative symptoms are related to symptom over-reporting. Methods: We relied on different measures of dissociation and over-reporting. In the clinical sample, we looked at whether the well-established link between dissociative symptoms and sleep disturbances would survive if we corrected for symptom over-reporting. Results: Dissociativity correlated with symptom over-reporting in the student samples, but not in the clinical sample. Correcting for over-reporting tendencies did not fundamentally alter the relationships between dissociative symptoms and sleep disturbances in the clinical sample. Conclusions: Our results suggest that the overlap between symptom over-reporting and dissociativity is much more a problem in nonclinical than in clinical samples.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cambridge depersonalisation scale", "Dissociative experiences scale", "Dissociative symptoms", "Overreporting", "Structured inventory of malingered symptomatology"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84948778832", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"55333402800": {"Name": "Merckelbach H.", "AuthorID": "55333402800", "AffiliationID": "60018869", "AffiliationName": "Forensic Psychology Section, Maastricht University"}, "7801650583": {"Name": "Giesbrecht T.", "AuthorID": "7801650583", "AffiliationID": "60018869", "AffiliationName": "Forensic Psychology Section, Maastricht University"}, "37001921200": {"Name": "Meyer T.", "AuthorID": "37001921200", "AffiliationID": "60018869", "AffiliationName": "Forensic Psychology Section, Maastricht University"}, "56986662800": {"Name": "Rietman K.", "AuthorID": "56986662800", "AffiliationID": "60018869", "AffiliationName": "Forensic Psychology Section, Maastricht University"}, "56032951500": {"Name": "van Heugten-van der Kloet D.", "AuthorID": "56032951500", "AffiliationID": "60008323, 60002634", "AffiliationName": "Nuffield Department of Clinical Neurosciences, John Radcliffe Hospital Oxford"}, "57197065861": {"Name": "de Jong J.", "AuthorID": "57197065861", "AffiliationID": "112773877", "AffiliationName": "Psychotrauma Section, Parnassia Bavo Clinics"}}}
