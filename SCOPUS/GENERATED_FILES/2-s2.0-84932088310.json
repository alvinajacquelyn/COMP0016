Generating clinical data in these patients poses ethical and operational challenges, yielding results that may not be generalizable to the overall population. Modeling and simulation (M&S) is proposed as a basis for assessing the impact of age-related changes and their clinical implications. M&S can be used in conjunction with bridging and extrapolation to ensure the selection of appropriate dose(s)/regimen(s) in this population.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Age Factors", "Aging", "Computer Simulation", "Decision Support Techniques", "Decision Trees", "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug", "Drug Dosage Calculations", "Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions", "Evidence-Based Medicine", "Humans", "Models, Biological", "Patient Selection", "Risk Assessment", "Risk Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84932088310", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"56693880900": {"Name": "Saeed M.", "AuthorID": "56693880900", "AffiliationID": "60026851, 60020649", "AffiliationName": "Kellogg College, University of Oxford, GlaxoSmithKline"}, "36601648200": {"Name": "Vlasakakis G.", "AuthorID": "36601648200", "AffiliationID": "60026851, 60020649", "AffiliationName": "Kellogg College, University of Oxford, GlaxoSmithKline"}, "8536932300": {"Name": "Della Pasqua O.", "AuthorID": "8536932300", "AffiliationID": "60026851, 60020649", "AffiliationName": "Kellogg College, University of Oxford, GlaxoSmithKline"}}}
