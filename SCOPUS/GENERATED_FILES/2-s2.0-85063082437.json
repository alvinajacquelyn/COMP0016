Methods Patients with myocardial infarction that had intravascular ultrasound-virtual histology (IVUS-VH) and optical coherence tomography (OCT) at baseline and 13-month follow-up were studied. The IVUS-VH data were used to reconstruct the nonculprit vessels, and in the obtained models the ESS was estimated in 3 mm segments. Plaque morphology was derived in each segment from IVUS-VH and OCT. Disease progression was defined as the presence of \u22652 out of the following criteria: reduction in lumen area, increase in plaque burden and change of plaque morphology to a more vulnerable phenotype. Linear mixed effects models were used to assess the effect of ESS in different phenotypes. Results Sixty-eight vessels were included in the analysis. Low ESS was associated with plaque progression in all phenotypes. The effect of ESS on plaque burden (p for interaction=0.467) and phenotype (p for interaction=0.188) was similar in all plaque types, whereas the effect of ESS on the changes in lumen dimensions was more prominent in disease-free (\u03b2=0.70, p<0.001) than fibrotic/fibrocalcific (\u03b2=0.28, p<0.001) or lipid-rich plaques (\u03b2=0.15, p=0.015). Standalone IVUS-VH misclassified plaque morphology in one-Third of the cases leading to erroneous estimations about the effect of ESS on plaque evolution in different phenotypes. Conclusions The effect of ESS on plaque progression is similar in all phenotypes and cannot be accurately assessed by standalone IVUS-VH which often misclassifies plaque morphology. Therefore, multimodality imaging should be considered to examine the implications of ESS on plaque evolution.
