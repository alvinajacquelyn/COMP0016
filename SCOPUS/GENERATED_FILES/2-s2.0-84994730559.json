The aim of the study was to evaluate how morphological phenotype impacted upon overall survival. 191 cases of malignant pleural mesothelioma with available follow-up were identified, examined and classified according to histological types. The epithelioid mesotheliomas were further subdivided according to morphological subtypes: myxoid, microcystic, tubulopapillary, solid epithelioid, micropapillary and pleomorphic; biphasic mesotheliomas were divided into epithelioid component dominant and sarcomatoid component dominant; pure sarcomatoid mesotheliomas were divided into not otherwise specified, leiomyoid, desmoplastic and heterologous. All cases were confirmed by two experienced observers. Myxoid variant malignant pleural epithelioid mesothelioma was observed to have a favourable overall survival compared with pleomorphic form ( p=0.00008). Pleomorphic phenotype had the worst overall survival. Morphological phenotype is an important histological factor that should be included in pathology reports to convey potential favourable prognostic subgroups of patients with mesothelioma.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Female", "Humans", "Lung Neoplasms", "Male", "Mesothelioma", "Middle Aged", "Pleural Neoplasms", "Prognosis", "Survival Rate"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84994730559", "SubjectAreas": [["Pathology and Forensic Medicine", "MEDI", "2734"]], "AuthorData": {"57189887166": {"Name": "Alchami F.S.", "AuthorID": "57189887166", "AffiliationID": "60000020, 60138351", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cellular Pathology, University Hospital of Wales, Cardiff and Vale University Health Board"}, "7003545002": {"Name": "Attanoos R.L.", "AuthorID": "7003545002", "AffiliationID": "60000020, 60138351", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cellular Pathology, University Hospital of Wales, Cardiff and Vale University Health Board"}, "55487335700": {"Name": "Bamber A.R.", "AuthorID": "55487335700", "AffiliationID": "60000020, 60138351", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cellular Pathology, University Hospital of Wales, Cardiff and Vale University Health Board"}}}
