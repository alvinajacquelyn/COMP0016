Here we explored the neuroprotective effects of 2,2\u2032,5\u2032-trihydroxychalcone (225THC), a potent antioxidant with radical-scavenging properties. 225THC was found to be a potent inhibitor of apoptosis in stimulated primary rat neuronal cultures. This was likely mediated by an anti-inflammatory effect on microglial cells since 225THC inhibited LPS-stimulated TNF- and IL-6 secretion from primary rat microglia and modulated the cytokine/chemokine profile of BV2 microglial cells. Additionally, 225THC inhibited LPS-evoked inducible nitric oxide synthase expression but did not influence endogenous superoxide generation. Microglial flow cytometric analyses indicated the 225THC treatment induced a shift from an M1-like phenotype to a more downregulated microglial profile. Taken together these data suggest that the chalcone 2,2\u2032,5\u2032-trihydroxychalcone can modulate neuroinflammatory activation in brain-derived microglia and holds promise as a therapeutic in neuroinflammatory conditions.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Anti-inflammatory effects", "Antiproliferative agents", "Flow-cytometric analysis", "Inducible nitric oxide synthase", "Neuroprotective effects", "Radical scavenging properties", "Superoxide generation", "Toll-like receptor 4", "Animals", "Biomarkers", "Cell Line", "Cell Membrane", "Cells, Cultured", "Chalcones", "Chemokines", "Inflammation", "Inflammation Mediators", "Mice", "Microglia", "Neurons", "Neuroprotection", "Neuroprotective Agents", "Phenotype", "Rats, Sprague-Dawley", "Reactive Oxygen Species", "Toll-Like Receptor 4"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84954288934", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Aging", "BIOC", "1302"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"55789553500": {"Name": "Jiwrajka M.", "AuthorID": "55789553500", "AffiliationID": "60031004", "AffiliationName": "Mayne Medical School, 288 Herston Road"}, "56919083100": {"Name": "Phillips A.", "AuthorID": "56919083100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroinflammation, University College London Institute of Neurology"}, "57054881200": {"Name": "Butler M.", "AuthorID": "57054881200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroinflammation, University College London Institute of Neurology"}, "7006476466": {"Name": "Pocock J.M.", "AuthorID": "7006476466", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroinflammation, University College London Institute of Neurology"}, "37019504600": {"Name": "Rossi M.", "AuthorID": "37019504600", "AffiliationID": "60024878", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Vassar College"}}}
