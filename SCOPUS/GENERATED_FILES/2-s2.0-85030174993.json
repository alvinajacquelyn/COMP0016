Climate TPs can severely affect millions of lives on Earth so that an active scientific community is working on finding early warning signals. This paper deals with the development of a time series segmentation algorithm for paleoclimate data in order to find segments sharing common statistical patterns. The proposed algorithm uses a clustering-based approach for evaluating the solutions and six statistical features, most of which have been previously considered in the detection of early warning signals in paleoclimate TPs. Due to the limitations of classical statistical methods, we propose the use of a genetic algorithm to automatically segment the series, together with a method to compare the segmentations. The final segments provided by the algorithm are used to construct a prediction model, whose promising results show the importance of segmentation for improving the understanding of a time series.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Abrupt climate change", "Clustering", "Genetic algorithms", "Paleoclimate data", "Time series segmentation", "Tipping points"], "IndexKeywords": ["Abrupt climate change", "Clustering", "Paleoclimates", "Time-series segmentation", "Tipping point"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85030174993", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"], ["Artificial Intelligence", "COMP", "1702"]], "AuthorData": {"35068542300": {"Name": "P\u00e9rez-Ortiz M.", "AuthorID": "35068542300", "AffiliationID": "60086940", "AffiliationName": "Department of Quantitative Methods, Universidad Loyola Andaluc\u00eda"}, "57217862239": {"Name": "S\u00e1nchez-Monedero J.", "AuthorID": "57217862239", "AffiliationID": "60086940", "AffiliationName": "Department of Quantitative Methods, Universidad Loyola Andaluc\u00eda"}, "35208362300": {"Name": "Fern\u00e1ndez-Navarro F.", "AuthorID": "35208362300", "AffiliationID": "60086940", "AffiliationName": "Department of Quantitative Methods, Universidad Loyola Andaluc\u00eda"}, "56733066400": {"Name": "Dur\u00e1n-Rosal A.M.", "AuthorID": "56733066400", "AffiliationID": "60003138", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science and Numerical Analysis, University of C\u00f3rdoba"}, "23473354200": {"Name": "Guti\u00e9rrez P.A.", "AuthorID": "23473354200", "AffiliationID": "60003138", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science and Numerical Analysis, University of C\u00f3rdoba"}, "6603240334": {"Name": "Herv\u00e1s-Mart\u00ednez C.", "AuthorID": "6603240334", "AffiliationID": "60003138", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science and Numerical Analysis, University of C\u00f3rdoba"}, "56205073800": {"Name": "Nikolaou A.", "AuthorID": "56205073800", "AffiliationID": "60007798", "AffiliationName": "German Aerospace Center Institute of Planetary Research Planetary Physics"}}}
