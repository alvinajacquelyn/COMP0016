All rights reserved.Background The association between bone mineral density (BMD) and serum25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentration is weak, particularly in certain races (eg, BlackAfrican vs Caucasian) and in athletic populations. We aimed to examine if bioavailable vitamin D rather than serum 25(OH)D was related to markers of bone health within a racially diverse athletic population. Methods In 604 male athletes (Arab (n=327), Asian (n=48), Black (n=108), Caucasian (n=53) and Hispanic (n=68)), we measured total 25(OH)D, vitamin D-binding protein and BMD by DXA. Bioavailable vitamin D was calculated using the free hormone hypothesis. Results From 604 athletes, 21.5% (n=130) demonstrated severe 25(OH)D deficiency, 37.1% (n=224) deficiency, 26% (n=157) insufficiency and 15.4% (n=93) sufficiency. Serum 25(OH)D concentrations were not associated with BMD at any site. After adjusting for age and race, bioavailable vitamin D was associated with BMD (spine, neck and hip). Mean serum vitamin D binding protein concentrations were not associated with 25(OH)D concentrations (p=0.392). Conclusion Regardless of age or race, bioavailable vitamin D and not serum 25(OH)D was associated with BMD in a racially diverse athletic population. If vitamin D screening is warranted, clinicians should use appropriate assays to calculate vitamin D binding protein and bioavailable vitamin D levels concentrations than serum 25(OH)D. In turn, prophylactic vitamin D supplementation to \u00e2 'correct' insufficient athletes should not be based on serum 25(OH)D measures.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Athlete", "Biochemistry", "Bone Mineral Density"], "IndexKeywords": ["Absorptiometry, Photon", "Adolescent", "Adult", "Athletes", "Biological Availability", "Biomarkers", "Bone Density", "Humans", "Male", "Parathyroid Hormone", "Vitamin D", "Vitamin D-Binding Protein", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85041332830", "SubjectAreas": [["Orthopedics and Sports Medicine", "MEDI", "2732"], ["Physical Therapy, Sports Therapy and Rehabilitation", "HEAL", "3612"]], "AuthorData": {"56282955700": {"Name": "Allison R.J.", "AuthorID": "56282955700", "AffiliationID": "60118338", "AffiliationName": "Arsenal Football Club"}, "9733771900": {"Name": "Close G.L.", "AuthorID": "9733771900", "AffiliationID": "60028355", "AffiliationName": "Research Institute for Sport and Exercise Science, Liverpool John Moores University"}, "25825824400": {"Name": "Wilson M.G.", "AuthorID": "25825824400", "AffiliationID": "60022193", "AffiliationName": "Research Institute of Sport and Exercise Sciences, University of Canberra"}, "49963302800": {"Name": "Farooq A.", "AuthorID": "49963302800", "AffiliationID": "60105844", "AffiliationName": "Athlete Health and Performance Research Centre, ASPETAR, Orthopaedic and Sports Medicine Hospital"}, "56911958600": {"Name": "Cherif A.", "AuthorID": "56911958600", "AffiliationID": "60105844", "AffiliationName": "Athlete Health and Performance Research Centre, ASPETAR, Orthopaedic and Sports Medicine Hospital"}, "55655478300": {"Name": "Hamilton B.", "AuthorID": "55655478300", "AffiliationID": "60121178", "AffiliationName": "Department of Sports Medicine, High Performance Sport New Zealand"}}}
