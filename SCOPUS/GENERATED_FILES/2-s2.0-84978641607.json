They offer advantages for aerospace applications, e.g., good strength to weight ratio. However, impact during the operation and servicing of the aircraft can lead to barely visible and difficult to detect damage. Depending on the severity of the impact, delaminations can occur, reducing the load carrying capacity of the structure. Efficient structural health monitoring of composite panels can be achieved using guided ultrasonic waves propagating along the structure. The guided ultrasonic wave (A0 Lamb wave mode) scattering at delaminations was modelled using full three-dimensional Finite Element (FE) simulations. The influence of the delamination size was systematically investigated from a parameter study. The angular dependency of the scattered guided wave amplitude was calculated using a baseline subtraction method. A significant influence of the delamination width on the guided wave scattering was found. The sensitivity of guided waves for the detection of barely visible impact damage in composite panels has been predicted.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Composites", "Delamination", "Finite Element Modeling", "Guided Ultrasonic Waves", "Lamb Waves"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aerospace structure", "Angular dependencies", "Barely visible impact damages", "Carbon fiber laminate", "Full three-dimensional", "Guided ultrasonic waves", "Strength to weight ratio", "Subtraction method"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84978641607", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"55756162400": {"Name": "Murat B.", "AuthorID": "55756162400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "23977809500": {"Name": "Fromme P.", "AuthorID": "23977809500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}}}
