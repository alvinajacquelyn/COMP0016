We work for the special case of Kiselev black hole where we take the state parameter wq=-23. For the detailed derivation and analysis of the bending angle involved in the deflection of light, we discuss three special cases of Kiselev black hole: nonextreme, extreme, and naked singularity. We also calculate the approximate bending angle and compare it with the exact bending angle. We found the relation of bending angles in the decreasing order as: naked singularity, extreme Kiselev black hole, nonextreme Kiselev black hole, and Schwarzschild black hole. In the weak field approximation, we compute the position and total magnification of relativistic images as well.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84945912343", "SubjectAreas": [["Nuclear and High Energy Physics", "PHYS", "3106"], ["Physics and Astronomy (miscellaneous)", "PHYS", "3101"]], "AuthorData": {"56938625600": {"Name": "Younas A.", "AuthorID": "56938625600", "AffiliationID": "60059937", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, School of Natural Sciences (SNS), National University of Sciences and Technology (NUST)"}, "56468612300": {"Name": "Hussain S.", "AuthorID": "56468612300", "AffiliationID": "60059937", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, School of Natural Sciences (SNS), National University of Sciences and Technology (NUST)"}, "24076168500": {"Name": "Jamil M.", "AuthorID": "24076168500", "AffiliationID": "60059937", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, School of Natural Sciences (SNS), National University of Sciences and Technology (NUST)"}, "55811800800": {"Name": "Bahamonde S.", "AuthorID": "55811800800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University College London"}}}
