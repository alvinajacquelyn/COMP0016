Method: Pragmatic, prospective, quasi-experimental study. Intervention patients were matched by propensity score techniques with a control group. Guided by results from a pilot study, clinical pharmacists implemented TFU intervention, added to routine integrated medicines management service. Results: Using an intention to treat approach, reductions in 30- and 90-day readmission rates for intervention patients compared with controls were 9.9% [odds ratio = 0.57; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.36\u20130.90; P < 0.001] and 15.2% (odds ratio = 0.53; 95% CI: 0.36\u20130.79; P = 0.021) respectively. Marginal mean time to readmission was 70.9 days (95% CI: 66.9\u201374.9) for intervention group compared with 60.1 days (95% CI: 55.4\u201364.7) for controls. Mean length of hospital stay compared with control was (8.3 days vs. 6.7 days; P < 0.001). Benefit: cost ratio for 30-day readmissions was 29.62, and 23.58 for 90-day interval. Per protocol analyses gave more marked improvements. In intervention patients, mean concern scale score, using Beliefs about Medicine Questionnaire, was reduced 3.2 (95% CI: \u20134.22 to \u22122.27; P < 0.001). Mean difference in Medication Adherence Report Scale was 1.4 (22.7 vs. 24.1; P < 0.001). Most patients (83.8%) reported having better control of their medicines after the intervention. Conclusions: Pharmacist-led postdischarge structured TFU intervention can reduce 30- and 90-day readmission rates. Positive impacts were noted on time to readmission, length of hospital stay upon readmission, healthcare costs, patient beliefs about medicines, patient self-reported adherence and satisfaction.", "AuthorKeywords": ["clinical pharmacists", "postdischarge follow-up", "readmission rate", "rehospitalization"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aftercare", "Aged", "Continuity of Patient Care", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Health Plan Implementation", "Humans", "Male", "Medication Adherence", "Middle Aged", "Patient Discharge", "Patient Readmission", "Pharmacists", "Pharmacy Service, Hospital", "Polypharmacy", "Professional Role", "Program Evaluation", "Prospective Studies", "Telephone"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85060638175", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"57205579983": {"Name": "Odeh M.", "AuthorID": "57205579983", "AffiliationID": "60044088", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Hashemite University"}, "7005096115": {"Name": "McElnay J.C.", "AuthorID": "7005096115", "AffiliationID": "60029738", "AffiliationName": "Clinical and Practice Research Group, School of Pharmacy, Queen's University Belfast"}, "21234301300": {"Name": "Scullin C.", "AuthorID": "21234301300", "AffiliationID": "122033576", "AffiliationName": "Medicines Optimisation Innovation Centre (MOIC)"}, "7202106529": {"Name": "Fleming G.", "AuthorID": "7202106529", "AffiliationID": "122033576", "AffiliationName": "Medicines Optimisation Innovation Centre (MOIC)"}, "35549495600": {"Name": "Scott M.G.", "AuthorID": "35549495600", "AffiliationID": "122033576", "AffiliationName": "Medicines Optimisation Innovation Centre (MOIC)"}, "23012144600": {"Name": "Horne R.", "AuthorID": "23012144600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "School of Pharmacy, University College London"}}}
