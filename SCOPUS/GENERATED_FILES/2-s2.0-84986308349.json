We evaluated the heterogeneity in the expression of PD-1 ligands in isogeneic primary and metastatic LC specimens. Experimental Design: From 12,580 post mortem cases, we identified 214 patients with untreated metastatic LC, of which 98 had adequately preserved tissues to construct a syngeneic primary LC/metastasis tissue microarray. Immunostaining for PD-L1 and 2 was evaluated in paired primary and metastatic lesions and correlated with clinicopathologic features. Results: We included 98 patients with non-small cell (NSCLC, n = 65, 66%), small cell histology (SCLC, n = 29, 30%) and four (4%) atypical carcinoids (AC). In total 8/65 (12%) primary PD-L1 positive NSCLC, had discordant matched metastases (14/17, 82%). PD-L1 negative primaries had universally concordant distant metastases. SCLCs were universally PD-L1 negative across primary and metastatic disease. PD-L2 positive NSCLC (n = 11/65, 17%) had high rate of discordant metastases (n = 24/27, 88%) and four cases (6%) had PD-L2 positive metastases with negative primaries. 2/29 SCLC (7%) and 1/4 AC (25%) were PD-L2 positive with discordance in all the sampled metastatic sites (n = 5). We found no correlation between the expression of PD ligands and clinicopathologic features of LC. Conclusions: Intra-tumoral heterogeneity in the expression of PD ligands is common in NSCLC, while PD-L1 is homogeneously undetectable in primary and metastatic SCLC. This holds implications in the clinical development of immune response biomarkers in LC.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Heterogeneity", "lung cancer", "PD-1", "PD-L1", "PD-L2"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84986308349", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"], ["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"]], "AuthorData": {"35180464500": {"Name": "Pinato D.J.", "AuthorID": "35180464500", "AffiliationID": "60020416, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery & Cancer, Imperial College London, Hammersmith Hospital"}, "57191072569": {"Name": "White S.D.T.", "AuthorID": "57191072569", "AffiliationID": "60020416, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery & Cancer, Imperial College London, Hammersmith Hospital"}, "57169443100": {"Name": "Black J.R.M.", "AuthorID": "57169443100", "AffiliationID": "60020416, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery & Cancer, Imperial College London, Hammersmith Hospital"}, "56343983100": {"Name": "Stebbing J.", "AuthorID": "56343983100", "AffiliationID": "60020416, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery & Cancer, Imperial College London, Hammersmith Hospital"}, "56434950800": {"Name": "Sharma R.", "AuthorID": "56434950800", "AffiliationID": "60020416, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery & Cancer, Imperial College London, Hammersmith Hospital"}, "7004246457": {"Name": "Shiner R.J.", "AuthorID": "7004246457", "AffiliationID": "60010719, 60020416", "AffiliationName": "National Heart and Lung Institute, Department of Respiratory Medicine, Hammersmith Hospital"}, "18937726200": {"Name": "Trivedi P.", "AuthorID": "18937726200", "AffiliationID": "60020416, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Histopathology, Imperial College London, Hammersmith Hospital"}, "19736453100": {"Name": "Mauri F.A.", "AuthorID": "19736453100", "AffiliationID": "60020416, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Histopathology, Imperial College London, Hammersmith Hospital"}}}
