In over half of 32 studies reviewed, the feedback condition had significantly higher levels of treatment effectiveness on at least one treatment outcome variable. Feedback was particularly effective for not-on-track patients or when it was provided to both clinicians and patients. The findings for treatment efficiency and collaborative practice were less consistent. Given the heterogeneity of studies, more research is needed to determine when and for whom feedback is most effective.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Collaboratve practice", "Feedback", "Outcome evaluation", "Outcome management", "Outcome measures"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cooperative Behavior", "Feedback", "Humans", "Mental Disorders", "Mental Health Services", "Outcome Assessment (Health Care)", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84953425824", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychiatric Mental Health", "NURS", "2921"], ["Health Policy", "MEDI", "2719"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"57041016300": {"Name": "Gondek D.", "AuthorID": "57041016300", "AffiliationID": "60170329, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Evidence Based Practice Unit, UCL and Anna Freud Centre"}, "56339951200": {"Name": "Edbrooke-Childs J.", "AuthorID": "56339951200", "AffiliationID": "60170329, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Evidence Based Practice Unit, UCL and Anna Freud Centre"}, "55329958600": {"Name": "Fink E.", "AuthorID": "55329958600", "AffiliationID": "60170329, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Evidence Based Practice Unit, UCL and Anna Freud Centre"}, "41861122100": {"Name": "Deighton J.", "AuthorID": "41861122100", "AffiliationID": "60170329, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Evidence Based Practice Unit, UCL and Anna Freud Centre"}, "6701596440": {"Name": "Wolpert M.", "AuthorID": "6701596440", "AffiliationID": "60170329, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Evidence Based Practice Unit, UCL and Anna Freud Centre"}}}
