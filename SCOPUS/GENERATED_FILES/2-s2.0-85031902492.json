However, electrically active defects at the SiC/SiO2 interface degrade the ideal behavior of the devices. The relevant microscopic defects can be identified by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) or electrically detected magnetic resonance (EDMR). This helps to decide which changes to the fabrication process will likely lead to further increases of device performance and reliability. EDMR measurements have shown very similar dominant hyperfine (HF) spectra in differently processed MOSFETs although some discrepancies were observed in the measured g-factors. Here, the HF spectra measured of different SiC MOSFETs are compared, and it is argued that the same dominant defect is present in all devices. A comparison of the data with simulated spectra of the C dangling bond (PbC) center and the silicon vacancy (VSi) demonstrates that the PbC center is a more suitable candidate to explain the observed HF spectra.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Device performance", "Electrically active defects", "Electrically detected magnetic resonances", "Electron paramagnetic resonances (EPR)", "Fabrication process", "Microscopic defects", "SiC/siO2-interfaces", "Silicon vacancies"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85031902492", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"55600926600": {"Name": "Gruber G.", "AuthorID": "55600926600", "AffiliationID": "60110568, 60019663", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Solid State Physics, Graz University of Technology"}, "7005833889": {"Name": "Hadley P.", "AuthorID": "7005833889", "AffiliationID": "60110568, 60019663", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Solid State Physics, Graz University of Technology"}, "57189512233": {"Name": "Cottom J.", "AuthorID": "57189512233", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "57196123388": {"Name": "Meszaros R.", "AuthorID": "57196123388", "AffiliationID": "60015818", "AffiliationName": "Infineon Technologies"}, "24502731100": {"Name": "Aichinger T.", "AuthorID": "24502731100", "AffiliationID": "60015818", "AffiliationName": "Infineon Technologies"}, "15725327100": {"Name": "Koch M.", "AuthorID": "15725327100", "AffiliationID": "60019663", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Experimental Physics, Graz University of Technology"}, "36552994800": {"Name": "Pobegen G.", "AuthorID": "36552994800", "AffiliationID": "60092045", "AffiliationName": "KAI GmbH"}, "7403067480": {"Name": "Peters D.", "AuthorID": "7403067480", "AffiliationID": "60030823", "AffiliationName": "Infineon Technologies"}}}
