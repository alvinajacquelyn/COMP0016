It contains accounts of the filaments[U+05F3] bending stiffness, of adhesion to the substrate, and of cross-links connecting the two families.An extension of the model is presented with contributions from nucleation of filaments by branching, from capping, from contraction by actin-myosin interaction, and from a pressure-like repulsion between parallel filaments due to Coulomb interaction. The effect of a chemoattractant is described by a simple signal transduction model influencing the polymerization speed. Simulations with the extended model show its potential for describing various moving cell shapes, depending on the signal transduction procedure, and for predicting transients between non-moving and moving states as well as changes of direction.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Actin", "Chemotaxis", "Cytoskeleton", "Mathematical model"], "IndexKeywords": ["Actin Cytoskeleton", "Animals", "Cell Shape", "Chemotaxis", "Computer Simulation", "Models, Biological", "Myosins", "Numerical Analysis, Computer-Assisted", "Polymerization", "Pseudopodia", "Signal Transduction"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84937915157", "SubjectAreas": [["Statistics and Probability", "MATH", "2613"], ["Modeling and Simulation", "MATH", "2611"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Immunology and Microbiology (all)", "IMMU", "2400"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"57188856699": {"Name": "Manhart A.", "AuthorID": "57188856699", "AffiliationID": "60025988", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Mathematics, University of Vienna"}, "7004130162": {"Name": "Schmeiser C.", "AuthorID": "7004130162", "AffiliationID": "60025988", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Mathematics, University of Vienna"}, "11739306000": {"Name": "Oelz D.", "AuthorID": "11739306000", "AffiliationID": "60003261, 60021784", "AffiliationName": "Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, New York University"}, "36609048500": {"Name": "Sfakianakis N.", "AuthorID": "36609048500", "AffiliationID": "60031216", "AffiliationName": "Johannes Gutenberg University"}}}
