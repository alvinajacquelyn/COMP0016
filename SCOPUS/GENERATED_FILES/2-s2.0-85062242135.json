To avert irreversible complications in congenital disorders producing early pathogenesis, safety and efficacy of AAV-intrauterine gene transfer (IUGT) requires assessment We therefore performed IUGT of AAV5 or -8 with liver-specific promoter-1 encoding either human coagulation factors IX (hPIX) or \u00d7 (hFX) into Macaca fascicularis fetuses at \u223c0.4 gestation. The initial cohort received 1 \u00d7 1012 vector genomes (vgs) of AAV5-hFIX (n = 5; 0.45 \u00d7 1013 vg/kg birth weight), resulting in \u223c3.0% hPIX at birth and 0.6\u20136.8% over 19\u201351 mo. The next cohort received 0.2-1 \u00d7 1013 vg boluses. AAV5-hPX animals (n = 3; 3.57 \u00d7 1013 vg/kg) expressed <1% at birth and 9.4\u201327.9% up to 42 mo. AAV8-hFIX recipients (n = 3; 2.56 \u00d7 1013 vg/kg) established 4.2\u201341.3% expression perinatally and 9.8\u201325.3% over 46 mo. Expression with AAV8-hFX (n = 6,3.12 \u00d7 1013 vg/kg) increased from <1% perinatally to 9.8\u201313.4% >35 mo. Low expressers (<1%, n = 3) were postnatally challenged with 2 \u00d7 1011 vg/kg AAV5 resulting in 2.4\u201313.2% expression and demonstrating acquired tolerance. Linear amplification-mediated-PCR analysis demonstrated random integration of 57\u201388% of AAV sequences retrieved from hepatocytes with no events occurring in or near oncogenesis-associated genes. Thus, early-IUGT in macaques produces sustained curative expression related significantly to integrated AAV in the absence of clinical toxicity, supporting its therapeutic potential for early-onset monogenic disorders.\u2014Chan, J.
