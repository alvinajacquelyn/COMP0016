Because of this constant flow of energy, their behavior can be explained and understood only within the framework of nonequilibrium physics. In the biological realm, many cells perform directed motion, for example, as a way to browse for nutrients or to avoid toxins. Inspired by these motile microorganisms, researchers have been developing artificial particles that feature similar swimming behaviors based on different mechanisms. These man-made micromachines and nanomachines hold a great potential as autonomous agents for health care, sustainability, and security applications. With a focus on the basic physical features of the interactions of self-propelled Brownian particles with a crowded and complex environment, this comprehensive review will provide a guided tour through its basic principles, the development of artificial self-propelling microparticles and nanoparticles, and their application to the study of nonequilibrium phenomena, as well as the open challenges that the field is currently facing.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Brownian particles", "Complex environments", "Different mechanisms", "Motile micro-organisms", "Non-equilibrium phenomena", "Non-equilibrium physics", "Physical features", "Security application"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85011371446", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"7003298237": {"Name": "Bechinger C.", "AuthorID": "7003298237", "AffiliationID": "60021199, 60109554", "AffiliationName": "NANOTEC-CNR Institute of Nanotechnology, Soft and Living Matter Laboratory"}, "8226255100": {"Name": "Di Leonardo R.", "AuthorID": "8226255100", "AffiliationID": "60014808", "AffiliationName": "Soft Matter Lab, Department of Physics, UNAM-National Nanotechnology Research Center, Bilkent University"}, "56212214600": {"Name": "L\u00f6wen H.", "AuthorID": "56212214600", "AffiliationID": "60025310", "AffiliationName": "Institut f\u00fcr Theoretische Physik II: Weiche Materie, Heinrich-Heine-Universit\u00e4t D\u00fcsseldorf"}, "35779738100": {"Name": "Reichhardt C.", "AuthorID": "35779738100", "AffiliationID": "60006099, 60006164", "AffiliationName": "Theoretical Division, Los Alamos National Laboratory"}, "55391086000": {"Name": "Volpe G.", "AuthorID": "55391086000", "AffiliationID": "60016437", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of Gothenburg"}, "8374046000": {"Name": "Volpe G.", "AuthorID": "8374046000", "AffiliationID": "60030569", "AffiliationName": "Max-Planck-Institut f\u00fcr Intelligente Systeme"}}}
