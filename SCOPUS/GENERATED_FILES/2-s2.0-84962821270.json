A multiwavelength source based on the line multiplication process taking place in a periodically poled lithium niobate waveguide has been recently proposed as a generator of tunable frequency combs. This source is stable and compact with respect to fiber-based solutions and does not require high radio frequency power. A transmitter employing the multiwavelength source is implemented and characterized in the static and dynamic regime, thus demonstrating hitless reconfiguration. The source also is tested within a three-node testbed employing commercial transceiver cards.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Elastic optical networks", "Multiwavelength source", "Periodically poled lithium niobate waveguide", "Sliceable bandwidth variable transponder"], "IndexKeywords": ["Dynamic regimes", "Elastic optical networks", "Multi-wavelength source", "Periodically poled lithium niobate waveguides", "Radio frequency power", "Reconfigurable", "Spectral efficiencies", "Tunable frequency"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84962821270", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"]], "AuthorData": {"6602694825": {"Name": "Scaffardi M.", "AuthorID": "6602694825", "AffiliationID": "60103966", "AffiliationName": "Consorzio Nazionale Interuniversitario per le Telecomunicazioni (CNIT)"}, "57197753294": {"Name": "Vercesi V.", "AuthorID": "57197753294", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London (UCL)"}, "55811273900": {"Name": "Sgambelluri A.", "AuthorID": "55811273900", "AffiliationID": "60028039", "AffiliationName": "Scuola Superiore sant'Anna"}, "7004301749": {"Name": "Bogoni A.", "AuthorID": "7004301749", "AffiliationID": "60028039", "AffiliationName": "Scuola Superiore sant'Anna"}}}
