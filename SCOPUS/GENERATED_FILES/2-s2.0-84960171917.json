The operator -\u0394V, \u2202\u03c9 is a Hamiltonian used to model both quantum corrals (Aligia and Lobos 2005 J. Phys.: Condens. Matter 17 S1095, Barr 2010 Nano Lett. 10 325360) and leaky quantum graphs (Exner P 2008 Analysis on Graphs and its Applications (Providence, RI: American Mathematical Society) pp 523564). Since highly frequency dependent delta potentials are out of reach of the more general techniques in (Galkowski J 2015 arXiv:1511.05894, Galkowski J and Smith H 2014 Int. Math. Res. Not.) we study the special case where \u03c9 = B(0, 1) CR2 and V =h-\u03b1V0 > 0 with \u03b11. Here h-1 \u223c Re\u2207is the frequency. We give sharp bounds on the size of resonance free regions for \u03b1\u2264 1 and the location of bands of resonances when 5/6\u2264\u03b1\u2264 1. Finally, we give a lower bound on the number of resonances in logarithmic size strips: -MlogRe\u2207\u2264Im\u2207\u22640.", "AuthorKeywords": ["delta potential", "high energy", "leaky quantum graph", "quantum corral", "resonances"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84960171917", "SubjectAreas": [["Statistical and Nonlinear Physics", "PHYS", "3109"], ["Statistics and Probability", "MATH", "2613"], ["Modeling and Simulation", "MATH", "2611"], ["Mathematical Physics", "MATH", "2610"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"16401508800": {"Name": "Galkowski J.", "AuthorID": "16401508800", "AffiliationID": "60012708", "AffiliationName": "Mathematics Department, Stanford University"}}}
