{"Title": "Impact of Fetal Growth and Preterm Birth on the Retinal Microvasculature in Mid-Adulthood", "Year": 2015, "Source": "Microcirculation", "Volume": "22", "Issue": 4, "Art.No": null, "PageStart": 285, "PageEnd": 293, "CitedBy": 9, "DOI": "10.1111/micc.12197", "Link": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84928264718&origin=inward", "Abstract": "\u00a9 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.Objective: We hypothesized that preterm birth and being born SGA would be associated with changes in retinal microvascular architecture and that these changes would be more marked among those born preterm. We further hypothesized that these microvascular changes would correlate with early markers of CVD in mid-adulthood. Methods: The Cardiovascular Risk in Young Finns Study included randomly selected children from 5 Finnish University cities. Retinal microvascular architecture of participants born preterm, born at term and SGA and a control group born at term and AGA were compared (aged 34-49 years). Results: In participants born preterm, arteriolar tortuosity (\u00d710<sup>2</sup>) was higher-means (standard error), 0.06 (0.01) versus 0.04 (0.01), p = 0.001, arteriolar length (pixels) were greater-644.9 (35.9) versus 591.7 (33.5), p = 0.007 and arteriolar diameters (pixels) were narrower-19.9 (0.4) versus 20.3 (0.3), p = 0.034 compared to participants born AGA, after adjustment. In participants born SGA, only arteriolar tortuosity was higher-0.05 (0.01) versus 0.04 (0.01), p = 0.074 compared to participants born AGA. Conclusion: This study demonstrated that being born SGA and in particular preterm birth are associated with changes in retinal microvascular architecture. The prenatal and immediate postnatal environment may contribute to the mechanisms.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Atherosclerosis", "Blood pressure", "Cardiovascular diseases", "Epidemiology", "Vasculature"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Female", "Fetal Development", "Follow-Up Studies", "Humans", "Male", "Microcirculation", "Middle Aged", "Premature Birth", "Retinal Vessels"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84928264718", "SubjectAreas": [["Physiology", "BIOC", "1314"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"], ["Physiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2737"]], "AuthorData": {"16679281400": {"Name": "Hussain S.", "AuthorID": "16679281400", "AffiliationID": "60019578", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine, Monash University"}, "7003450942": {"Name": "Metha A.", "AuthorID": "7003450942", "AffiliationID": "60026553", "AffiliationName": "Department of Optometry and Vision Sciences, The University of Melbourne"}, "7004191809": {"Name": "Tapp R.", "AuthorID": "7004191809", "AffiliationID": "60118547, 60026553", "AffiliationName": "The Melbourne School of Population and Global Health, The University of Melbourne"}, "7006708451": {"Name": "K\u00e4h\u00f6nen M.", "AuthorID": "7006708451", "AffiliationID": "60011170, 60008760", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Physiology, Tampere University Hospital and the University of Tampere"}, "7004828916": {"Name": "Raitakari O.", "AuthorID": "7004828916", "AffiliationID": "60025765", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Physiology and Nuclear Medicine, Turku University Hospital"}, "6506534545": {"Name": "Skilton M.", "AuthorID": "6506534545", "AffiliationID": "60025709", "AffiliationName": "Boden Institute of Obesity Nutrition Exercise and Eating Disorders, University of Sydney"}, "13104672700": {"Name": "Witt N.", "AuthorID": "13104672700", "AffiliationID": "60111785, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "International Centre for Circulatory Health, NHLI, Imperial College, London and Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"}, "7005513520": {"Name": "Chaturvedi N.", "AuthorID": "7005513520", "AffiliationID": "60111785, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "International Centre for Circulatory Health, NHLI, Imperial College, London and Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"}, "56090811900": {"Name": "Wijetunge S.", "AuthorID": "56090811900", "AffiliationID": "60111785, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "International Centre for Circulatory Health, NHLI, Imperial College, London and Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"}, "7401765648": {"Name": "Hughes A.", "AuthorID": "7401765648", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}, "6507679364": {"Name": "Mcg Thom S.", "AuthorID": "6507679364", "AffiliationID": "60111785, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "International Centre for Circulatory Health, NHLI, Imperial College, London and Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"}, "6603582807": {"Name": "Hutri-K\u00e4h\u00f6nen N.", "AuthorID": "6603582807", "AffiliationID": "60011170, 60008760", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatrics, University of Tampere and Tampere University Hospital"}, "7006539182": {"Name": "Lehtim\u00e4ki T.", "AuthorID": "7006539182", "AffiliationID": "60011170", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Chemistry, Fimlab Laboratories, University of Tampere School of Medicine"}, "6603344962": {"Name": "Vaahtoranta-Lehtonen H.", "AuthorID": "6603344962", "AffiliationID": "60025765", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, Turku University Hospital"}, "6505819732": {"Name": "Juonala M.", "AuthorID": "6505819732", "AffiliationID": "60025765", "AffiliationName": "Division of Medicine, Turku University Hospital"}}}
