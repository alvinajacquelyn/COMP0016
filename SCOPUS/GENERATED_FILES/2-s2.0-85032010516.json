Clinical research on this educational practice focuses on its realism, defined as a property of simulation technology. We treat realism as a function of subjective but collectively organized perception and imbued with fantasy, which we define by drawing on Lacanian studies of virtual reality and workplace organization. Data from an observational study of four simulation centres in London teaching hospitals is drawn on to present an account of what was taught and learned about medicine, including medical failure, when medical practice was simulated.", "AuthorKeywords": ["fantasy", "medical education", "simulation", "technology", "virtual reality", "work"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85032010516", "SubjectAreas": [["Social Psychology", "PSYC", "3207"], ["Health (social science)", "SOCI", "3306"], ["Cultural Studies", "SOCI", "3316"], ["Applied Psychology", "PSYC", "3202"], ["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"]], "AuthorData": {"15069948400": {"Name": "Pelletier C.", "AuthorID": "15069948400", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "Department of Lifelong and Comparative Education, Institute of Education, University of London"}, "7004625073": {"Name": "Kneebone R.", "AuthorID": "7004625073", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery and Cancer, Imperial College, Clinical Skills Centre"}}}
