Increased availability of RMRP mutation screening has uncovered a number of infants with significant immunodeficiency but only mild or absent skeletal features. We surveyed the clinical and immunological phenotype of children who have undergone allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation for this condition in the UK. Methods: Thirteen patients with confirmed RMRP mutations underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) at two nationally commissioned centres using a variety of donors and conditioning regimens. Records were retrospectively reviewed. Results: Median time from clinical presentation to diagnosis was 12 months (range 1 to 276 months), with three infants diagnosed with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) without radiographical manifestations of CHH. A total of 17 allogeneic procedures were performed on 13 patients including two stem-cell top-ups. The median age at transplant was 32.4 months (range 1.5 to 125 months). Of the eleven surviving patients, median follow-up was 50 months (range 21.6 to 168 months). Conclusions: RMRP mutations can cause short stature and significant immunodeficiency which can be corrected by allogeneic SCT and the diagnosis should be considered even in the absence of skeletal manifestations.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Allogeneic stem cell transplantation", "cartilage hair hypoplasia", "immunodeficiencies", "metaphyseal chondrodysplasia", "variable phenotype"], "IndexKeywords": ["Alleles", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Genotype", "Graft vs Host Disease", "Hair", "Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation", "Hirschsprung Disease", "Humans", "Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes", "Immunophenotyping", "Infant", "Infant, Newborn", "Lymphocyte Subsets", "Male", "Mutation", "Osteochondrodysplasias", "Phenotype", "RNA, Long Noncoding", "Severity of Illness Index", "Siblings", "Transplantation Chimera", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84925507976", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"]], "AuthorData": {"55601754300": {"Name": "Ip W.", "AuthorID": "55601754300", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Molecular and Cellular Immunology Section, UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "7003891382": {"Name": "Gaspar H.B.", "AuthorID": "7003891382", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Immunology, Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "25932742800": {"Name": "Davies E.G.", "AuthorID": "25932742800", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Immunology, Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "11739326500": {"Name": "Qasim W.", "AuthorID": "11739326500", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Immunology, Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "57207559231": {"Name": "Kleta R.", "AuthorID": "57207559231", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60032819", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Nephrology University College London, Royal Free Hospital"}, "56642753900": {"Name": "Chanudet E.", "AuthorID": "56642753900", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Translational Omics-GOSgene, Institute of Child Health, University College"}, "6507375825": {"Name": "Bacchelli C.", "AuthorID": "6507375825", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Translational Omics-GOSgene, Institute of Child Health, University College"}, "56511522000": {"Name": "Pitts A.", "AuthorID": "56511522000", "AffiliationID": "60026712, 60006222", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cellular Medicine, Newcastle University"}, "15820973300": {"Name": "Nademi Z.", "AuthorID": "15820973300", "AffiliationID": "60024240", "AffiliationName": "Bone Marrow Transplant Unit, Royal Victoria Infirmary, Great North Children\u2019s Hospital"}, "6507443729": {"Name": "Slatter M.A.", "AuthorID": "6507443729", "AffiliationID": "60024240", "AffiliationName": "Bone Marrow Transplant Unit, Royal Victoria Infirmary, Great North Children\u2019s Hospital"}, "7003820184": {"Name": "Gennery A.R.", "AuthorID": "7003820184", "AffiliationID": "60024240", "AffiliationName": "Bone Marrow Transplant Unit, Royal Victoria Infirmary, Great North Children\u2019s Hospital"}, "6602889677": {"Name": "Amrolia P.", "AuthorID": "6602889677", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Bone Marrow Transplantation Department, Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "57218180806": {"Name": "Rao K.", "AuthorID": "57218180806", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Bone Marrow Transplantation Department, Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "57203102921": {"Name": "Veys P.", "AuthorID": "57203102921", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Bone Marrow Transplantation Department, Great Ormond Street Hospital"}}}
