Systems modelling techniques are applied to model the lobby area of the site, and to guide data collection to situate the model. Managers at the site were consulted during preference elicitation to identify meaningful model parameters. Direct observation of regular employee behaviours from pre-recorded CCTV footage provided localised data: 1800 sequences of behaviour events were logged over one working day for approximately 600 employees and visitors. This included responses to security events, such as returning to the card reader or moving to a diferent turnstile. Model results showed that if one turnstile was implemented at the observed site, an average of 0.5 seconds would be added to individual entry times for employees, amounting to over sixty hours for the site as a whole over a year. Three turnstiles approach the time cost of a secure door.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Data collection", "Direct observations", "Model parameters", "Model results", "Physical security", "Preference elicitation", "Security events", "Systems modelling"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85030568471", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Human-Computer Interaction", "COMP", "1709"], ["Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition", "COMP", "1707"], ["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"]], "AuthorData": {"56235823000": {"Name": "Caulfield T.", "AuthorID": "56235823000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "19640579100": {"Name": "Parkin S.", "AuthorID": "19640579100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
