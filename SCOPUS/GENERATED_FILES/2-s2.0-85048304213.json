Illustrative results show that, OTSS can provide extremely better performance in latency and blocking probability than conventional flexi-grid optical networks.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Low latency", "Smart Grid Communications", "Time slice"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85048304213", "SubjectAreas": [["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"], ["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"]], "AuthorData": {"56447730500": {"Name": "Zhong Z.", "AuthorID": "56447730500", "AffiliationID": "60025278, 60104026", "AffiliationName": "Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology (TNList), Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University"}, "8930261300": {"Name": "Hua N.", "AuthorID": "8930261300", "AffiliationID": "60025278, 60104026", "AffiliationName": "Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology (TNList), Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University"}, "57192533245": {"Name": "Li Y.", "AuthorID": "57192533245", "AffiliationID": "60025278, 60104026", "AffiliationName": "Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology (TNList), Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University"}, "7404091480": {"Name": "Zheng X.", "AuthorID": "7404091480", "AffiliationID": "60025278, 60104026", "AffiliationName": "Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology (TNList), Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University"}, "57190755812": {"Name": "Liu Z.", "AuthorID": "57190755812", "AffiliationID": "118006979", "AffiliationName": "State Grid Information and Telecommunication Group Co., LTD."}, "55718709600": {"Name": "Li W.", "AuthorID": "55718709600", "AffiliationID": "118006979", "AffiliationName": "State Grid Information and Telecommunication Group Co., LTD."}}}
