We aimed to investigate the associations of maternal preeclampsia, gestational hypertension, and maternal blood pressure change in pregnancy with offspring cardiac structure and function in adolescence. Methods and Results-Using data from a prospective birth cohort study, we included offspring who underwent echocardiography (mean age, 17.7 years; SD, 0.3; N=1592). We examined whether hypertensive disorders of pregnancy were associated with offspring cardiac structure and systolic/diastolic function using linear regression. Using multilevel linear spline models (measurement occasions within women), we also investigated whether rate of maternal systolic/diastolic blood pressure change during pregnancy (weeks 8-18, 18-30, 30-36, and 36 or more) were associated with offspring outcomes. Main models were typically adjusted for maternal age, offspring age and sex, prepregnancy body mass index, parity, glycosuria/diabetes mellitus, education, and maternal smoking. Exposure to maternal preeclampsia (0.025; 95% CI, 0.008-0.043) and gestational hypertension (0.010; 0.002-0.017) were associated with greater relative wall thickness. Furthermore, preeclampsia was also associated with a smaller left ventricular end-diastolic volume (-9.0 mL; -15 to -3.1). No associations were found between hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and offspring cardiac function. Positive rate of maternal systolic blood pressure change during weeks 8 to 18 was associated with greater offspring left ventricular end-diastolic volume, left ventricular mass indexed to height2.7, and E/A. Conclusions-Adolescent offspring exposed to maternal preeclampsia had greater relative wall thickness and reduced left ventricular end-diastolic volume, which could be early signs of concentric remodeling and affect future cardiac function as well as risk of cardiovascular disease.", "AuthorKeywords": ["ALSPAC", "Blood pressure", "Cohort study", "Concentric remodeling", "Echocardiography", "Epidemiology", "Hypertension", "Preeclampsia/pregnancy"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Blood Pressure", "Female", "Humans", "Hypertension, Pregnancy-Induced", "Hypertrophy, Left Ventricular", "Male", "Pre-Eclampsia", "Pregnancy", "Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects", "Prospective Studies", "Risk Factors", "Stroke", "Ventricular Dysfunction", "Ventricular Dysfunction, Left"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84995475935", "SubjectAreas": [["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"36174727000": {"Name": "Timpka S.", "AuthorID": "36174727000", "AffiliationID": "60118785, 60029170", "AffiliationName": "Genetic and Molecular Epidemiology Unit, Lund University Diabetes Center, Lund University"}, "7101842109": {"Name": "Franks P.W.", "AuthorID": "7101842109", "AffiliationID": "60032499, 60009982", "AffiliationName": "Harvard T.H Chan School of Public Health, Harvard University"}, "36105102100": {"Name": "Macdonald-Wallis C.", "AuthorID": "36105102100", "AffiliationID": "60020650, 60172455", "AffiliationName": "MRC Integrative Epidemiology at the University of Bristol, University of Bristol"}, "7102452820": {"Name": "Lawlor D.A.", "AuthorID": "7102452820", "AffiliationID": "60020650, 60172455", "AffiliationName": "MRC Integrative Epidemiology at the University of Bristol, University of Bristol"}, "55770838500": {"Name": "Fraser A.", "AuthorID": "55770838500", "AffiliationID": "60020650, 60172455", "AffiliationName": "MRC Integrative Epidemiology at the University of Bristol, University of Bristol"}, "7401765648": {"Name": "Hughes A.D.", "AuthorID": "7401765648", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}, "35412645300": {"Name": "Chaturvedi N.", "AuthorID": "35412645300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}}}
