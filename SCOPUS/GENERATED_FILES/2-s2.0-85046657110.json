The former case occurs for quadrangulations of self-dual type, and the zero-temperature critical point has central charge c=1. The latter case occurs for quadrangulations of non-self-dual type, and the critical point belongs to the universality class of the three-state Potts ferromagnet. We have tested this criterion against high-precision computations on four lattices of each type, with very good agreement. We have also found that the Wang-Swendsen-Koteck\u00fd algorithm has no critical slowing-down in the former case, and critical slowing-down in the latter.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Antiferromagnets", "Critical slowing down", "Ferromagnets", "Finite temperatures", "High precision computation", "Quadrangulation", "Universality class", "Zero-temperature critical points"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85046657110", "SubjectAreas": [["Statistical and Nonlinear Physics", "PHYS", "3109"], ["Statistics and Probability", "MATH", "2613"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"]], "AuthorData": {"24734112200": {"Name": "Lv J.P.", "AuthorID": "24734112200", "AffiliationID": "118727149", "AffiliationName": "Anhui Province Key Laboratory of Optoelectric Materials Science and Technology"}, "7401531535": {"Name": "Deng Y.", "AuthorID": "7401531535", "AffiliationID": "60019118, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "CAS, Center for Excellence and Synergetic Innovation Center in Quantum Information and Quantum Physics, University of Science and Technology of China"}, "7202610067": {"Name": "Jacobsen J.L.", "AuthorID": "7202610067", "AffiliationID": "60019615, 60106131", "AffiliationName": "Institut de Physique Th\u00e9orique, CEA Saclay"}, "7201384106": {"Name": "Salas J.", "AuthorID": "7201384106", "AffiliationID": "60001741, 60000580", "AffiliationName": "Grupo de Teor\u00edas de Campos y F\u00edsica Estad\u00edstica, Instituto Gregorio Mill\u00e1n, UC3M, Unidad Asociada Al IEM-CSIC"}, "7003946479": {"Name": "Sokal A.D.", "AuthorID": "7003946479", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University College London"}}}
