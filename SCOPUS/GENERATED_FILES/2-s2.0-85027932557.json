KGaA, Weinheim.We report the incorporation of graphene-oxide quantum dots (GOQDs) into films, diluted solutions, and light-emitting diodes (LEDs) as part of a water-soluble derivative of poly(p-phenylene vinylene), or PDV.Li, to investigate their impact on the light-emission properties of this model conjugated polymer. Despite the well-known ability of graphene and graphene oxide to quench the photoluminescence of nearby emitters, we find that the addition of GOQDs to diluted solutions of PDV.Li does not significantly affect the photoluminescence (PL) dynamics of PDV.Li, bringing about only a modest quenching of the PL. However, loading the polymer with GOQDs led to a substantial decrease in the turn-on voltage of LEDs based on GOQD-PDV.Li composites. This effect can be attributed to either the improved morphology of the host polymer, resulting in an increase in the charge mobility, or the enhanced injection through GOQDs near the electrodes.", "AuthorKeywords": ["blends", "graphene", "LEDs", "photophysics", "rotaxanes"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85027932557", "SubjectAreas": [["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"]], "AuthorData": {"16028777700": {"Name": "Li P.", "AuthorID": "16028777700", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "London Centre for Nanotechnology, Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "55845430900": {"Name": "Di Stasio F.", "AuthorID": "55845430900", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "London Centre for Nanotechnology, Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "8644567300": {"Name": "Fenwick O.", "AuthorID": "8644567300", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "London Centre for Nanotechnology, Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "7006071546": {"Name": "Cacialli F.", "AuthorID": "7006071546", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "London Centre for Nanotechnology, Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "14028212700": {"Name": "Eda G.", "AuthorID": "14028212700", "AffiliationID": "60017161", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, National University of Singapore"}, "9738751100": {"Name": "McDonnell S.O.", "AuthorID": "9738751100", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Oxford, Chemistry Research Laboratory"}, "7402165869": {"Name": "Anderson H.L.", "AuthorID": "7402165869", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Oxford, Chemistry Research Laboratory"}, "7006564716": {"Name": "Chhowalla M.", "AuthorID": "7006564716", "AffiliationID": "60119141", "AffiliationName": "Materials Science and Engineering, Rutgers University"}}}
