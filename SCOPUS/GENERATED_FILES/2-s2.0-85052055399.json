The E4 allele is a major genetic risk factor for the sporadic form of Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD), and studies of human brain and mouse models have revealed that E4 significantly exacerbates the deposition of amyloid beta (A). It has been suggested that this deposition could be attributed to the formation of soluble ApoE isoform\u2013specific ApoE\u2013A complexes. However, previous studies have reported conflicting results regarding the directionality and strength of those interactions. In this study, using a series of flow cytometry assays that maintain the physiological integrity of ApoE\u2013A complexes, we systematically assessed the association of A with ApoE2, E3, or E4. We used ApoE secreted from HEK cells or astrocytes overexpressing ApoE fused with a GFP tag. As a source of soluble A peptide, we used synthetic A40 or A42 or physiological A secreted from CHO cell lines overexpressing WT or V717F variant amyloid precursor protein (APP). We observed significant interactions between the different ApoE isoforms and A, with E4 interacting with A more strongly than the E2 and E3 isoforms. We also found subtle differences depending on the A type and the ApoE-producing cell type. In conclusion, these results indicate that the strength of the ApoE\u2013A association depends on the source of A or ApoE.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Amyloid betas", "Amyloid precursor proteins", "Apolipoprotein E (apoE)", "Apolipoproteins", "Extracellular environments", "Flow cytometry assays", "Genetic risks", "In-vitro assays", "Amyloid beta-Peptides", "Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor", "Animals", "Apolipoprotein E2", "Apolipoprotein E3", "Apolipoprotein E4", "Astrocytes", "Biological Assay", "Cell Lineage", "Flow Cytometry", "HEK293 Cells", "Humans", "In Vitro Techniques", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Transgenic", "Neurons", "Protein Isoforms"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85052055399", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"55212159900": {"Name": "Kara E.", "AuthorID": "55212159900", "AffiliationID": "60029929", "AffiliationName": "Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Research Laboratory, MassGeneral Institute for Neurodegenerative Disease"}, "57195611502": {"Name": "Marks J.D.", "AuthorID": "57195611502", "AffiliationID": "60029929", "AffiliationName": "Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Research Laboratory, MassGeneral Institute for Neurodegenerative Disease"}, "55814453900": {"Name": "Roe A.D.", "AuthorID": "55814453900", "AffiliationID": "60029929", "AffiliationName": "Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Research Laboratory, MassGeneral Institute for Neurodegenerative Disease"}, "56901244700": {"Name": "Commins C.", "AuthorID": "56901244700", "AffiliationID": "60029929", "AffiliationName": "Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Research Laboratory, MassGeneral Institute for Neurodegenerative Disease"}, "35069354700": {"Name": "Fan Z.", "AuthorID": "35069354700", "AffiliationID": "60029929", "AffiliationName": "Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Research Laboratory, MassGeneral Institute for Neurodegenerative Disease"}, "56866339800": {"Name": "Calvo-Rodriguez M.", "AuthorID": "56866339800", "AffiliationID": "60029929", "AffiliationName": "Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Research Laboratory, MassGeneral Institute for Neurodegenerative Disease"}, "17342934500": {"Name": "Wegmann S.", "AuthorID": "17342934500", "AffiliationID": "60029929", "AffiliationName": "Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Research Laboratory, MassGeneral Institute for Neurodegenerative Disease"}, "35770672700": {"Name": "Hudry E.", "AuthorID": "35770672700", "AffiliationID": "60029929", "AffiliationName": "Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Research Laboratory, MassGeneral Institute for Neurodegenerative Disease"}, "35351120600": {"Name": "Hyman B.T.", "AuthorID": "35351120600", "AffiliationID": "60029929", "AffiliationName": "Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Research Laboratory, MassGeneral Institute for Neurodegenerative Disease"}}}
