To test whether this process potentiates viral spread by activating signaling pathways, we developed an approach to analyze the phosphoproteome in infected and uninfected mixed-population T cells using differential metabolic labeling and mass spectrometry. We discovered HIV-1-induced activation of signaling networks during viral spread encompassing over 200 cellular proteins. Strikingly, pathways downstream of the T cell receptor were the most significantly activated, despite the absence of canonical antigen-dependent stimulation. The importance of this pathway was demonstrated by the depletion of proteins, and we show that HIV-1 Env-mediated cell-cell contact, the T cell receptor, and the Src kinase Lck were essential for signaling-dependent enhancement of viral dissemination. This study demonstrates that manipulation of signaling at immune cell contacts by HIV-1 is essential for promoting virus replication and defines a paradigm for antigen-independent T cell signaling.", "AuthorKeywords": ["HIV", "phosphoproteomics", "signaling", "synapse", "T cell", "TCR"], "IndexKeywords": ["Antigens, Viral", "HEK293 Cells", "HIV-1", "Humans", "Jurkat Cells", "Lymphocyte Activation", "Mass Spectrometry", "Microscopy, Fluorescence", "Phosphopeptides", "Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell", "Signal Transduction", "src-Family Kinases", "T-Lymphocytes", "Virus Internalization", "Virus Replication"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85010289447", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"57193882129": {"Name": "Len A.", "AuthorID": "57193882129", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London"}, "56454140900": {"Name": "Starling S.", "AuthorID": "56454140900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London"}, "55893002400": {"Name": "Shivkumar M.", "AuthorID": "55893002400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London"}, "8730584600": {"Name": "Jolly C.", "AuthorID": "8730584600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London"}}}
