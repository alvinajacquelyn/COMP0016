{"Title": "Quantitative evaluation of an information leaflet to increase prompt help-seeking for gynaecological cancer symptoms", "Year": 2016, "Source": "BMC Public Health", "Volume": "16", "Issue": 1, "Art.No": null, "PageStart": null, "PageEnd": null, "CitedBy": 5, "DOI": "10.1186/s12889-016-3032-y", "Link": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84978950495&origin=inward", "Abstract": "\u00a9 2016 Morris et al.Background: Provision of written information may improve awareness of cancer symptoms and encourage timely presentation in primary care. This study assessed changes in symptom knowledge, perceived barriers to help-seeking, anxiety and intention to seek help, following exposure to a leaflet to raise awareness of gynaecological cancer symptoms. Methods: Women (N = 484) completed questionnaires before and after reading the leaflet. The primary outcome was change in anticipated time to help-seeking for 12 symptoms. Changes in symptom knowledge, barriers and anxiety, and their association with prompt help-seeking were evaluated using Wilcoxon signed rank tests and logistic regression analyses. Results: After reading the leaflet, symptom knowledge increased (p < 0.001), and perceived barriers (p < 0.001) and anxiety (p = 0.008) decreased. The number of symptoms for which women anticipated seeking help promptly increased (p < 0.001). Changes in knowledge (OR 4.21, 95 % CI 1.95-9.13) and perceived barriers (OR 4.60, 95 % CI 1.91-11.04) were independently associated with increased help-seeking. Conclusion: Increased symptom knowledge and lowered perceived barriers were related to increased prompt anticipated help-seeking. This occurred without an increase in anxiety. This intervention is effective in altering knowledge, beliefs and help-seeking intentions for gynaecological cancer symptoms, at least in the short-term, and should be trialled in primary care.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Anxiety", "Barriers", "Early diagnosis", "Gynaecological cancer", "Help-seeking", "Knowledge", "Leaflet"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Early Diagnosis", "Female", "Genital Neoplasms, Female", "Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice", "Humans", "Middle Aged", "Pamphlets", "Patient Acceptance of Health Care", "Patient Education as Topic", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "United Kingdom", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84978950495", "SubjectAreas": [["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"16231392800": {"Name": "Morris M.", "AuthorID": "16231392800", "AffiliationID": "60031331, 60012754", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Research UK Cancer Survival Group, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "57190171204": {"Name": "Friedemann Smith C.", "AuthorID": "57190171204", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Health Behaviour Research Centre, University College London"}, "55338429600": {"Name": "Boxell E.", "AuthorID": "55338429600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Health Behaviour Research Centre, University College London"}, "7102146930": {"Name": "Wardle J.", "AuthorID": "7102146930", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Health Behaviour Research Centre, University College London"}, "8311204100": {"Name": "Simon A.", "AuthorID": "8311204100", "AffiliationID": "60025704", "AffiliationName": "Health Services Research, School of Health Sciences, City University London"}, "57191898211": {"Name": "Waller J.", "AuthorID": "57191898211", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Health Behaviour Research Centre, University College London"}}}
