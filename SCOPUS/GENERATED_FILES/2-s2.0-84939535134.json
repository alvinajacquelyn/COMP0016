A substantial amount of empirical evidence suggests that making sense of another's intentional and belief states (i.e. theory of mind) relies on exteroceptive (e.g. visual and auditory) and proprioceptive (i.e. motor) signals. Yet, despite its pivotal role in the guidance of behaviour, the role of the observer's interoceptive (visceral) processing in understanding another's internal states remains unexplored. Predicting and keeping track of interoceptive bodily states \u2013 which inform intentions and beliefs that guide behaviour \u2013 is one of the fundamental purposes of the human brain. In this paper, we will focus on the role of interoceptive predictions, prescribed by the free energy principle, in making sense of internal states that cause another's behaviour. We will discuss how multimodal expectations induced at deep (high) hierarchical levels \u2013 that necessarily entail interoceptive predictions \u2013 contribute to inference about others that is at the heart of theory of mind.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Emotion", "Expectation", "Free energy", "Intention", "Predictive processing"], "IndexKeywords": ["Comprehension", "Emotions", "Humans", "Intention", "Interoception", "Theory of Mind"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84939535134", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuropsychology and Physiological Psychology", "PSYC", "3206"], ["Experimental and Cognitive Psychology", "PSYC", "3205"], ["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"], ["Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)", "ARTS", "1201"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"]], "AuthorData": {"54885292500": {"Name": "Ondobaka S.", "AuthorID": "54885292500", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Sobell Department for Motor Neuroscience and Movement Disorders, University College London"}, "7006483714": {"Name": "Kilner J.", "AuthorID": "7006483714", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Sobell Department for Motor Neuroscience and Movement Disorders, University College London"}, "36080215500": {"Name": "Friston K.", "AuthorID": "36080215500", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Sobell Department for Motor Neuroscience and Movement Disorders, University College London"}}}
