There is little published on the implementation, evaluation, and effectiveness of meaningful peer engagement. This paper aims to describe and evaluate peer engagement in British Columbia from 2010-2014. Methods: A process evaluation framework specific to peer engagement was developed and used to assess progress made, lessons learned, and future opportunities under four domains: supportive environment, equitable participation, capacity building and empowerment, and improved programming and policy. The evaluation was conducted by reviewing primary and secondary qualitative data including focus groups, formal documents, and meeting minutes. Results: Peer engagement was an iterative process that increased and improved over time as a consequence of reflexive learning. Practical ways to develop trust, redress power imbalances, and improve relationships were crosscutting themes. Lack of support, coordination, and building on existing capacity were factors that could undermine peer engagement. Peers involved across the province reviewed and provided feedback on these results. Conclusion: Recommendations from this evaluation can be applied to other peer engagement initiatives in decision-making settings to improve relationships between peers and professionals and to ensure programs and policies are relevant and equitable.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Community engagement", "Harm reduction", "Health equity", "Peer engagement", "Process evaluation", "Public participation", "Substance use"], "IndexKeywords": ["British Columbia", "Community Health Services", "Harm Reduction", "Humans", "Peer Influence", "Program Evaluation", "Substance-Related Disorders"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84971393434", "SubjectAreas": [["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"55551111100": {"Name": "Greer A.", "AuthorID": "55551111100", "AffiliationID": "60010365", "AffiliationName": "School of Population and Public Health, University of British Columbia"}, "56012537600": {"Name": "Amlani A.", "AuthorID": "56012537600", "AffiliationID": "60012171", "AffiliationName": "BC Centre for Disease Control"}, "57189491115": {"Name": "Lacroix K.", "AuthorID": "57189491115", "AffiliationID": "116733280", "AffiliationName": "Society of Living Illicit Drug Users"}, "57189497047": {"Name": "Burmeister C.", "AuthorID": "57189497047", "AffiliationID": "60012171", "AffiliationName": "BC Centre for Disease Control"}, "7006242730": {"Name": "Buxton J.", "AuthorID": "7006242730", "AffiliationID": "60010365", "AffiliationName": "School of Population and Public Health, University of British Columbia"}, "25825267700": {"Name": "Luchenski S.", "AuthorID": "25825267700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Farr Institute of Health Informatics Research, University College London"}}}
