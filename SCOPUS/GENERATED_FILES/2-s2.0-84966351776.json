All rights reserved.U.K. guidelines for vaccinating HIV-infected adults against bacteria are based on limited data. We compared antibody responses between 211 HIV-infected and 73 HIV-uninfected adults vaccinated with pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV) and Haemophilus influenzae b/meningococcal C polysaccharide-tetanus toxoid glycoconjugate vaccine (Hib/MenC-TT). IgG responses to Hib/MenC-TT were not significantly different. PPV induced median IgGs >1.3 g/mL for 10/12 serotypes among HIV-uninfected participants and 5/12 in HIV-infected participants. HIV-uninfected adults had higher post-vaccination IgGs than HIV-infected adults for 4/12 serotypes (P < 0.001). Responses did not associate with CD4 count or viral suppression. In a U.K. HIV-infected population, Hib/MenC-TT induced similar responses to HIV-uninfected adults, whereas PPV induced poor responses.", "AuthorKeywords": ["bacteria", "Haemophilus influenzae b", "HIV", "meningococcus", "pneumococcus", "vaccines"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "AIDS-Related Opportunistic Infections", "Antibodies, Bacterial", "Bacterial Capsules", "Female", "Haemophilus Vaccines", "HIV Infections", "Humans", "Immunization", "Immunization Schedule", "Male", "Meningococcal Vaccines", "Pneumococcal Infections", "Pneumococcal Vaccines"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84966351776", "SubjectAreas": [["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"7005421287": {"Name": "MacLennan C.A.", "AuthorID": "7005421287", "AffiliationID": "60008936, 60026851, 60175818", "AffiliationName": "Jenner Institute, Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford"}, "57189227180": {"Name": "Faustini S.", "AuthorID": "57189227180", "AffiliationID": "60012191, 60026493", "AffiliationName": "HIV Services, Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham, University Hospitals Birmingham, NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7003983346": {"Name": "Drayson M.T.", "AuthorID": "7003983346", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Immunology Service, School of Immunity and Infection, College of Medicine and Dental Sciences, University of Birmingham"}, "12775899900": {"Name": "Richter A.", "AuthorID": "12775899900", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Immunology Service, School of Immunity and Infection, College of Medicine and Dental Sciences, University of Birmingham"}, "26022764100": {"Name": "Birtwistle J.", "AuthorID": "26022764100", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Immunology Service, School of Immunity and Infection, College of Medicine and Dental Sciences, University of Birmingham"}, "8580768100": {"Name": "Whitelegg A.", "AuthorID": "8580768100", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Immunology Service, School of Immunity and Infection, College of Medicine and Dental Sciences, University of Birmingham"}, "14016470500": {"Name": "Plant T.", "AuthorID": "14016470500", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Immunology Service, School of Immunity and Infection, College of Medicine and Dental Sciences, University of Birmingham"}, "37053923800": {"Name": "Hodson J.", "AuthorID": "37053923800", "AffiliationID": "60012191, 60026493", "AffiliationName": "HIV Services, Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham, University Hospitals Birmingham, NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57189219420": {"Name": "Chigiga J.", "AuthorID": "57189219420", "AffiliationID": "60012191, 60026493", "AffiliationName": "HIV Services, Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham, University Hospitals Birmingham, NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57189213956": {"Name": "Singo M.", "AuthorID": "57189213956", "AffiliationID": "60012191, 60026493", "AffiliationName": "HIV Services, Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham, University Hospitals Birmingham, NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57189223597": {"Name": "Walker-Haywood J.", "AuthorID": "57189223597", "AffiliationID": "60012191, 60026493", "AffiliationName": "HIV Services, Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham, University Hospitals Birmingham, NHS Foundation Trust"}, "36061126400": {"Name": "Mulugeta B.", "AuthorID": "36061126400", "AffiliationID": "60012191, 60026493", "AffiliationName": "HIV Services, Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham, University Hospitals Birmingham, NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57189222503": {"Name": "Masuka S.", "AuthorID": "57189222503", "AffiliationID": "60012191, 60026493", "AffiliationName": "HIV Services, Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham, University Hospitals Birmingham, NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57189218035": {"Name": "Mainey C.", "AuthorID": "57189218035", "AffiliationID": "60012191, 60026493", "AffiliationName": "HIV Services, Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham, University Hospitals Birmingham, NHS Foundation Trust"}, "6603023480": {"Name": "Manavi K.", "AuthorID": "6603023480", "AffiliationID": "60012191, 60026493", "AffiliationName": "HIV Services, Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham, University Hospitals Birmingham, NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
