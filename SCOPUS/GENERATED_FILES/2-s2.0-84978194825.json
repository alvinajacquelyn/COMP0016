Current devices however, generally utilize bespoke active systems to transmit large bandwidth signals. In this paper, a real-Time phase extraction method based on passive Wi-Fi radar is proposed for detecting the chest movements associated with a person breathing. Since the monitored movements are of low amplitude and small Doppler shift, this method uses the phase variation rather than traditional range-Doppler processing. The processing is based on time domain cross correlation, with the addition of a Hampel filter for outlier detection and removal. In this paper the basic passive Wi-Fi model and limitations of traditional cross ambiguity function for signs of life detection are first introduced. The phase extraction method is then described followed by experimental results and analysis. Detection of breathing for a stationary person is shown in both in-room and through wall scenarios using both the Wi-Fi beacon and data transmissions. This is believed to be the first demonstration of signs of life detection using phase extraction in passive radar and extends the capability of such systems into a wide range of new applications.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Beacon Signal Detection", "Breathing Detection", "Passive Wi-Fi Radar", "Phase Extraction", "Real Time", "Through-Wall"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cross correlations", "Cross-ambiguity function", "Disaster situations", "Non contact devices", "Outlier Detection", "Phase extraction", "Real time", "Through walls"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84978194825", "SubjectAreas": [["Signal Processing", "COMP", "1711"], ["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"], ["Instrumentation", "PHYS", "3105"]], "AuthorData": {"56939438700": {"Name": "Chen Q.", "AuthorID": "56939438700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Security and Crime Science, University College London"}, "34867832000": {"Name": "Chetty K.", "AuthorID": "34867832000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Security and Crime Science, University College London"}, "7003652416": {"Name": "Woodbridge K.", "AuthorID": "7003652416", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Security and Crime Science, University College London"}, "56342423200": {"Name": "Tan B.", "AuthorID": "56342423200", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University of Bristol"}}}
