We present outcomes following the use of vein-preserving (VP) surgical techniques, notably the sheath exchange for tunneled lines (SETL). Materials and Methods A retrospective, single observer analysis of a prospectively maintained departmental logbook as well as the medical records of patients. Two broad groups of central line replacements were identified; those inserted following removal of a previous line and a traditional plastic-free (PF) period and those exchanged without such an interval. Results Overall, 19 lines were directly exchanged during the study period and compared with 34 inserted after a PF period. Similar catheter life spans and infection rates were demonstrated in each group; 125 (range, 78-173) days in VP exchanges versus 122 (range, 70-175) days in PF replacements (p = 0.41). Line Sepsis resulting in removal or change of line occurred at 103 (range, 60-147) days in VP group versus 104 (range, 45-164) days in PF (p = 0.73). Conclusion For children with critical venous access requirements, direct line exchange procedures are a robust and reproducible means of vein preservation. The outcomes compare favorably with those following the more traditional removal, a PF period and reinsertion.", "AuthorKeywords": ["central venous access", "infection", "line exchange", "vein preservation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Catheter-Related Infections", "Catheterization, Central Venous", "Catheters, Indwelling", "Central Venous Catheters", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Female", "Humans", "Infant", "Male", "Retrospective Studies", "Sepsis"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84980002278", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"]], "AuthorData": {"56780896700": {"Name": "Davidson J.", "AuthorID": "56780896700", "AffiliationID": "60021923", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Surgery, King's College Hospital"}, "36898488600": {"Name": "Paul A.", "AuthorID": "36898488600", "AffiliationID": "60021923", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Surgery, King's College Hospital"}, "8251546200": {"Name": "Patel S.", "AuthorID": "8251546200", "AffiliationID": "60021923", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Surgery, King's College Hospital"}, "7101990915": {"Name": "Davenport M.", "AuthorID": "7101990915", "AffiliationID": "60021923", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Surgery, King's College Hospital"}, "6602748899": {"Name": "Ade-Ajayi N.", "AuthorID": "6602748899", "AffiliationID": "60021923", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Surgery, King's College Hospital"}}}
