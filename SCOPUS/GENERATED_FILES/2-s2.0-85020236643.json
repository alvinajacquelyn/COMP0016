This phenomenon is known as the Urban Heat Island (UHI), and this paper introduces a methodology to investigate the spatial variability of air and surface temperatures across London. In particular, this study aims to investigate if a widely used spatial resolution (1 km) is appropriate for heat-related health risk studies. Data from vehicle-transect and ASTER thermal images were overlaid on a reference grid of 1 km, used by UHI simulation models. The results showed higher variability of air temperature within some specific modelled grid cells in the city centre, while surface temperatures presented higher variability in the London borders. This investigation suggests that LST has larger variation levels and more grid cells with sub-grid variation above 1\u00b0C compared to air temperature measurements.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Air temperature", "Air temperature measurement", "Reference grids", "Spatial resolution", "Spatial variability", "Surface temperatures", "Thermal images", "Urban heat island"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85020236643", "SubjectAreas": [["Signal Processing", "COMP", "1711"], ["Urban Studies", "SOCI", "3322"], ["Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law", "ENVI", "2308"], ["Instrumentation", "PHYS", "3105"]], "AuthorData": {"57194448132": {"Name": "Dos Santos R.S.", "AuthorID": "57194448132", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Bartlett Institute for Environmental Design and Engineering, University College London"}, "7405402740": {"Name": "Taylor J.", "AuthorID": "7405402740", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Bartlett Institute for Environmental Design and Engineering, University College London"}, "57202098246": {"Name": "Davies M.", "AuthorID": "57202098246", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Bartlett Institute for Environmental Design and Engineering, University College London"}, "35077188000": {"Name": "Mavrogianni A.", "AuthorID": "35077188000", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Bartlett Institute for Environmental Design and Engineering, University College London"}, "14421319200": {"Name": "Milner J.", "AuthorID": "14421319200", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Social and Environmental Health Research, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}}}
