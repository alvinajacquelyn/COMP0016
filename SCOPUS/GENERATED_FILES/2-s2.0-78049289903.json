Currently, however, the mechanisms that regulate the number of GABAARs at synapses remain poorly understood. By imaging superecliptic pHluorin tagged GABAAR subunits we show that synaptic GABAAR clusters are normally stable, but that increased neuronal activity upon glutamate receptor (GluR) activation results in their rapid and reversible dispersal. This dispersal correlates with increases in the mobility of single GABAARs within the clusters as determined using single-particle tracking of GABAARs labeled with quantum dots. GluR-dependent dispersal of GABAAR clusters requires Ca2+ influx via NMDA receptors (NMDARs) and activation of the phosphatase calcineurin. Moreover, the dispersal of GABAAR clusters and increased mobility of individual GABAARs are dependent on serine 327 within the intracellular loop of the GABAAR \u03b32 subunit. Thus, NMDAR signaling, via calcineurin and a key GABAAR phosphorylation site, controls the stability of synaptic GABAARs,with important implications for activity-dependent control of synaptic inhibition and neuronal plasticity.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Calcineurin", "Diffusion", "Ion channels", "Plasticity", "Trafficking"], "IndexKeywords": ["Amino Acid Substitution", "Animals", "Calcineurin", "Calcium Signaling", "Cells, Cultured", "Glutamic Acid", "Multiprotein Complexes", "Mutagenesis, Site-Directed", "Neuronal Plasticity", "Neurons", "Rats", "Receptors, GABA-A", "Receptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate", "Recombinant Fusion Proteins", "Serine", "Signal Transduction", "Synapses", "Transfection"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-78049289903", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"26029983000": {"Name": "Muir J.", "AuthorID": "26029983000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Mathematics and Physics in the Life Sciences and Experimental Biology, University College London"}, "8834053300": {"Name": "Arancibia-Carcamo I.L.", "AuthorID": "8834053300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Physiology, and Pharmacology, University College London"}, "8409224100": {"Name": "MacAskill A.F.", "AuthorID": "8409224100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Physiology, and Pharmacology, University College London"}, "56638739200": {"Name": "Smith K.R.", "AuthorID": "56638739200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Physiology, and Pharmacology, University College London"}, "7102315993": {"Name": "Kittler J.T.", "AuthorID": "7102315993", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Physiology, and Pharmacology, University College London"}, "7102753156": {"Name": "Griffin L.D.", "AuthorID": "7102753156", "AffiliationID": "60176024", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}}}
