Despite extensive study of these exemplary deep-marine clastic successions, there has been no comprehensive chronostratigraphic framework that provides primary ages for the submarine fan and related deposits. Here, we present a new composite basin stratigraphy based upon biostratigraphic analyses of the Upper Hecho Group submarine-fan and interfan deposits. Calcareous nannofossil data suggest that deposition of the Gerbe through to Guaso systems occurred during biozones NP14-16 (42.6 and 48.9. Ma based on our age model). Additional biostratigraphic ages from the Lower Hecho Group suggest that the entire Hecho Group no older than biozone NP13 (~. 51. Ma). The improved chronostratigraphic control enables correlations between submarine canyons and submarine-fans of the Ainsa and Jaca basins to be assessed. Our new age model provides a means of comparison of stratigraphic events with regional sections allowing a better understanding of the lateral and temporal evolution of these depositional systems from source-to-sink.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Ainsa Basin", "Biostratigraphy", "Eocene", "Hecho Group", "Larger benthic foraminifera", "Nannofossil"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84925196685", "SubjectAreas": [["Earth and Planetary Sciences (all)", "EART", "1900"]], "AuthorData": {"35622573500": {"Name": "Scotchman J.", "AuthorID": "35622573500", "AffiliationID": "112579039", "AffiliationName": "Neftex Petroleum Consultants"}, "6701346236": {"Name": "Bown P.", "AuthorID": "6701346236", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, University College London (UCL)"}, "7005054236": {"Name": "Pickering K.", "AuthorID": "7005054236", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, University College London (UCL)"}, "6603431289": {"Name": "BouDagher-Fadel M.", "AuthorID": "6603431289", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, University College London (UCL)"}, "34972829400": {"Name": "Bayliss N.", "AuthorID": "34972829400", "AffiliationID": "60021814", "AffiliationName": "ExxonMobil Production Company"}, "35622470200": {"Name": "Robinson S.", "AuthorID": "35622470200", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, University of Oxford"}}}
