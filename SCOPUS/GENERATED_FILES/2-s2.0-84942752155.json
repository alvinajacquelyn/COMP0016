In particular, it argues for vertical geographies that encompass more than issues of security and segregation and are not necessarily framed by the three-dimensional politics of Israel/Palestine identified by some commentators. In opening up a wider world of vertical urbanisms, the paper outlines three key approaches: close attention to where urban verticality is theorised and the relationship between power and height, the importance of ethnographic detail to emphasise more everyday verticalities and disrupt top-down analytical perspectives, and geographical imaginations that carefully attend to the myriad spatial entanglements of the three-dimensional city.", "AuthorKeywords": ["mobile urbanisms", "ordinary cities", "topology", "verticality", "volume"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84942752155", "SubjectAreas": [["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"]], "AuthorData": {"7404039943": {"Name": "Harris A.", "AuthorID": "7404039943", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
