As a part of this study, a new forcefield was developed for use in studying boron carbide materials. Impact scenarios in boron carbide were simulated in order to investigate the exceptional resistance of this material, and other icosahedral boron solids, to high-energy impact events. It was observed that interstitial defects created by radiative impacts are likely to be quenched locally, utilizing the high substitutional disorder of chains and cages in the boron carbide structure, rather than via impacted atoms recombining with their vacated lattice site.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Boron carbide", "DFT", "Molecular dynamics", "Radiation damage"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84995511413", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"], ["Computational Theory and Mathematics", "COMP", "1703"]], "AuthorData": {"55549900400": {"Name": "Sugden I.", "AuthorID": "55549900400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Chemistry Department"}, "7404519536": {"Name": "Bell R.", "AuthorID": "7404519536", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Chemistry Department"}, "14042342200": {"Name": "Plant D.", "AuthorID": "14042342200", "AffiliationID": "60020573", "AffiliationName": "AWE"}}}
