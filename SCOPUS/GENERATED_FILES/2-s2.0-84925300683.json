However, well-conducted quasi-experimental studies can provide strong evidence for causal inference. With this article, we aim to stimulate and inform discussions on including quasi-experiments in systematic reviews of health systems research. We define quasi-experimental studies as those that estimate causal effect sizes using exogenous variation in the exposure of interest that is not directly controlled by the researcher. We incorporate this definition into a non-hierarchical three-class taxonomy of study designs - experiments, quasi-experiments, and non-experiments. Based on a review of practice in three disciplines related to health systems research (epidemiology, economics, and political science), we discuss five commonly used study designs that fit our definition of quasi-experiments: natural experiments, instrumental variable analyses, regression discontinuity analyses, interrupted times series studies, and difference studies including controlled before-and-after designs, difference-in-difference designs and fixed effects analyses of panel data. We further review current practices regarding quasi-experimental studies in three non-health fields that utilize systematic reviews (education, development, and environment studies) to inform the design of approaches for synthesizing quasi-experimental evidence in health systems research. Ultimately, the aim of any review is practical: to provide useful information for policymakers, practitioners, and researchers. Future work should focus on building a consensus among users and producers of systematic reviews regarding the inclusion of quasi-experiments.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Difference-in-difference studies", "Instrumental variable analysis", "Interrupted time series", "Quasi-experimental studies", "Regression discontinuity designs", "Systematic reviews"], "IndexKeywords": ["Evidence-Based Practice", "Health Services Research", "Regression Analysis", "Research Design", "Review Literature as Topic"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84925300683", "SubjectAreas": [["Health Policy", "MEDI", "2719"]], "AuthorData": {"24830976900": {"Name": "Rockers P.C.", "AuthorID": "24830976900", "AffiliationID": "60019674", "AffiliationName": "Center for Global Health and Development, Boston University"}, "7003529676": {"Name": "R\u00f8ttingen J.A.", "AuthorID": "7003529676", "AffiliationID": "60009982", "AffiliationName": "Harvard Global Health Institute, Harvard University"}, "23011726900": {"Name": "B\u00e4rnighausen T.", "AuthorID": "23011726900", "AffiliationID": "60010499, 60138826", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Trust Africa Centre for Health and Population Studies, University of KwaZulu-Natal"}, "6508202986": {"Name": "Shemilt I.", "AuthorID": "6508202986", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Behavior and Health Research Unit, University of Cambridge"}, "35374403700": {"Name": "Tugwell P.", "AuthorID": "35374403700", "AffiliationID": "60028897", "AffiliationName": "Department and Epidemiology and Community Health, University of Ottawa"}}}
