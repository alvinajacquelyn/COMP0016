All rights reserved.Parkinson's disease is a complex heterogeneous disorder with urgent need for disease-modifying therapies. Progress in successful therapeutic approaches for PD will require an unprecedented level of collaboration. At a workshop hosted by Parkinson's UK and co-organized by Critical Path Institute's (C-Path) Coalition Against Major Diseases (CAMD) Consortiums, investigators from industry, academia, government and regulatory agencies agreed on the need for sharing of data to enable future success. Government agencies included EMA, FDA, NINDS/NIH and IMI (Innovative Medicines Initiative). Emerging discoveries in new biomarkers and genetic endophenotypes are contributing to our understanding of the underlying pathophysiology of PD. In parallel there is growing recognition that early intervention will be key for successful treatments aimed at disease modification. At present, there is a lack of a comprehensive understanding of disease progression and the many factors that contribute to disease progression heterogeneity. Novel therapeutic targets and trial designs that incorporate existing and new biomarkers to evaluate drug effects independently and in combination are required. The integration of robust clinical data sets is viewed as a powerful approach to hasten medical discovery and therapies, as is being realized across diverse disease conditions employing big data analytics for healthcare. The application of lessons learned from parallel efforts is critical to identify barriers and enable a viable path forward. A roadmap is presented for a regulatory, academic, industry and advocacy driven integrated initiative that aims to facilitate and streamline new drug trials and registrations in Parkinson's disease.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Collaboration", "Data integration", "Data standards", "Privacy", "Quantitative disease progression", "Regulatory science"], "IndexKeywords": ["Biomarkers", "Clinical Trials as Topic", "Drug Discovery", "Humans", "Information Dissemination", "Parkinson Disease", "Research Design"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84941793151", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"]], "AuthorData": {"7202648428": {"Name": "Stephenson D.", "AuthorID": "7202648428", "AffiliationID": "114883215", "AffiliationName": "Critical Path Institute, CAMD"}, "35068449000": {"Name": "Romero K.", "AuthorID": "35068449000", "AffiliationID": "114883215", "AffiliationName": "Critical Path Institute, CAMD"}, "55910185400": {"Name": "Avil\u00e9s E.", "AuthorID": "55910185400", "AffiliationID": "114883215", "AffiliationName": "Critical Path Institute, CAMD"}, "57189494530": {"Name": "Hu M.T.", "AuthorID": "57189494530", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60008323, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Nuffield Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Oxford, Neurology Department, John Radcliffe Hospital"}, "7005575001": {"Name": "Lovestone S.", "AuthorID": "7005575001", "AffiliationID": "60000940, 60002634", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, University of Oxford, Warneford Hospital"}, "7006315497": {"Name": "Breen K.", "AuthorID": "7006315497", "AffiliationID": "113202486", "AffiliationName": "Scientific Consultant"}, "26034521700": {"Name": "Burn D.", "AuthorID": "26034521700", "AffiliationID": "60026712, 60006222", "AffiliationName": "Henry Wellcome Building, Faculty of Medical Sciences, Newcastle University"}, "7006649063": {"Name": "Ben-Shlomo Y.", "AuthorID": "7006649063", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "University of Bristol"}, "53163307500": {"Name": "Bhattaram A.", "AuthorID": "53163307500", "AffiliationID": "60010237", "AffiliationName": "US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), New Hampshire Avenue"}, "7005150185": {"Name": "Isaac M.", "AuthorID": "7005150185", "AffiliationID": "108577905", "AffiliationName": "EMA"}, "16067601400": {"Name": "Venuto C.", "AuthorID": "16067601400", "AffiliationID": "60024746", "AffiliationName": "U of Rochester Medical Center"}, "57205791057": {"Name": "Kubota K.", "AuthorID": "57205791057", "AffiliationID": "60113050", "AffiliationName": "Michael J Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research"}, "57203050134": {"Name": "Little M.A.", "AuthorID": "57203050134", "AffiliationID": "60022195, 60014551", "AffiliationName": "Aston University and MIT, Aston University, Aston Triangle, Birmingham, Media Lab, Massachusetts Institute of Technology"}, "7007092262": {"Name": "Friend S.", "AuthorID": "7007092262", "AffiliationID": "60111926", "AffiliationName": "Sage Bionetworks"}, "7401534782": {"Name": "Morris H.R.", "AuthorID": "7401534782", "AffiliationID": "60020736", "AffiliationName": "Neurology, National Hospital for Neurology"}, "7005989891": {"Name": "Grosset D.", "AuthorID": "7005989891", "AffiliationID": "60001490", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neuroscience and Psychology, University of Glasgow"}, "56379733400": {"Name": "Sutherland M.", "AuthorID": "56379733400", "AffiliationID": "60013780", "AffiliationName": "National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), Neuroscience Center"}, "7005198349": {"Name": "Gallacher J.", "AuthorID": "7005198349", "AffiliationID": "60002634", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, University of Oxford Hospital"}, "13611624400": {"Name": "Williams-Gray C.", "AuthorID": "13611624400", "AffiliationID": "60120904, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Neurosciences, John Van Geest Centre for Brain Repair, University of Cambridge, E.D.
