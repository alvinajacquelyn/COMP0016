Oxidative addition of Bu3GeH to [Os3(CO)10(\u03bc-dppm)] at 110 \u00b0C affords [HOs3(CO)9(GeBu3)(\u03bc-dppm)] (1) which undergoes further decarbonylation upon prolonged heating to yield [H2Os3(CO)7(GeBu3){\u03bc3-Ph2PCH2P(Ph)C6H4}] (2) and [HOs3(CO)8(GeBu3)(\u03bc-GeBu2)(\u03bc-dppm)] (3). Control experiments confirm the bimodal formation of 2 and 3 from 1 during thermolysis. Cluster 2 reacts with additional Bu3GeH at 140 \u00b0C to give [Os3(CO)6(\u03bc-GeBu2)2{\u03bc3-PhP(C6H4)CH2P(Ph)C6H4}] (4), a thermolysis product also produced from 3. In contrast, oxidative addition of Bu3GeH to [HOs3(CO)8{\u03bc3-Ph2PCH2P(Ph)C6H4}] occurs at room temperature to afford [H2Os3(CO)8(GeBu3){\u03bc3-Ph2PCH2P(Ph)C6H4}] (5), which decarbonylates at 110 \u00b0C to yield 4. All new clusters have been characterized by elemental analyses and spectroscopic methods, and the molecular structures established by X-ray crystallography. Electronic structure calculations on the different hydride isomers based on 1 and 5 are reported.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bis(diphenylphosphino)methane (dppm)", "DFT", "Ge\u2013C bond cleavage", "Oxidative-addition of Ge\u2013H bond", "Tributylgermanium hydride", "Triosmium clusters"], "IndexKeywords": ["Bond cleavages", "Control experiments", "Decarbonylations", "Electronic structure calculations", "H-bonds", "Oxidative additions", "Spectroscopic method", "Triosmium clusters"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85070188196", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"], ["Organic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1605"], ["Inorganic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1604"], ["Materials Chemistry", "MATE", "2505"]], "AuthorData": {"57210284514": {"Name": "Roy P.", "AuthorID": "57210284514", "AffiliationID": "60029276", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Jahangirnagar University"}, "57210281915": {"Name": "Joy M.", "AuthorID": "57210281915", "AffiliationID": "60029276", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Jahangirnagar University"}, "24366466600": {"Name": "Ghosh S.", "AuthorID": "24366466600", "AffiliationID": "60029276", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Jahangirnagar University"}, "7006918410": {"Name": "Kabir S.", "AuthorID": "7006918410", "AffiliationID": "60029276", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Jahangirnagar University"}, "7005072839": {"Name": "Tocher D.", "AuthorID": "7005072839", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "7102128143": {"Name": "Nesterov V.", "AuthorID": "7102128143", "AffiliationID": "60024438", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of North Texas"}, "7103239169": {"Name": "Richmond M.", "AuthorID": "7103239169", "AffiliationID": "60024438", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of North Texas"}}}
