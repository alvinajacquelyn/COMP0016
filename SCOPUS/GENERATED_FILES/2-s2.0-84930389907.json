Data from 79 first-time parents and their children aged 8-13months, who were followed up in a two-wave, 1-year longitudinal study, were analysed within a multilevel structural equation modelling framework in order to account for within-couple interdependence. Results revealed that, as hypothesised, both parental self-criticism and dependency were associated with increased levels of relationship stress, which in turn were negatively related to child development. Hence, parental personality features in combination with relationship stress may be an important target in couple and family-based interventions. Implications for further research on family dynamics and interventions are discussed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Child development", "Family intervention", "Personality", "Relationship stress", "Stress generation"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84930389907", "SubjectAreas": [["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"]], "AuthorData": {"35325730100": {"Name": "Tang E.", "AuthorID": "35325730100", "AffiliationID": "60025063", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Psychology, KU Leuven"}, "57203069499": {"Name": "Luyten P.", "AuthorID": "57203069499", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London"}, "35323737000": {"Name": "Casalin S.", "AuthorID": "35323737000", "AffiliationID": "60025063", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Psychology, KU Leuven"}, "14033545400": {"Name": "Vliegen N.", "AuthorID": "14033545400", "AffiliationID": "60025063", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Psychology, KU Leuven"}}}
