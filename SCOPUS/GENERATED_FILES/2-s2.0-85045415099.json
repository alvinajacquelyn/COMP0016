Most research has employed quasi-static analysis methods that estimate heat loss metrics such as U-values, without taking advantage of the rich time series data that is often recorded. This paper presents a dynamic Bayesian-based method to estimate the thermophysical properties of building elements from in-situ measurements. The analysis includes Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) estimation, priors, uncertainty analysis, and model comparison to select the most appropriate model. Data from two case study dwellings is used to illustrate model performance; U-value estimates from the dynamic and static methods are within error estimates, with the dynamic model generally requiring much shorter time series than the static model. The dynamic model produced robust results at all times of year, including when the average indoor-to-outdoor temperature difference was low, when external temperatures had large daily variation, and measurements were subjected to direct solar radiation. Further, the probability distributions of parameters may provide insights into the thermal performance of elements. Dynamic methods such as that presented herein may enable wider characterisation of the performance of building elements as built, supporting work to reduce the performance gap.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bayesian statistics", "Dynamic modelling", "Heat transfer", "In-situ measurements", "Inverse modelling", "U-value", "Uncertainty analysis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Bayesian statistics", "Direct solar radiation", "Energy performance of buildings", "In-situ measurement", "Inverse modelling", "Markov chain Monte Carlo", "Performance of buildings", "U values"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85045415099", "SubjectAreas": [["Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment", "ENER", "2105"], ["Energy Engineering and Power Technology", "ENER", "2102"], ["Energy (miscellaneous)", "ENER", "2101"], ["Control and Optimization", "MATH", "2606"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"55871123100": {"Name": "Gori V.", "AuthorID": "55871123100", "AffiliationID": "60084282", "AffiliationName": "Physical Characterisation of Buildings Group, UCL Energy Institute"}, "57197676050": {"Name": "Biddulph P.", "AuthorID": "57197676050", "AffiliationID": "60084282", "AffiliationName": "Physical Characterisation of Buildings Group, UCL Energy Institute"}, "55756255300": {"Name": "Elwell C.A.", "AuthorID": "55756255300", "AffiliationID": "60084282", "AffiliationName": "Physical Characterisation of Buildings Group, UCL Energy Institute"}}}
