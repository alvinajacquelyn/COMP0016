Metal-organic framework (MOF) based proton conductors have received immense importance recently. The present study endeavors to design two post synthetically modified UiO-66-based MOFs and examines the effects of their structural differences on their proton conductivity. UiO-66-NH 2 is modified by reaction with sultones to prepare two homologous compounds, that is, PSM 1 and PSM 2, with SO 3 H functionalization in comparable extent (Zr:S = 2:1) in both. However, the pendant alkyl chain holding the -SO 3 H group is of different length. PSM 2 has longer alkyl chain attachment than PSM 1. This difference in the length of side arms results in a huge difference in proton conductivity of the two compounds. PSM 1 is observed to have the highest MOF-based proton conductivity (1.64 \u00d7 10 -1 S cm -1 ) at 80 \u00b0C, which is comparable to commercially available Nafion, while PSM 2 shows significantly lower conductivity (4.6 \u00d7 10 -3 S cm -1 ). Again, the activation energy for proton conduction is one of the lowest among all MOF-based proton conductors in the case of PSM 1, while PSM 2 requires larger activation energy (almost 3 times). This profound effect of variation of the chain length of the side arm by one carbon atom in the case of PSM 1 and PSM 2 was rather surprising and never documented before. This effect of the length of the side arm can be very useful to understand the proton conduction mechanism of MOF-based compounds and also to design better proton conductors. Besides, PSM 1 showed proton conductivity as high as 1.64 \u00d7 10 -1 S cm -1 at 80 \u00b0C, which is the highest reported value to date among all MOF-based systems. The lability of the -SO 3 H proton of the post synthetically modified UiO-66 MOFs has theoretically been determined by molecular electrostatic potential analysis and theoretical pK a calculation of models of functional sites along with relevant NBO analyses.", "AuthorKeywords": ["effect of chain length", "humidity-assisted proton conduction", "MOF", "post-synthetic modification", "superproton conductors"], "IndexKeywords": ["Homologous compounds", "Metal organic framework", "Molecular electrostatic potentials", "Postsynthetic modification", "Proton conduction", "Proton conduction mechanisms", "Structural differences", "Superprotonic conductor"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85064131580", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"]], "AuthorData": {"57208212906": {"Name": "Mukhopadhyay S.", "AuthorID": "57208212906", "AffiliationID": "60029516", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, University of Hyderabad"}, "36622728800": {"Name": "Debgupta J.", "AuthorID": "36622728800", "AffiliationID": "60029516", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, University of Hyderabad"}, "56722317400": {"Name": "Singh C.", "AuthorID": "56722317400", "AffiliationID": "60029516", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, University of Hyderabad"}, "56506501100": {"Name": "Sarkar R.", "AuthorID": "56506501100", "AffiliationID": "60029516", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, University of Hyderabad"}, "57189985790": {"Name": "Basu O.", "AuthorID": "57189985790", "AffiliationID": "60029516", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, University of Hyderabad"}, "55476992100": {"Name": "Das S.", "AuthorID": "55476992100", "AffiliationID": "60029516", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, University of Hyderabad"}}}
