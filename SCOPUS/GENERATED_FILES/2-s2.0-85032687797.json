In the thermal treatment, the Ag2S QDs react to produce Ag nanoparticles and ZnS. The metal nanoparticles act to shorten electron pathways and improve the connectivity of the matrix, and the partial sulfidation of the ZnO surface improves the cycling stability of the material. The electrochemical properties of ZnO@C, Ag2S QDs-treated ZnO@C, and the amorphous carbon in ZnO@C have been compared. The small weight ratio of Ag2S QDs to ZnO@C at 1:180 shows the best performance in lithium storage. The exhibited specific capacities are improved and retained remarkably in the cycling at high current rates. At low current densities (200 mA g-1), treatment of ZnO@C with Ag2S QDs results in a 38% increase in the specific capacity.", "AuthorKeywords": ["distorted MOFs", "lithium storage", "sulfidation", "ZnO", "ZnS"], "IndexKeywords": ["distorted MOFs", "High current rates", "Lithium storage properties", "Lithium storages", "Low current density", "Metal organic framework", "Specific capacities", "Sulfidation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85032687797", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"]], "AuthorData": {"55498690000": {"Name": "Song W.", "AuthorID": "55498690000", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials and Centre for Nanotechnology, Imperial College London"}, "57196344573": {"Name": "Brugge R.", "AuthorID": "57196344573", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials and Centre for Nanotechnology, Imperial College London"}, "55904995400": {"Name": "Theodorou I.G.", "AuthorID": "55904995400", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials and Centre for Nanotechnology, Imperial College London"}, "57196329035": {"Name": "Burgess C.H.", "AuthorID": "57196329035", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials and Centre for Nanotechnology, Imperial College London"}, "8954805500": {"Name": "Aguadero A.", "AuthorID": "8954805500", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials and Centre for Nanotechnology, Imperial College London"}, "36991679000": {"Name": "Xie F.", "AuthorID": "36991679000", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials and Centre for Nanotechnology, Imperial College London"}, "57213492423": {"Name": "Riley D.J.", "AuthorID": "57213492423", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials and Centre for Nanotechnology, Imperial College London"}, "57196345549": {"Name": "Lim A.L.", "AuthorID": "57196345549", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "24178516700": {"Name": "Shearing P.R.", "AuthorID": "24178516700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "13805905800": {"Name": "Brett D.J.L.", "AuthorID": "13805905800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "57196046471": {"Name": "Yang Y.", "AuthorID": "57196046471", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "57189444370": {"Name": "Zhao T.", "AuthorID": "57189444370", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "56559457100": {"Name": "Johnson I.D.", "AuthorID": "56559457100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}}}
