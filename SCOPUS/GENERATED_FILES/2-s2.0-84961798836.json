This research tested how in-group/out-group membership affected judgments of peers who deviated from social norms for weight and loyalty. Two hundred and forty 11\u201313-year-olds (49 percent female; 94 percent Caucasian) judged two in-group or out-group peers: one was normative (loyal and average weight) and the other was non-normative (i.e., \u2018deviant\u2019). The deviant target was overweight, disloyal to their own group (school), or both (\u2018doubly deviant\u2019). Derogation of overweight relative to average weight peers was greater if they were in-group rather than out-group members, revealing a strong \u2018black sheep effect\u2019 for overweight peers. Disloyal out-group deviants were judged favorably, but this effect was eliminated if they were doubly deviant, suggesting that their disloyalty was insufficient to overcome the overweight stigma. Consistent with developmental subjective group dynamics theory, effects of group membership and types of deviance on adolescents\u2019 favorability toward peers were mediated by adolescents\u2019 perceptions of how well the deviant members would \u2018fit\u2019 with the in-group school. Implications for theory and strategies to reduce peer exclusion, particularly weight stigmatization, are considered.", "AuthorKeywords": ["loyalty", "overweight stigma", "peer exclusion", "subjective group dynamics"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84961798836", "SubjectAreas": [["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"], ["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"], ["Social Sciences (miscellaneous)", "SOCI", "3301"]], "AuthorData": {"7101975318": {"Name": "Abrams D.", "AuthorID": "7101975318", "AffiliationID": "60010818", "AffiliationName": "University of Kent"}, "55992204800": {"Name": "Van de Vyver J.", "AuthorID": "55992204800", "AffiliationID": "60010818", "AffiliationName": "University of Kent"}, "57188582454": {"Name": "Guarella S.", "AuthorID": "57188582454", "AffiliationID": "60010818", "AffiliationName": "University of Kent"}, "56216193700": {"Name": "Purewal K.", "AuthorID": "56216193700", "AffiliationID": "60010818", "AffiliationName": "University of Kent"}, "50262839800": {"Name": "Palmer S.", "AuthorID": "50262839800", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Education"}, "57188594028": {"Name": "Hayes D.", "AuthorID": "57188594028", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College"}, "57188581956": {"Name": "Delaney K.", "AuthorID": "57188581956", "AffiliationID": "60111062", "AffiliationName": "Hertfordshire County Council"}}}
