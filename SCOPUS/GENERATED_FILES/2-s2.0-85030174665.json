Using a cornerstone result in lattice theory, we show that such transition systems can be modelled in two ways: as conditional transition systems (CTS) with a partial order on conditions, or as lattice transition systems (LaTS), where transitions are labelled with the elements from a distributive lattice. We define equivalent notions of bisimilarity for both variants and characterise them via a bisimulation game. We explain how conditional transition systems are related to featured transition systems for the modelling of software product lines. Furthermore, we show how to compute bisimilarity symbolically via BDDs by defining an operation on BDDs that approximates an element of a Boolean algebra into a lattice. We have implemented our procedure and provide runtime results.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Bisimilarity", "Bisimulation games", "Distributive lattice", "Partial order", "Run-time results", "Runtimes", "Software Product Line", "Transition system"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85030174665", "SubjectAreas": [["Computational Theory and Mathematics", "COMP", "1703"], ["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality", "ENGI", "2213"]], "AuthorData": {"44261040700": {"Name": "Beohar H.", "AuthorID": "44261040700", "AffiliationID": "60014264", "AffiliationName": "Universit\u00e4t Duisburg-Essen"}, "8850002700": {"Name": "K\u00f6nig B.", "AuthorID": "8850002700", "AffiliationID": "60014264", "AffiliationName": "Universit\u00e4t Duisburg-Essen"}, "56342440200": {"Name": "Kupper S.", "AuthorID": "56342440200", "AffiliationID": "60020621", "AffiliationName": "Fern Universit\u00e4t in Hagen"}, "23398564400": {"Name": "Silva A.", "AuthorID": "23398564400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
