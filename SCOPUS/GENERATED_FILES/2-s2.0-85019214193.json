However like all planar arrays, FP sensors suffer from the limited view problem. Here, a multi-angle FP sensor system is described that mitigates the partial view effects of a planar FP sensor while retaining its detection advantages. The possibility of improving data acquisition speed through the use of sub-sampling techniques is also explored. The capabilities of the system are demonstrated with 3D images of pre-clinical targets.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Data acquisition speed", "Element sizes", "Photo-acoustic imaging", "Photoacoustic image", "Planar arrays", "Sensor systems", "Spatial sampling", "Ultrasound sensor arrays"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85019214193", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Biomaterials", "MATE", "2502"], ["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"], ["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"35766450000": {"Name": "Ellwood R.", "AuthorID": "35766450000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "7102686951": {"Name": "Zhang E.", "AuthorID": "7102686951", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "7006238023": {"Name": "Beard P.", "AuthorID": "7006238023", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "7403198742": {"Name": "Cox B.", "AuthorID": "7403198742", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "52364146500": {"Name": "Lucka F.", "AuthorID": "52364146500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}}}
