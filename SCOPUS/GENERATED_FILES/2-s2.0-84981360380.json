FV system is used in the 3D visualisation of heart and diagnosis and prognosis of many cardiologic disorders including myocardial infarction, Brugada syndrome etc. However, cardiologists are accustomed to S12 system pertaining to its decades-old usage and widespread acceptability and hence, it is generally used as primary ECG acquisition system and state-of-the-art inverse Dower transform (DT) and affine transform (AT) are used to obtain FV system from S12 system. Here, we propose the acquisition of FV system and use PT to reconstruct S12 system from FV system. PhysioNet's PTB database after wavelet-based preprocessing to remove baseline wandering and noise has been used in this investigation. The personalised coefficients have been obtained using least-squares fit method and heart-vector projection theory and evaluation metrics used are R2 statistics, correlation and regression coefficients. Our proposed PT methodology has outperformed AT and DT by mean R2 values of 16.36% and 26.53%, respectively. For the practical application of the proposed system, we have investigated into the reusability of personalised coefficients which has been shown to outperform state-of-the-art AT and DT.", "AuthorKeywords": ["ECG", "Frank VCG system", "lead reconstruction", "personalised coefficients", "standard 12-lead system"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84981360380", "SubjectAreas": [["Computational Mechanics", "ENGI", "2206"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"], ["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"]], "AuthorData": {"55903260800": {"Name": "Maheshwari S.", "AuthorID": "55903260800", "AffiliationID": "60010126", "AffiliationName": "Electronics and Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati"}, "26326176500": {"Name": "Acharyya A.", "AuthorID": "26326176500", "AffiliationID": "60103917", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Hyderabad"}, "7101784080": {"Name": "Puddu P.", "AuthorID": "7101784080", "AffiliationID": "60032350", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiovascular Sciences, Sapienza University of Rome"}, "6602472548": {"Name": "Schiariti M.", "AuthorID": "6602472548", "AffiliationID": "60032350", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiovascular Sciences, Sapienza University of Rome"}, "35097627900": {"Name": "Mazomenos E.", "AuthorID": "35097627900", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "School of Electronics and Computer Science, University of Southampton"}, "55904125700": {"Name": "Maharatna K.", "AuthorID": "55904125700", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "School of Electronics and Computer Science, University of Southampton"}}}
