The prevalence and clinical correlates of depression were examined in a paediatric specialist OCD-clinic sample (N = 295; Mean = 15 [7 \u2013 18] years, 42 % female), using both dimensional (Beck Depression Inventory-youth; n = 261) and diagnostic (Development and Wellbeing Assessment; n = 127) measures of depression. The impact of depressive symptoms and suspected disorders on post-treatment OCD severity was examined in a sub-sample who received CBT, with or without SSRI medication (N = 100). Fifty-one per-cent of patients reported moderately or extremely elevated depressive symptoms and 26 % (95 % CI: 18 \u2013 34) met criteria for a suspected depressive disorder. Depressive symptoms and depressive disorders were associated with worse OCD symptom severity and global functioning prior to CBT. Individuals with depression were more likely to be female, have had a psychiatric inpatient admission and less likely to be attending school (ps < 0.01). OCD and depressive symptom severity significantly decreased after CBT. Depressive symptoms and depressive disorders predicted worse post-treatment OCD severity (\u03b2s = 0.19 and 0.26, ps < 0.05) but became non-significant when controlling for pre-treatment OCD severity (\u03b2s = 0.05 and 0.13, ns). Depression is common in paediatric OCD and is associated with more severe OCD and poorer functioning. However, depression severity decreases over the course of CBT for OCD and is not independently associated with worse outcomes, supporting the recommendation for treatment as usual in the presence of depressive symptoms.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cognitive-behavioural therapy", "Correlates", "Depression", "Obsessive-compulsive disorder", "Treatment outcomes"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Child", "Cognitive Therapy", "Comorbidity", "Depression", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder", "Prevalence", "Psychiatric Status Rating Scales", "Severity of Illness Index", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84930864402", "SubjectAreas": [["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"55498577100": {"Name": "Brown H.", "AuthorID": "55498577100", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Psychiatry, King\u2019s College"}, "16429683500": {"Name": "Lester K.", "AuthorID": "16429683500", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Psychiatry, King\u2019s College"}, "35275280100": {"Name": "Krebs G.", "AuthorID": "35275280100", "AffiliationID": "60028884", "AffiliationName": "OCD clinic, Michael Rutter Centre, South London and Maudsley NHS trust"}, "6503937463": {"Name": "Jassi A.", "AuthorID": "6503937463", "AffiliationID": "60028884", "AffiliationName": "OCD clinic, Michael Rutter Centre, South London and Maudsley NHS trust"}, "7003916653": {"Name": "Heyman I.", "AuthorID": "7003916653", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Child Health, University College London"}}}
