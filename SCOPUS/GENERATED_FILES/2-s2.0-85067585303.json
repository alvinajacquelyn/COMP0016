The International Parkinson's and Movement Disorder Society commissioned a task force to assess available clinical screening instruments and rating scales, including their clinimetric properties, make recommendations regarding their utility, and suggest future directions in scale development and validation. The literature was systematically searched for scales measuring a range of reported ICBs in PD. A scale was designated \u201crecommended\u201d if the scale had been employed in PD studies, been used beyond the group that developed it, and had adequate clinimetric data published for PD. Numerous diagnostic screening tools and severity rating scales were identified for a range of ICBs, including compulsive medication use, punding/hobbyism, walkabout, pathological gambling, hypersexuality, compulsive or binge eating, compulsive buying, reckless driving, compulsive exercise, pyromania, trichotillomania, hoarding, kleptomania, intermittent explosive disorder, and internet addiction. For screening across the range of ICBs (except compulsive medication use), the Questionnaire for Impulsive-Compulsive Disorders in Parkinson's disease (QUIP) and QUIP-Rating Scale (QUIP-RS) are recommended, and for severity rating across the range of ICBs the QUIP-RS and the Ardouin Scale of Behavior in Parkinson's Disease are recommended. The Scale for Outcomes in Parkinson's Disease\u2013Psychiatric Complications is recommended for rating of hypersexuality and the compulsive behaviors gambling/shopping. Further testing of established scales against gold standard diagnostic criteria is urgently required for all other individual ICBs in PD. \u00a9 2019 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society \u00a9 2019 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.", "AuthorKeywords": ["clinimetrics", "impulse control disorders", "Parkinson's disease", "rating scales", "reliability", "validity"], "IndexKeywords": ["Compulsive Behavior", "Disruptive, Impulse Control, and Conduct Disorders", "Humans", "Impulsive Behavior", "Parkinson Disease", "Psychiatric Status Rating Scales"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85067585303", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"7404357699": {"Name": "Evans A.H.", "AuthorID": "7404357699", "AffiliationID": "60005245", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, the Royal Melbourne Hospital"}, "15839814500": {"Name": "Okai D.", "AuthorID": "15839814500", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Kings College London, Institute of Psychiatry, Section of Cognitive Neuropsychiatry"}, "57203216133": {"Name": "Weintraub D.", "AuthorID": "57203216133", "AffiliationID": "60014232", "AffiliationName": "Parkinson's Disease and Mental Illness Research, Education and Clinical Centers (Philadelphia Parkinson's Disease Research, Education and Clinical Center (PADRECC) and Mental Illness Research Education Clinical, Centers of Excellence (MIRECC)), Philadelphia Veterans Affairs Medical Center"}, "14046922800": {"Name": "Lim S.Y.", "AuthorID": "14046922800", "AffiliationID": "60029157", "AffiliationName": "Division of Neurology, Department of Medicine, University of Malaya"}, "55066920600": {"Name": "O'Sullivan S.S.", "AuthorID": "55066920600", "AffiliationID": "60018577", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Bon Secours Hospital"}, "8449219500": {"Name": "Voon V.", "AuthorID": "8449219500", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, University of Cambridge"}, "26643584500": {"Name": "Krack P.", "AuthorID": "26643584500", "AffiliationID": "60020486, 60010987", "AffiliationName": "Movement Disorders Center, Department of Neurology, University Hospital (Inselspital) and University of Bern"}, "35228015300": {"Name": "Sampaio C.", "AuthorID": "35228015300", "AffiliationID": "60096697", "AffiliationName": "Cure Huntington's Disease InitiativeEl (CHDI) Management/CHDI Foundation"}, "23095355300": {"Name": "Post B.", "AuthorID": "23095355300", "AffiliationID": "60002573", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Center"}, "7003951347": {"Name": "Leentjens A.F.G.", "AuthorID": "7003951347", "AffiliationID": "60007895", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, Maastricht University Medical Center"}, "7005097519": {"Name": "Martinez-Martin P.", "AuthorID": "7005097519", "AffiliationID": "60085102, 60001602, 60012588", "AffiliationName": "National Center of Epidemiology and Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red sobre Enfermedades Neurodegenerativas (CIBERNED), Carlos III Institute of Health"}, "56933550900": {"Name": "Stebbins G.T.", "AuthorID": "56933550900", "AffiliationID": "60018691", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurological Sciences, Rush University Medical Center"}, "36063561200": {"Name": "Goetz C.G.", "AuthorID": "36063561200", "AffiliationID": "60018691", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurological Sciences, Rush University Medical Center"}, "55802371060": {"Name": "Schrag A.", "AuthorID": "55802371060", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Neurosciences, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "55882458500": {"Name": "Bhidayasiri R.", "AuthorID": "55882458500", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "7406363771": {"Name": "Brown R.G.", "AuthorID": "7406363771", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "6601933976": {"Name": "Marinus J.", "AuthorID": "6601933976", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "57202566818": {"Name": "Mestre T.A.", "AuthorID": "57202566818", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "57208800309": {"Name": "Violante M.R.", "AuthorID": "57208800309", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "23478501900": {"Name": "Skorvanek M.", "AuthorID": "23478501900", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
