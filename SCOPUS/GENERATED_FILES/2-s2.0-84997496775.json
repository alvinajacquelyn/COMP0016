Policy targets to achieve decarbonisation goals for national energy systems will therefore impact levels of air pollution. Advantages can be gained from considering these co-impacts when analysing technology transition scenarios in order to avoid tension between climate change and air quality policies. We incorporated non-GHG air pollution into a bottom-up, technoeconomic energy systems model that is at the core of UK decarbonisation policy development. We then used this model to assess the co-impacts of decarbonisation on other types of air pollution and evaluated the extent to which transition pathways would be altered if these other pollutants were considered. In a scenario where the UK meets its existing decarbonisation targets to 2050, including the costs of non-GHG air pollution led to a 40% and 45% decrease in PM10 and PM2.5 pollution (respectively) between 2010 and 2050 due to changes in technology choice in residential heating. Conversely, limited change in the pollution profile for transportation were observed, suggesting that other policy strategies will be necessary to reduce pollution from transport.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Air pollution", "Co-impacts", "Energy system modelling", "Low carbon scenario", "Policy analysis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Energy system modelling", "Energy systems modeling", "Low carbon", "Outdoor air pollution", "Policy analysis", "Policy development", "Residential heating", "Technology transition"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84997496775", "SubjectAreas": [["Energy (all)", "ENER", "2100"], ["Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law", "ENVI", "2308"]], "AuthorData": {"56692395900": {"Name": "Lott M.", "AuthorID": "56692395900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London (UCL) Institute for Sustainable Resources"}, "55224736800": {"Name": "Dodds P.", "AuthorID": "55224736800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Energy Institute Central House"}, "36792192100": {"Name": "Pye S.", "AuthorID": "36792192100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Energy Institute Central House"}}}
