This review provides an up-to-date discussion of the key clinical, social and ethical implications associated with this revolutionary technology. Stakeholders are positive about a test that is highly accurate, safe, can be perfomed early in pregnancy, identifies affected pregnancies that might otherwise have been missed and reduces the need for invasive testing. Nevertheless, professional societies currently recommend it as an advanced screening test due to the low false positive rate (FPR). Despite the practical and psychological benefits, a number of concerns have been raised which warrant attention. These include the potential for routinisation of testing and subsequent impact on informed decision-making, an \u201ceasy\u201d blood test inadvertently contributing to women feeling pressured to take the test, fears NIPT will lead to less tolerance and support for those living with Down syndrome and the heightened expectation of having \u201cperfect babies\u201d. These issues can be addressed to some extent through clinician education, patient information and establishing national and international consensus in the development of comprehensive and regularly updated guidelines. As the number of conditions we are able to test for non-invasively expands it will be increasingly important to ensure pre-test counselling can be delivered effectively supported by knowledgeable healthcare professionals.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Aneuploidy", "cell-free foetal DNA", "clinical", "Down syndrome", "ethical", "Non-invasive prenatal testing", "social"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aneuploidy", "Chromosome Disorders", "Decision Making", "Female", "Humans", "Pregnancy", "Prenatal Diagnosis"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85012094048", "SubjectAreas": [["Reproductive Medicine", "MEDI", "2743"], ["Clinical Psychology", "PSYC", "3203"], ["Obstetrics and Gynecology", "MEDI", "2729"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"57192646363": {"Name": "Griffin B.", "AuthorID": "57192646363", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "North East Thames Regional Genetics Service, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57193260004": {"Name": "Edwards S.", "AuthorID": "57193260004", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "North East Thames Regional Genetics Service, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7006741537": {"Name": "Chitty L.S.", "AuthorID": "7006741537", "AffiliationID": "60018207, 60012662", "AffiliationName": "Genetics and Genomic Medicine, UCL Institute of Child Health and Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}, "22135567300": {"Name": "Lewis C.", "AuthorID": "22135567300", "AffiliationID": "60018207, 60012662", "AffiliationName": "Genetics and Genomic Medicine, UCL Institute of Child Health and Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
