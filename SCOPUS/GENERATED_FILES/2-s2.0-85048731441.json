Although the contemporary science of metabolism points to complexity and contingency, the application of a simplified version of \u2018metabolic disorder\u2019 or \u2018metabolic syndrome\u2019 as the supposed central driver of non-communicable disease in low- and middle-income countries runs the risk of obscuring the ways in which local circumstances and histories interact with global forces to produce epidemiological change. The paper discusses health data collection and its interpretation in Malawi to demonstrate how the use of this concept has led to a narrowing of the category of non-communicable disease and a neglect of the role of infectious disease in producing chronic conditions. Finally, the paper points to alternative approaches which might yield a better understanding of pressing health problems.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Africa", "Epidemiologic transition", "Malawi", "Metabolic disorder", "Non-communicable disease"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85048731441", "SubjectAreas": [["Health (social science)", "SOCI", "3306"], ["Health Policy", "MEDI", "2719"]], "AuthorData": {"7202016954": {"Name": "Vaughan M.", "AuthorID": "7202016954", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Advanced Studies, University College London"}}}
