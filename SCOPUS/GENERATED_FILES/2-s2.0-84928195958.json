Here we report 2 neonates who were admitted to the hospital with complaints of respiratory failure and myoclonic seizures with an elevated cerebrospinal fluid/plasma glycine ratio and diagnosed as nonketotic hyperglycinemia. We report these cases as 2 novel homozygous mutations; a missense mutation c.593A>T (p.D198 V) in the glycine decarboxylase gene and a splicing mutation c.339G>A (Q113Q) in the aminomethyltransferase gene were detected. We would like to emphasize the genetic difference of our region in inherited metabolic diseases once again.", "AuthorKeywords": ["mutation", "nonketotic hyperglycinemia", "novel"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aminomethyltransferase", "Epilepsies, Myoclonic", "Female", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Glycine", "Glycine Dehydrogenase (Decarboxylating)", "Homozygote", "Humans", "Hyperglycinemia, Nonketotic", "Infant, Newborn", "Male", "Mutation, Missense", "Respiratory Insufficiency", "RNA Splicing"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84928195958", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"54999866900": {"Name": "Yilmaz B.", "AuthorID": "54999866900", "AffiliationID": "60002278", "AffiliationName": "Cukurova University Medical Faculty, Department of Pediatric Metabolism and Nutrition"}, "56380107600": {"Name": "Kor D.", "AuthorID": "56380107600", "AffiliationID": "60002278", "AffiliationName": "Cukurova University Medical Faculty, Department of Pediatric Metabolism and Nutrition"}, "56601436800": {"Name": "Kartal E.", "AuthorID": "56601436800", "AffiliationID": "60002278", "AffiliationName": "Cukurova University Medical Faculty, Department of Pediatric Metabolism and Nutrition"}, "7005565613": {"Name": "Mungan N.", "AuthorID": "7005565613", "AffiliationID": "60002278", "AffiliationName": "Cukurova University Medical Faculty, Department of Pediatric Metabolism and Nutrition"}, "6508114123": {"Name": "Ceylaner S.", "AuthorID": "6508114123", "AffiliationID": "109590320", "AffiliationName": "Intergen Genetic Laboratory"}, "55937027500": {"Name": "Mert G.", "AuthorID": "55937027500", "AffiliationID": "60032587", "AffiliationName": "Cukurova University Medical Faculty, Department of Pediatric Neurology"}, "8541259900": {"Name": "Incecik F.", "AuthorID": "8541259900", "AffiliationID": "60032587", "AffiliationName": "Cukurova University Medical Faculty, Department of Pediatric Neurology"}}}
