However, once HIV infected patients have commenced ART in resource limited settings, the benefits of continued CTX prophylaxis are not known. The few studies that investigated the safety of discontinuing CTX prophylaxis in these settings had limitations due to their design. Materials and methods: COSTOP is a randomised double blind placebo controlled non-inferiority trial among HIV infected Ugandan adults stabilised on anti-retroviral treatment (ART). Participants with CD4 count of 250 or more cells/mm3 are randomised to two arms: the intervention arm in which CTX is discontinued and the control arm in which CTX prophylaxis is continued. The study aims to assess whether the intervention regimen is not inferior, with respect to the incidence of pre-defined CTX-preventable events, to the control regimen and superior with respect to the incidence of haematological adverse events. Discussion: Studies that have previously evaluated the safety of discontinuing CTX prophylaxis among HIV infected adults in resource limited settings have provided moderate to low quality evidence owing in part to methodological limitations. COSTOP is designed and conducted with sufficient rigour to answer this question. The results of the trial will assist in guiding policy recommendations. Conclusion: This paper describes the design and methodological considerations important for the conduct of CTX cessation studies.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Antiretroviral treatment", "Cotrimoxazole cessation study design", "Cotrimoxazole prophylaxis", "HIV infection", "Stopping cotrimoxazole", "Uganda"], "IndexKeywords": ["AIDS-Related Opportunistic Infections", "Anti-Retroviral Agents", "CD4 Lymphocyte Count", "Double-Blind Method", "Drug Administration Schedule", "Female", "HIV Infections", "Humans", "Incidence", "Male", "Research Design", "Trimethoprim, Sulfamethoxazole Drug Combination", "Uganda"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84930216583", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"55799491900": {"Name": "Anywaine Z.", "AuthorID": "55799491900", "AffiliationID": "60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC/UVRI Uganda Research Unit on AIDS"}, "25930307600": {"Name": "Abaasa A.", "AuthorID": "25930307600", "AffiliationID": "60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC/UVRI Uganda Research Unit on AIDS"}, "7403284470": {"Name": "Levin J.", "AuthorID": "7403284470", "AffiliationID": "60016218", "AffiliationName": "School of Public Health, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of the Witwatersrand"}, "55195293900": {"Name": "Kasirye R.", "AuthorID": "55195293900", "AffiliationID": "60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC/UVRI Uganda Research Unit on AIDS"}, "57206476386": {"Name": "Kamali A.", "AuthorID": "57206476386", "AffiliationID": "60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC/UVRI Uganda Research Unit on AIDS"}, "16236343900": {"Name": "Grosskurth H.", "AuthorID": "16236343900", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "14825365500": {"Name": "Munderi P.", "AuthorID": "14825365500", "AffiliationID": "60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC/UVRI Uganda Research Unit on AIDS"}, "7102771386": {"Name": "Nunn A.", "AuthorID": "7102771386", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60003108", "AffiliationName": "MRC Clinical Trials Unit, University College London"}}}
