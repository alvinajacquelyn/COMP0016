Here we test whether the quit method used in a previous attempt influences (i) future decisions to quit and/or (ii) treatment/s used during subsequent attempts. Design and Setting: Data came from the Smoking Toolkit Study, a United Kingdom national household survey. Participants and Measures: Smokers (n=5489) who completed a baseline and 6-month follow-up questionnaire. Respondents were asked what treatment/s, grouped as: prescription medication/s [bupropion, varenicline or nicotine replacement therapy (NRT)], over-the-counter NRT or unaided that they had used in their most recent quit attempt (at baseline), and any use of treatment/s for a quit attempt in the last 3months at follow-up. Results: Smokers who had tried to quit at baseline were more likely to report having tried to quit again prior to follow-up [all odds ratios \u22652.19 relative to no attempt at baseline, P<0.001]. Smokers who tried to quit using pharmacological aids were more likely to try to quit again at follow-up (all ORs \u22652.19 relative to no attempt at baseline, P<0.001). Smokers tended to re-try aids used in baseline attempts in future attempts (all ORs \u22651.48 relative to no attempt at baseline, P<0.01). Conclusions: Smokers who have tried to quit in the past year are more likely to try to quit again within 6months regardless of whether they used a pharmacological aid, and they are more likely to re-try aids they had used previously.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Behavioural support", "Bupropion", "Cessation medication", "Modelling", "Nicotine replacement therapy", "Quitting behaviour", "Smoking cessation", "Varenicline"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Bupropion", "Dopamine Uptake Inhibitors", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Nicotinic Agonists", "Odds Ratio", "Smoking Cessation", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "Tobacco Use Cessation Products", "Treatment Outcome", "Varenicline", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84922575475", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (miscellaneous)", "MEDI", "2701"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"12344685100": {"Name": "Ferguson S.", "AuthorID": "12344685100", "AffiliationID": "60015356", "AffiliationName": "School of Medicine, University of Tasmania"}, "36698750600": {"Name": "Frandsen M.", "AuthorID": "36698750600", "AffiliationID": "60015356", "AffiliationName": "School of Medicine, University of Tasmania"}, "55547124591": {"Name": "Brown J.", "AuthorID": "55547124591", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60012754", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Research UK Health Behaviour Research Centre, University College London"}, "7402396010": {"Name": "West R.", "AuthorID": "7402396010", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60012754", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Research UK Health Behaviour Research Centre, University College London"}}}
