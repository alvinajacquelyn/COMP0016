In this paper, we introduce a probabilistic programming language (PPL) based on abductive logic programming for performing inference in probabilistic models involving categorical distributions with Dirichlet priors. We encode these models as abductive logic programs enriched with probabilistic definitions and queries, and show how to execute and compile them to boolean formulas. Using the latter, we perform generalized inference using one of two proposed Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling algorithms: an adaptation of uncollapsed Gibbs sampling from related work and a novel collapsed Gibbs sampling (CGS). We show that CGS converges faster than the uncollapsed version on a latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) task using synthetic data. On similar data, we compare our PPL with LDA-specific algorithms and other PPLs. We find that all methods, except one, perform similarly and that the more expressive the PPL, the slower it is. We illustrate applications of our PPL on real data in two variants of LDA models (Seed and Cluster LDA), and in the repeated insertion model (RIM). In the latter, our PPL yields similar conclusions to inference with EM for Mallows models.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Abductive logic programming", "Latent Dirichlet allocation", "Markov Chain Monte Carlo", "Probabilistic programming", "Repeated insertion model"], "IndexKeywords": ["Abductive logic programming", "Abductive logic programs", "Latent Dirichlet allocation", "Latent dirichlet allocations", "Markov Chain Monte-Carlo", "Probabilistic programming", "Probabilistic programming language", "Probabilistic programs"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84980322260", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Theoretical Computer Science", "MATH", "2614"], ["Artificial Intelligence", "COMP", "1702"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"54586220200": {"Name": "Turliuc C.R.", "AuthorID": "54586220200", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computing, Imperial College"}, "57205336627": {"Name": "Russo A.", "AuthorID": "57205336627", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computing, Imperial College"}, "9133273600": {"Name": "Broda K.", "AuthorID": "9133273600", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computing, Imperial College"}, "23088594700": {"Name": "Dickens L.", "AuthorID": "23088594700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Information Studies, University College"}}}
