Molecular radiotherapy in children is most commonly indicated for thyroid cancer, neuroblastoma and other neuroendocrine tumours. The treatments most often administered are 131I-sodium iodide, 131 I-meta-iodobenzylguanidin and radiolabelled peptides such as 177Lu-Lutetium DOTATATE. Safe administration of molecular radiotherapy to children poses special challenges and so should only be given in recognised centres. These combine radiation-protected treatment facilities in a paediatric environment with parental accommodation; medical, nursing and play specialist expertise in the care of children and the management of paediatric malignancy; and a well-equipped nuclear medicine department with medical, radiographic and physics staff experienced in diagnostic imaging, therapy administration, post-therapy imaging and dosimetry and specialist paediatric general anaesthesia available if required for optimal imaging. This may mean treatment a long way from home, and a clinical coordinator is key for communication with families and referring clinicians. Radiation protection is important, and to reduce radiation exposure to staff, parents or other suitable adults will act as comforters and cares for the child during the inpatient stay.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Children\u2019s cancer", "Molecular radiotherapy", "Neuroblastoma", "Paediatric oncology", "Radiation protection", "Radionuclide therapy", "Radiopharmaceutical", "Thyroid cancer"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84957664447", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"7004607359": {"Name": "Gaze M.N.", "AuthorID": "7004607359", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Oncology, University College London Hospitals, NHS Foundation Trust"}, "47760956800": {"Name": "Gains J.E.", "AuthorID": "47760956800", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Oncology, University College London Hospitals, NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7005791371": {"Name": "Bomanji J.B.", "AuthorID": "7005791371", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nuclear Medicine, University College London Hospitals, NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
