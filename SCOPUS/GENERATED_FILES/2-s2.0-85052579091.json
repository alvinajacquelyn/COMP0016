Despite recent growth, data on university estates has received little concerted attention from national and international statistics bodies. This paper examines and contrasts the evolution of universities and their estates in the UK and Poland, in the light of the degree of central government control versus institutional autonomy. Given increased international competition for students, staff and research funding, the paper argues that universities and their stakeholders would benefit from more transparency, the development of an agreed set of estate definitions, standards and regular statistical reports. Data based on agreed standards would provide a basis for comparative analysis and help to run better university estates and facilities, thereby enhancing HEI efficiency, effectiveness and environmental sustainability.", "AuthorKeywords": ["autonomy", "data", "real estate", "transparency", "university"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85052579091", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"]], "AuthorData": {"56830487100": {"Name": "Rymarzak M.", "AuthorID": "56830487100", "AffiliationID": "60026000", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Management, Department of Investment and Real Estate, University of Gda\u0144sk"}, "15036043500": {"Name": "Marmot A.", "AuthorID": "15036043500", "AffiliationID": "60025709", "AffiliationName": "School of Architecture, Design & Planning, University of Sydney"}}}
