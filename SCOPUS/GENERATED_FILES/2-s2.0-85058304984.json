The terahertz generation originates from nonlinear optical rectification in meta-atoms is broadband and free from phase match conditions. The strong linear response and inherent nonlinear behaviors in plasmonic metasurface can be described by a time-domain hydrodynamic model, in which both surface and bulk contributions of nonlinearity are considered. The coupled Maxwell-hydrodynamic system capturing full-wave physics and free electron dynamics is solved with a parallel finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method. The proposed method is fundamentally important to design nonlinear plasmonic nanodevices, especially for efficient and broadband THz emitters.", "AuthorKeywords": ["finite-difference time-domain (FDTD)", "Hydrodynamic model", "metasurface", "nonlinear plasmonic nanodevice", "terahertz emission"], "IndexKeywords": ["Finite -difference time domains (FDTD)", "Hydrodynamic model", "Metasurface", "Plasmonic nanodevice", "Terahertz emissions"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85058304984", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"], ["Signal Processing", "COMP", "1711"], ["Instrumentation", "PHYS", "3105"]], "AuthorData": {"57201198869": {"Name": "Fang M.", "AuthorID": "57201198869", "AffiliationID": "60001455, 60001604", "AffiliationName": "Ministry of Education, Anhui University, Key Laboratory of Intelligent Computing and Signal Processing"}, "12243904200": {"Name": "Huang Z.", "AuthorID": "12243904200", "AffiliationID": "60001455, 60001604", "AffiliationName": "Ministry of Education, Anhui University, Key Laboratory of Intelligent Computing and Signal Processing"}, "55621370600": {"Name": "Wu X.", "AuthorID": "55621370600", "AffiliationID": "60001455, 60001604", "AffiliationName": "Ministry of Education, Anhui University, Key Laboratory of Intelligent Computing and Signal Processing"}, "56419475000": {"Name": "Sha W.", "AuthorID": "56419475000", "AffiliationID": "60117753, 60003970", "AffiliationName": "College of Information Science and Electronic Engineering, Zhejiang University"}}}
