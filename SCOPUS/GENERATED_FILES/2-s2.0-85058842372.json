Heterostructures formed by stacking layered materials require atomically clean interfaces. However, contaminants are usually trapped between the layers, aggregating into randomly located blisters, incompatible with scalable fabrication processes. Here we report a process to remove blisters from fully formed heterostructures. Our method is over an order of magnitude faster than those previously reported and allows multiple interfaces to be cleaned simultaneously. We fabricate blister-free regions of graphene encapsulated in hexagonal boron nitride with an area ~ 5000 \u03bcm 2 , achieving mobilities up to 180,000 cm 2 V \u22121 s \u22121 at room temperature, and 1.8 \u00d7 10 6 cm 2 V \u22121 s \u22121 at 9 K. We also assemble heterostructures using graphene intentionally exposed to polymers and solvents. After cleaning, these samples reach similar mobilities. This demonstrates that exposure of graphene to process-related contaminants is compatible with the realization of high mobility samples, paving the way to the development of wafer-scale processes for the integration of layered materials in (opto)electronic devices.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85058842372", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"56308057100": {"Name": "Purdie D.", "AuthorID": "56308057100", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Cambridge Graphene Centre, University of Cambridge"}, "56070579300": {"Name": "Ferrari A.", "AuthorID": "56070579300", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Cambridge Graphene Centre, University of Cambridge"}, "25632490300": {"Name": "Lombardo A.", "AuthorID": "25632490300", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Cambridge Graphene Centre, University of Cambridge"}, "6701528077": {"Name": "Pugno N.", "AuthorID": "6701528077", "AffiliationID": "100319979", "AffiliationName": "Ket-lab, E.
