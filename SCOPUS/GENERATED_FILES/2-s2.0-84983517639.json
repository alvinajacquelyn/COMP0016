This depends on industry adopting unconventional approaches to production. This research explores the root causes of barriers to the adoption of such approaches in the construction industry, and applies a behavioural model to assess whether companies are hindered by capability, opportunity or motivation. The long history of lowest-cost tendering in construction has led to a path-dependent lock-in to conventional market-driven objectives of cost and risk reduction; it is suggested that locked-in companies lack the commercial opportunity and hence motivation, rather than the capability, to adopt approaches perceived to increase cost or risk. Such companies will therefore tend to resist unconventional approaches, restricting the physical opportunity for other project participants. This theory is explored in a case study of first adoptions of cross-laminated timber (CLT) in UK projects, using a survey and series of semi-structured interviews. The case study found that project contexts created market niches. This provided designers, who were motivated to use CLT, the opportunity to promote its use in the project. CLT was seen as key to successful resolution of project constraints, thereby providing motivation to other project participants to adopt the material.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Barriers to adoption", "Behaviour models", "Construction materials", "Cross-laminated timber", "Structural engineering", "Technology transitions"], "IndexKeywords": ["Barriers to adoption", "Behaviour models", "Cross laminated", "Non-renewable resource", "Project participants", "Semi structured interviews", "Technology transition", "Unconventional approaches"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84983517639", "SubjectAreas": [["Civil and Structural Engineering", "ENGI", "2205"], ["Building and Construction", "ENGI", "2215"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"]], "AuthorData": {"57190862353": {"Name": "Jones K.", "AuthorID": "57190862353", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Centre for Resource Efficiency & the Environment"}, "7005025101": {"Name": "Stegemann J.", "AuthorID": "7005025101", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Centre for Resource Efficiency & the Environment"}, "57190580084": {"Name": "Sykes J.", "AuthorID": "57190580084", "AffiliationID": "117124721", "AffiliationName": "Useful Simple Projects"}, "25634724800": {"Name": "Winslow P.", "AuthorID": "25634724800", "AffiliationID": "112434762", "AffiliationName": "Expedition Engineering, The Clove Building"}}}
