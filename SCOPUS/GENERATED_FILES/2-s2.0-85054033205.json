Aims: This study aimed to examine the role of survivin as a prognostic marker in pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Settings and Design: Fifty-one specimens of PDAC were assessed for survivin expression by immunohistochemistry. Subjects and Methods: Overall survival and 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival were retrieved retrospectively. Statistical Analysis Used: Bivariate analysis was conducted using Chi-square and Mann-Whitney U tests, while survival analysis was conducted using Kaplan-Meier statistics. Results: Of the 51 assessed cases, 49% were positive for survivin. Survivin expression was significantly correlated 1-year survival and overall survival, particularly in bcl-2 positive cases. Conclusions: Survivin may be implicated in the bcl-2 and p53 pathways and therefore in the biology of PDAC. Its potential use as a survival predictor and therapeutic target represent a promising field.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Apoptosis", "pancreatic adenocarcinoma", "survival", "survivin"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adenocarcinoma", "Adult", "Aged", "Apoptosis", "Biomarkers, Tumor", "Disease-Free Survival", "Female", "Humans", "Immunohistochemistry", "Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins", "Kaplan-Meier Estimate", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Neoplasm Proteins", "Pancreatic Neoplasms", "Prognosis", "Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2", "Tumor Suppressor Protein p53"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85054033205", "SubjectAreas": [["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"6604020081": {"Name": "Contis J.", "AuthorID": "6604020081", "AffiliationID": "60031170, 60028900", "AffiliationName": "2ndDepartment of Surgery, Aretaieio University Hospital, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens"}, "40361377000": {"Name": "Lykoudis P.", "AuthorID": "40361377000", "AffiliationID": "60031170, 60028900", "AffiliationName": "2ndDepartment of Surgery, Aretaieio University Hospital, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens"}, "12140664500": {"Name": "Goula K.", "AuthorID": "12140664500", "AffiliationID": "60031170, 60028900", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, Aretaieio University Hospital, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens"}, "6506407291": {"Name": "Karandrea D.", "AuthorID": "6506407291", "AffiliationID": "60031170, 60028900", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, Aretaieio University Hospital, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens"}, "15057982500": {"Name": "Kondi-Pafiti A.", "AuthorID": "15057982500", "AffiliationID": "60031170, 60028900", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, Aretaieio University Hospital, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens"}}}
