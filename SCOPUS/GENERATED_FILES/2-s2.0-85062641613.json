From 1775 to1790 it was a health problem of major proportions in dozens of parishes in Quebec \u2013 one that appeared to be both endemic and epidemic in nature. Considered by contemporaries (and by more recent medical historians) as a form of non-venereal syphilis, or perhaps another of the treponematoses (pinta/yaws), St Paul\u2019s Bay disease was prominent throughout the colony, a ecting thousands of colonists directly and indirectly.2 By 1785 it had created enough concern to elicit an ambitious response that brought to bear the combined energies of the British colonial government, the Catholic clergy and the medical profession upon the physically unwell peasantry of Quebec. Leading the medical charge was the physician James Bowman, who was instructed by Governor Henry Hamilton to create an e ective plan for the eradication of the disease.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85062641613", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"7402046364": {"Name": "Moran J.", "AuthorID": "7402046364", "AffiliationID": "60007655", "AffiliationName": "Department at the University of Prince Edward Island"}}}
