One-dimensional systems provide fundamental insights because they are often amenable to exact methods. However, no exact solution is known for the experimentally relevant case of external confinement. We propose a powerful ansatz for the one-dimensional Fermi gas in a harmonic potential near the limit of infinite short-range repulsion. For the case of a single impurity in a Fermi sea, we show that our ansatz is indistinguishable from numerically exact results in both the few- and many-body limits. We further derive an effective Heisenberg spin-chain model corresponding to our ansatz, valid for any spin-mixture, within which we obtain the impurity eigenstates analytically. In particular, the classical Pascal\u2019s triangle emerges in the expression for the ground-state wave function. As well as providing an important benchmark for strongly correlated physics, our results are relevant for emerging quantum technologies, where a precise knowledge of one-dimensional quantum states is paramount.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["External confinement", "Ground state wavefunctions", "Heisenberg spin chains", "One-dimensional Fermi gas", "One-dimensional systems", "Quantum many-body systems", "Quantum technologies", "Short-range repulsion"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85027889971", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"6508193614": {"Name": "Levinsen J.", "AuthorID": "6508193614", "AffiliationID": "60019578", "AffiliationName": "School of Physics and Astronomy, Monash University"}, "9240980200": {"Name": "Parish M.M.", "AuthorID": "9240980200", "AffiliationID": "60175883", "AffiliationName": "London Centre for Nanotechnology"}, "8341599900": {"Name": "Massignan P.", "AuthorID": "8341599900", "AffiliationID": "60016357", "AffiliationName": "ICFO\u2014The Institute of Photonic Sciences"}, "6701654777": {"Name": "Bruun G.M.", "AuthorID": "6701654777", "AffiliationID": "60029616", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, Aarhus University"}}}
