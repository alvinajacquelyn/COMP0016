All rights reserved.Objective: The prevalence of overweight and obesity is increasing among HIV-infected patients. Whether standard antiretroviral drug dosage is adequate in heavy individuals remains unresolved.We assessed the virological and immunological responses to initial efavirenz (EFV)-containing regimens in heavy compared to normal-weight HIV-infected patients. Design: Observational European cohort collaboration study. Methods: Eligible patients were antiretroviral-na\u00efve with documented weight prior to EFV start and follow-up viral loads after treatment initiation. Cox regression analyses evaluated the association between weight and time to first undetectable viral load (<50 copies/ml) after treatment initiation, and time to viral load rebound (two consecutive viral load >50 copies/ml) after initial suppression over 5 years of follow-up. Recovery of CD4+ cell count was evaluated 6 and 12 months after EFV initiation. Analyses were stratified by weight (kg) group (I - <55; II - >55, <80 (reference); III - >80, <85; IV - >85, <90; V - >90, <95; VI - >95). Results: The study included 19 968 patients, of whom 9.1, 68.3, 9.1, 5.8, 3.5, and 4.3% were in weight groups I-VI, respectively. Overall, 81.1% patients attained virological suppression, of whom 34.1% subsequently experienced viral load rebound. After multiple adjustments, no statistical difference was observed in time to undetectable viral load and virological rebound for heavier individuals compared to their normal-weight counterparts. Although heaviest individuals had significantly higher CD4+ cell count at baseline, CD4+ cell recovery at 6 and 12 months after EFV initiation was comparable to normal-weight individuals. Conclusion: Virological and immunological responses to initial EFV-containing regimens were not impaired in heavy individuals, suggesting that the standard 600mg EFV dosage is appropriate across a wide weight range.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Efavirenz", "HIV", "Immunological response", "Virological response", "Weight"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Adult", "Antiretroviral Therapy, Highly Active", "Antiretroviral Therapy, Highly Active", "Benzoxazines", "Benzoxazines", "Body Weight", "Body Weight", "CD4 Lymphocyte Count", "CD4 Lymphocyte Count", "Cohort Studies", "Cohort Studies", "Female", "Female", "HIV Infections", "HIV Infections", "Humans", "Humans", "Male", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Middle Aged", "Obesity", "Obesity", "Regression Analysis", "Regression Analysis", "Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors", "Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors", "Treatment Outcome", "Treatment Outcome", "Viral Load", "Viral Load"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84920261545", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"6602863267": {"Name": "Marzolini C.", "AuthorID": "6602863267", "AffiliationID": "60028287", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infectious Diseases and Hospital Epidemiology, Departments of Medicine and Clinical Research, University Hospital of Basel"}, "7004770044": {"Name": "Battegay M.", "AuthorID": "7004770044", "AffiliationID": "60028287", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infectious Diseases and Hospital Epidemiology, Departments of Medicine and Clinical Research, University Hospital of Basel"}, "56466212800": {"Name": "Sabin C.", "AuthorID": "56466212800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infection and Population Health, University College London"}, "7006513758": {"Name": "Mocroft A.", "AuthorID": "7006513758", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infection and Population Health, University College London"}, "57217841501": {"Name": "Raffi F.", "AuthorID": "57217841501", "AffiliationID": "60028048", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infectious Diseases, University Hospital of Nantes"}, "13007436000": {"Name": "Siccardi M.", "AuthorID": "13007436000", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular and Clinical Pharmacology, Institute of Translational Medicine, University of Liverpool"}, "7006842875": {"Name": "Mussini C.", "AuthorID": "7006842875", "AffiliationID": "60004591", "AffiliationName": "Clinic of Infectious Diseases, University of Modena"}, "17635344700": {"Name": "Launay O.", "AuthorID": "17635344700", "AffiliationID": "60123796", "AffiliationName": "University Paris Descartes"}, "55540576000": {"Name": "Burger D.", "AuthorID": "55540576000", "AffiliationID": "60002573", "AffiliationName": "Radboud University Medical Centre"}, "7006849690": {"Name": "Roca B.", "AuthorID": "7006849690", "AffiliationID": "60002644, 60012930", "AffiliationName": "Hospital General of Castellon, University of Valencia and University Jaume I"}, "7005978487": {"Name": "Fehr J.", "AuthorID": "7005978487", "AffiliationID": "60019619, 60012614", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infectious Diseases and Hospital Epidemiology, University Hospital Zurich and University of Zurich"}, "56539512900": {"Name": "Bonora S.", "AuthorID": "56539512900", "AffiliationID": "60012259", "AffiliationName": "Unit of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medical Sciences, University of Torino"}, "7005042699": {"Name": "Obel N.", "AuthorID": "7005042699", "AffiliationID": "60015199", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infectious Diseases, Copenhagen University Hospital"}, "55942017500": {"Name": "Dauchy F.A.", "AuthorID": "55942017500", "AffiliationID": "60003362", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infectious and Tropical Diseases, HIV Unit, University Hospital Pellegrin"}, "7005799741": {"Name": "Zangerle R.", "AuthorID": "7005799741", "AffiliationID": "60008222", "AffiliationName": "Medical University Innsbruck"}, "35548368400": {"Name": "Gogos C.", "AuthorID": "35548368400", "AffiliationID": "60024484", "AffiliationName": "Department of Internal Medicine, University Hospital of Patras"}, "6701574139": {"Name": "Gianotti N.", "AuthorID": "6701574139", "AffiliationID": "60082964", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infectious Diseases, San Raffaele Scientific Institute"}, "7003410809": {"Name": "Ammassari A.", "AuthorID": "7003410809", "AffiliationID": "60072494", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Department, National Institute for Infectious Diseases 'L.
