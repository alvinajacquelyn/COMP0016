The trial wave function consists of an antisymmetrized geminal power arranged in a single determinant that is multiplied by a Jastrow correlation factor. Whereas the determinantal part incorporates static correlation effects, the augmented real-space correlation factor accounts for the dynamics electron correlation. The accuracy of this approach is demonstrated by computing the dissociation energy and PES for the ozone molecule in three vibrational states: symmetric, asymmetric, and scissoring. We find that the employed wave function provides a detailed description of rather strongly correlated multireference systems, which is in quantitative agreement with experiment, using a single determinant only.", "AuthorKeywords": ["dynamics electron correlation", "quantum Monte Carlo", "resonating valence bond", "static electron correlation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Correlation effect", "Correlation factors", "Dissociation energies", "Multireference systems", "Quantitative agreement", "Quantum monte carlo", "Quantum Monte Carlo simulations", "Resonating valence bonds"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84943355847", "SubjectAreas": [["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"]], "AuthorData": {"14627363100": {"Name": "Azadi S.", "AuthorID": "14627363100", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Imperial College London"}, "55389694200": {"Name": "Singh R.", "AuthorID": "55389694200", "AffiliationID": "112086172", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, DAV University Jalandhar"}, "57219972170": {"Name": "K\u00fchne T.D.", "AuthorID": "57219972170", "AffiliationID": "60020238", "AffiliationName": "Paderborn Center for Parallel Computing, Institute for Lightweight Design with Hybrid Systems, University of Paderborn"}}}
