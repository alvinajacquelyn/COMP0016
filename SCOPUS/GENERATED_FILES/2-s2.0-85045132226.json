To date, no study has evaluated the longitudinal change in the prevalence of detectable viremia within the HIV-positive community (PDV +) and the entire population (PDV P) using data from a sub-Saharan African setting. Methods In 2011, 2013, and 2014, we obtained 6752 HIV-positive and 15415 HIV-negative test results from a population-based surveillance system in the KwaZulu-Natal province of South Africa. We quantified the PDV + as the proportion of the 6752 HIV-positive results with a viral load >1550 copies/mL and the PDV P as the proportion of the 6752 HIV-positive and 15415 HIV-negative results with a viral load >1550 copies/mL. Results Between 2011 and 2014, the PDV + decreased by 16.5 percentage points (pp) for women (from 71.8% to 55.3%) and 10.6 pp for men (from 77.8% to 67.2%). However, a steady rise in the overall HIV prevalence, from 26.7% to 32.4%, offset the declines in the PDV + for both sexes. For women, the PDV P decreased by only 2.1 pp, from 21.3% to 19.2%, but for men, the PDV P actually increased by 1.6 pp, from 14.6% to 16.2%, over the survey period. Conclusions The PDV +, which is currently being tracked under the UNAIDS 90-90-90 targets, may not be an accurate indicator of the potential for ongoing HIV transmission. There is a critical need for countries to monitor and report the prevalence of detectable viremia among all adults, irrespective of HIV status.", "AuthorKeywords": ["detectable viremia", "HIV", "prevalence", "South Africa", "viral load"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Female", "HIV", "HIV Infections", "HIV Seropositivity", "Humans", "Longitudinal Studies", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Population Surveillance", "Prevalence", "Rural Population", "Sexual Behavior", "South Africa", "Viral Load", "Viremia", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85045132226", "SubjectAreas": [["Microbiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2726"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"23096323900": {"Name": "Vandormael A.", "AuthorID": "23096323900", "AffiliationID": "60010499", "AffiliationName": "Kwazulu-Natal Research Innovation and Sequencing Platform, University of KwaZulu-Natal"}, "55322184600": {"Name": "Tomita A.", "AuthorID": "55322184600", "AffiliationID": "60010499", "AffiliationName": "Kwazulu-Natal Research Innovation and Sequencing Platform, University of KwaZulu-Natal"}, "6603089893": {"Name": "Tanser F.", "AuthorID": "6603089893", "AffiliationID": "60094841, 60010499", "AffiliationName": "Centre for the AIDS Programme of Research in South Africa, University of KwaZulu-Natal"}, "23011726900": {"Name": "B\u00e4rnighausen T.", "AuthorID": "23011726900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Infection and Population Health, University College London"}, "7201727367": {"Name": "Pillay D.", "AuthorID": "7201727367", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London"}, "8897715800": {"Name": "De Oliveira T.", "AuthorID": "8897715800", "AffiliationID": "60094841, 60010499", "AffiliationName": "Centre for the AIDS Programme of Research in South Africa, University of KwaZulu-Natal"}, "8270002100": {"Name": "Herbeck J.", "AuthorID": "8270002100", "AffiliationID": "60015481", "AffiliationName": "International Clinical Research Center, Department of Global Health, University of Washington"}, "35372648800": {"Name": "Phillips A.", "AuthorID": "35372648800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Global Health, University College London"}}}
