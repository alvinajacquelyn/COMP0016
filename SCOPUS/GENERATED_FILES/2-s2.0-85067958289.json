The LiTY line lists cover all rovibration transitions within the five lowest lying electronic states (X1\u03a3 +, a3II, A1II, B1\u03a3 + and b3\u03a3 +) and five isotopologues: 24Mg16O, 25Mg16O, 26Mg16O, 24Mg17O and 24Mg18O. The calculations use potential energy cures, spin-orbit and electronic angular momentum coupling curves determined by fitting to empirical energy levels; these levels are reproduced to within 0.01 cm-1 in most cases. Computed nuclear-motion wavefunctions are combined with ab initio dipole moment curves to give transition intensities and excited state radiative lifetimes, which are compared with laboratorymeasurements. The 24Mg16O line list comprises 186 842 (J\u2264320) rovibronic states and 72 833 173 transitions with angular momenta, J, up to 300 and covering wavenumbers up to 33 000 cm-1 (\u03bb> 0.3 \u03bcm). The line lists are suitable for temperatures up to about 5000 K. They are relevant to astrophysical studies of exoplanet atmospheres, cool stars and brown dwarfs, and are made available in electronic form in the CDS and ExoMol databases.", "AuthorKeywords": ["astronomical data bases: miscellaneous", "molecular data", "opacity", "planets and satellites: atmospheres", "stars: low-mass."], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85067958289", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"57209503720": {"Name": "Li H.Y.", "AuthorID": "57209503720", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "7101645601": {"Name": "Tennyson J.", "AuthorID": "7101645601", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "35605893200": {"Name": "Yurchenko S.N.", "AuthorID": "35605893200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}}}
