Objective: Studies have related air pollution to myocardial infarction (MI) events over days or weeks, with few data on very short-term risks. We studied risk of ST-segment elevation MI (STEMI) within hours of exposure to air pollution while adjusting for weather. Methods: We performed a case-crossover study of STEMI cases in Stockholm, Sweden (Jan 2000\u2013June 2014) based on SWEDEHEART. Exposures during hazard periods up to 24 h prior to admission were compared to bidirectionally sampled control periods. Risks attributable to sulphur dioxide (SO 2 ), nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ), ozone and particulate pollutants (PM 2.5 , PM 10 ) were studied in conditional logistic regression models for interquartile range increments. Results: Risk of STEMI (n = 14,601) was associated with NO 2 (strongest at 15-h lag) and with PM 2.5 (strongest at 20-h lag), in single-pollutant models adjusting for air temperature and humidity (NO 2 : odds ratio (OR; 95% confidence interval) 1.065 (1.031\u20131.101); PM 2.5 : 1.026 (1.001\u20131.054)). After adjusting models for atmospheric pressure (significantly associated with STEMI risk at 14\u201324-h lags), NO 2 remained highly statistically significant (1.057 (1.022\u20131.094)) but not PM 2.5 (1.024 (0.997\u20131.052)). No associations were seen for SO 2 , ozone or PM 10 . Conclusion: Risk of STEMI rises within hours of exposure to air pollutants, with strongest impact of NO 2 . These findings are complementary to earlier reports which have not acknowledged widely the importance of very short-term fluctuations in air pollution.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Air pollution", "ST-elevation myocardial infarction", "Weather"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Air Pollutants", "Cross-Over Studies", "Electrocardiography", "Female", "Humans", "Incidence", "Male", "Risk Factors", "Seasons", "ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction", "Sweden", "Time Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85055648315", "SubjectAreas": [["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"6507365717": {"Name": "Sahl\u00e9n A.", "AuthorID": "6507365717", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Karolinska Institutet"}, "57200137228": {"Name": "Yap J.", "AuthorID": "57200137228", "AffiliationID": "60004409", "AffiliationName": "National Heart Centre Singapore"}, "16644168800": {"Name": "Yeo K.K.", "AuthorID": "16644168800", "AffiliationID": "60004409", "AffiliationName": "National Heart Centre Singapore"}, "20433957500": {"Name": "Ljungman P.", "AuthorID": "20433957500", "AffiliationID": "60026150, 60012311", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Sciences, Danderyd University Hospital, Karolinska Institutet"}, "7004161821": {"Name": "Jernberg T.", "AuthorID": "7004161821", "AffiliationID": "60026150, 60012311", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Sciences, Danderyd University Hospital, Karolinska Institutet"}, "7005319185": {"Name": "Erlinge D.", "AuthorID": "7005319185", "AffiliationID": "60029170", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Clinical Sciences, Lund University"}, "23388249600": {"Name": "Chan M.Y.", "AuthorID": "23388249600", "AffiliationID": "60106366", "AffiliationName": "National University Heart Centre"}, "6602976997": {"Name": "Hausenloy D.J.", "AuthorID": "6602976997", "AffiliationID": "60004093", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Barts Heart Centre, St Bartholomew's Hospital"}}}
