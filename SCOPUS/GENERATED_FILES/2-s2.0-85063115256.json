This prospective study investigated whether frontal lobe dysfunction is predictive of poorer psychiatric outcomes. Methods: Forty-nine unilateral TLE surgical patients were assessed using the Beck Depression Inventory\u2013Fast Screen (BDI-FS) and Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) preoperatively and 6 and 12 months postoperatively. Measures of intellectual function, semantic knowledge, memory and executive function were completed preoperatively, at 6 and 12 months following surgery. Results: Preoperatively, 33 (67%) patients had minimal depressive symptoms, 8 (16%) were mildly depressed, 2 (4%) were moderately depressed, and 6 (12%) reported severe depressive morbidity. Twenty-three (47%) patients reported minimal anxiety, 18 (37%) were mildly anxious, 6 (12%) were moderately anxious and 2 (4%) patients reported severe anxiety symptoms. A mixed-model repeated-measures analysis was performed on the BDI-FS and BAI scores, adjusting for pertinent covariates identified in univariable analyses. At a year following TLE surgery, anxiety symptoms significantly improved but depressive morbidity did not. Indicators of frontal lobe dysfunction moderated the magnitude and direction of mood change. Specifically, pre-surgical cognitive measures of frontal lobe dysfunction predicted increased depression and anxiety symptoms following surgery. There was no relationship between preoperative BDI-FS or BAI scores and seizure outcome at 12 months or change in affective morbidity and seizure outcome. Significance: This is the first longitudinal study to provide evidence that specific pre-surgical cognitive and behavioural indices of frontal dysfunction are predictive of poorer psychiatric outcome following TLE surgery. In addition, our findings highlight the potential utility of a dysexecutive behavioural rating scale (DEX) as an assessment tool in epilepsy. Examination of executive functioning in pre-surgical evaluations may lead to an increase in the power of prognostic models used to predict the psychiatric outcome of TLE surgery.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Anxiety", "Depression", "Epilepsy surgery", "Frontal lobe dysfunction", "Temporal lobe epilepsy"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Anxiety", "Cognition", "Depression", "Epilepsy, Temporal Lobe", "Female", "Frontal Lobe", "Functional Laterality", "Humans", "Logistic Models", "Longitudinal Studies", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Memory", "Middle Aged", "Neuropsychological Tests", "Neurosurgery", "Postoperative Complications", "Psychiatric Status Rating Scales", "Semantics", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85063115256", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"55994244000": {"Name": "Pope R.A.", "AuthorID": "55994244000", "AffiliationID": "60020736", "AffiliationName": "The National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "57203018933": {"Name": "Thompson P.J.", "AuthorID": "57203018933", "AffiliationID": "60020736", "AffiliationName": "The National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "15061701400": {"Name": "Rantell K.", "AuthorID": "15061701400", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Experimental Epilepsy, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology"}, "37073576600": {"Name": "Stretton J.", "AuthorID": "37073576600", "AffiliationID": "60029069", "AffiliationName": "MRC Cognition and Brain Science Unit"}, "55422866400": {"Name": "Wright M.A.", "AuthorID": "55422866400", "AffiliationID": "60020736", "AffiliationName": "The National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "6603423034": {"Name": "Foong J.", "AuthorID": "6603423034", "AffiliationID": "60020736", "AffiliationName": "The National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}}}
