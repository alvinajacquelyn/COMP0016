Methods: Professionals from four UK CAMHS tried a range of tools to support SDM. They reflected on their experiences using plan-do-study-act log books. A total of 23 professionals completed 307 logs, which were transcribed and analysed using Framework Analysis in Atlas.Ti. Results: Three states of implementation (apprehension, feeling clunky, and integration) and three aspects of clinician behavior or approach (effort, trust, and flexibility) were identified. Conclusions: Implementation of SDM in CAMHS requires key positive clinician behaviors, including preparedness to put in effort, trust in young people, and use of the approach flexibly. Practice implications: Implementation of SDM in CAMHS is effortful, and while tools may help support SDM, clinicians need to be allowed to use the tools flexibly to allow them to move from a state of apprehension through a sense of feeling \"clunky\" to integration in practice.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services", "child mental health", "implementation", "plan-do-study-act", "Shared decision making"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adolescent Health Services", "Child", "Child Health Services", "Decision Making", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Mental Health Services", "Patient Participation", "Qualitative Research", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84952803154", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Clinical Psychology", "PSYC", "3203"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"57034232000": {"Name": "Abrines-Jaume N.", "AuthorID": "57034232000", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Health Services Research and Policy, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM)"}, "57210239690": {"Name": "Hopkins K.", "AuthorID": "57210239690", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60170329", "AffiliationName": "EBPU, Anna Freud Centre, UCL"}, "56719025100": {"Name": "Hoffman J.", "AuthorID": "56719025100", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60170329", "AffiliationName": "EBPU, Anna Freud Centre, UCL"}, "6701596440": {"Name": "Wolpert M.", "AuthorID": "6701596440", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60170329", "AffiliationName": "EBPU, Anna Freud Centre, UCL"}, "57216973595": {"Name": "Midgley N.", "AuthorID": "57216973595", "AffiliationID": "60170329, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Anna Freud Centre and UCL"}, "57033466000": {"Name": "Martin K.", "AuthorID": "57033466000", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Common Room Consulting Ltd"}, "12774112700": {"Name": "Law D.", "AuthorID": "12774112700", "AffiliationID": "112910442", "AffiliationName": "Child Outcomes Research Consortium"}}}
