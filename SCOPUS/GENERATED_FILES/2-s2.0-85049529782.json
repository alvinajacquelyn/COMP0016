KGaA, WeinheimPhotodetectors, which can convert light signals into electrical signals, are important opto-electronic devices in imaging, optical communication, biomedical/biological sensing, and so on. Here a solution-processed photodetector based on the triple cation perovskite is demonstrated. The perovskite photodetectors show a high detectivity, high speed, as well as excellent environmental stability. Operating at a low voltage bias of 2 V, the photodetectors exhibit a large on/off ratio of 105, high specific detectivity of \u22481013 Jones, and a fast photoresponse with 3 dB bandwidth up to 0.82 MHz. Further analysis demonstrates that such performance originates from the modulated Schottky barrier height by illumination. The barrier suppresses dark current without any illumination, but it can be effectively lowered under illumination, thus resulting in a more efficient charge extraction and collection. The results demonstrate a great potential of triple cation perovskite in photodetection and provide a route to achieve high performance devices.", "AuthorKeywords": ["environmental stability", "photoresponse properties", "Schottky barrier", "triple cation perovskite photodetectors"], "IndexKeywords": ["Electrical signal", "Environmental stability", "High performance devices", "Photoresponses", "Schottky barrier heights", "Schottky barriers", "Solution-processed", "Specific detectivity"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85049529782", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"]], "AuthorData": {"56990540700": {"Name": "Zhang T.", "AuthorID": "56990540700", "AffiliationID": "60005465", "AffiliationName": "School of Optoelectronic Information, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China"}, "57219324275": {"Name": "Zhang P.", "AuthorID": "57219324275", "AffiliationID": "60005465", "AffiliationName": "School of Optoelectronic Information, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China"}, "57191971496": {"Name": "Ahmad W.", "AuthorID": "57191971496", "AffiliationID": "60005465", "AffiliationName": "School of Optoelectronic Information, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China"}, "55733853200": {"Name": "Wang Y.", "AuthorID": "55733853200", "AffiliationID": "60005465", "AffiliationName": "School of Optoelectronic Information, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China"}, "57196065167": {"Name": "Chen H.", "AuthorID": "57196065167", "AffiliationID": "60005465", "AffiliationName": "School of Optoelectronic Information, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China"}, "14324907400": {"Name": "Gao C.", "AuthorID": "14324907400", "AffiliationID": "60005465", "AffiliationName": "School of Optoelectronic Information, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China"}, "54079892300": {"Name": "Li S.", "AuthorID": "54079892300", "AffiliationID": "60005465", "AffiliationName": "School of Optoelectronic Information, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China"}, "10141185300": {"Name": "Wu J.", "AuthorID": "10141185300", "AffiliationID": "60005465", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Fundamental and Frontier Sciences, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China"}, "57202830100": {"Name": "Alqahtani M.", "AuthorID": "57202830100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "54780880800": {"Name": "Wang Z.", "AuthorID": "54780880800", "AffiliationID": "60005465", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Fundamental and Frontier Sciences, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China"}, "57216471973": {"Name": "Chen Z.D.", "AuthorID": "57216471973", "AffiliationID": "60015941", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering and Center for Nanoscale Science & Engineering, University of Kentucky"}}}
