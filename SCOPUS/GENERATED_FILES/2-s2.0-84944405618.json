We have investigated the kinetic stability of 147-atom Au-Ag nanoalloys with varying composition and chemical ordering using ensemble molecular dynamics simulations to replicate these high temperature conditions. Ag-rich mixed alloys undergo a diffusion-less \"martensitic\" structural transition from cuboctahedral to icosahedral; the melting temperature (Tm) of the subsequent icosahedra is dependent on the Au:Ag stoichiometry. Core@shell chemical arrangements do not behave in a similar manner: Tm strongly depends on the shell component; additionally Au55@Ag92 exhibits increased stability as a result of its icosahedral Au core. We also report a novel dependence of nanocluster phase transitions on the chemical arrangement, as shown by low temperature nonmartensitic atomic diffusion of Ag atoms to the surface for Ag55@Au92. This finding establishes why Ag@Au chemical arrangements, in particular, are difficult to maintain experimentally. Overall, the kinetic phenomena observed help to explain why particular morphologies and chemical arrangements are more abundant in experimental synthesis and how postprocessing affects structure and chemical arrangement.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Atomic diffusions", "Bimetallic nanoclusters", "Calcination temperature", "Efficient fabrication process", "High temperature condition", "Molecular dynamics simulations", "Nanoparticle synthesis", "Structural transitions"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84944405618", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Energy (all)", "ENER", "2100"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"], ["Surfaces, Coatings and Films", "MATE", "2508"]], "AuthorData": {"56379692300": {"Name": "Gould A.L.", "AuthorID": "56379692300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Kathleen Lonsdale Materials Chemistry, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "56488383400": {"Name": "Catlow C.R.A.", "AuthorID": "56488383400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Kathleen Lonsdale Materials Chemistry, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "26639651700": {"Name": "Logsdail A.J.", "AuthorID": "26639651700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Kathleen Lonsdale Materials Chemistry, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}}}
