Here, we evaluated whether the Maastricht Acute Stress Test (MAST), a potent stress protocol that combines physical and psychosocial stress components, can be used to reliably elicit subjective and neuroendocrine stress responses multiple times. Sixty healthy undergraduate participants were exposed to the MAST on three occasions, with intervals of three-weeks and one-month in between sessions. Results showed no significant signs of habituation or sensitization to the MAST in terms of subjective or physiological (salivary alpha-amylase and cortisol) stress reactivity. Fifty-nine percent of the sample displayed a significant physiological stress response (i.e., cortisol) to two MAST exposures and 57% to every MAST exposure. This study demonstrates that the MAST can be used to repeatedly induce significant stress responses.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cortisol", "Maastricht Acute Stress Test (MAST)", "Repeated stress protocols", "Stress habituation", "Stress sensitization"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Female", "Habituation, Psychophysiologic", "Humans", "Hydrocortisone", "Hypothalamo-Hypophyseal System", "Male", "Pituitary-Adrenal System", "Saliva", "Salivary alpha-Amylases", "Stress, Physiological", "Stress, Psychological", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85008457488", "SubjectAreas": [["Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism", "MEDI", "2712"], ["Endocrinology", "BIOC", "1310"], ["Endocrine and Autonomic Systems", "NEUR", "2807"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"], ["Biological Psychiatry", "NEUR", "2803"]], "AuthorData": {"55216586100": {"Name": "Quaedflieg C.", "AuthorID": "55216586100", "AffiliationID": "60018869", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Psychology and Neuroscience, Maastricht University"}, "37001921200": {"Name": "Meyer T.", "AuthorID": "37001921200", "AffiliationID": "60016529", "AffiliationName": "Behavioral Science Institute, Radboud University Nijmegen"}, "14623381100": {"Name": "van Ruitenbeek P.", "AuthorID": "14623381100", "AffiliationID": "60018869", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Psychology and Neuroscience, Maastricht University"}, "35234988100": {"Name": "Smeets T.", "AuthorID": "35234988100", "AffiliationID": "60018869", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Psychology and Neuroscience, Maastricht University"}}}
