There are, however, no longitudinal studies investigating if CSF markers of neuroinflammation and neuronal injury predict clinical outcomes in patients with bipolar disorder. We have in previous studies found higher CSF concentrations of interleukin-8 (IL-8), monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1/CCL-2), chitinase-3-like protein 1 (CHI3L1/YKL-40), and neurofilament light chain (NF-L) in euthymic patients with bipolar disorder compared with controls. Here, we investigated the relationship of these CSF markers of neuroinflammation and neuronal injury with clinical outcomes in a prospective study. 77 patients with CSF analyzed at baseline were followed for 6\u20137 years. Associations of baseline biomarkers with clinical outcomes (manic/hypomanic and depressive episodes, suicide attempts, psychotic symptoms, inpatient care, GAF score change) were investigated. Baseline MCP-1 concentrations were positively associated with manic/hypomanic episodes and inpatient care during follow-up. YKL-40 concentrations were negatively associated with manic/hypomanic episodes and with occurrence of psychotic symptoms. The prospective negative association between YKL-40 and manic/hypomanic episodes survived multiple testing correction. Concentrations of IL-8 and NF-L were not associated with clinical outcomes. High concentrations of these selected CSF markers of neuroinflammation and neuronal injury at baseline were not consistently associated with poor clinical outcomes in this prospective study. The assessed proteins may be involved in adaptive immune processes or reflect a state of vulnerability for bipolar disorder rather than being of predictive value for disease progression.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bipolar disorder", "Cerebrospinal fluid", "Cytokines", "Disease progression", "Microglia", "Neuroinflammation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Biomarkers", "Bipolar Disorder", "Chemokine CCL2", "Chitinase-3-Like Protein 1", "Cytokines", "Female", "Humans", "Interleukin-8", "Longitudinal Studies", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Neurofilament Proteins", "Neuroimmunomodulation", "Neurons", "Prognosis", "Prospective Studies", "Psychotic Disorders", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85019130221", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"], ["Endocrine and Autonomic Systems", "NEUR", "2807"], ["Behavioral Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2802"]], "AuthorData": {"53877274400": {"Name": "Isgren A.", "AuthorID": "53877274400", "AffiliationID": "60027675, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, Department of Psychiatry and Neurochemistry, The Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg"}, "16238630700": {"Name": "Holm\u00e9n-Larsson J.", "AuthorID": "16238630700", "AffiliationID": "60027675, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, Department of Psychiatry and Neurochemistry, The Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg"}, "56415176000": {"Name": "Blennow K.", "AuthorID": "56415176000", "AffiliationID": "60031699", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Neurochemistry Laboratory, Sahlgrenska University Hospital"}, "6701454676": {"Name": "Zetterberg H.", "AuthorID": "6701454676", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "55508135900": {"Name": "Jakobsson J.", "AuthorID": "55508135900", "AffiliationID": "60027675, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, Department of Psychiatry and Neurochemistry, The Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg"}, "7004259279": {"Name": "Land\u00e9n M.", "AuthorID": "7004259279", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Karolinska Institutet"}, "37020689800": {"Name": "Sellgren C.", "AuthorID": "37020689800", "AffiliationID": "60029929, 60002746", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School"}, "56116170200": {"Name": "Ekman C.", "AuthorID": "56116170200", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Neuroscience, Karolinska Institutet"}}}
