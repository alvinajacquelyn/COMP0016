A total of 174 toxicology-related in vitro/vivo experimental datasets were used for model construction and Mondrian conformal prediction was used to estimate the confidence of the resulting predictions. Toxic substructure analysis is also implemented in eMolTox. eMolTox predicts and displays a wealth of information of potential molecular toxicities for safety analysis in drug development. Availability and implementation: The eMolTox Server is freely available for use on the web at http://xundrug.cn/moltox. Supplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Carcinogens", "Humans", "Mutagens", "Software", "Toxicology"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85062398971", "SubjectAreas": [["Statistics and Probability", "MATH", "2613"], ["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Computational Theory and Mathematics", "COMP", "1703"], ["Computational Mathematics", "MATH", "2605"]], "AuthorData": {"27567812000": {"Name": "Ji C.", "AuthorID": "27567812000", "AffiliationID": "120609453", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Center for Molecular Informatics"}, "6603427180": {"Name": "Svensson F.", "AuthorID": "6603427180", "AffiliationID": "60022446", "AffiliationName": "IOTA Pharmaceuticals, St John's Innovation Centre"}, "55921902800": {"Name": "Zoufir A.", "AuthorID": "55921902800", "AffiliationID": "120609453", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Center for Molecular Informatics"}, "8779307500": {"Name": "Bender A.", "AuthorID": "8779307500", "AffiliationID": "120609453", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Center for Molecular Informatics"}}}
