However, none of the previous studies investigated the influences of dissolved gas content of the oil and oil composition, on the new gaseous phase. This study attempts to provide insights on this area. Based on the results, during CWI as CO2 partitions into the oil the dissolved gas of the oil liberates, which leads to in-situ new gaseous phase formation. The dissolved gas content of the crude oil has a direct impact on the saturation and growth rate of the new gaseous phase. The new gaseous phase doesn\u2019t form for oils that have an infinite capacity for dissolving CO2, such as light pure hydrocarbon components. Oils with limited capacity for dissolving CO2, such as heavy hydrocarbon components, are responsible for the formation of the new gaseous phase. Therefore for a live crude oil, the relatively heavier fractions of oil are responsible for triggering of the new gaseous phase and light to intermediate oil components control the further growth of the new gaseous phase.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85064331693", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"56856681900": {"Name": "Seyyedi M.", "AuthorID": "56856681900", "AffiliationID": "115385861", "AffiliationName": "CSIRO Energy, Australian Resources Research Centre (ARRC)"}, "7007177714": {"Name": "Sohrabi M.", "AuthorID": "7007177714", "AffiliationID": "60019656", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Enhanced Oil Recovery and CO2 solutions, Heriot-Watt University"}, "56316281400": {"Name": "Mahzari P.", "AuthorID": "56316281400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, University College London"}}}
