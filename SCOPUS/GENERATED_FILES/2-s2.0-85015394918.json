These arguments are supported by a study of the dispersion relation derived to describe such processes as a function of the cut-off energy. This shows that the position of the virtual bound state is independent of the cut-off energy.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85015394918", "SubjectAreas": [["Nuclear and High Energy Physics", "PHYS", "3106"]], "AuthorData": {"6701768658": {"Name": "F\u00e4ldt G.", "AuthorID": "6701768658", "AffiliationID": "60003858", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, Uppsala University"}, "7003313816": {"Name": "Wilkin C.", "AuthorID": "7003313816", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Physics and Astronomy Department, UCL"}}}
