However, the trial was underpowered to address the effect of routine induction of labour on the risk of perinatal death. We aimed to determine the association between induction of labour at \u226539 weeks and the risk of perinatal mortality among nulliparous women aged \u226535 years. Methods and findings: We used English Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) data collected between April 2009 and March 2014 to compare perinatal mortality between induction of labour at 39, 40, and 41 weeks of gestation and expectant management (continuation of pregnancy to either spontaneous labour, induction of labour, or caesarean section at a later gestation). Analysis was by multivariable Poisson regression with adjustment for maternal characteristics and pregnancy-related conditions. Among the cohort of 77,327 nulliparous women aged 35 to 50 years delivering a singleton infant, 33.1% had labour induced: these women tended to be older and more likely to have medical complications of pregnancy, and the infants were more likely to be small for gestational age. Induction of labour at 40 weeks (compared with expectant management) was associated with a lower risk of in-hospital perinatal death (0.08% versus 0.26%; adjusted risk ratio [adjRR] 0.33; 95% CI 0.13\u20130.80, P = 0.015) and meconium aspiration syndrome (0.44% versus 0.86%; adjRR 0.52; 95% CI 0.35\u20130.78, P = 0.002). Induction at 40 weeks was also associated with a slightly increased risk of instrumental vaginal delivery (adjRR 1.06; 95% CI 1.01\u20131.11, P = 0.020) and emergency caesarean section (adjRR 1.05; 95% CI 1.01\u20131.09, P = 0.019). The number needed to treat (NNT) analysis indicated that 562 (95% CI 366\u20131,210) inductions of labour at 40 weeks would be required to prevent 1 perinatal death. Limitations of the study include the reliance on observational data in which gestational age is recorded in weeks rather than days. There is also the potential for unmeasured confounders and under-recording of induction of labour or perinatal death in the dataset. Conclusions: Bringing forward the routine offer of induction of labour from the current recommendation of 41\u201342 weeks to 40 weeks of gestation in nulliparous women aged \u226535 years may reduce overall rates of perinatal death.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Age Factors", "Cohort Studies", "Female", "Humans", "Infant, Newborn", "Labor, Induced", "Labor, Obstetric", "Maternal Age", "Middle Aged", "Parity", "Perinatal Mortality", "Pregnancy", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85036575613", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"55702967800": {"Name": "Knight H.E.", "AuthorID": "55702967800", "AffiliationID": "60113763", "AffiliationName": "Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists"}, "26040692500": {"Name": "Cromwell D.A.", "AuthorID": "26040692500", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Health Services Research and Policy, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"}, "15834690800": {"Name": "Gurol-Urganci I.", "AuthorID": "15834690800", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Health Services Research and Policy, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"}, "55249873300": {"Name": "Harron K.", "AuthorID": "55249873300", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Health Services Research and Policy, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"}, "7102799145": {"Name": "van der Meulen J.H.", "AuthorID": "7102799145", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Health Services Research and Policy, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"}, "7406742171": {"Name": "Smith G.C.S.", "AuthorID": "7406742171", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, University of Cambridge, NIHR Cambridge Comprehensive Biomedical Research Centre"}}}
