I argued that a new conception of scientific method is required to subject this problematic presupposition to critical attention so that it may be improved as science proceeds. This view has implications for the study of the metaphysics of science. The view has however been ignored by recent contributions to the field. Broader implications of the view are indicated. Finally, reasons for the neglect of the view are considered.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Aim-oriented empiricism", "Metaphysics of science", "Philosophy of physics", "Physicalism", "Problem of induction", "Scientific method", "Scientific progress", "Theory unity"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85062795627", "SubjectAreas": [["Philosophy", "ARTS", "1211"]], "AuthorData": {"7004686297": {"Name": "Maxwell N.", "AuthorID": "7004686297", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Science and Technology Studies, University College London"}}}
