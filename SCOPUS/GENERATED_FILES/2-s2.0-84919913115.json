It is used for a wide range of purposes, including communications, radio and television broadcasting, radionavigation, and sensing. Radar represents a fundamentally important use of the electromagnetic (EM) spectrum, in applications which include air traffic control, geophysical monitoring of Earth resources from space, automotive safety, severe weather tracking, and surveillance for defense and security. Nearly all services have a need for greater bandwidth, which means that there will be ever-greater competition for this finite resource. The paper explains the nature of the spectrum congestion problem from a radar perspective, and describes a number of possible approaches to its solution both from technical and regulatory points of view. These include improved transmitter spectral purity, passive radar, and intelligent, cognitive approaches that dynamically optimize spectrum use.", "AuthorKeywords": ["interference", "radar", "radar transmitters", "radio broadcast transmitters", "radio communication"], "IndexKeywords": ["Automotive safety", "Cognitive approaches", "Electromagnetic spectra", "Geophysical monitoring", "Radio frequencies", "Regulatory issues", "Spectral purity", "Spectrum congestion"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84919913115", "SubjectAreas": [["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"7202821654": {"Name": "Griffiths H.", "AuthorID": "7202821654", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "7202546334": {"Name": "Watts S.", "AuthorID": "7202546334", "AffiliationID": "60019269", "AffiliationName": "Thales, Crawley"}, "7403929310": {"Name": "Cohen L.", "AuthorID": "7403929310", "AffiliationID": "60027271", "AffiliationName": "Radar Division, Naval Research Laboratory"}, "6603179063": {"Name": "Mokole E.", "AuthorID": "6603179063", "AffiliationID": "60027271", "AffiliationName": "Radar Division, Naval Research Laboratory"}, "7403629358": {"Name": "Baker C.", "AuthorID": "7403629358", "AffiliationID": "60003500", "AffiliationName": "Ohio State University"}, "7005187912": {"Name": "Wicks M.", "AuthorID": "7005187912", "AffiliationID": "60008609", "AffiliationName": "University of Dayton"}, "57193611693": {"Name": "Blunt S.", "AuthorID": "57193611693", "AffiliationID": "115014862", "AffiliationName": "University of Kansas"}}}
