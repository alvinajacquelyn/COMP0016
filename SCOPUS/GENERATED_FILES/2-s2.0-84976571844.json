Rietveld refinement was performed with the software package GSAS yielding orthorhombic lattice parameters of a = 19.7685(4), b = 15.0697(4), and c = 7.6704(2) \u00c5 (C24H34N2O5, Z = 4, space group P212121). The Rietveld refinement results were compared with density functional theory (DFT) calculations performed with CRYSTAL14. While the structures are similar, discrepancies are observed in the configuration of the octahydroindole ring between the Rietveld and DFT structures, suggesting the refined and calculated molecules are diastereomers.", "AuthorKeywords": ["density functional theory", "powder diffraction", "structure solution", "trandolapril"], "IndexKeywords": ["Diastereomers", "Orthorhombic lattices", "Parallel tempering", "Powder diffraction", "Powder diffraction files", "Space Groups", "Structure solutions", "Trandolapril"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84976571844", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiation", "PHYS", "3108"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Instrumentation", "PHYS", "3105"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"]], "AuthorData": {"7404547958": {"Name": "Reid J.W.", "AuthorID": "7404547958", "AffiliationID": "60110902", "AffiliationName": "Canadian Light Source"}, "7003524081": {"Name": "Kaduk J.A.", "AuthorID": "7003524081", "AffiliationID": "60002873", "AffiliationName": "Illinois Institute of Technology"}, "36893205700": {"Name": "Vickers M.", "AuthorID": "36893205700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}}}
