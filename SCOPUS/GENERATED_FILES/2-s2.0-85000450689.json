In this work, we study the dynamic behavior of room-temperature ionic liquids using a classical time-dependent density functional theory that accounts for the molecular excluded volume effects, the electrostatic correlations, and the dispersion forces. While the conventional models predict a monotonic increase of the surface charge with time upon application of an electrode voltage, our results show that dispersion between ions results in a non-monotonic increase of the surface charge with the duration of charging. Furthermore, we investigate the effects of van der Waals attraction between electrode/ionic-liquid interactions on the charging processes.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Design and Development", "Electric double layer", "Electrochemical devices", "Electrostatic correlation", "Excluded volume effects", "Room temperature ionic liquids", "Time dependent density functional theory", "Van der Waals attraction"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85000450689", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"]], "AuthorData": {"55571313700": {"Name": "Lian C.", "AuthorID": "55571313700", "AffiliationID": "60029526", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical and Environmental Engineering, University of California"}, "36969286100": {"Name": "Zhao S.", "AuthorID": "36969286100", "AffiliationID": "60011069, 60117934", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Chemical Engineering, School of Chemistry and Molecular Engineering, East China University of Science and Technology"}, "34570619200": {"Name": "Liu H.", "AuthorID": "34570619200", "AffiliationID": "60011069, 60117934", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Chemical Engineering, School of Chemistry and Molecular Engineering, East China University of Science and Technology"}, "57203272553": {"Name": "Wu J.", "AuthorID": "57203272553", "AffiliationID": "60029526", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical and Environmental Engineering, University of California"}}}
