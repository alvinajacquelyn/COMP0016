The venerable but now dated ex vivo Brodmann map is currently being superseded by in vivo techniques that can better take into account intersubject variability. One popular in vivo method focusses on myeloarchitecture by measuring T1. This, however, probes only one aspect of cortical microstructure and is less useful in regions of low myelination. In contrast, diffusion MRI (dMRI) is sensitive to several additional microstructural features and can potentially provide a richer set of information regarding the architecture of grey matter microcircuitry. The following study used 3T HARDI data of multiple subjects to produce an entirely unsupervised, hemisphere-wide, group-average, parcellation. A qualitative assessment of the resulting cortical parcellation demonstrates several spatially coherent clusters in areas corresponding to well known functional anatomical areas. In addition, it exhibits some cluster boundaries that correlate with independently derived myelin mapping data for the same set of subjects, whilst also providing distinct clusters in areas (e.g., within MT+) where myelination is a less informative measurement.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Cluster boundaries", "Coherent clusters", "Cytoarchitecture", "Diffusion mris", "Grey matters", "Microstructural features", "Qualitative assessments", "Structure-function relationship"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85019744477", "SubjectAreas": [["Modeling and Simulation", "MATH", "2611"], ["Geometry and Topology", "MATH", "2608"], ["Computer Graphics and Computer-Aided Design", "COMP", "1704"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"57194331632": {"Name": "Ganepola T.", "AuthorID": "57194331632", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, Centre for Medical Image Computing, University College London"}, "7005050489": {"Name": "Sereno M.", "AuthorID": "7005050489", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cognitive, Perceptual and Brain Sciences, University College London"}, "7402830766": {"Name": "Alexander D.", "AuthorID": "7402830766", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, Centre for Medical Image Computing, University College London"}, "57213639593": {"Name": "Nagy Z.", "AuthorID": "57213639593", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60084279", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, UCL Institute of Neurology"}}}
