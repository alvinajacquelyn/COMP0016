Our study aims to unravel the \u201cblack box\u201d of multiplex value cocreation by investigating the processes and mechanisms through which actors manage the temporal nature of value cocreation in unique service exchanges. The research design is a multiple case study comprising four firms engaged in the definition, design, and delivery of mega-infrastructure projects. Our results showed that multiplex value cocreation involves two core processes of institutional work and resource reconfiguration that are reciprocally interrelated, driven by actor motives and conflicts and facilitated by interaction mechanisms. We further propose that emerged institutions and existing previous similar service exchanges may eliminate the need for multiplex value cocreation in routine service exchanges.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Project", "Service dominant logic", "Service ecosystem", "Temporal", "Unique service", "Value co-creation"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85057221608", "SubjectAreas": [["Marketing", "BUSI", "1406"]], "AuthorData": {"56548961500": {"Name": "Razmdoost K.", "AuthorID": "56548961500", "AffiliationID": "60112562", "AffiliationName": "ESCP Europe Business School"}, "55772296500": {"Name": "Alinaghian L.", "AuthorID": "55772296500", "AffiliationID": "60116362, 60004407", "AffiliationName": "Cranfield University, Cranfield School of Management"}, "13410539800": {"Name": "Smyth H.J.", "AuthorID": "13410539800", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, The Bartlett School of Construction and Project Management"}}}
