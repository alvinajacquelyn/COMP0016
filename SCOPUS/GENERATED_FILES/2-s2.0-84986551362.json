Background Most western infants develop long night-time sleep periods by four months of age. However, 30% of infants in many countries sleep for short periods and cry out on waking in the night: the most common type of infant sleep behaviour problem. Preventive interventions may help families and improve services. There is evidence that 'limit-setting' parenting, which is common in western cultures, supports the development of settled infant night-time behaviour. However, a recent review has challenged this and argued that this form of parenting risks distressing infants. This study describes limit-setting parenting as practiced in London, compares it with 'infant-cued' parenting and measures the associated infant distress. Methods Longitudinal infrared video, diary and questionnaire observations comparing a General-Community (n=101) group and subgroups with a Bed-Sharing (n=19) group on measures of infant and parenting behaviours at night. Findings General-Community parents took longer to detect and respond to infant waking and signalling, and to begin feeding, compared with the highly infant-cued care provided by Bed-Sharing parents. The average latency in General-Community parents' responding to infant night-time waking was 3.5 min, during which infants fuss/cried for around 1 min. Compared with Bed-Sharing parenting, General-Community parenting was associated with increased infant distress of around 30 min/night at two weeks, reducing to 12 min/night by three months of age. However, differences in infant distress between General-Community subgroups adopting limit-setting versus infant-cued parenting were not large or statistically significant at any age. The figures provide descriptive evidence about limit-setting parenting which may counter some doubts about this form of parenting and help parents and professionals to make choices.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Infant crying", "infant sleeping", "parenting"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Crying", "Female", "Humans", "Infant", "Infant Care", "Infant, Newborn", "London", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Parenting", "Parents", "Sleep"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84986551362", "SubjectAreas": [["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"], ["Care Planning", "NURS", "2904"]], "AuthorData": {"6603829823": {"Name": "St James-Roberts I.", "AuthorID": "6603829823", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Thomas Coram Research Unit, UCL Institute of Education, University College London"}, "35788549800": {"Name": "Roberts M.", "AuthorID": "35788549800", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Thomas Coram Research Unit, UCL Institute of Education, University College London"}, "36542350100": {"Name": "Hovish K.", "AuthorID": "36542350100", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Thomas Coram Research Unit, UCL Institute of Education, University College London"}, "16943959900": {"Name": "Owen C.", "AuthorID": "16943959900", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Thomas Coram Research Unit, UCL Institute of Education, University College London"}}}
