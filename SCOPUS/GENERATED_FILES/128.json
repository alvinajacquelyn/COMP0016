To examine the association between socioeconomic status (SES) and delay to a pediatric rheumatology clinic, disease severity, and illness perception in patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis in England. Methods. Using the Index of Multiple Deprivation, 923 consecutive children from the Childhood Arthritis Prospective Study were assigned to SES groups: high-SES (19.1%), middle-SES (44.5%), or low-SES (36.4%). At baseline, disease activity was assessed, and the Childhood Health Assessment Questionnaire (C-HAQ), the Illness Perception Questionnaire, and the Child Health Questionnaire, version Parent Form 50, were completed. Linear median regression analyses or zero-inflated negative binominal (ZINB) regression analyses were used. Results. Delay to first pediatric rheumatology consultation was the same between the 3 SES groups. Although disease activity scores assessed by the pediatric rheumatologist did not differ between the 3 SES groups, persons in the low-SES group recorded higher C-HAQ scores compared to the high-SES group (zero-inflated part of ZINB odds ratio 0.28 [95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.14, 0.55], count part of ZINB \u03b2 0.26 [95% CI 0.05, 0.48]). Parents with low SES also reported more often that their children's school work or activities with friends had been limited. Furthermore, the low-SES group had a worse perception about the consequences of the disease and the effect of treatment than those in the high-SES group. Conclusion. Patients from a low-SES background report more problems with daily activities and have a lower perception of the consequences of the disease than patients from a high-SES background, warranting special attention from a multidisciplinary team.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Activities of Daily Living", "Adolescent", "Arthritis, Juvenile", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Cost of Illness", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Disability Evaluation", "England", "Female", "Health Services Accessibility", "Health Status Disparities", "Humans", "Linear Models", "Male", "Motor Activity", "Odds Ratio", "Predictive Value of Tests", "Prognosis", "Prospective Studies", "Questionnaires", "Referral and Consultation", "Rheumatology", "Self Concept", "Severity of Illness Index", "Social Class"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84923297253", "SubjectAreas": [["Rheumatology", "MEDI", "2745"]], "AuthorData": {"6603191436": {"Name": "Verstappen S.M.M.", "AuthorID": "6603191436", "AffiliationID": "60003771, 60172861", "AffiliationName": "Arthritis Research UK Centre for Epidemiology, Institute of Inflammation and Repair, University of Manchester"}, "55243689300": {"Name": "Cobb J.", "AuthorID": "55243689300", "AffiliationID": "60003771, 60172861", "AffiliationName": "Arthritis Research UK Centre for Epidemiology, Institute of Inflammation and Repair, University of Manchester"}, "7801500474": {"Name": "Hyrich K.L.", "AuthorID": "7801500474", "AffiliationID": "60003771, 60172861", "AffiliationName": "Arthritis Research UK Centre for Epidemiology, Institute of Inflammation and Repair, University of Manchester"}, "55523890900": {"Name": "Foster H.E.", "AuthorID": "55523890900", "AffiliationID": "60006222, 60001239", "AffiliationName": "Newcastle University and Great North Children's Hospital, Newcastle Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "56524894500": {"Name": "Fu B.O.", "AuthorID": "56524894500", "AffiliationID": "60003771, 60111801", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Musculoskeletal Research, Manchester Academic Health Science Centre, and Institute of Population Health, University of Manchester"}, "6602844611": {"Name": "Baildam E.", "AuthorID": "6602844611", "AffiliationID": "60024857", "AffiliationName": "Alder Hey Children's Foundation NHS Trust, Hospital"}, "7004250589": {"Name": "Wedderburn L.R.", "AuthorID": "7004250589", "AffiliationID": "60024544, 60012662, 60022148, 60018207", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Child Health, Arthritis Research UK Centre for Adolescent Rheumatology at UCL, UCLH and GOSH, Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "12783343700": {"Name": "Davidson J.E.", "AuthorID": "12783343700", "AffiliationID": "60001060", "AffiliationName": "Royal Hospital for Sick Children"}, "55865491600": {"Name": "Ioannou J.", "AuthorID": "55865491600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Arthritis Research UK Centre for Adolescent Rheumatology, University College London"}, "35933205600": {"Name": "Chieng A.", "AuthorID": "35933205600", "AffiliationID": "60023969", "AffiliationName": "Royal Manchester Children s Hospital"}, "7201689098": {"Name": "Thomson W.", "AuthorID": "7201689098", "AffiliationID": "60003771, 60120605, 60111801", "AffiliationName": "University of Manchester, Central Manchester NHS Foundation Trust, Manchester Academic Health Sciences Centre"}}}
