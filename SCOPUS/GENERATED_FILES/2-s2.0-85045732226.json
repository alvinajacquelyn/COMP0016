Transplantation of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) genetically corrected with early murine leukemia retrovirus (MLV)-derived gammaretroviral vectors showed restoration of T cell immunity in patients, but it resulted in vector-induced insertional oncogenesis. We developed a self-inactivating (SIN) lentiviral vector carrying a codon-optimized human IL2RG cDNA driven by the EF1\u03b1 short promoter (EFS-IL2RG), and we tested its efficacy and safety in vivo by transplanting transduced Il2rg-deficient Lin\u2212 HSPCs in an Il2rg\u2212/\u2212/Rag2\u2212/\u2212 mouse model. The study showed restoration of T, B, and NK cell counts in bone marrow and peripheral blood and normalization of thymus and spleen cellularity and architecture. High-definition insertion site analysis defined the EFS-IL2RG genomic integration profile, and it showed no sign of vector-induced clonal selection or skewing in primarily and secondarily transplanted animals. The study enables a phase I/II clinical trial aimed at restoring both T and B cell immunity in SCID-X1 children upon non-myeloablative conditioning.", "AuthorKeywords": ["gene therapy", "genotoxicity", "immunodeficiency", "integration", "lentiviral vector", "SCID-X1"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85045732226", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Medicine", "BIOC", "1313"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"]], "AuthorData": {"25655343700": {"Name": "Poletti V.", "AuthorID": "25655343700", "AffiliationID": "60006105", "AffiliationName": "Genethon"}, "6603919598": {"Name": "Charrier S.", "AuthorID": "6603919598", "AffiliationID": "60006105", "AffiliationName": "Genethon"}, "37085133000": {"Name": "Corre G.", "AuthorID": "37085133000", "AffiliationID": "60006105", "AffiliationName": "Genethon"}, "6507665927": {"Name": "Gjata B.", "AuthorID": "6507665927", "AffiliationID": "60006105", "AffiliationName": "Genethon"}, "8285006300": {"Name": "Vignaud A.", "AuthorID": "8285006300", "AffiliationID": "60006105", "AffiliationName": "Genethon"}, "55495273000": {"Name": "Zhang F.", "AuthorID": "55495273000", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "7003891382": {"Name": "Gaspar H.B.", "AuthorID": "7003891382", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "7005085037": {"Name": "Thrasher A.J.", "AuthorID": "7005085037", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "56661903100": {"Name": "Rothe M.", "AuthorID": "56661903100", "AffiliationID": "60024052", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Experimental Hematology, Hannover Medical School (MHH)"}, "6507714915": {"Name": "Schambach A.", "AuthorID": "6507714915", "AffiliationID": "60024052", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Experimental Hematology, Hannover Medical School (MHH)"}, "7006100372": {"Name": "Mavilio F.", "AuthorID": "7006100372", "AffiliationID": "60123804, 60123796", "AffiliationName": "Imagine Institute, Paris Descartes-Sorbonne Cit\u00e9 University"}}}
