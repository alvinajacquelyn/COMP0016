We show that such circuits can evaluate every monotone Boolean function. By using two vertices to encode each logical bit, we obtain universal computation. We also highlight a phenomenon of \u201cback forcing\u201d as a property of each function. Such a phenomenon occurs in a circuit when the input of gates which have been already used at a given time step is further modified by a computation actually performed at a later stage. Finally, we show that zero forcing can be also used to implement reversible computation. The model introduced here provides a potentially new tool in the analysis of Boolean functions, with particular attention to monotonicity. Moreover, in the light of applications of zero forcing in quantum mechanics, the link with Boolean functions may suggest a new directions in quantum control theory and in the study of engineered quantum spin systems. It is an open technical problem to verify whether there is a link between zero forcing and computation with contact circuits.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Adiabatic quantum computation", "Logic circuits", "Zero forcing"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adiabatic quantum computation", "Monotone Boolean functions", "Monotonicity", "Quantum control theories", "Quantum spin systems", "Reversible computations", "Universal computations", "Zero-forcing"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84939650771", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"]], "AuthorData": {"8432158100": {"Name": "Burgarth D.", "AuthorID": "8432158100", "AffiliationID": "60030514", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics and Physics, Aberystwyth University"}, "7004137815": {"Name": "Giovannetti V.", "AuthorID": "7004137815", "AffiliationID": "60030674, 60021199", "AffiliationName": "NEST, Scuola Normale Superiore and Istituto Nanoscienze-CNR"}, "6602178055": {"Name": "Hogben L.", "AuthorID": "6602178055", "AffiliationID": "60026185", "AffiliationName": "American Institute of Mathematics"}, "37071422400": {"Name": "Young M.", "AuthorID": "37071422400", "AffiliationID": "60004354", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, Iowa State University"}, "8984521800": {"Name": "Severini S.", "AuthorID": "8984521800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}}}
