However, allogeneic T cell therapies must address HLA barriers and conventionally rely on the availability of a suitable HLA-matched donor if graft-vs-host-disease and rejection effects are to be avoided. More recently, the incorporation of additional genome editing manipulations, to disrupt T cell receptor expression and address other critical pathways have been explored. Clinical trials are underway investigating non-HLA matched T cells expressing anti-CD19 CARs for the treatment of B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) and anti-CD123 CAR for acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Such approaches continue to be refined and improved to widen accessibility and reduce the cost of T cell therapies for a wider range of conditions.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Humans", "Immunotherapy, Adoptive", "Leukemia", "Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute", "Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma", "Receptors, Chimeric Antigen", "Transplantation, Homologous"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85060863692", "SubjectAreas": [["Hematology", "MEDI", "2720"]], "AuthorData": {"11739326500": {"Name": "Qasim W.", "AuthorID": "11739326500", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}}}
