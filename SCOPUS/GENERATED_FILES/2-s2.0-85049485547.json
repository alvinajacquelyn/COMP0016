Correspondingly, the economy-environment-society nexus should be incorporated into city-scale CO2 accounting. Therefore, in this study, the semi-closed IO model is integrated with a HEM to calculate CO2 emissions arising from the social consumption pattern and income distribution, and to explore economic drivers behind CO2 variations. This method is applied to a case study of Beijing. Result demonstrate that Beijing in 2012 witnessed something different from that in 2005: (1) CO2 emissions centred in the internal linkages of a broader class of consumption terms with high economic output, mainly driven by interprovincial exports; (2) imports increasingly helped decarbonize the mixed, net forward and backward CO2 linkages of consumption items; and (3) income-driven CO2 emissions excluding demand-side parts persisted, which were more obvious on the supply side where households have more economy-wide effects. Besides, urban households played an essential role in household-wide CO2 reductions. This paper ended with corresponding conclusions, policy implications and directions for future work.", "AuthorKeywords": ["City", "CO2 emissions", "Hypothetical extraction method", "Income distribution", "Semi-closed input\u2013output model", "Social consumption pattern", "Sustainability"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85049485547", "SubjectAreas": [["Environmental Science (all)", "ENVI", "2300"], ["Economics and Econometrics", "ECON", "2002"]], "AuthorData": {"56599515600": {"Name": "Tian J.", "AuthorID": "56599515600", "AffiliationID": "60028442", "AffiliationName": "Environmental Modelling Laboratory, Department of Chemical and Environmental Engineering, Technical University of Madrid (UPM)"}, "57202878882": {"Name": "Wang F.", "AuthorID": "57202878882", "AffiliationID": "60016835", "AffiliationName": "Beijing Key Laboratory of Energy Economics and Environmental Management"}, "55222159400": {"Name": "Liao H.", "AuthorID": "55222159400", "AffiliationID": "60016835", "AffiliationName": "Beijing Key Laboratory of Energy Economics and Environmental Management"}, "15839411900": {"Name": "Guan D.", "AuthorID": "15839411900", "AffiliationID": "60000112", "AffiliationName": "School of International Development, University of East Anglia"}, "23983113900": {"Name": "Lumbreras J.", "AuthorID": "23983113900", "AffiliationID": "60006332", "AffiliationName": "Harvard Kennedy School (HKS)"}, "57202821535": {"Name": "Andraded C.", "AuthorID": "57202821535", "AffiliationID": "60013710", "AffiliationName": "School of Management, Universidade Federal da Bahia (UFBA)"}}}
