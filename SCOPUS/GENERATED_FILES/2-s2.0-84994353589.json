The PT single phase powder was detected by X-ray diffraction where the phase obtained by sintering at 700 \u00b0C for 2 h. Morphology of the ceramics powder were studied using SEM\u2013EDS. It was found that the particle size tend to increase with increasing sintering temperature. Hot stage microscope has been used to investigate the sintering curve of the calcined powder. The pure calcined powder was prepared as humidity sensors by the screen-printing technique. Thereafter, DC resistance measurements were performed in the presence of relative humidity at room temperature where the powder shows a poor sensitivity towards relative humidity. The phase transition from ferroelectric to paraelectric was identified by differential thermal analysis, and was detected at 493 \u00b0C. The difference between using alumina and platinum crucibles during processing has been discussed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Lead titanate", "Phase formation", "Relative humidity", "Sintering", "Solid-state reaction"], "IndexKeywords": ["Hot stage microscopes", "Humidity sensing property", "Phase formations", "Platinum crucibles", "Screen printing technique", "Single-phase powders", "Sintering temperatures", "Solid-state reaction techniques"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84994353589", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Mechanics of Materials", "ENGI", "2211"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"]], "AuthorData": {"57188671930": {"Name": "Mahmoud A.E.r.", "AuthorID": "57188671930", "AffiliationID": "122210499", "AffiliationName": "Department of Applied Science and Technology, Institute of Materials Physics and Engineering"}, "17347220500": {"Name": "Viola G.", "AuthorID": "17347220500", "AffiliationID": "122210499", "AffiliationName": "Department of Applied Science and Technology, Institute of Materials Physics and Engineering"}, "56770951800": {"Name": "Afify A.S.", "AuthorID": "56770951800", "AffiliationID": "122210499", "AffiliationName": "Department of Applied Science and Technology, Institute of Materials Physics and Engineering"}, "7004824296": {"Name": "Ferraris M.", "AuthorID": "7004824296", "AffiliationID": "122210499", "AffiliationName": "Department of Applied Science and Technology, Institute of Materials Physics and Engineering"}, "57188671595": {"Name": "Babeer A.M.", "AuthorID": "57188671595", "AffiliationID": "60106293", "AffiliationName": "Physics Department, Faculty of Science, Jazan University"}}}
