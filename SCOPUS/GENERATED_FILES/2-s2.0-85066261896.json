However, the neural mechanisms that promote the continuation and completion of such action sequences are not well understood. Here, we characterize the anatomy, physiology, and function of the nucleus isthmi (NI), a cholinergic nucleus thought to modulate tectal-dependent, goal-directed behaviors. We find that the larval zebrafish NI establishes reciprocal connectivity with the optic tectum and identify two distinct types of isthmic projection neuron that either connect ipsilaterally to retinorecipient laminae of the tectum and pretectum or bilaterally to both tectal hemispheres. Laser ablation of NI caused highly specific deficits in tectally mediated loom-avoidance and prey-catching behavior. In the context of hunting, NI ablation did not affect prey detection or hunting initiation but resulted in larvae failing to sustain prey-tracking sequences and aborting their hunting routines. Moreover, calcium imaging revealed elevated neural activity in NI following onset of hunting behavior. We propose a model in which NI provides state-dependent feedback facilitation to the optic tectum and pretectum to potentiate neural activity and increase the probability of consecutive prey-tracking maneuvers during hunting sequences. Henriques et al. identify two classes of projection neuron connecting the nucleus isthmi (NI) to the optic tectum and pretectum. Functional calcium imaging and laser ablation combined with behavioral analyses indicate that NI is recruited during hunting and functions to sustain prey-tracking sequences.", "AuthorKeywords": ["behavioral sequences", "calcium imaging", "hunting", "nucleus isthmi", "optic tectum", "pretectum", "prey-catching", "sensorimotor processing", "visually guided behavior", "zebrafish"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Efferent Pathways", "Goldfish", "Neurons", "Superior Colliculi", "Tectum Mesencephali", "Visual Pathways", "Zebrafish"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85066261896", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"]], "AuthorData": {"57209010010": {"Name": "Henriques P.M.", "AuthorID": "57209010010", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology, University College London"}, "57209005957": {"Name": "Rahman N.", "AuthorID": "57209005957", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology, University College London"}, "57209005485": {"Name": "Jackson S.E.", "AuthorID": "57209005485", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology, University College London"}, "57195720131": {"Name": "Bianco I.H.", "AuthorID": "57195720131", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology, University College London"}}}
