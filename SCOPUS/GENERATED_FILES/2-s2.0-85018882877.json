PVE can be a confounding factor in clinical studies if the effect changes over time or between subjects, and it is then important to correct for PVE. Such a correction procedure is known as \u201cpartial volume correction\u201d (PVC). Since the PVE depends on the spatial resolution of the PET images, some degree of compensation can be obtained using resolution recovery or deconvolution algorithms. However, these algorithms should not be considered as PVC algorithms, as they simply provide alternative bias vs. noise trade-off solutions from the same measured data. More accurate correction methods can be implemented by utilising high-resolution anatomical information from co-registered MRI or CT images, which would typically first be segmented into a number of regions. Different PVC methods have been developed, which are based on different assumptions. The corrected values should therefore be regarded as approximations of the true values. Also, the results are sensitive to errors in co-registration and segmentation of the anatomical images, as well as in the estimation of the system point spread function. Despite these limitations, the importance of PVC has been demonstrated in a number of clinical neurology, oncology and cardiology studies.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Accurate correction", "Anatomical information", "Correction procedure", "Deconvolution algorithm", "Partial volume correction", "Partial volume effect", "Resolution recovery", "Tracer concentration"], "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85018882877", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"7003356996": {"Name": "Erlandsson K.", "AuthorID": "7003356996", "AffiliationID": "60090043, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Nuclear Medicine, University College London"}}}
