Phytolith assemblages from three Neolithic sites in the Lower Yangtze valley reveal that in early rice fields the emphasis was on drainage to limit the amount of water and force the rice to produce seed. It was only in the later third millennium BC that the strategy changed and irrigated paddies came into use. The results demonstrate that plant remains, including weed assemblages, can reveal wetter or drier growing conditions, showing changes in rice cultivation from flooded and drained fields to large, intensively irrigated paddies.", "AuthorKeywords": ["archaeobotany", "China, Neolithic", "cultivation", "ecology", "irrigation"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84984605083", "SubjectAreas": [["Archeology", "SOCI", "3302"], ["Arts and Humanities (all)", "ARTS", "1200"]], "AuthorData": {"36118300000": {"Name": "Weisskopf A.", "AuthorID": "36118300000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Archaeology, University College London"}, "56844729800": {"Name": "Fuller D.", "AuthorID": "56844729800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Archaeology, University College London"}, "35960090700": {"Name": "Qin L.", "AuthorID": "35960090700", "AffiliationID": "60014966", "AffiliationName": "School of Archaeology and Museology, Peking University"}, "14025483000": {"Name": "Ding J.", "AuthorID": "14025483000", "AffiliationID": "117255467", "AffiliationName": "Suzhou Research Institute of Archaeology"}, "56115845000": {"Name": "Ding P.", "AuthorID": "56115845000", "AffiliationID": "100506925", "AffiliationName": "Zhejiang Province Institute of Cultural Relics and Archaeology"}, "7402760779": {"Name": "Sun G.", "AuthorID": "7402760779", "AffiliationID": "100506925", "AffiliationName": "Zhejiang Province Institute of Cultural Relics and Archaeology"}}}
