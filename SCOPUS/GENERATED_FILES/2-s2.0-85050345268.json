All rights reserved.Background: The effects of treatments on tinnitus have been difficult to quantify. The Tinnitus Functional Index (TFI) has been proposed as a standard questionnaire for measurement of tinnitus treatment outcomes. For a questionnaire to achieve wide acceptance, its psychometric properties need to be confirmed in different populations. Objective: To determine if the TFI is a reliable and valid measure of tinnitus, and if its psychometric properties are suitable for use as an outcome measure. Research Design: A psychometric evaluation of the TFI from secondary data obtained from a crosssectional clinic survey and a clinical trial undertaken in New Zealand. Study Sample: Confirmatory factor analysis and evaluation of internal consistency reliability were undertaken on a sample of 318 patients with the primary complaint of tinnitus. In a separate sample of 40 research volunteers, test-retest reliability, convergent and divergent validity were evaluated. Both samples consisted of predominantly older Caucasian male patients with tinnitus. Results: The internal structure of the original US TFI was confirmed. The Cronbach's Alpha and Intraclass correlation coefficients were > 0.7 for the TFI overall and each of its subscales, indicating high internal consistency and test-retest reliability. Strong Pearson correlations with the Tinnitus Handicap Questionnaire and tinnitus numerical rating scales indicated excellent convergent validity, and a moderate correlation with the Hearing Handicap Inventory, indicated moderate divergent validity. Evaluation of the clinical trial showed good test-retest reliability and agreement between no-treatment baselines with a smallest detectable change of 4.8 points. Conclusions: The TFI is a reliable and valid measure of tinnitus severity in the population tested and is responsive to treatment-related change. Further research as to the TFI's responsiveness to treatment is needed across different populations.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Psychometric", "Questionnaire", "Severity", "Tinnitus", "Tinnitus Functional Index"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Patient Outcome Assessment", "Psychometrics", "Reproducibility of Results", "Tinnitus"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85050345268", "SubjectAreas": [["Speech and Hearing", "HEAL", "3616"]], "AuthorData": {"57189697218": {"Name": "Chandra N.", "AuthorID": "57189697218", "AffiliationID": "60005686", "AffiliationName": "Audiology Section, University of Auckland Tamaki Campus"}, "56087344000": {"Name": "Shekhawat G.S.", "AuthorID": "56087344000", "AffiliationID": "60005686", "AffiliationName": "Health Systems, University of Auckland"}, "6506808384": {"Name": "Searchfield G.D.", "AuthorID": "6506808384", "AffiliationID": "60005686", "AffiliationName": "Eisdell Moore Centre, University of Auckland"}, "57203505473": {"Name": "Chang K.", "AuthorID": "57203505473", "AffiliationID": "60005686", "AffiliationName": "Statistics, University of Auckland"}, "7405628908": {"Name": "Lee A.", "AuthorID": "7405628908", "AffiliationID": "60005686", "AffiliationName": "Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of Auckland"}}}
