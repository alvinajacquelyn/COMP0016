It draws upon two large research projects in particular \u2013 one which involved children\u2019s international migration in search of education; the other which examined examples of young people \u2018stuck\u2019 in Hong Kong and prescribed, by virtue of their \u2018failure\u2019 in the school system, particular circumscribed life chances. The paper attempts to change the spatial lens through which international education is viewed\u2013away from the focus on \u2018exodus\u2019 (Abelmann, N., and Kang, J., 2014. Memoir/manuals of South Korean Pre\u2010College Study Abroad: Defending Mothers and Humanizing Children. Global Networks 14 (1), 1\u201322) towards a sense of \u2018internalisation\u2019 (and the impact that international education is having \u2018at home\u2019). The paper speaks to wider debates concerning educational migrations (the role of students as migrants) and the formative role that education (both domestic and international) plays in contemporary societies.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Hong Kong", "International education", "young people"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85057006970", "SubjectAreas": [["Cultural Studies", "SOCI", "3316"], ["History", "ARTS", "1202"], ["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"]], "AuthorData": {"10041492900": {"Name": "Waters J.", "AuthorID": "10041492900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography, University College London"}}}
