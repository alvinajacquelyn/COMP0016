A number of recent studies have also shown that the temperature history of the device after the irradiation impacts the performance of the detector, linked to the mobility of defects at different temperatures. The initial results from an e2v technologies p-channel CCD204 irradiated at 153 K with 10-MeV equivalent proton fluences of 1.24\u00d7109 and 1.24\u00d71011 protons cm-2 is described. The dark current, cosmetic quality, and the number of defects identified using trap pumping immediately were monitored after the irradiation for a period of 150 h with the device held at 153 K and then after different periods of time at room temperature. The device also exhibited a flatband voltage shift of around 30 mV/krad, determined by the reduction in full well capacity.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Charge-coupled devices", "cryogenic irradiation", "p-channel", "proton radiation damage"], "IndexKeywords": ["Displacement damages", "E2v technologies", "Flat-band voltage shift", "Full well capacity", "P channels", "Proton radiation damage", "Radiation-induced", "Temperature history"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84979502884", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Control and Systems Engineering", "ENGI", "2207"], ["Instrumentation", "PHYS", "3105"], ["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"22984865200": {"Name": "Gow J.", "AuthorID": "22984865200", "AffiliationID": "60012113", "AffiliationName": "Open University, Centre for Electronic Imaging, Department of Physical Sciences"}, "57198667804": {"Name": "Wood D.", "AuthorID": "57198667804", "AffiliationID": "60012113", "AffiliationName": "Open University, Centre for Electronic Imaging, Department of Physical Sciences"}, "24073235100": {"Name": "Murray N.", "AuthorID": "24073235100", "AffiliationID": "60012113", "AffiliationName": "Open University, Centre for Electronic Imaging, Department of Physical Sciences"}, "57214169439": {"Name": "Hall D.", "AuthorID": "57214169439", "AffiliationID": "60012113", "AffiliationName": "Open University, Centre for Electronic Imaging, Department of Physical Sciences"}, "36454630800": {"Name": "Dryer B.", "AuthorID": "36454630800", "AffiliationID": "60012113", "AffiliationName": "Open University, Centre for Electronic Imaging, Department of Physical Sciences"}, "7202996580": {"Name": "Holland A.", "AuthorID": "7202996580", "AffiliationID": "60012113", "AffiliationName": "Open University, Centre for Electronic Imaging, Department of Physical Sciences"}, "7102130581": {"Name": "Burt D.", "AuthorID": "7102130581", "AffiliationID": "60102138", "AffiliationName": "E2v Technologies PLC"}}}
