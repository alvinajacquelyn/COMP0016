Yet, their lack of accessibility from fetuses and from the brain of diseased patients has hindered our understanding of their full implication in developmental and pathogenic processes. Human pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) are an alternative source to obtain large quantities of astrocytes in vitro, for mechanistic studies of development and disease. However, these studies often require highly pure populations of astrocytes, which are not always achieved, depending on the PSC lines and protocols used. Here, we describe the generation and characterization of human PSC reporter lines expressing TagRFP driven by the ABC1D region of the human GFAP promoter, as new cellular model for generating homogenous population of astrocytes generated from CNS regionally defined PSC-derived neural progenitors. GFAABC1D::TagRFP-expressing astrocytes can be purified by fluorescent-activated cell sorting and maintain a bright expression for several additional weeks. These express canonical astrocyte markers NF1A, S100\u03b2, CX43, GLAST, GS and CD44. These new cellular models, from which highly pure populations of fluorescence-expressing astrocytes can be obtained, provide a new platform for studies where pure or fluorescently labeled astrocyte populations are necessary, for example to assess pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine release in response to specific treatment, and uptake and degradation of fluorescently labeled pathogenic proteins, as reported in this study.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Astrocytes", "Cell Line", "Cell Separation", "Clone Cells", "Flow Cytometry", "Genes, Reporter", "Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein", "Humans", "Inflammation", "Mesencephalon", "Neural Stem Cells", "Pluripotent Stem Cells", "Spinal Cord", "Time Factors", "Transgenes"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84934914866", "SubjectAreas": [["Developmental Biology", "BIOC", "1309"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"56274555300": {"Name": "Holmqvist S.", "AuthorID": "56274555300", "AffiliationID": "60118986, 60029170", "AffiliationName": "Strategic Research Area MultiPark and Lund Stem Cell Center, Lund University"}, "56708217100": {"Name": "Brouwer M.", "AuthorID": "56708217100", "AffiliationID": "60118986, 60029170", "AffiliationName": "Strategic Research Area MultiPark and Lund Stem Cell Center, Lund University"}, "55250112700": {"Name": "Djelloul M.", "AuthorID": "55250112700", "AffiliationID": "60118986, 60029170", "AffiliationName": "Strategic Research Area MultiPark and Lund Stem Cell Center, Lund University"}, "8146519100": {"Name": "Roybon L.", "AuthorID": "8146519100", "AffiliationID": "60118986, 60029170", "AffiliationName": "Strategic Research Area MultiPark and Lund Stem Cell Center, Lund University"}, "56403973400": {"Name": "Diaz A.", "AuthorID": "56403973400", "AffiliationID": "114798201", "AffiliationName": "Columbia Stem Cell Core Facility"}, "35889193800": {"Name": "Devine M.", "AuthorID": "35889193800", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "6603182641": {"Name": "Kunath T.", "AuthorID": "6603182641", "AffiliationID": "60014873, 60027272", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Regenerative Medicine, Institute for Stem Cell Research, University of Edinburgh"}, "57189197656": {"Name": "Hammarberg A.", "AuthorID": "57189197656", "AffiliationID": "60018674, 60029170", "AffiliationName": "MultiPark Strategic Research Area, Cellomics and Flow Cytometry Core Facility, Department of Experimental Medical Science, Lund University"}, "26030312400": {"Name": "Fog K.", "AuthorID": "26030312400", "AffiliationID": "60027906", "AffiliationName": "H.
