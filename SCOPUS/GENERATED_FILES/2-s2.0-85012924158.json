Gallium-68-labelled PSMA PET has increased the sensitivity of detection of disease recurrence at low PSA levels, thus allowing an optimal window for salvage treatment. Apart from its use in disease recurrence, PSMA PET has the potential for increasing sensitivity and specificity for primary tumour localisation and in detecting lymph node disease, leading to a more accurate initial staging of the condition. In advanced disease, the use of PSMA PET may be able to assess response to treatment and also guide treatment with radionuclide therapy. Newer ligands under development might provide avenues for theranostic or personalised therapy applications with early data showing high PSA response rates. The rate of translation of PSMA PET into clinical practice has been remarkable. The use of this modality is likely to increase with future efforts to modify the radiotracer including 18F labelling to improve availability.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Imaging", "Prostate cancer", "PSMA PET", "Radiotracers", "Theranostics"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Gallium Radioisotopes", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Multimodal Imaging", "Neoplasm Invasiveness", "Neoplasm Staging", "Positron-Emission Tomography", "Prostate-Specific Antigen", "Prostatic Neoplasms", "Sensitivity and Specificity", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85012924158", "SubjectAreas": [["Nephrology", "MEDI", "2727"], ["Urology", "MEDI", "2748"]], "AuthorData": {"38662206500": {"Name": "Afaq A.", "AuthorID": "38662206500", "AffiliationID": "60105470", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, London North West Healthcare NHS Trust"}, "7005791371": {"Name": "Bomanji J.", "AuthorID": "7005791371", "AffiliationID": "60024544, 60090043", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Nuclear Medicine, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "25653915800": {"Name": "Batura D.", "AuthorID": "25653915800", "AffiliationID": "60105470", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, London North West Healthcare NHS Trust"}}}
