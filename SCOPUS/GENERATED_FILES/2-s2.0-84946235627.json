All rights reserved.Infinite dilution activity coefficients (\u03b3\u221e) were measured at 298 K for 9 different aliphatic hydrocarbons (alkanes, cycloalkanes, alkenes), 7 different aromatic compounds (benzene, alkylbenzenes, halobenzenes), and for 1,2-dichloropropane, dichloromethane, acetone, acetonitrile, tetrahydrofuran, 1,4-dioxane and 2-propanol dissolved in both 2-propoxyethanol and 2-isopropoxyethanol at 298 K using a headspace gas chromatographic method. As part of the experimental study solubilities of 18 and 20 crystalline organic nonelectrolyte solutes were determined in 2-propoxyethanol and 2-isopropoxyethanol, respectively, at 298 K using a UV/visible spectrophotometric method. The experimental values were converted to gas-to-alkoxyethanol partition coefficients, water-to-alkoxyethanol partition coefficients, and molar solubility ratios using standard thermodynamic relationships. Abraham model correlations for solute transfer into both alkoxyethanols were derived from the calculated solubility ratios and partition coefficients. The derived Abraham model describes the observed solubility ratios and partition coefficients to within 0.12 log units (or less).", "AuthorKeywords": ["2-isopropoxyethanol", "2-propoxyethanol", "Activity coefficients", "Headspace chromatographic measurements", "Partition coefficients", "Solubilities"], "IndexKeywords": ["2-isopropoxyethanol", "2-Propoxyethanol", "Chromatographic methods", "Headspaces", "Infinite dilution activity coefficients", "Partition coefficient", "Spectro-photometric method", "Thermodynamic relationships"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84946235627", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Spectroscopy", "CHEM", "1607"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"], ["Materials Chemistry", "MATE", "2505"]], "AuthorData": {"57200148048": {"Name": "Sedov I.", "AuthorID": "57200148048", "AffiliationID": "60070941", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Kazan Federal University"}, "56943436800": {"Name": "Khaibrakhmanova D.", "AuthorID": "56943436800", "AffiliationID": "60070941", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Kazan Federal University"}, "56222214400": {"Name": "Hart E.", "AuthorID": "56222214400", "AffiliationID": "60024438", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of North Texas, TX 76203"}, "56538081100": {"Name": "Grover D.", "AuthorID": "56538081100", "AffiliationID": "60024438", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of North Texas, TX 76203"}, "56538213300": {"Name": "Zettl H.", "AuthorID": "56538213300", "AffiliationID": "60024438", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of North Texas, TX 76203"}, "56607210600": {"Name": "Koshevarova V.", "AuthorID": "56607210600", "AffiliationID": "60024438", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of North Texas, TX 76203"}, "56643864800": {"Name": "Dai C.", "AuthorID": "56643864800", "AffiliationID": "60024438", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of North Texas, TX 76203"}, "56643526000": {"Name": "Zhang S.", "AuthorID": "56643526000", "AffiliationID": "60024438", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of North Texas, TX 76203"}, "56735135700": {"Name": "Schmidt A.", "AuthorID": "56735135700", "AffiliationID": "60024438", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of North Texas, TX 76203"}, "35496753700": {"Name": "Acree W.", "AuthorID": "35496753700", "AffiliationID": "60024438", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of North Texas, TX 76203"}, "7202901240": {"Name": "Abraham M.", "AuthorID": "7202901240", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London, WC1H OAJ"}}}
