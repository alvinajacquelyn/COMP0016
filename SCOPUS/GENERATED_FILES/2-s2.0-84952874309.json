It was constructed using the Integrated Epidemiological Surveillance System of HIV in Catalonia and data from the PISCIS Cohort. Estimates of the number of people living with HIV in Catalonia are modelled using Spectrum Projection Package 2011 (UNAIDS/WHO). Totals for each stage in the cascade are obtained by applying to the preceding stage a proportion estimated from available surveillance and cohort data. Undiagnosed HIV was estimated from the European literature. The proportions retained in care, on ART and virally suppressed were derived from the PISCIS cohort. Programmatic data on ART consumption was used to validate estimates. By the end of 2011 there were about 33,000 people living with HIV in Catalonia, 71% of which had been both diagnosed and linked to care. We estimate that 61% of all HIV infected persons were retained in care, 56% were on ART and 48% were virally suppressed. These figures data are comparable, although slightly lower, than that of France or the UK. The Cascade of HIV Care in Catalonia is similar to other western European countries such as France and the UK. Direct estimates of the undiagnosed HIV population and linkage to care are desirable but the contribution of cohort data to the cascade highlights their continued importance in HIV surveillance and design of evidence-based health strategies.", "AuthorKeywords": ["ART", "cascade", "Catalonia", "HIV", "Spain"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Anti-HIV Agents", "Continuity of Patient Care", "Female", "HIV Infections", "Humans", "Male", "Medication Adherence", "Patient Acceptance of Health Care", "Population Surveillance", "Spain"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84952874309", "SubjectAreas": [["Social Psychology", "PSYC", "3207"], ["Health (social science)", "SOCI", "3306"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"56270793500": {"Name": "Campbell C.", "AuthorID": "56270793500", "AffiliationID": "112770663", "AffiliationName": "Institut d'Investigaci\u00f3 Germans Trias i Pujol (IGTP)"}, "20033891200": {"Name": "Esteve A.", "AuthorID": "20033891200", "AffiliationID": "60023020", "AffiliationName": "Departament de Pediatria, d'Obstetricia i Ginecologia i de Medicina Preventiva i de Salut Publica, Universitat Aut\u00f2noma de Barcelona"}, "35227110600": {"Name": "Casabona J.", "AuthorID": "35227110600", "AffiliationID": "60023020", "AffiliationName": "Departament de Pediatria, d'Obstetricia i Ginecologia i de Medicina Preventiva i de Salut Publica, Universitat Aut\u00f2noma de Barcelona"}, "15833962900": {"Name": "Ambrosioni J.", "AuthorID": "15833962900", "AffiliationID": "60001576, 60030315, 60010814", "AffiliationName": "Infectious Diseases Service, Hospital Cl\u00ednic - IDIBAPS, University of Barcelona"}, "7102494372": {"Name": "Miro J.", "AuthorID": "7102494372", "AffiliationID": "60001576, 60030315, 60010814", "AffiliationName": "Infectious Diseases Service, Hospital Cl\u00ednic - IDIBAPS, University of Barcelona"}, "55432979900": {"Name": "Navarro G.", "AuthorID": "55432979900", "AffiliationID": "112983634", "AffiliationName": "Corporaci\u00f3 Sanit\u00e0ria i Universit\u00e0ria Parc Taul\u00ed"}, "7201765401": {"Name": "Garc\u00eda I.", "AuthorID": "7201765401", "AffiliationID": "60015430", "AffiliationName": "Hospital General de L'Hospitalet"}, "7101784560": {"Name": "Ferrer E.", "AuthorID": "7101784560", "AffiliationID": "60011805", "AffiliationName": "Hospital Universitari de Bellvitge"}, "10340595500": {"Name": "Force L.", "AuthorID": "10340595500", "AffiliationID": "60026474", "AffiliationName": "Hospital de Matar\u00f3"}, "7004764702": {"Name": "Tural C.", "AuthorID": "7004764702", "AffiliationID": "60028462", "AffiliationName": "Hospital Universitari Germans Trias i Pujol"}}}
