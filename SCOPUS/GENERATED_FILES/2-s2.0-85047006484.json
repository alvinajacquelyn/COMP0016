Research evidence in long-term conditions suggests that patients benefit from self-management education and that this may improve quality of life (QoL). Epilepsy self-management education has yet to be tested in a UK setting. Objectives: To determine the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of Self-Management education for people with poorly controlled epILEpsy [SMILE (UK)]. Design: A parallel pragmatic randomised controlled trial. Setting: Participants were recruited from eight hospitals in London and south-east England. Participants: Adults aged \u2265 16 years with epilepsy and two or more epileptic seizures in the past year, who were currently being prescribed antiepileptic drugs. Intervention: A 2-day group self-management course alongside treatment as usual (TAU). The control group received TAU. Main outcome measures: The primary outcome is QoL in people with epilepsy at 12-month follow-up using the Quality Of Life In Epilepsy 31-P (QOLIE-31-P) scale. Other outcomes were seizure control, impact of epilepsy, medication adverse effects, psychological distress, perceived stigma, self-mastery and medication adherence. Cost-effectiveness analyses and a process evaluation were undertaken. Randomisation: A 1: 1 ratio between trial arms using fixed block sizes of two. Blinding: Participants were not blinded to their group allocation because of the nature of the study. Researchers involved in data collection and analysis remained blinded throughout. Results: The trial completed successfully. A total of 404 participants were enrolled in the study [SMILE (UK), n = 205; TAU, n = 199] with 331 completing the final follow-up at 12 months [SMILE (UK), n = 163; TAU, n = 168]. In the intervention group, 61.5% completed all sessions of the course. No adverse events were found to be related to the intervention. At baseline, participants had a mean age of 41.7 years [standard deviation (SD) 14.1 years], and had epilepsy for a median of 18 years. The mean QOLIE-31-P score for the whole group at baseline was 66.0 out of 100.0 (SD 14.2). Clinically relevant levels of anxiety symptoms were reported in 53.6% of the group and depression symptoms in 28.0%. The results following an intention-to-treat analysis showed no change in any measures at the 12-month follow-up [QOLIE-31-P: SMILE (UK) mean: 67.4, SD 13.5; TAU mean: 69.5, SD 14.8]. The cost-effectiveness study showed that SMILE (UK) was possibly cost-effective but was also associated with lower QoL. The process evaluation with 20 participants revealed that a group course increased confidence by sharing with others and improved self-management behaviours. Conclusions: For people with epilepsy and persistent seizures, a 2-day self-management education course is cost-saving, but does not improve QoL after 12-months or reduce anxiety or depression symptoms. A psychological intervention may help with anxiety and depression. Interviewed participants reported attending a group course increased their confidence and helped them improve their self-management.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Anticonvulsants", "Anxiety", "Cost-Benefit Analysis", "Depression", "England", "Epilepsy", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Medication Adherence", "Middle Aged", "Patient Education as Topic", "Quality of Life", "Quality-Adjusted Life Years", "Self-Management", "Single-Blind Method", "Social Stigma", "State Medicine", "Stress, Psychological", "Technology Assessment, Biomedical"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85047006484", "SubjectAreas": [["Health Policy", "MEDI", "2719"]], "AuthorData": {"7005292091": {"Name": "Ridsdale L.", "AuthorID": "7005292091", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Basic and Clinical Neurosciences, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King\u2019s College London"}, "57194340978": {"Name": "McKinlay A.", "AuthorID": "57194340978", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Basic and Clinical Neurosciences, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King\u2019s College London"}, "57194335826": {"Name": "Wojewodka G.", "AuthorID": "57194335826", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Basic and Clinical Neurosciences, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King\u2019s College London"}, "57194329023": {"Name": "Feehan S.J.", "AuthorID": "57194329023", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Basic and Clinical Neurosciences, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King\u2019s College London"}, "7401976540": {"Name": "Richardson M.", "AuthorID": "7401976540", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Basic and Clinical Neurosciences, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King\u2019s College London"}, "57189463801": {"Name": "Robinson E.J.", "AuthorID": "57189463801", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biostatistics and Health Informatics, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King\u2019s College London"}, "7101776972": {"Name": "Landau S.", "AuthorID": "7101776972", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biostatistics and Health Informatics, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King\u2019s College London"}, "56433558100": {"Name": "Mosweu I.", "AuthorID": "56433558100", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "King\u2019s Health Economics, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King\u2019s College London"}, "7003937597": {"Name": "McCrone P.", "AuthorID": "7003937597", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "King\u2019s Health Economics, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King\u2019s College London"}, "8958054200": {"Name": "Noble A.J.", "AuthorID": "8958054200", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychological Sciences, Institute of Psychology, Health and Society, University of Liverpool"}, "7403025385": {"Name": "Morgan M.", "AuthorID": "7403025385", "AffiliationID": "60177635", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Pharmaceutical Science, King\u2019s College London"}, "7404756587": {"Name": "Taylor S.J.C.", "AuthorID": "7404756587", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Centre for Primary Care and Public Health, Queen Mary University of London"}, "7403001272": {"Name": "Baker G.", "AuthorID": "7403001272", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular and Clinical Pharmacology, University of Liverpool"}, "57197790094": {"Name": "Goldstein L.H.", "AuthorID": "57197790094", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King\u2019s College London"}}}
