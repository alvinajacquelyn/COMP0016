XRD, FTIR, SEM-EDS, and TGA-DSC were used for microstructural characterization of the binder. The gel composition of the system was found to be influenced by NaOH concentration and was not affected when curing temperature was varied from 60\u00b0C to 80\u00b0C. The main phase was N,C\u2013A\u2013S\u2013H for all alkali-activated oyster shell-volcanic ash, with C\u2013S\u2013H as secondary phase for some samples and contains high percentage of iron. The splitting at \u03c53 = 1400\u20131494 cm\u22121 on FTIR spectra corresponded to the elimination of the degeneracy due to the distortion of CO3 2\u2212 group. The high degree of splitting indicated that this carbonate group is linked to Ca2+. The compressive strength was influenced by curing temperature and the formation of a secondary phase. The compressive strength in dry condition increased roughly between 28 and 180 d for some samples, while in wet condition, the partial dissolution of Si\u2013O\u2013Si bonds of some silicate phases resulted in a reduction of strength.", "AuthorKeywords": ["alkali activation", "calcium silicate hydrate", "gel composition", "heat treatment", "oyster shell-volcanic ash"], "IndexKeywords": ["Alkali activation", "Calcium silicate hydrate", "Curing temperature", "Gel compositions", "Micro-structural characterization", "Partial dissolution", "Synthesis conditions", "Volcanic ash"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84973458178", "SubjectAreas": [["Ceramics and Composites", "MATE", "2503"], ["Materials Chemistry", "MATE", "2505"]], "AuthorData": {"56518315900": {"Name": "Djobo J.", "AuthorID": "56518315900", "AffiliationID": "60070928", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Applied Inorganic Chemistry, Department of Inorganic Chemistry, Faculty of Science, University of Yaound\u00e9 I"}, "36775484500": {"Name": "Tchakout\u00e9 H.", "AuthorID": "36775484500", "AffiliationID": "60070928", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Applied Inorganic Chemistry, Department of Inorganic Chemistry, Faculty of Science, University of Yaound\u00e9 I"}, "22034557000": {"Name": "Elimbi A.", "AuthorID": "22034557000", "AffiliationID": "60070928", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Applied Inorganic Chemistry, Department of Inorganic Chemistry, Faculty of Science, University of Yaound\u00e9 I"}, "56719629100": {"Name": "Tchadji\u00e9 L.", "AuthorID": "56719629100", "AffiliationID": "60070928", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Applied Inorganic Chemistry, Department of Inorganic Chemistry, Faculty of Science, University of Yaound\u00e9 I"}, "22035436600": {"Name": "Njopwouo D.", "AuthorID": "22035436600", "AffiliationID": "60070928", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Applied Inorganic Chemistry, Department of Inorganic Chemistry, Faculty of Science, University of Yaound\u00e9 I"}, "55484588000": {"Name": "Ranjbar N.", "AuthorID": "55484588000", "AffiliationID": "60026914", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil Engineering, Shiraz University"}, "7003785725": {"Name": "Biernacki J.", "AuthorID": "7003785725", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
