These NPs were then incorporated into TiO2 acceptor films in hybrid solar cells to enhance light harvesting by virtue of an up-conversion process where low energy photons can be converted into high energy photons through multi-photon processes. The results showed that the SMO:Yb/Er single crystal NPs are capable of turning near infrared photons into visible ones that can be easily captured by poly(thieno[3,4-b]-thiophene/benzodithiophene) (PTB7). The results indicate that the electron transfer rate at the PTB7/TiO2 donor/acceptor interface has been boosted sharply from 0.59 to 1.35 \u00d7 109 s-1. Consequently, a hybrid solar cell based on SMO:Yb/Er NP-doped TiO2/PTB7 delivers a high power conversion efficiency of up to 3.61%, thus leading to an efficiency enhancement of around 28% as compared to that of the neat PTB7/TiO2 counterpart (2.81%). This work demonstrates a promising approach to engineering efficient photovoltaic devices by taking advantage of the versatility of rare-earth ion doped oxides that function by modifying light in the solar spectrum.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85003794672", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"]], "AuthorData": {"55600876400": {"Name": "Sun W.", "AuthorID": "55600876400", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemical Engineering, University of Birmingham"}, "56205971300": {"Name": "Chen Z.", "AuthorID": "56205971300", "AffiliationID": "60028333", "AffiliationName": "School of Photovoltaic and Renewable Energy Engineering, University of New South Wales"}, "13612223600": {"Name": "Zhou J.", "AuthorID": "13612223600", "AffiliationID": "60022414", "AffiliationName": "School of Civil Engineering and Architecture, Wuhan University of Technology"}, "14619181500": {"Name": "Li D.", "AuthorID": "14619181500", "AffiliationID": "60073739", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Lingnan Normal College"}, "57157680800": {"Name": "Huang Z.", "AuthorID": "57157680800", "AffiliationID": "60073739", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Lingnan Normal College"}, "57208453092": {"Name": "Jin X.", "AuthorID": "57208453092", "AffiliationID": "60083519", "AffiliationName": "Jiangxi Engineering Laboratory for Optoelectronics Testing Technology, Nanchang Hangkong University"}, "57208840068": {"Name": "Zhang Q.", "AuthorID": "57208840068", "AffiliationID": "60083519", "AffiliationName": "Jiangxi Engineering Laboratory for Optoelectronics Testing Technology, Nanchang Hangkong University"}, "57198719025": {"Name": "Li F.", "AuthorID": "57198719025", "AffiliationID": "60083519", "AffiliationName": "Jiangxi Engineering Laboratory for Optoelectronics Testing Technology, Nanchang Hangkong University"}, "56157911800": {"Name": "Li Q.", "AuthorID": "56157911800", "AffiliationID": "60083519", "AffiliationName": "Jiangxi Engineering Laboratory for Optoelectronics Testing Technology, Nanchang Hangkong University"}}}
