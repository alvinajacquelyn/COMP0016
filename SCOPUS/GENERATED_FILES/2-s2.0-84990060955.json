This is an ill-posed inverse problem that needs regularization, and we propose to use the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to provide stable solutions. Indeed, EM is an iterative algorithm that imposes a positivity constraint on the solution, and provides regularization if iterations are stopped early enough. We describe the algorithm and propose a stopping criterion inspired by a statistical principle. We then discuss its properties concerning the spatial resolution. Finally, we validate the proposed approach by using both synthetic data and experimental measurements; we compare the reconstructions obtained by EM with those obtained by the Tikhonov method, by the Levenberg-Marquardt method, as well as those obtained by combining data smoothing and numerical derivation.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Aerosol extinction coefficient", "Atmospheric extinction coefficients", "Expectation - maximizations", "Expectation-maximization algorithms", "ILL-posed inverse problem", "Levenberg- Marquardt methods", "Raman lidar measurement", "Statistical principles"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84990060955", "SubjectAreas": [["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"]], "AuthorData": {"55884894500": {"Name": "Garbarino S.", "AuthorID": "55884894500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Image Computing, Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "24081279700": {"Name": "Sorrentino A.", "AuthorID": "24081279700", "AffiliationID": "60105685", "AffiliationName": "CNR-SPIN"}, "35557405100": {"Name": "Piana M.", "AuthorID": "35557405100", "AffiliationID": "60105685", "AffiliationName": "CNR-SPIN"}, "7003587058": {"Name": "Massone A.", "AuthorID": "7003587058", "AffiliationID": "60105685", "AffiliationName": "CNR-SPIN"}, "56579935500": {"Name": "Sannino A.", "AuthorID": "56579935500", "AffiliationID": "60017293", "AffiliationName": "Dipartimento di Fisica, Universit\u00e0 di Napoli Federico II"}, "7004307916": {"Name": "Spinelli N.", "AuthorID": "7004307916", "AffiliationID": "60017293", "AffiliationName": "Dipartimento di Fisica, Universit\u00e0 di Napoli Federico II"}, "7005899926": {"Name": "Boselli A.", "AuthorID": "7005899926", "AffiliationID": "60021199", "AffiliationName": "CNR-IMAA"}, "8527523100": {"Name": "Wang X.", "AuthorID": "8527523100", "AffiliationID": "60110813", "AffiliationName": "CNR-SPIN"}}}
