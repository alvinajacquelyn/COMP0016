This pathway regulates protein synthesis in response to stresses, viral infections, and nutrient depletion, among others. We present analyses of an ordinary differential equation-based model of this pathway, which aim to identify its principal robustness-conferring features. Our analyses indicate that robustness is a distributed property, rather than arising from the properties of any one individual pathway species. However, robustness-conferring properties are unevenly distributed between the different species, and we identify a guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor (GDI) complex as a species that likely contributes strongly to the robustness of the pathway. Our analyses make further predictions on the dynamic response to different types of kinases that impinge on eIF2.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Control engineering", "eIF2", "eIF2B", "Gcn2", "Protein synthesis", "Robustness", "Translation", "Translational control"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Eukaryotic Cells", "Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-2", "Humans", "Models, Biological", "Phosphorylation", "Protein Biosynthesis"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85042719524", "SubjectAreas": [["Statistics and Probability", "MATH", "2613"], ["Modeling and Simulation", "MATH", "2611"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Immunology and Microbiology (all)", "IMMU", "2400"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"55881356400": {"Name": "Khan M.", "AuthorID": "55881356400", "AffiliationID": "60010818", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering and Digital Arts, University of Kent"}, "6602675660": {"Name": "von der Haar T.", "AuthorID": "6602675660", "AffiliationID": "60010818", "AffiliationName": "School of Biosciences, University of Kent"}, "7005642573": {"Name": "Spurgeon S.", "AuthorID": "7005642573", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}}}
