Virtual 3D scans are in many cases replacing the drawn record and are leading to objects being more easily accessed, shared and analysed. However, the wholesale production of 3D virtual replicas of artefacts is not always supported by adequate information regarding the multi-sensory nature of artefacts. The visual and geometric aspects are well represented, but the sounds and smells of the artefacts are lost. This paper explores the possible consequences of this and provides some indications of how we may remedy the situation, before our 3D archives become senseless.", "AuthorKeywords": ["3D scanning", "archaeology", "Artefact analysis", "augmented reality", "photogrammetry"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85047125809", "SubjectAreas": [["Conservation", "ARTS", "1206"], ["Archeology (arts and humanities)", "ARTS", "1204"], ["Education", "SOCI", "3304"]], "AuthorData": {"55279466100": {"Name": "Eve S.", "AuthorID": "55279466100", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Department of Archaeology"}}}
