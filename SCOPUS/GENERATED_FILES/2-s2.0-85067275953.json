For example, HCI is exploring agency delegation and automation to support the user in managing the deluge of IoT data, make decisions, or even take actions on behalf of the user, while economic models are being proposed to drive sharing economy services. This creates new problems including how to design appropriate solutions for uncertain and dynamic human behaviour, how to ensure resources are distributed fairly, and how to ensure that the user can understand system actions and ultimately remains in control. These issues are becoming more pertinent as the IoT diversifies into safety-critical domains such as manufacturing and healthcare. This one-day workshop intends to bring together the CHI community to explore the interactional, socio-cultural, ethical, and practical challenges and approaches that these new domains raise for the IoT. With this, we want to consider how such approaches could be integrated to achieve more sustainable, inclusive, or effective interactions.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Autonomous agents", "Autonomy", "Healthcare", "Internet-of-things", "Proactive technology", "Sharing economy"], "IndexKeywords": ["Autonomy", "Economic models", "Effective interactions", "Hci researches", "Human behaviours", "Safety-critical domain", "Sharing economy", "Socio-cultural"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85067275953", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Human-Computer Interaction", "COMP", "1709"], ["Computer Graphics and Computer-Aided Design", "COMP", "1704"]], "AuthorData": {"55834961500": {"Name": "Fuentes C.", "AuthorID": "55834961500", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "Mixed Reality Laboratory, University of Nottingham"}, "56157070100": {"Name": "Porcheron M.", "AuthorID": "56157070100", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "Mixed Reality Laboratory, University of Nottingham"}, "36095705300": {"Name": "Fischer J.", "AuthorID": "36095705300", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "Mixed Reality Laboratory, University of Nottingham"}, "55053598600": {"Name": "Verdezoto N.", "AuthorID": "55053598600", "AffiliationID": "60033125", "AffiliationName": "Department of Informatics, University of Leicester"}, "10042089800": {"Name": "Zuckerman O.", "AuthorID": "10042089800", "AffiliationID": "60012513", "AffiliationName": "Interdisciplinary Center (IDC)"}, "22834126300": {"Name": "Costanza E.", "AuthorID": "22834126300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Interaction Centre, University College London"}, "18433937300": {"Name": "Herskovic V.", "AuthorID": "18433937300", "AffiliationID": "60029681", "AffiliationName": "Computer Science, School of Engineering, Pontificia Universidad Cat\u00f3lica de Chile"}, "6507505628": {"Name": "Takayama L.", "AuthorID": "6507505628", "AffiliationID": "60024941", "AffiliationName": "University of California"}}}
