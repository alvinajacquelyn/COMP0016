Using as a case study the Huichol community of North-Western Mexico we will discuss how institutional health and welfare programmes which aim to address accepted risk factors for maternal health are undermined by a series of structural barriers which put indigenous women especially in harm's way. Semi-structured interviews and observational data were gathered between 2009 and 2011 in highland communities and on coastal tobacco plantations to where a large number of this ethnic group migrate. Many Huichol women birth alone, and to facilitate this process they maintain a low nutritional intake to reduce their infant's growth and seek spiritual guidance during pregnancy from a shaman. These practices are reinforced by feelings of shame and humiliation encountered when using institutional health provision. These are some of the structural barriers to care that need to be addressed. Effective interventions could include addressing the training of health professionals, focusing on educational inequalities and the structural determinants of poverty whilst designing locally specific programmes that encourage acceptance of available health care.", "AuthorKeywords": ["health policy", "Huichol Indians", "maternal mortality", "Mexico", "pregnancy", "structural violence"], "IndexKeywords": ["Female", "Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice", "Health Policy", "Health Status Disparities", "Humans", "Indians, North American", "Maternal Health", "Maternal Health Services", "Maternal Mortality", "Mexico", "Parturition", "Pregnancy", "Qualitative Research", "Shame", "Violence"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84911961766", "SubjectAreas": [["Health (social science)", "SOCI", "3306"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"57195444351": {"Name": "B.
