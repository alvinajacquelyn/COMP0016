The simulations benefit from a newly implemented state tracking algorithm that accounts for trivial surface crossings and from a projection algorithm that removes decoherence correction-induced artificial long-range charge transfer. The CT mechanism changes from slow hopping of a fully localized charge to fast diffusion of a polaron delocalized over several molecules as electronic coupling between the molecules exceeds the critical threshold V \u2265 \u03bb/2 (\u03bb is the reorganization energy). With increasing temperature, the polaron becomes more localized and the mobility exhibits a \"band-like\" power law decay due to increased site energy and electronic coupling fluctuations (local and nonlocal electron-phonon coupling). Thus, reducing both types of electron-phonon coupling while retaining high mean electronic couplings should be part of the strategy toward discovery of new organics with high room-temperature mobilities.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Atomistic modeling", "Electron phonon couplings", "Electronic coupling", "Increasing temperatures", "Nonadiabatic molecular dynamics", "Projection algorithms", "Reorganization energies", "Room temperature mobility"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85047547470", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"]], "AuthorData": {"57199323307": {"Name": "Giannini S.", "AuthorID": "57199323307", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175885", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, Thomas Young Centre, University College London"}, "6506544713": {"Name": "Carof A.", "AuthorID": "6506544713", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175885", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, Thomas Young Centre, University College London"}, "8669973600": {"Name": "Blumberger J.", "AuthorID": "8669973600", "AffiliationID": "60117652, 60019722", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Advanced Study, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen"}}}
