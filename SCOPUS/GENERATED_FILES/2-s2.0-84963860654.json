This highlights deviation from organizational temperature policy, and aims to bring staff \"into the loop\" of understanding and managing heating, and so reduce energy waste. The display was deployed for three weeks in five public libraries. Analysis of interaction logs, questionnaires and interviews shows that staff used the displays to understand heating in their buildings, and took action reflecting this new understanding. Bringing together our results, we discuss design implications for workplace displays, and an analysis of carbon emissions generated in constructing and operating our design. More in general, the findings helped us to reflect on the role of policy on energy consumption, and the potential for the HCI community to engage with its application, as well as its definition or modification.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Buildings", "Energy", "Public displays", "Sustainability", "Visualization", "Workplace"], "IndexKeywords": ["Carbon emissions", "Design and evaluations", "Design implications", "Energy", "ITS applications", "Public display", "Temperature variation", "Workplace"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84963860654", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Human-Computer Interaction", "COMP", "1709"], ["Computer Graphics and Computer-Aided Design", "COMP", "1704"]], "AuthorData": {"22834126300": {"Name": "Costanza E.", "AuthorID": "22834126300", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "University of Southampton"}, "14016052900": {"Name": "Jewell M.", "AuthorID": "14016052900", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "University of Southampton"}, "50261047100": {"Name": "Bedwell B.", "AuthorID": "50261047100", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "University of Nottingham"}, "55841380900": {"Name": "Colley J.", "AuthorID": "55841380900", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "University of Nottingham"}, "7003488009": {"Name": "Rodden T.", "AuthorID": "7003488009", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "University of Nottingham"}}}
