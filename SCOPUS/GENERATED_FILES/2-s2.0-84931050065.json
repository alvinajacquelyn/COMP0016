Because long acting inhaled \u03b2-agonists reduce hyperinflation, they could reduce sympathoexcitation by improving the inflation reflex. We aimed to evaluate if inhaled therapy with salmeterol reduces muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) evaluated by microneurography. Methods: MSNA, heart rate, blood pressure, and respiration were continually measured. After baseline recording of 20 minutes, placebo was administered; after further 45 minutes salmeterol (50 \u03bcg) was administered which was followed by a further 45 minutes of data recording. Additionally, lung function, plasma catecholamine levels, arterial pulse wave velocity, heart rate variability, and baroreflex sensitivity were evaluated. Following 4 weeks of treatment with salmeterol 50 \u03bcg twice daily, measurements were repeated without placebo administration. Results: A total of 32 COPD patients were included. Valid MSNA signals were obtained from 18 patients. Change in MSNA (bursts/100 heart beats) following acute administration of salmeterol did not differ significantly from the change following placebo (-1.96 \u00b1 9.81 vs. -0.65 \u00b1 9.07; p = 0.51) although hyperinflation was significantly reduced. Likewise, no changes in MSNA or catecholamines were observed after 4 weeks. Heart rate increased significantly by 3.8 \u00b1 4.2 (p < 0.01) acutely and 3.9 \u00b1 4.3 bpm (p < 0.01) after 4 weeks. Salmeterol treatment was safe and well tolerated. Conclusions: By using microneurography as a gold standard to evaluate sympathetic activity we found no change in MSNA following salmeterol inhalation. Thus, despite an attenuation of hyperinflation, the long acting \u03b2-agonist salmeterol does not appear to reduce nor incite sympathoexcitation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Beta agonist", "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease", "Salmeterol", "Sympathetic activity"], "IndexKeywords": ["Administration, Inhalation", "Adrenergic beta-Agonists", "Aged", "Baroreflex", "Blood Pressure", "Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor", "Catecholamines", "Epinephrine", "Female", "Heart Rate", "Humans", "Lung", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Norepinephrine", "Peroneal Nerve", "Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive", "Pulse Wave Analysis", "Respiratory Function Tests", "Respiratory Rate", "Salmeterol Xinafoate", "Single-Blind Method", "Sympathetic Nervous System"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84931050065", "SubjectAreas": [["Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine", "MEDI", "2740"]], "AuthorData": {"55308994300": {"Name": "Haarmann H.", "AuthorID": "55308994300", "AffiliationID": "60021110", "AffiliationName": "Clinic for Cardiology and Pneumology, University Medical Center G\u00f6ttingen"}, "56685137400": {"Name": "Bornemann T.", "AuthorID": "56685137400", "AffiliationID": "60021110", "AffiliationName": "Clinic for Cardiology and Pneumology, University Medical Center G\u00f6ttingen"}, "55881271300": {"Name": "R\u00fcter K.", "AuthorID": "55881271300", "AffiliationID": "60021110", "AffiliationName": "Clinic for Cardiology and Pneumology, University Medical Center G\u00f6ttingen"}, "23135592200": {"Name": "Raupach T.", "AuthorID": "23135592200", "AffiliationID": "60021110", "AffiliationName": "Clinic for Cardiology and Pneumology, University Medical Center G\u00f6ttingen"}, "26643367300": {"Name": "Hasenfu\u00df G.", "AuthorID": "26643367300", "AffiliationID": "60021110", "AffiliationName": "Clinic for Cardiology and Pneumology, University Medical Center G\u00f6ttingen"}, "55357138700": {"Name": "Andreas S.", "AuthorID": "55357138700", "AffiliationID": "113181467", "AffiliationName": "Lung Clinic Immenhausen"}, "56685647100": {"Name": "Mohrlang C.", "AuthorID": "56685647100", "AffiliationID": "60111454", "AffiliationName": "GlaxoSmithKline (GSK)"}, "56685293200": {"Name": "Tschiesner U.", "AuthorID": "56685293200", "AffiliationID": "60111454", "AffiliationName": "GlaxoSmithKline (GSK)"}, "56685093600": {"Name": "Bonev S.", "AuthorID": "56685093600", "AffiliationID": "60016908", "AffiliationName": "Mannheim Biomedical Engineering Laboratories, Medical Faculty at Heidelberg University"}, "56563532200": {"Name": "Rubin D.", "AuthorID": "56563532200", "AffiliationID": "60097308", "AffiliationName": "GlaxoSmithKline"}}}
