KGaA, WeinheimPlasmonic nanostructures have demonstrated a remarkable ability to control light in ways never observed in nature, as the optical response is closely linked to their flexible geometric design. Due to lack of mirror symmetry, chiral nanostructures allow twisted electric field \u201chotspots\u201d to form at the material surface. These hotspots depend strongly on the optical wavelength and nanostructure geometry. Understanding the properties of these chiral hotspots is crucial for their applications; for instance, in enhancing the optical interactions with chiral molecules. Here, the results of an elegant experiment are presented: by designing 35 intermediate geometries, the structure is \u201cenantiomorphed\u201d from one handedness to the other, passing through an achiral geometry. Nonlinear multiphoton microscopy is used to demonstrate a new kind of double-bisignate circular dichroism due to enantiomorphing, rather than wavelength change. From group theory, a fundamental origin of this plasmonic chiroptical response is proposed. The analysis allows the optimization of plasmonic chiroptical materials.", "AuthorKeywords": ["chirality", "chiroptical effects", "metamaterials", "nonlinear optics", "plasmonic"], "IndexKeywords": ["Chiral nanostructures", "Chiroptical effects", "Intermediate geometries", "Multi-photon microscopy", "Nanostructure geometries", "Optical interactions", "Plasmonic", "Plasmonic nanostructures"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85046293841", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"]], "AuthorData": {"57193142092": {"Name": "Collins J.T.", "AuthorID": "57193142092", "AffiliationID": "60030480", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Photonics and Photonic Materials, and Centre for Nanoscience and Nanotechnology, Department of Physics, University of Bath"}, "10045795100": {"Name": "Valev V.K.", "AuthorID": "10045795100", "AffiliationID": "60030480", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Photonics and Photonic Materials, and Centre for Nanoscience and Nanotechnology, Department of Physics, University of Bath"}, "46062612900": {"Name": "Zheng X.", "AuthorID": "46062612900", "AffiliationID": "60025063", "AffiliationName": "ESAT-TELEMIC, KU Leuven"}, "7005545716": {"Name": "Vandenbosch G.A.E.", "AuthorID": "7005545716", "AffiliationID": "60025063", "AffiliationName": "ESAT-TELEMIC, KU Leuven"}, "56125065200": {"Name": "Braz N.V.S.", "AuthorID": "56125065200", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "London Centre for Nanotechnology, University College London"}, "7005264376": {"Name": "Warburton P.A.", "AuthorID": "7005264376", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "London Centre for Nanotechnology, University College London"}, "56088083500": {"Name": "Slenders E.", "AuthorID": "56088083500", "AffiliationID": "60014699, 60010413", "AffiliationName": "University Hasselt and Transnational University Limburg"}, "7003654143": {"Name": "Ameloot M.", "AuthorID": "7003654143", "AffiliationID": "60014699, 60010413", "AffiliationName": "University Hasselt and Transnational University Limburg"}, "56054738000": {"Name": "Zu S.", "AuthorID": "56054738000", "AffiliationID": "60014966", "AffiliationName": "School of Physics, State Key Lab for Mesoscopic Physics, and Collaborative Innovation Center of Quantum Matter, Peking University"}, "8684282600": {"Name": "Fang Z.", "AuthorID": "8684282600", "AffiliationID": "60014966", "AffiliationName": "School of Physics, State Key Lab for Mesoscopic Physics, and Collaborative Innovation Center of Quantum Matter, Peking University"}, "36047560000": {"Name": "Moshchalkov V.V.", "AuthorID": "36047560000", "AffiliationID": "60025063", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Solid State Physics and Magnetism, KU Leuven"}}}
