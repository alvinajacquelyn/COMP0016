While the burden of CKD is reasonably well defined in developed countries, increasing evidence indicates that the CKD burden may be even greater in developing countries. Diabetes, hypertension, and obesity are major contributors to the global burden of the disease and are important traditional CKD risk factors; however, nontraditional CKD risk factors such as nephrotoxin exposure, kidney stones, fetal and maternal factors, infections, environmental factors, and acute kidney injury are also increasingly being recognized as major threats to global kidney health. A broad approach to CKD prevention begins with the identification of CKD risk factors in the population, followed by the development of appropriate mitigation strategies. Effective prevention policies rely on an accurate understanding of the incidence and prevalence of CKD in a given setting, as well as the distribution and burden of risk factors. Populations or individuals at CKD risk must be screened and treated early to prevent the onset of and delay the progression of the kidney disease. Systematically collected data should be analyzed at country, province, and district levels to identify regional disparities and CKD hotspots and develop targeted prevention strategies. Race-ethnicity, genetics, sex, socioeconomic status, and geography are likely modifiers of CKD risk. A comprehensive, informed approach to prevention that takes into account all of these factors is therefore required to successfully tackle the global CKD epidemic.", "AuthorKeywords": ["acute kidney injury", "chronic kidney disease", "multi-sectoral approach", "prevention", "public health", "risk factors"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85031734992", "SubjectAreas": [["Nephrology", "MEDI", "2727"]], "AuthorData": {"6602423192": {"Name": "Luyckx V.A.", "AuthorID": "6602423192", "AffiliationID": "60019619", "AffiliationName": "Klinik f\u00fcr Nephrologie, Universit\u00e4tsspital"}, "7004370861": {"Name": "Tuttle K.R.", "AuthorID": "7004370861", "AffiliationID": "60015481", "AffiliationName": "Providence Medical Research Center, Providence Health Care Kidney Research Institute, Nephrology Division and Institute for Translational Health Sciences, University of Washington"}, "57204716567": {"Name": "Garcia-Garcia G.", "AuthorID": "57204716567", "AffiliationID": "60008943, 60032700", "AffiliationName": "Servicio de Nefrologia, Hospital Civil de Guadalajara Fray Antonio Alcalde, University of Guadalajara Health Sciences Center, Hospital 278"}, "55666335100": {"Name": "Gharbi M.B.", "AuthorID": "55666335100", "AffiliationID": "60192354, 60025457", "AffiliationName": "Urinary Tract Diseases Department, Faculty of Medicine and Pharmacy of Casablanca, University Hassan II of Casablanca"}, "26324845700": {"Name": "Heerspink H.J.L.", "AuthorID": "26324845700", "AffiliationID": "60006027, 60010023", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Pharmacy and Pharmacology, University of Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen"}, "34975083900": {"Name": "Johnson D.W.", "AuthorID": "34975083900", "AffiliationID": "60025258", "AffiliationName": "Metro South and Ipswich Nephrology and Transplant Services, Princess Alexandra Hospital"}, "56118017700": {"Name": "Liu Z.H.", "AuthorID": "56118017700", "AffiliationID": "60004667, 60069749", "AffiliationName": "National Clinical Research Center of Kidney Diseases, Jinling Hospital, Nanjing University School of Medicine"}, "7005894966": {"Name": "Massy Z.A.", "AuthorID": "7005894966", "AffiliationID": "60029937, 60106085, 60000905", "AffiliationName": "French National Institute of Health and Medical Research (INSERM) U1018, Team5, Centre for Research in Epidemiology and Population Health (CESP), Paris-Ile-de-France-West, Versailles-Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines University"}, "7005957196": {"Name": "Moe O.", "AuthorID": "7005957196", "AffiliationID": "60075964, 60014739, 60026695", "AffiliationName": "Department of Internal Medicine and Charles and Jane Pak Center of Mineral Metabolism and Clinical Research, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center"}, "7404561092": {"Name": "Nelson R.G.", "AuthorID": "7404561092", "AffiliationID": "60008438", "AffiliationName": "National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases"}, "22951739500": {"Name": "Sola L.", "AuthorID": "22951739500", "AffiliationID": "119642861", "AffiliationName": "Division Epidemiologia, Direccion General de Salud (DIGESA)-Ministerio Salud Publica"}, "7202992832": {"Name": "Wheeler D.C.", "AuthorID": "7202992832", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60032819", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Nephrology, Royal Free Hospital, University College London"}, "35752770000": {"Name": "White S.L.", "AuthorID": "35752770000", "AffiliationID": "60121699, 60025709", "AffiliationName": "Charles Perkins Centre, Sydney Medical School, The University of Sydney"}}}
