In earlier work Close and Aarts (2010) and Aarts, Close, and Wallis (2013) looked at the changing use of the modal and semi-modal auxiliaries in spoken English. While the results of these investigations are extremely valuable, they tell us very little about how modal verb usage has changed within the various modal verb phrase patterns.To our knowledge no one has ever looked at the frequencies of these various patterns, let alone how they have changed over time. In Section 4.2 we briefly introduce the Diachronic Corpus of Present-Day Spoken English (DCPSE; Aarts and Wallis 2006) which has been used as a database for the present research. In Section 4.3 we look at previous research on changes in the use of modal verbs as individual items (\u2018core modals\u2019) in written English. We will compare our findings on spoken English with those obtained by Leech (2003) and Leech et al. (2009) for written English in Section 4.4. In Section 4.5 we look at relative changes, while in Section 4.6 we will present the results of the research we have done on modal verbs occurring in various patterns, and how modal usage in these patterns has developed over time. In Section 4.7 we discuss our results. The final section is the conclusion. The database: Diachronic Corpus of Present-Day Spoken English DCPSE is a corpus of parsed (grammatically analyzed) spoken English which contains approximately 885,000 words: 464,000 taken from the London-Lund Corpus (LLC) which was collected between the 1960s and 1970s (Svartvik 1990 and Nelson et al. 2002) and 421,000 words from the British component of the International Corpus of English (ICE-GB) dating from the early 1990s. The phrase structure analysis used is a highly detailed \u2018traditional\u2019 one based on Quirk et al. (1985), familiar to many linguists.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84954236278", "SubjectAreas": [["Arts and Humanities (all)", "ARTS", "1200"], ["Social Sciences (all)", "SOCI", "3300"]], "AuthorData": {"8776604500": {"Name": "Aarts B.", "AuthorID": "8776604500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "35831968800": {"Name": "Wallis S.", "AuthorID": "35831968800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "56572230000": {"Name": "Bowie J.", "AuthorID": "56572230000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
