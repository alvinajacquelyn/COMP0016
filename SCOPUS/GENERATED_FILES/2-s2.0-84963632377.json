Communication between heterotypic cell types is essential for biological cohesion and is frequently dysregulated in disease. Despite the importance of heterocellular communication, most systems biology techniques do not report cell-specific signaling data from mixtures of cells. As a result, our existing perspective of cellular behavior under-represents the influence of heterocellular signaling. Recent technical advances now permit the resolution of systems-level cell-specific signaling data. This review discusses how new physical, spatial, and isotopic resolving methods are facilitating unique systems biology studies of heterocellular communication.", "AuthorKeywords": ["cell signaling", "cell\u2013cell communication", "heterocellular", "mass cytometry", "phosphoproteomics", "PTM", "systems biology"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cell-cell communications", "Cytometry", "Heterocellular", "Phosphoproteomics", "Systems biology", "Cell Communication", "Cell Separation", "Computer Simulation", "Gene Expression Profiling", "Lab-On-A-Chip Devices", "Models, Biological", "Proteome", "Systems Biology", "Tissue Array Analysis"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84963632377", "SubjectAreas": [["Biotechnology", "BIOC", "1305"], ["Bioengineering", "CENG", "1502"]], "AuthorData": {"36444399100": {"Name": "Tape C.", "AuthorID": "36444399100", "AffiliationID": "60022195", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biological Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology"}}}
