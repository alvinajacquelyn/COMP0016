In this study, we examined the association between POAG and common variations in gene-encoding mitochondrial proteins. METHODS. We examined genetic data from 3430 POAG cases and 3108 controls derived from the combination of the GLAUGEN and NEIGHBOR studies. We constructed biological-system coherent mitochondrial nuclear-encoded protein gene-sets by intersecting the MitoCarta database with the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database. We examined the mitochondrial gene-sets for association with POAG and with normal-tension glaucoma (NTG) and high-tension glaucoma (HTG) subsets using Pathway Analysis by Randomization Incorporating Structure. RESULTS. We identified 22 KEGG pathways with significant mitochondrial protein-encoding gene enrichment, belonging to six general biological classes. Among the pathway classes, mitochondrial lipid metabolism was associated with POAG overall (P = 0.013) and with NTG (P = 0.0006), and mitochondrial carbohydrate metabolism was associated with NTG (P = 0.030). Examining the individual KEGG pathway mitochondrial gene-sets, fatty acid elongation and synthesis and degradation of ketone bodies, both lipid metabolism pathways, were significantly associated with POAG (P = 0.005 and P = 0.002, respectively) and NTG (P = 0.0004 and P < 0.0001, respectively). Butanoate metabolism, a carbohydrate metabolism pathway, was significantly associated with POAG (P = 0.004), NTG (P = 0.001), and HTG (P = 0.010). CONCLUSIONS. We present an effective approach for assessing the contributions of mitochondrial genetic variation to open-angle glaucoma. Our findings support a role for mitochondria in POAG pathogenesis and specifically point to lipid and carbohydrate metabolism pathways as being important.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Genetics", "Glaucoma", "Mitochondria"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84988926124", "SubjectAreas": [["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"], ["Sensory Systems", "NEUR", "2809"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"]], "AuthorData": {"55195093800": {"Name": "Khawaja A.P.", "AuthorID": "55195093800", "AffiliationID": "60016691, 60022148, 60172638", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Biomedical Research Centre, Moorfields Eye Hospital National Health Service (NHS) Foundation Trust, University College London (UCL) Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "55796183300": {"Name": "Cooke Bailey J.N.", "AuthorID": "55796183300", "AffiliationID": "60006404", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Institute for Computational Biology, Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine"}, "35371857000": {"Name": "Haines J.L.", "AuthorID": "35371857000", "AffiliationID": "60006404", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Institute for Computational Biology, Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine"}, "35976132500": {"Name": "Kang J.H.", "AuthorID": "35976132500", "AffiliationID": "60002746, 60010869, 60016782", "AffiliationName": "Channing Division of Network Medicine, Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital, Harvard Medical School"}, "7003824401": {"Name": "Pasquale L.R.", "AuthorID": "7003824401", "AffiliationID": "60003828, 60002746", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, Harvard Medical School, Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary"}, "57188808765": {"Name": "Rand Allingham R.", "AuthorID": "57188808765", "AffiliationID": "60113147", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, Duke University Medical Center"}, "57211415330": {"Name": "Hauser M.A.", "AuthorID": "57211415330", "AffiliationID": "60113147", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Duke University Medical Center"}, "7005113362": {"Name": "Brilliant M.", "AuthorID": "7005113362", "AffiliationID": "60029075", "AffiliationName": "Marshfield Clinic Research Foundation"}, "7005066559": {"Name": "Budenz D.L.", "AuthorID": "7005066559", "AffiliationID": "60025111", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, University of North Carolina"}, "7007151909": {"Name": "Christen W.G.", "AuthorID": "7007151909", "AffiliationID": "60016782, 60002746", "AffiliationName": "Division of Preventive Medicine, Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital, Harvard Medical School"}, "6602136038": {"Name": "Fingert J.", "AuthorID": "6602136038", "AffiliationID": "114031828", "AffiliationName": "Stephen A.
