Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Royal Astronomical Society.We report modelling follow-up of recently discovered gravitational-lens candidates in the Canada France Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey. Lens modelling was done by a small group of specially interested volunteers from the SpaceWarps citizen-science community who originally found the candidate lenses. Models are categorized according to seven diagnostics indicating (a) the image morphology and how clear or indistinct it is, (b) whether the mass map and synthetic lensed image appear to be plausible, and (c) how the lens-model mass compares with the stellar mass and the abundance-matched halo mass. The lensing masses range from ~1011 to > 1013M\u2299. Preliminary estimates of the stellar masses show a smaller spread in stellar mass (except for two lenses): a factor of a few below or above ~1011M\u2299. Therefore, we expect the stellar-to-total mass fraction to decline sharply as lensing mass increases. The most massive system with a convincing model is J1434+522 (SW 05). The two low-mass outliers are J0206-095 (SW 19) and J2217+015 (SW 42); if these two are indeed lenses, they probe an interesting regime of very low star formation efficiency. Some improvements to the modelling software (SpaghettiLens), and discussion of strategies regarding scaling to future surveys with more and frequent discoveries, are included.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Dark matter", "Galaxies: general", "Galaxies: stellar content", "Gravitational lensing: strong"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85040254404", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"56868379900": {"Name": "K\u00fcng R.", "AuthorID": "56868379900", "AffiliationID": "60012614", "AffiliationName": "Physik-Institut, University of Zurich"}, "7203029486": {"Name": "Saha P.", "AuthorID": "7203029486", "AffiliationID": "60012614", "AffiliationName": "Physik-Institut, University of Zurich"}, "7004053948": {"Name": "Ferreras I.", "AuthorID": "7004053948", "AffiliationID": "60084281, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Mullard Space Science Laboratory, University College London"}, "54787290500": {"Name": "Baeten E.", "AuthorID": "54787290500", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Zooniverse, c/o Astrophysics Department, University of Oxford"}, "56800920800": {"Name": "Cornen C.", "AuthorID": "56800920800", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Zooniverse, c/o Astrophysics Department, University of Oxford"}, "56800306600": {"Name": "Macmillan C.", "AuthorID": "56800306600", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Zooniverse, c/o Astrophysics Department, University of Oxford"}, "7102877520": {"Name": "Wilcox J.K.", "AuthorID": "7102877520", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Zooniverse, c/o Astrophysics Department, University of Oxford"}, "24281359900": {"Name": "Coles J.", "AuthorID": "24281359900", "AffiliationID": "60019722", "AffiliationName": "Physik-Department, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen"}, "9239802400": {"Name": "Marshall P.", "AuthorID": "9239802400", "AffiliationID": "60091251, 60012708", "AffiliationName": "Kavli Institute for Particle Astrophysics and Cosmology, Stanford University"}, "23968123900": {"Name": "More A.", "AuthorID": "23968123900", "AffiliationID": "60025272", "AffiliationName": "Kavli IPMU (WPI), UTIAS, University of Tokyo"}, "57200214909": {"Name": "Oswald L.", "AuthorID": "57200214909", "AffiliationID": "60119666, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Murray Edwards College, University of Cambridge"}, "7401938216": {"Name": "Verma A.", "AuthorID": "7401938216", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Sub-department of Astrophysics, University of Oxford"}}}
