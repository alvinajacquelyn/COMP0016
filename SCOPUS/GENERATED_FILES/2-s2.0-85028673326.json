While the hallmark of immunodeficiency is susceptibility to infection, it is increasingly clear that autoimmunity is prevalent, suggestive of a more general immune dysregulation in some cases. With the increasing use of genetic technologies, the underlying causes of immune dysregulation are beginning to emerge. Here we provide a review of the heterozygous mutations found in the immune checkpoint protein CTLA-4, identified in cases of common variable immunodeficiency disorders (CVID) with accompanying autoimmunity. Study of these mutations provides insights into the biology of CTLA-4 as well as suggesting approaches for rational treatment of these patients.", "AuthorKeywords": ["autoimmunity", "co-stimulation", "immunodeficiency diseases", "regulatory T cells", "T cells"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Autoimmunity", "Common Variable Immunodeficiency", "CTLA-4 Antigen", "Humans", "Immunotherapy", "Lymphocyte Activation", "Mutation", "Signal Transduction", "T-Lymphocytes"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85028673326", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"]], "AuthorData": {"55777490400": {"Name": "Verma N.", "AuthorID": "55777490400", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Immunology Department, Royal Free Hospital"}, "8778070100": {"Name": "Burns S.O.", "AuthorID": "8778070100", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60032819", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity, School of Life and Medical Sciences, Institute of Immunity and Transplantation, University College London, Royal Free Hospital"}, "7402359366": {"Name": "Walker L.S.K.", "AuthorID": "7402359366", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60032819", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity, School of Life and Medical Sciences, Institute of Immunity and Transplantation, University College London, Royal Free Hospital"}, "7005289543": {"Name": "Sansom D.M.", "AuthorID": "7005289543", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60032819", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity, School of Life and Medical Sciences, Institute of Immunity and Transplantation, University College London, Royal Free Hospital"}}}
