Here we investigate the adsorption and aggregation of surfactants on hydrophobic stripes crossing each other perpendicularly (i.e., crossing stripes) and on hydrophobic steps. The results are compared with those obtained for isolated stripes. We find that on crossing stripes of moderate stripe widths (e.g., L = 0.61LS, 1.22LS and 1.83LS, where LS is the length of one surfactant molecule) the crossing region hinders the formation of defect-free adsorbed surfactant structures. By increasing the stripe width and/or by increasing the length of one of the two perpendicularly crossing stripes (i.e., lowering the surface density of defects/intersections), the crossing region is found to have a weaker effect on the features of the adsorbed structures. Regarding surfactant adsorption on steps, our simulation results show that the self-assembled aggregates can be stretched along the step corner, and the resultant elastic deformation can hinder adsorption. This qualitative observation can facilitate a description of surfactant adsorption that takes into consideration also the deformation of the self-assembled film. As suggested by such a general model, increasing the convex angle of the step, increasing the size of the surfactant head groups, and changing other physical parameters can reduce the elastic energy penalty, and yield larger amounts of surfactants adsorbed. The results presented could assist in understanding and sometimes predicting surfactant adsorption on heterogeneous surfaces, suggest methods to formulate surfactant mixtures to control surface coverage on heterogeneous surfaces, and perhaps facilitate new methods for the fabrication of nano-structured surfaces.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Dissipative particle dynamics", "Heterogeneous surface", "Nanostructured surface", "Qualitative observations", "Surface heterogeneities", "Surfactant adsorption", "Surfactant head groups", "Surfactants adsorption"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85010775138", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"]], "AuthorData": {"49662147800": {"Name": "Suttipong M.", "AuthorID": "49662147800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "6602824221": {"Name": "Striolo A.", "AuthorID": "6602824221", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "7006090144": {"Name": "Grady B.", "AuthorID": "7006090144", "AffiliationID": "60030931", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemical, Biological and Materials Engineering, University of Oklahoma"}}}
