Published by John Wiley & Sons LtdAim: The diagnosis of tongue-tie (or ankyloglossia) has increased more than 10-fold in some countries. Whether this is a global phenomenon or related to cultural and professional differences is uncertain. Methods: An online survey in English, Japanese, Chinese and Spanish was disseminated between May and November 2016 via 27 international professional bodies to >30 clinical professions chosen a priori to represent occupations involved in the management of neonatal ankyloglossia. Results: A total of 1721 responses came from nursing (51%), medical (40%), dental (6%) and allied health (4%) clinicians. Nurses (40%) and allied health (34%) professionals were more likely than doctors (8%) to consider ankyloglossia as important for lactation problems, as were western (83%) compared to Asian (52%) clinicians. Referrals to clinicians for ankyloglossia management originated mainly from parents (38%). Interprofessional referrals were not clearly defined. Frenectomies were most likely to be performed by surgeons (65%) and dentists (35%), who were also less likely to be involved in lactation support. Clinicians performing frenectomies were more likely to consider analgesia as important compared to those not performing frenectomies. Conclusion: The diagnosis and treatment of ankyloglossia vary considerably around the world and between professions. Efforts to standardise management are required.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Ankyloglossia", "Frenectomy", "Opinion", "Survey"], "IndexKeywords": ["Ankyloglossia", "Attitude of Health Personnel", "Breast Feeding", "Feeding Behavior", "Internationality", "Lingual Frenum", "Surveys and Questionnaires"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85042154940", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"]], "AuthorData": {"57200674462": {"Name": "Jin R.R.", "AuthorID": "57200674462", "AffiliationID": "60028333", "AffiliationName": "School of Women's and Children's Health, University of New South Wales"}, "7201478175": {"Name": "Smyth J.", "AuthorID": "7201478175", "AffiliationID": "60006598", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Midwifery Consultant for Lactation Services, Royal Hospital for women"}, "6603673655": {"Name": "Oei J.L.", "AuthorID": "6603673655", "AffiliationID": "60006598", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Midwifery Consultant for Lactation Services, Royal Hospital for women"}, "7005644774": {"Name": "Sutcliffe A.", "AuthorID": "7005644774", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "PPP Theme, UCL and Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "7006461497": {"Name": "Vento M.", "AuthorID": "7006461497", "AffiliationID": "60032451", "AffiliationName": "Division of Neonatology, University and Polytechnic Hospital La Fe"}, "57200676729": {"Name": "Miles C.", "AuthorID": "57200676729", "AffiliationID": "60006598", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Midwifery Consultant for Lactation Services, Royal Hospital for women"}, "56633484700": {"Name": "Travadi J.", "AuthorID": "56633484700", "AffiliationID": "60000825", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neonatology, John Hunter Children's Hospital"}, "57194978985": {"Name": "Wooderson S.", "AuthorID": "57194978985", "AffiliationID": "60000825", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neonatology, John Hunter Children's Hospital"}, "57200675518": {"Name": "Kishore K.", "AuthorID": "57200675518", "AffiliationID": "114113918", "AffiliationName": "Cloudnine Hospitals"}, "55503670100": {"Name": "Suzuki K.", "AuthorID": "55503670100", "AffiliationID": "60028799", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatrics, Tokai University School of Medicine"}, "7201388363": {"Name": "Todd D.", "AuthorID": "7201388363", "AffiliationID": "60016880", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neonatology, Canberra Hospital"}, "57188630610": {"Name": "Kamar A.A.", "AuthorID": "57188630610", "AffiliationID": "60013665", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neonatology, University of Malaya Medical Centre"}, "57199702992": {"Name": "Ma L.", "AuthorID": "57199702992", "AffiliationID": "121343929", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatrics, Shijiazhuang Children's Hospital"}}}
