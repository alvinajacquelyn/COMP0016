Successful healing of stress fractures in high demand individuals is important to prevent complications upon early return to activity. This article reviews the literature on outcomes of surgical management of stress fractures in high demand individuals. An online literature search was carried out for articles published up to and including January 2017. Twenty five papers were reviewed. In the majority of studies, no complications were reported, clinical and radiographic healing was achieved, and patients returned to their premorbid level of activity. Current literature suggests good outcomes after surgical management of stress fractures in high demand individuals, particularly those in whom conservative treatment has failed. Further studies comparing surgical techniques are necessary to demonstrate the most efficacious.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85041691905", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"57200562188": {"Name": "Maden M.C.", "AuthorID": "57200562188", "AffiliationID": "60029950, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Medical School, University College London"}, "57195349854": {"Name": "Robbins A.", "AuthorID": "57195349854", "AffiliationID": "60029950, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Medical School, University College London"}, "13605606100": {"Name": "Volpin A.", "AuthorID": "13605606100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Trauma and Orthopaedics, University College London"}, "34767767000": {"Name": "Biz C.", "AuthorID": "34767767000", "AffiliationID": "60000481", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery, Onchology, Gastroentherology DiSCOG, University of Padua"}, "24466324900": {"Name": "Konan S.", "AuthorID": "24466324900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Orthopaedics, University College London"}}}
