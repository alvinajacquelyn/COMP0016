This register-based study from Finland aimed to analyze in which ways the type of job contract (none, temporary, or permanent) at the start of maternity leave predicts labor market attachment in the long term. The mother cohorts were followed up for 11 years. Labor market attachment was analyzed with latent class growth analysis, which makes it possible to identify subgroups with differing track and level of development. Lack of employment and having a temporary contract at baseline were associated with slower and weaker labor market attachment irrespective of mother's age, socioeconomic status, and subsequent births. These findings suggest that the polarization of women into the core and periphery of the labor market structure tends to continue after the birth of the first child. Temporary employment might be an obstacle for having rights for a job-protected family leave and have long-term consequences on the continuity of employment and the division of paid and unpaid work in the family.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Finland", "Labor market attachment", "Latent class growth analysis", "Mothers' employment", "Temporary employment"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85015091776", "SubjectAreas": [["Industrial Relations", "BUSI", "1410"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"], ["Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management", "BUSI", "1407"], ["Life-span and Life-course Studies", "SOCI", "3319"]], "AuthorData": {"36180320100": {"Name": "Peutere L.", "AuthorID": "36180320100", "AffiliationID": "60011170", "AffiliationName": "University of Tampere, School of Health Sciences"}, "7003922524": {"Name": "Vahtera J.", "AuthorID": "7003922524", "AffiliationID": "60006876", "AffiliationName": "University of Turku, Department of Public Health"}, "7004391239": {"Name": "Kivim\u00e4ki M.", "AuthorID": "7004391239", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Department of Epidemiology and Public Health"}, "7003843149": {"Name": "Pentti J.", "AuthorID": "7003843149", "AffiliationID": "60010493", "AffiliationName": "Finnish Institute of Occupational Health"}, "7005328637": {"Name": "Virtanen P.", "AuthorID": "7005328637", "AffiliationID": "60011170", "AffiliationName": "University of Tampere, School of Health Sciences"}}}
