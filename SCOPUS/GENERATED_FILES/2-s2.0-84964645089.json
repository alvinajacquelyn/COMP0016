However, adapting and configuring these algorithms for a specific problem can demand significant effort from software engineers. Therefore, to help in this task, a hyper-heuristic, named HITO (Hyper-heuristic for the Integration and Test Order problem) was proposed to adaptively select search operators during the optimization process. HITO was successfully applied using NSGA-II for solving the integration and test order problem. HITO can use two hyper-heuristic selection methods: Choice Function and Multi-armed Bandit. However, a hypotheses behind this study is that HITO does not depend of NSGA-II and can be used with other MOEAs. To this aim, this paper presents results from evaluation experiments comparing the performance of HITO using two different MOEAs: NSGA-II and SPEA2. The results show that HITO is able to outperform both MOEAs.", "AuthorKeywords": ["genetic algorithms", "hyper-heuristic", "integration and test order", "multi-objective optimization", "search-based software engineering", "software testing"], "IndexKeywords": ["Evaluation experiments", "Hyperheuristic", "Multi armed bandit", "Multi objective evolutionary algorithms", "Search operators", "Search-based software engineering", "Specific problems", "Test orderings"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84964645089", "SubjectAreas": [["Artificial Intelligence", "COMP", "1702"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"]], "AuthorData": {"56310164700": {"Name": "Guizzo G.", "AuthorID": "56310164700", "AffiliationID": "60015043", "AffiliationName": "DInf Informatics Department, Federal University of Paran\u00e1"}, "6506290092": {"Name": "Vergilio S.", "AuthorID": "6506290092", "AffiliationID": "60015043", "AffiliationName": "DInf Informatics Department, Federal University of Paran\u00e1"}, "13404845400": {"Name": "Pozo A.", "AuthorID": "13404845400", "AffiliationID": "60015043", "AffiliationName": "DInf Informatics Department, Federal University of Paran\u00e1"}}}
