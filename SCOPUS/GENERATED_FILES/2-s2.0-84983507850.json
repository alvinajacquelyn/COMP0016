We first show that this capacity is only a function of the linear span of Choi-Kraus operators of the channel, which generalizes the bipartite equivocation graph of a classical channel, and which we dub non-commutative bipartite graph. Then, we go on to show that the feedback-assisted capacity is non-zero (allowing for a constant amount of activating noiseless communication) if and only if the non-commutative bipartite graph is non-trivial, and give a number of equivalent characterizations. This result involves a far-reaching extension of the conclusive exclusion of quantum states. We then present an upper bound on the feedback-assisted zero-error capacity, motivated by a conjecture originally made by Shannon and proved later by Ahlswede. We demonstrate that this bound to have many good properties, including being additive and given by a minimax formula. We also prove a coding theorem showing that this quantity is the entanglement-assisted capacity against an adversarially chosen channel from the set of all channels with the same Choi-Kraus span, which can also be interpreted as the feedback-assisted unambiguous capacity. The proof relies on a generalization of the Postselection Lemma (de Finetti reduction) that allows to reflect additional constraints, and which we believe to be of independent interest. This capacity is a relaxation of the feedback-assisted zero-error capacity; however, we have to leave open the question of whether they coincide in general. We illustrate our ideas with a number of examples, including classical-quantum channels and Weyl diagonal channels, and close with an extensive discussion of open questions.", "AuthorKeywords": ["feedback", "Quantum information", "zero-error capacity"], "IndexKeywords": ["Bipartite graphs", "Classical-quantum channels", "Noiseless feedback", "Non-commutative", "Quantum capacity", "Quantum channel", "Quantum Information", "Zero-error capacity"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84983507850", "SubjectAreas": [["Information Systems", "COMP", "1710"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Library and Information Sciences", "SOCI", "3309"]], "AuthorData": {"7101980566": {"Name": "Duan R.", "AuthorID": "7101980566", "AffiliationID": "60003707, 60190743, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "UTS-Academy of Mathematics and Systems Science (AMSS), Joint Research Laboratory for Quantum Computation and Quantum Information Processing, AMSS, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "8984521800": {"Name": "Severini S.", "AuthorID": "8984521800", "AffiliationID": "60025084", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Natural Sciences, Shanghai Jiao Tong University"}, "7202642495": {"Name": "Winter A.", "AuthorID": "7202642495", "AffiliationID": "60023020, 60032907", "AffiliationName": "ICREA (Instituci\u00f3 Catalana de Recerca i Estudis Avancats), Grup d'Informaci\u00f3 Quantica, Departament de Fasica, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona"}}}
