By contrast oral language skills and text generation have been found to be less influential in the texts produced by beginning writers. To date, our understanding of the role of spelling skills in transparent orthographies is limited. The current study addressed this gap by examining the contribution of spelling, oral language and text generation skills in written text production in Italian beginner writers. Eighty-three children aged 7\u20138 years participated in the study. Spelling, lexical retrieval, receptive grammar, and written sentence generation and reformulation skills were assessed and children were asked to write a text on a set topic. A factor analysis revealed that the children\u2019s written text production was captured by three factors: productivity, complexity and accuracy. In contrast to results from children learning to write in opaque orthographies, such as English, this study showed that receptive grammar and written sentence generation skills accounted for significant variance in measures of productivity, complexity and accuracy in Italian children\u2019s written text production. Spelling skills contributed to text accuracy and quality and explained more variance than receptive grammar in microstructural accuracy. By contrast, oral grammatical skills explained more variance in text quality than spelling. The current study shows the differential impact of language systems, such as Italian, on written text production. Implications for assessment and instruction are outlined.", "AuthorKeywords": ["And grammatical skills", "Lexical retrieval", "Spelling", "Text generation", "Writing development"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84958873160", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuropsychology and Physiological Psychology", "PSYC", "3206"], ["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["Linguistics and Language", "SOCI", "3310"], ["Speech and Hearing", "HEAL", "3616"]], "AuthorData": {"15065071300": {"Name": "Arf\u00e9 B.", "AuthorID": "15065071300", "AffiliationID": "60000481", "AffiliationName": "Dipartimento di Psicologia dello Sviluppo e della Socializzazione, University of Padova"}, "7004429681": {"Name": "Dockrell J.", "AuthorID": "7004429681", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Education, UCL"}, "35981443500": {"Name": "De Bernardi B.", "AuthorID": "35981443500", "AffiliationID": "60032256", "AffiliationName": "University of Verona"}}}
