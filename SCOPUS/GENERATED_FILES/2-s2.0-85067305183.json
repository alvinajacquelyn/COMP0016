The mutation leads to overactivity in the target tissues and to a wide phenotype of clinical features that vary in severity and age of onset. The rarity of the disease and its variable presentation to multiple specialities often leads to misdiagnosis and inappropriate variability in investigations and treatments. To address this, our international consortium of clinicians, researchers, and patients' advocates has developed pragmatic clinical guidelines for best clinical practice for the definition, diagnosis, staging, treatment and monitoring for FD/MAS to empower patients and support clinical teams in both general and specialised healthcare settings. With the lack of strong evidence to inform care, the guidelines were developed based on review of published literature, long-standing extensive experience of authors, input from other healthcare professionals involved in the care of FD/MAS patients and feedback from patients and patient groups across the globe. This has led to the formulation of a set of statements to inform healthcare professionals, patients, their families, carers and patient groups of the best practice of care. It is anticipated the implementation of these recommendations will lead to improvement in the care of patients with FD/MAS internationally.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Diagnosis", "Fibrous dysplasia", "Guidelines", "Management", "McCune Albright syndrome"], "IndexKeywords": ["Fibrous Dysplasia of Bone", "Fibrous Dysplasia, Polyostotic", "Humans"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85067305183", "SubjectAreas": [["Genetics (clinical)", "MEDI", "2716"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"7003462266": {"Name": "Javaid M.K.", "AuthorID": "7003462266", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Nuffield Department of Orthopaedics, Rheumatology and Musculoskeletal Sciences, University of Oxford"}, "54793908200": {"Name": "Boyce A.", "AuthorID": "54793908200", "AffiliationID": "60023653", "AffiliationName": "Skeletal Disorders and Mineral Homeostasis Section, National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research"}, "57216559701": {"Name": "Collins M.T.", "AuthorID": "57216559701", "AffiliationID": "60023653", "AffiliationName": "Skeletal Disorders and Mineral Homeostasis Section, National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research"}, "46160890700": {"Name": "Appelman-Dijkstra N.", "AuthorID": "46160890700", "AffiliationID": "60015618", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Division of Endocrinology, Center for Bone Quality, Leiden University Medical Center"}, "18535151000": {"Name": "Hamdy N.A.T.", "AuthorID": "18535151000", "AffiliationID": "60015618", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Division of Endocrinology, Center for Bone Quality, Leiden University Medical Center"}, "10739531300": {"Name": "Ong J.", "AuthorID": "10739531300", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Plastic Surgery, Craniofacial Centre, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Trust"}, "7003473662": {"Name": "Defabianis P.", "AuthorID": "7003473662", "AffiliationID": "60012259", "AffiliationName": "Section of Paediatric Dentistry, University of Turin"}, "6601982797": {"Name": "Offiah A.", "AuthorID": "6601982797", "AffiliationID": "60001881", "AffiliationName": "Department of Oncology and Metabolism, University of Sheffield"}, "57209303444": {"Name": "Arunde P.", "AuthorID": "57209303444", "AffiliationID": "60002869", "AffiliationName": "Metabolic Bone Team, Sheffield Children's Hospital"}, "8695423000": {"Name": "Shaw N.", "AuthorID": "8695423000", "AffiliationID": "60170285", "AffiliationName": "Endocrine Department, Birmingham Women's and Children's NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57209304818": {"Name": "Pos V.D.", "AuthorID": "57209304818", "AffiliationID": "122706419", "AffiliationName": "European Association of Friends of McCune-Albright Syndrome (TO)"}, "57209307965": {"Name": "Underhil A.", "AuthorID": "57209307965", "AffiliationID": "122706505", "AffiliationName": "Fibrous Dysplasia Support Society"}, "57209305877": {"Name": "Portero D.", "AuthorID": "57209305877", "AffiliationID": "122705579", "AffiliationName": "Fibrous Dysplasia Foundation"}, "57151515100": {"Name": "Heral L.", "AuthorID": "57151515100", "AffiliationID": "122705579", "AffiliationName": "Fibrous Dysplasia Foundation"}, "6603562860": {"Name": "Heegaard A.M.", "AuthorID": "6603562860", "AffiliationID": "60030840", "AffiliationName": "Department of Drug Design and Pharmacology, University of Copenhagen"}, "7004365273": {"Name": "Masi L.", "AuthorID": "7004365273", "AffiliationID": "60021859", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery and Translational Medicine, University of Florence"}, "7102461515": {"Name": "Brandi M.L.", "AuthorID": "7102461515", "AffiliationID": "60021859", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery and Translational Medicine, University of Florence"}, "6603609992": {"Name": "Monsell F.", "AuthorID": "6603609992", "AffiliationID": "60170515", "AffiliationName": "Paediatric Orthopaedic and Trauma Surgery, University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7101932777": {"Name": "Stanton R.", "AuthorID": "7101932777", "AffiliationID": "60026523", "AffiliationName": "Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Nemours Children's Hospital"}, "36165320400": {"Name": "Dijkstra P.D.S.", "AuthorID": "36165320400", "AffiliationID": "60015618", "AffiliationName": "Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Leiden University Medical Center"}, "6701502772": {"Name": "Chapurlat R.", "AuthorID": "6701502772", "AffiliationID": "60102126, 60000905", "AffiliationName": "INSERM UMR 1033, Universit\u00e9 de Lyon"}}}
