These experimental results are used to validate charges calculated with three computational methods: charges from electrostatic potentials using a grid-based method (ChelpG), natural bond orbital population analysis, and the atoms in molecules approach. By combining these results with those from a previous study on sulfur, we find that ChelpG charges provide the best description of the charge distribution in ILs. However, we find that ChelpG charges can lead to significant conformational dependence and therefore advise that small differences in ChelpG charges (<0.3 e) should be interpreted with care. We use these validated charges to provide physical insight into nitrogen atomic charges for the ILs probed.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Atomic charge", "Atoms in Molecules", "Electrostatic potentials", "Experimental validations", "Grid based method", "Ionic liquid (ils)", "Natural bond orbital"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85041814467", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"]], "AuthorData": {"57195972505": {"Name": "Fogarty R.M.", "AuthorID": "57195972505", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Imperial College London"}, "24435902900": {"Name": "Matthews R.P.", "AuthorID": "24435902900", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Imperial College London"}, "57200630963": {"Name": "Ashworth C.R.", "AuthorID": "57200630963", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Imperial College London"}, "7202324320": {"Name": "Hunt P.A.", "AuthorID": "7202324320", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Imperial College London"}, "57194978204": {"Name": "Brandt-Talbot A.", "AuthorID": "57194978204", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, Imperial College London"}, "8227436900": {"Name": "Palgrave R.G.", "AuthorID": "8227436900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "35304472000": {"Name": "Bourne R.A.", "AuthorID": "35304472000", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemical and Process Engineering, Institute of Process Research and Development, School of Chemistry, University of Leeds"}, "55308119600": {"Name": "Vander Hoogerstraete T.", "AuthorID": "55308119600", "AffiliationID": "60025063", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, KU Leuven"}, "8535219800": {"Name": "Lovelock K.R.J.", "AuthorID": "8535219800", "AffiliationID": "60012197", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Reading"}}}
