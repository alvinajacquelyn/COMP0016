To test this question in mammals, we investigate the lateral cerebellum, a neurobiological system that is novel to mammals, and is associated with higher cognitive functions. We map the evolutionary diversification of the mammalian cerebellum and find that relative volumetric changes of the lateral cerebellar hemispheres (independent of cerebellar size) are correlated with measures of domain-general cognition in primates, and are characterized by a combination of parallel and convergent shifts towards similar levels of expansion in distantly related mammalian lineages. Results suggest that multiple independent evolutionary occurrences of increased behavioral complexity in mammals may at least partly be explained by selection on a common neural system, the cerebellum, which may have been subject to multiple independent neurodevelopmental remodeling events during mammalian evolution.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Biological Evolution", "Bottle-Nosed Dolphin", "Cattle", "Cerebellum", "Cognition", "Humans", "Hylobates", "Macaca mulatta", "Mammals", "Organ Size", "Phylogeny", "Sea Lions", "Ursidae"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85051957092", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Immunology and Microbiology (all)", "IMMU", "2400"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"35103506500": {"Name": "Smaers J.", "AuthorID": "35103506500", "AffiliationID": "60026415", "AffiliationName": "Center for the Advanced Study of Human Paleobiology, Stony Brook University"}, "54938885400": {"Name": "Turner A.", "AuthorID": "54938885400", "AffiliationID": "60026415", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anatomical Sciences, Stony Brook University"}, "19638655200": {"Name": "G\u00f3mez-Robles A.", "AuthorID": "19638655200", "AffiliationID": "60003088", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anthropology, The George Washington University"}, "7005043387": {"Name": "Sherwood C.", "AuthorID": "7005043387", "AffiliationID": "60003088", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anthropology, The George Washington University"}}}
