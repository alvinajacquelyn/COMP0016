Here we describe a phased mass spectrometry-based approach for the discovery, screening, and validation of circulating protein biomarkers with diagnostic value. Initially, we profiled human primary tumor tissue epithelia and characterized about 300 secreted and cell surface candidate glycoproteins. These candidates were then screened in patient systemic circulation to identify detectable candidates in blood plasma. An 88-plex targeting method was established to systematically monitor these proteins in two large and independent cohorts of plasma samples, which generated quantitative clinical datasets at an unprecedented scale. The data were deployed to develop and evaluate a five-protein biomarker signature for colorectal cancer detection.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Colorectal cancer", "Diagnostic protein biomarker", "Discovery-driven and targeted proteomics"], "IndexKeywords": ["Biomarkers, Tumor", "Clinical Laboratory Techniques", "Colorectal Neoplasms", "Humans", "Mass Spectrometry", "Plasma"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84940786379", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Medicine", "BIOC", "1313"]], "AuthorData": {"24339487500": {"Name": "Surinova S.", "AuthorID": "24339487500", "AffiliationID": "60109234, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Cancer Institute, University College London"}, "36062824100": {"Name": "Liu Y.", "AuthorID": "36062824100", "AffiliationID": "60025858", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biology, Institute of Molecular Systems Biology, ETH Zurich"}, "8701936100": {"Name": "Matondo M.", "AuthorID": "8701936100", "AffiliationID": "60025858", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biology, Institute of Molecular Systems Biology, ETH Zurich"}, "35185117000": {"Name": "H\u00fcttenhain R.", "AuthorID": "35185117000", "AffiliationID": "60025858", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biology, Institute of Molecular Systems Biology, ETH Zurich"}, "54885927100": {"Name": "Weisser H.", "AuthorID": "54885927100", "AffiliationID": "60025858", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biology, Institute of Molecular Systems Biology, ETH Zurich"}, "36066918700": {"Name": "Aebersold R.", "AuthorID": "36066918700", "AffiliationID": "60012614", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Science, University of Zurich"}, "56245284900": {"Name": "Choi M.", "AuthorID": "56245284900", "AffiliationID": "60028629, 60009254", "AffiliationName": "Department of Statistics, Purdue University"}, "37036997000": {"Name": "Chang C.Y.", "AuthorID": "37036997000", "AffiliationID": "60028629, 60009254", "AffiliationName": "Department of Statistics, Purdue University"}, "36947839800": {"Name": "Clough T.", "AuthorID": "36947839800", "AffiliationID": "60028629, 60009254", "AffiliationName": "Department of Statistics, Purdue University"}, "57203681819": {"Name": "Vitek O.", "AuthorID": "57203681819", "AffiliationID": "60028628", "AffiliationName": "College of Science and College of Computer and Information Science, Northeastern University"}, "57220885835": {"Name": "Tao S.", "AuthorID": "57220885835", "AffiliationID": "60009860", "AffiliationName": "Department of Preventive Medicine, Center for Genomic Translational Medicine and Prevention, School of Public Health, Fudan University"}, "7201832825": {"Name": "Brenner H.", "AuthorID": "7201832825", "AffiliationID": "60017059", "AffiliationName": "German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ)"}, "22036306700": {"Name": "Sch\u00fcffler P.J.", "AuthorID": "22036306700", "AffiliationID": "60025858", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, Institute for Machine Learning, ETH Zurich"}, "7004241909": {"Name": "Buhmann J.M.", "AuthorID": "7004241909", "AffiliationID": "60025858", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, Institute for Machine Learning, ETH Zurich"}, "6603742996": {"Name": "Vyslou\u017eil K.", "AuthorID": "6603742996", "AffiliationID": "60008462", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery, University Hospital in Olomouc"}, "55362311800": {"Name": "Khoylou M.", "AuthorID": "55362311800", "AffiliationID": "60003367", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Molecular and Translational Medicine, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, Palack\u00fd University"}, "15048693600": {"Name": "Srovnal J.", "AuthorID": "15048693600", "AffiliationID": "60003367", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Molecular and Translational Medicine, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, Palack\u00fd University"}, "55942123700": {"Name": "Hajd\u00fach M.", "AuthorID": "55942123700", "AffiliationID": "60003367", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Molecular and Translational Medicine, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, Palack\u00fd University"}}}
