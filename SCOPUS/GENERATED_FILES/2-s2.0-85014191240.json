When detrimental surface-related effects such as irreversible capacity loss due to interphase formation (known as solid-electrolyte interphase, SEI) can be mitigated or altogether avoided, the greatest advantage can be achieved by maximizing the gravimetric and volumetric surface area and by tailoring the porosity to accommodate the relevant ion species. We investigate this concept by employing zeolite-templated carbon (ZTC) as the cathode in an aluminum battery based on a chloroaluminate ionic liquid electrolyte. Its ultrahigh surface area and dense, conductive network of homogeneous channels (12 \u00c5 in width) render ZTC suitable for the fast, dense storage of AlCl4- ions (6 \u00c5 in ionic diameter). With aluminum as the anode, full cells were prepared which simultaneously exhibited both high specific energy (up to 64 Wh kg-1, 30 Wh L-1) and specific power (up to 290 W kg-1, 93 W L-1), highly stable cycling performance, and complete reversibility within the potential range of 0.01-2.20 V.", "AuthorKeywords": ["adsorption", "aluminum", "battery", "carbon", "energy storage", "ion", "microporous", "porous materials", "surface area"], "IndexKeywords": ["battery", "Chloroaluminate ionic liquids", "Electrochemical energy storage", "Irreversible capacity loss", "Microporous", "Solid electrolyte interphase", "Surface area", "Zeolite templated carbons"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85014191240", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Engineering (all)", "ENGI", "2200"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"36480522400": {"Name": "Stadie N.P.", "AuthorID": "36480522400", "AffiliationID": "60020086", "AffiliationName": "Empa - Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology"}, "57191711760": {"Name": "Wang S.", "AuthorID": "57191711760", "AffiliationID": "60020086", "AffiliationName": "Empa - Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology"}, "22941169400": {"Name": "Kravchyk K.V.", "AuthorID": "22941169400", "AffiliationID": "60020086", "AffiliationName": "Empa - Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology"}, "12797537000": {"Name": "Kovalenko M.V.", "AuthorID": "12797537000", "AffiliationID": "60020086", "AffiliationName": "Empa - Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology"}}}
