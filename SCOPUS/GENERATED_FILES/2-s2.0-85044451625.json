Medications are a potentially modifiable risk factor for hospitalizations. Objective: Our objective was to systematically review the association between medications or prescribing patterns and hospitalizations from LTCFs. Methods: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (IPA) from inception to August 2017 for longitudinal studies reporting associations between medications or prescribing patterns and hospitalizations. Two independent investigators completed the study selection, data extraction and quality assessment using the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Tools. Results: Three randomized controlled trials (RCTs), 22 cohort studies, five case\u2013control studies, one case-time-control study and one case-crossover study, investigating 13 different medication classes and two prescribing patterns were included. An RCT demonstrated that high-dose influenza vaccination reduced all-cause hospitalization compared with standard-dose vaccination (risk ratio [RR] 0.93; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.88\u20130.98). Another RCT found no difference in hospitalization rates between oseltamivir as influenza treatment and oseltamivir as treatment plus prophylaxis (treatment = 4.7%, treatment and prophylaxis = 3.5%; p = 0.7). The third RCT found no difference between multivitamin/mineral supplementation and hospitalization (odds ratio [OR] 0.94; 95% CI 0.74\u20131.20) or emergency department visits (OR 1.05; 95% CI 0.76\u20131.47). Two cohort studies demonstrated influenza vaccination reduced hospitalization. Four studies suggested polypharmacy and potentially inappropriate medications (PIMs) increased all-cause hospitalization. However, associations between polypharmacy (two studies), PIMs (one study) and fall-related hospitalizations were inconsistent. Inconsistent associations were found between psychotropic medications with all-cause and cause-specific hospitalizations (11 studies). Warfarin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, pantoprazole and vinpocetine but not long-term acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), statins, trimetazidine, digoxin or \u03b2-blockers were associated with all-cause or cause-specific hospitalizations in single studies of specific resident populations. Most cohort studies assessed prevalent rather than incident medication exposure, and no studies considered time-varying medication use. Conclusion: High-quality evidence suggests influenza vaccination reduces hospitalization. Polypharmacy and PIMs are consistently associated with increased all-cause hospitalization.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Age Factors", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Case-Control Studies", "Cohort Studies", "Cross-Over Studies", "Drug Prescriptions", "Emergency Service, Hospital", "Hospitalization", "Humans", "Inappropriate Prescribing", "Long-Term Care", "Nursing Homes", "Polypharmacy"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85044451625", "SubjectAreas": [["Geriatrics and Gerontology", "MEDI", "2717"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"57190395477": {"Name": "Wang K.", "AuthorID": "57190395477", "AffiliationID": "60019578", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Centre for Medicine Use and Safety, Monash University"}, "35508107000": {"Name": "Bell J.", "AuthorID": "35508107000", "AffiliationID": "60019578", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine, School of Public Health and Preventive Medicine, Monash University"}, "57059758600": {"Name": "Chen E.", "AuthorID": "57059758600", "AffiliationID": "60033174", "AffiliationName": "NHMRC Cognitive Decline Partnership Centre, Hornsby Ku-ring-gai Hospital"}, "23990465700": {"Name": "Ilom\u00e4ki J.", "AuthorID": "23990465700", "AffiliationID": "60019578", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine, School of Public Health and Preventive Medicine, Monash University"}, "55621888000": {"Name": "Gilmartin-Thomas J.", "AuthorID": "55621888000", "AffiliationID": "60016379", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Practice and Policy, University College London School of Pharmacy"}}}
