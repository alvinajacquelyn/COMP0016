In some studies striatal responses appear to represent loss as a negative reward (BOLD deactivation), while in others as positive punishment (BOLD activation). We argue that these discrepancies can be explained by the existence of two fundamentally different types of loss: excitatory losses signaling the presence of substantive punishment, and inhibitory losses signaling cessation or omission of reward. We then map different theories of motivational opponency to loss related decision-making, and highlight five distinct underlying computational processes. We suggest that this excitatory-inhibitory model of loss provides a neurobiological framework for understanding reference dependence in behavioral economics.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84944214264", "SubjectAreas": [["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"], ["Behavioral Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2802"]], "AuthorData": {"8609317000": {"Name": "Seymour B.", "AuthorID": "8609317000", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, University of Cambridge"}, "56902221100": {"Name": "Maruyama M.", "AuthorID": "56902221100", "AffiliationID": "60024322", "AffiliationName": "Immunology Frontier Research Center, Osaka University"}, "23391752900": {"Name": "De Martino B.", "AuthorID": "23391752900", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, University of Cambridge"}}}
