Shyness can be considered a subclinical analogue of SAD, yet there is little research into the effect of alcohol on anxiety levels in highly-shy individuals. This naturalistic study investigated acute and sub-acute effects of alcohol in high and low shy social drinkers. 97 individuals were tested at home and assigned to either consume alcohol to normal levels (n = 50) or to remain sober (n = 47). Baseline measures of AUD symptoms, shyness and social phobia were taken. Measures of state anxiety were taken at baseline, following a period of alcohol consumption or sobriety, and the following morning. Marginally decreased acute anxiety resulting from alcohol consumption in high shyness was observed. A significant increase in anxiety the day following drinking was observed in highly-shy participants. There was a significant correlation between anxiety elevation on the second day and AUDIT scores in highly-shy participants. This study suggests anxiety during hangover is linked to AUD symptoms in highly-shy individuals, providing a potential marker for increased AUD risk, which could inform prevention and treatment.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alcohol", "Alcohol use disorders", "Hangover", "Shyness", "Social anxiety"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85055962903", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychology (all)", "PSYC", "3200"]], "AuthorData": {"57204532983": {"Name": "Marsh B.", "AuthorID": "57204532983", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Psychopharmacology Unit, University College London"}, "57195148225": {"Name": "Carlyle M.", "AuthorID": "57195148225", "AffiliationID": "60026479", "AffiliationName": "Psychopharmacology and Addiction Research Centre, University of Exeter"}, "57204529190": {"Name": "Carter E.", "AuthorID": "57204529190", "AffiliationID": "60026479", "AffiliationName": "Psychopharmacology and Addiction Research Centre, University of Exeter"}, "57204529386": {"Name": "Hughes P.", "AuthorID": "57204529386", "AffiliationID": "60026479", "AffiliationName": "Psychopharmacology and Addiction Research Centre, University of Exeter"}, "57204532223": {"Name": "McGahey S.", "AuthorID": "57204532223", "AffiliationID": "60026479", "AffiliationName": "Psychopharmacology and Addiction Research Centre, University of Exeter"}, "55804860800": {"Name": "Stevens T.", "AuthorID": "55804860800", "AffiliationID": "60026479", "AffiliationName": "Psychopharmacology and Addiction Research Centre, University of Exeter"}, "55332655000": {"Name": "McAndrew A.", "AuthorID": "55332655000", "AffiliationID": "60026479", "AffiliationName": "Psychopharmacology and Addiction Research Centre, University of Exeter"}, "57204536028": {"Name": "Morgan C.", "AuthorID": "57204536028", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Psychopharmacology Unit, University College London"}, "56288079700": {"Name": "Lawn W.", "AuthorID": "56288079700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Psychopharmacology Unit, University College London"}}}
