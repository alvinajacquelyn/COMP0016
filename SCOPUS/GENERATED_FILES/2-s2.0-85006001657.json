We investigated the potential functions of surface-active behaviors in humpback whale groups by examining the social and environmental contexts in which they occurred. Focal observations on 94 different groups of whales were collected in conjunction with continuous acoustic monitoring, and data on the social and environmental context of each group. We propose that breaching may play a role in communication between distant groups as the probability of observing this behavior decreased significantly when the nearest whale group was within 4,000 m compared to beyond 4,000 m. Involvement in group interactions, such as the splitting of a group or a group joining with other whales, was an important factor in predicting the occurrence of pectoral, fluke, and peduncle slapping, and we suggest that they play a role in close-range or within-group communication. This study highlights the potentially important and diverse roles of surface-active behaviors in the communication of migrating humpback whales.", "AuthorKeywords": ["breach", "fluke slap", "function", "head lunge", "humpback whale", "Megaptera novaeangliae", "pectoral slap", "peduncle slap", "surface behavior", "surface-active behavior"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85006001657", "SubjectAreas": [["Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics", "AGRI", "1105"], ["Aquatic Science", "AGRI", "1104"]], "AuthorData": {"56985645100": {"Name": "Kavanagh A.", "AuthorID": "56985645100", "AffiliationID": "60031004", "AffiliationName": "School of Veterinary Science, University of Queensland"}, "55496779600": {"Name": "Owen K.", "AuthorID": "55496779600", "AffiliationID": "60031004", "AffiliationName": "School of Veterinary Science, University of Queensland"}, "57191618067": {"Name": "Williamson M.", "AuthorID": "57191618067", "AffiliationID": "60031004", "AffiliationName": "School of Veterinary Science, University of Queensland"}, "6506393830": {"Name": "Noad M.", "AuthorID": "6506393830", "AffiliationID": "60031004", "AffiliationName": "School of Veterinary Science, University of Queensland"}, "6701464606": {"Name": "Cato D.", "AuthorID": "6701464606", "AffiliationID": "60025709", "AffiliationName": "School of Geosciences, University of Sydney"}, "12752893600": {"Name": "Dunlop R.", "AuthorID": "12752893600", "AffiliationID": "60031004", "AffiliationName": "School of Veterinary Science, University of Queensland"}, "7006212509": {"Name": "Blomberg S.", "AuthorID": "7006212509", "AffiliationID": "60031004", "AffiliationName": "School of Biological Sciences, University of Queensland"}, "6701544380": {"Name": "Goldizen A.", "AuthorID": "6701544380", "AffiliationID": "60031004", "AffiliationName": "School of Biological Sciences, University of Queensland"}, "56539958000": {"Name": "Kniest E.", "AuthorID": "56539958000", "AffiliationID": "60010571", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering, University of Newcastle, University Drive"}}}
