The literature review demonstrates the lack of research on stabilization of sandy material using FA. The study is concerned with the role of FA content in stabilized soil physical characteristics. The main aim of this paper is to determine the optimum quantity of FA content for stabilization of this type of soil. This is achieved through particle size distribution and compaction (standard proctor) tests. The sand was stabilized with three proportions of FA (5%, 10% and 15%) and constant cement content of 3% was used as an activator. For better comparison, the sand was also stabilized by 3% cement only so that the effect of FA could be observed more clearly. The results were in line with the literature for other types of soil, i.e. as the % of FA increases, reduction in maximum dry density and higher optimum moisture content were observed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Civil engineering", "Structural engineering"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85016518741", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"57193777531": {"Name": "Mahvash S.", "AuthorID": "57193777531", "AffiliationID": "60004814", "AffiliationName": "School of Computing and Engineering, University of West London"}, "12797053800": {"Name": "Bahadori-Jahromi A.", "AuthorID": "12797053800", "AffiliationID": "60004814", "AffiliationName": "School of Computing and Engineering, University of West London"}, "57203544711": {"Name": "L\u00f3pez-Querol S.", "AuthorID": "57203544711", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil, Environmental and Geomatic Engineering, University College London"}}}
