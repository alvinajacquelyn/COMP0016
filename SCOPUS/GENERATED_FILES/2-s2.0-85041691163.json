Design: Phase 3, open-label, multicenter clinical trial extension (VISUAL III). Participants: Adults meeting treatment failure (TF) criteria or who completed VISUAL I or II (phase 3, randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled) without TF. Methods: Patients received adalimumab 40 mg every other week. Interim follow-up data were described from VISUAL III weeks 0 through 78. Main Outcome Measures: Disease quiescence, steroid-free quiescence, active inflammatory chorioretinal/retinal vascular lesions, anterior chamber cell grade, vitreous haze grade, best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), and corticosteroid dose. Binary data were reported using nonresponder imputation (NRI), continuous data using last observation carried forward and as-observed analysis, and corticosteroid dose using observed-case analysis. Adverse events (AEs) were reported from first adalimumab dose in VISUAL III through interim cutoff. Results: Of 424 patients enrolled, 371 were included in intent-to-treat analysis. At study entry, 242 of 371 (65%) patients had active uveitis; 60% (145/242, NRI) achieved quiescence at week 78, and 66% (95/143, as-observed) of those were corticosteroid free. At study entry, 129 of 371 (35%) patients had inactive uveitis; 74% (96/129, NRI) achieved quiescence at week 78, and 93% (89/96, as-observed) of those were corticosteroid free. Inflammatory lesions, anterior chamber grade, and vitreous haze grade showed initial improvement followed by decline in patients with active uveitis and remained stable in patients with inactive uveitis. BCVA improved in patients with active uveitis from weeks 0 to 78 (0.27 to 0.14 logMAR; left and right eyes; as-observed) and remained stable in patients with inactive uveitis. Mean corticosteroid dose decreased from 13.6 mg/day (week 0) to 2.6 mg/day (week 78) in patients with active uveitis and remained stable in those with inactive uveitis (1.5\u20131.2 mg/day). AEs (424 events/100 patient-years) and serious AEs (16.5 events/100 patient-years) were comparable with previous VISUAL trials. Conclusions: Patients with active uveitis at study entry who received adalimumab therapy were likely to achieve quiescence, improve visual acuity, and reduce their daily uveitis-related systemic corticosteroid use. Most patients with inactive uveitis at study entry sustained quiescence without a systemic corticosteroid dose increase. No new safety signals were identified.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adalimumab", "Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Anti-Inflammatory Agents", "Double-Blind Method", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Panuveitis", "Treatment Outcome", "Uveitis, Intermediate", "Uveitis, Posterior", "Visual Acuity", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85041691163", "SubjectAreas": [["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"]], "AuthorData": {"6602158580": {"Name": "Suhler E.B.", "AuthorID": "6602158580", "AffiliationID": "60016733, 60008693", "AffiliationName": "Oregon Health & Science University, Casey Eye Institute, Portland, Oregon, VA Portland Health Care System"}, "57216108733": {"Name": "Ad\u00e1n A.", "AuthorID": "57216108733", "AffiliationID": "60030315", "AffiliationName": "Hospital Clinic de Barcelona"}, "7003687933": {"Name": "Br\u00e9zin A.P.", "AuthorID": "7003687933", "AffiliationID": "60123796, 60019163", "AffiliationName": "Universit\u00e9 Paris Descartes, H\u00f4pital Cochin"}, "17534138400": {"Name": "Fortin E.", "AuthorID": "17534138400", "AffiliationID": "60009507", "AffiliationName": "University of Montreal"}, "7401675852": {"Name": "Goto H.", "AuthorID": "7401675852", "AffiliationID": "60003181", "AffiliationName": "Tokyo Medical University"}, "7004539481": {"Name": "Jaffe G.J.", "AuthorID": "7004539481", "AffiliationID": "60008724", "AffiliationName": "Duke University"}, "6603600302": {"Name": "Kaburaki T.", "AuthorID": "6603600302", "AffiliationID": "60025272", "AffiliationName": "University of Tokyo"}, "7402838329": {"Name": "Kramer M.", "AuthorID": "7402838329", "AffiliationID": "60005037, 60005681, 60022119", "AffiliationName": "Rabin Medical Center, Sackler School of Medicine, Tel Aviv University"}, "15053336200": {"Name": "Lim L.L.", "AuthorID": "15053336200", "AffiliationID": "60019331, 60016598", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Eye Research Australia, Royal Victorian Eye and Ear Hospital"}, "6701678940": {"Name": "Muccioli C.", "AuthorID": "6701678940", "AffiliationID": "60014992", "AffiliationName": "Federal University of S\u00e3o Paulo"}, "55666336400": {"Name": "Nguyen Q.D.", "AuthorID": "55666336400", "AffiliationID": "60012708", "AffiliationName": "Byers Eye Institute, Stanford University"}, "23989605500": {"Name": "Van Calster J.", "AuthorID": "23989605500", "AffiliationID": "60031069", "AffiliationName": "University Hospitals Leuven"}, "7003872473": {"Name": "Cimino L.", "AuthorID": "7003872473", "AffiliationID": "60111063", "AffiliationName": "Ocular Immunology Unit, Azienda USL IRCCS"}, "56556312600": {"Name": "Kron M.", "AuthorID": "56556312600", "AffiliationID": "60105169", "AffiliationName": "AbbVie Deutschland GmbH & Co KG"}, "6603603002": {"Name": "Camez A.", "AuthorID": "6603603002", "AffiliationID": "60105169", "AffiliationName": "AbbVie Deutschland GmbH & Co KG"}, "57191091692": {"Name": "Song A.P.", "AuthorID": "57191091692", "AffiliationID": "60105169", "AffiliationName": "AbbVie Inc."}, "57200563553": {"Name": "Liu J.", "AuthorID": "57200563553", "AffiliationID": "60105169", "AffiliationName": "AbbVie Inc."}, "57191093081": {"Name": "Tari S.", "AuthorID": "57191093081", "AffiliationID": "60105169", "AffiliationName": "AbbVie Inc."}, "9943072800": {"Name": "Pathai S.", "AuthorID": "9943072800", "AffiliationID": "60105169", "AffiliationName": "AbbVie Ltd"}, "6505774527": {"Name": "Schlaen A.", "AuthorID": "6505774527", "AffiliationID": "60015833", "AffiliationName": "Austral University"}, "8923641700": {"Name": "van Velthoven M.E.J.", "AuthorID": "8923641700", "AffiliationID": "60070145", "AffiliationName": "Rotterdam Eye Hospital"}, "16067436800": {"Name": "Vitale A.T.", "AuthorID": "16067436800", "AffiliationID": "60025488", "AffiliationName": "John A.
