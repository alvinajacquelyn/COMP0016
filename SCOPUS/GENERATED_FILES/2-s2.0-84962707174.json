Methods: Sixteen patients (mean age 39.5 years, 9 male) undergoing MR enterography before ileal resection were retrospectively analysed. Thirty-six small (\u22643 mm) ROIs were placed on T2-weighted images and location-matched histological acute inflammatory scores (AIS) measured. MRI activity (mural thickness, T2 signal, T1 enhancement) (CDA) was scored in large ROIs. MRTA features (mean, standard deviation, mean of positive pixels (MPP), entropy, kurtosis, skewness) were extracted using a filtration histogram technique. Spatial scale filtration (SSF) ranged from 2 to 5 mm. Regression (linear/logistic) tested associations between MRTA and AIS (small ROIs), and CDA/constituent parameters (large ROIs). Results: Skewness (SSF = 2 mm) was associated with AIS [regression coefficient (rc) 4.27, p = 0.02]. Of 120 large ROI analyses (for each MRI, MRTA feature and SSF), 15 were significant. Entropy (SSF = 2, 3 mm) and kurtosis (SSF = 3 mm) were associated with CDA (rc 0.9, 1.0, \u22120.45, p = 0.006\u20130.01). Entropy and mean (SSF = 2\u20134 mm) were associated with T2 signal [odds ratio (OR) 2.32\u20133.16, p = 0.02\u20130.004], [OR 1.22\u20131.28, p = 0.03\u20130.04]. MPP (SSF = 2 mm) was associated with mural thickness (OR 0.91, p = 0.04). Kurtosis (SSF = 3 mm), standard deviation (SSF = 5 mm) were associated with decreased T1 enhancement (OR 0.59, 0.42, p = 0.004, 0.007). Conclusions: MRTA features may be associated with CD activity. Key Points: \u2022 MR texture analysis features may be associated with Crohn\u2019s disease histological activity. \u2022 Texture analysis features may correlate with MR-dependent Crohn\u2019s disease activity scores. \u2022 The utility of MR texture analysis in Crohn\u2019s disease merits further investigation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Crohn disease", "Histology", "Magnetic resonance imaging", "Small intestine", "Textural analysis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Crohn Disease", "Female", "Humans", "Ileum", "Intestines", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Preoperative Care", "Retrospective Studies", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84962707174", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"54400322900": {"Name": "Makanyanga J.", "AuthorID": "54400322900", "AffiliationID": "60024544, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Center for Medical Imaging, University College London and University College London Hospitals NIHR Biomedical Research Centre"}, "37100960500": {"Name": "Bhatnagar G.", "AuthorID": "37100960500", "AffiliationID": "60024544, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Center for Medical Imaging, University College London and University College London Hospitals NIHR Biomedical Research Centre"}, "55642708000": {"Name": "Halligan S.", "AuthorID": "55642708000", "AffiliationID": "60024544, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Center for Medical Imaging, University College London and University College London Hospitals NIHR Biomedical Research Centre"}, "57203543924": {"Name": "Taylor S.A.", "AuthorID": "57203543924", "AffiliationID": "60024544, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Center for Medical Imaging, University College London and University College London Hospitals NIHR Biomedical Research Centre"}, "8556612100": {"Name": "Ganeshan B.", "AuthorID": "8556612100", "AffiliationID": "60090043, 60022148, 60027403", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Nuclear Medicine, University College London, University College Hospital"}, "7004435019": {"Name": "Groves A.", "AuthorID": "7004435019", "AffiliationID": "60090043, 60022148, 60027403", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Nuclear Medicine, University College London, University College Hospital"}, "16948025200": {"Name": "Miles K.", "AuthorID": "16948025200", "AffiliationID": "60090043, 60022148, 60027403", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Nuclear Medicine, University College London, University College Hospital"}, "22036034000": {"Name": "Rodriguez-Justo M.", "AuthorID": "22036034000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Research Pathology, University College London Cancer Institute, University College London"}}}
