This is the case when the trafficking involves cargo containers. Thus, suitable detection techniques are required to penetrate a ferromagnetic enclosure. The present study considers techniques that employ an electromagnetic based principle of detection. It is generally assumed that a ferromagnetic metallic enclosure will effectively act as a Faraday cage to electromagnetic radiation and therefore screen any form of interrogating electromagnetic radiation from penetrating, thus denying the detection of any eventual hidden material. In contrast, we demonstrate that it is actually possible to capture magnetic images of a conductive object through a set of metallic ferromagnetic enclosures. This validates electromagnetic interrogation techniques as a potential detection tool for National Nuclear Security applications.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84939448680", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"56416364100": {"Name": "Darrer B.", "AuthorID": "56416364100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "56415822800": {"Name": "Bartlett P.", "AuthorID": "56415822800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "6603770390": {"Name": "Renzoni F.", "AuthorID": "6603770390", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "56415576300": {"Name": "Watson J.", "AuthorID": "56415576300", "AffiliationID": "115578531", "AffiliationName": "Novel Detection Concepts, National Nuclear Security Programme, Atomic Weapons Establishment"}}}
