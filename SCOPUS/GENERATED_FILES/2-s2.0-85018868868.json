Methods and results Multi-centre, prospective, observational study, with blinded analysis of CMR data. Patients underwent adenosine stress CMR, symptom-limited exercise testing (ETT) and echocardiography and were followed up for 12-30 months. The primary outcome was a composite of: typical AS symptoms necessitating referral for AVR, cardiovascular death and major adverse cardiovascular events. 174 patients were recruited: mean age 66.2 \u00b1 13.34 years, 76% male, peak velocity 3.86 \u00b1 0.56 m/s and aortic valve area index 0.57 \u00b1 0.14 cm2/m2. A primary outcome occurred in 47 (27%) patients over a median follow-up of 374 (IQR 351-498) days. The mean MPR in those with and without a primary outcome was 2.06 \u00b1 0.65 and 2.34 \u00b1 0.70 (P = 0.022), while the incidence of a symptom-limited ETT was 45.7% and 27.0% (P = 0.020), respectively. MPR showed moderate association with outcome area under curve (AUC) = 0.61 (0.52-0.71, P = 0.020), as did exercise testing (AUC = 0.59 (0.51-0.68, P = 0.027), with no significant difference between the two. Conclusions MPR was associated with symptom-onset in initially asymptomatic patients with AS, but with moderate accuracy and was not superior to symptom-limited exercise testing.
