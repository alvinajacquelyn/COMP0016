Experience and perceptions about quality of care may differ according to women\u2019s socio-cultural background, individual characteristics, their exposure and expectations. This study aimed to compare perceptions of the quality of maternal healthcare services between two groups that are consistently considered vulnerable, women with disabilities from both the non-Dalit population and Dalit population and their peers without disabilities from both non-Dalit and Dalit communities. Methods A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 343 total women that included women with disabilities, Dalits and non-Dalits. Women were recruited for interview, who were aged 15\u201349 years, had been pregnant within the last five years and who had used maternal care services in one of the public health facilities of Rupandehi district. A 20-item, Likert-type scale with four sub-scales or dimensions: \u2018Health Facility\u2019, \u2018Healthcare Delivery\u2019, \u2018Inter-personal\u2019 and \u2018Access to Care\u2019 was used to measure women\u2019s perceptions of quality of care. Chi-square test and t test were used to compare groups and to assess differences in perceptions; and linear regression was applied to assess confounding effects of socio-demographic factors. The mean score was compared for each item and separately for each dimension. Results All groups, women with disabilities and women without disabilities, Dalit and non-Dalit rated their perceptions and experiences of quality of care lowly in a number of items. While perceived quality of care between women with disabilities and without disabilities in the \u2018Health Facility\u2019 dimension and associated items, was found to differ (p<0.05), this difference was linked to disability status, but was not linked to caste differences. For example, differences in mean scores relating to \u2018Cleanliness and Facilities\u2019, \u2018Open and Friendliness\u2019 and \u2018Compassion and Kindness\u2019 were highly significant (p<0.001), with women with disabilities rating these as better than women without disabilities. On the other hand, women without disabilities rated the \u2018Availability of cash Incentives\u2019 more highly (p<0.01). No significant differences were found between Dalit and non-Dalit women in perceived quality of care, except in relation to \u2018Cleanliness and facilities\u2019, which Dalit women rated lower than non-Dalits (p<0.05). Conclusions Perceptions about the quality of care differed significantly by disability status but not by caste. All groups rated the quality of healthcare delivery, interpersonal and personal factors as well as access to services \u2018low.\u2019 Poor service user experiences and perceptions of quality of care undermine opportunities to translate increased healthcare coverage into improved access and outcomes. Greater attention is required by policy makers, health planners and providers to the improvement of quality of care in health facilities.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Demography", "Disabled Persons", "Female", "Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice", "Humans", "Maternal Health Services", "Middle Aged", "Nepal", "Quality of Health Care", "Social Class", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85038946191", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"57194685028": {"Name": "Devkota H.", "AuthorID": "57194685028", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London (UCL)"}, "36632716100": {"Name": "Murray E.", "AuthorID": "36632716100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London (UCL)"}, "57200039615": {"Name": "Clarke A.", "AuthorID": "57200039615", "AffiliationID": "100863782", "AffiliationName": "Technical Support Unit, Kidasha UK/Nepal"}, "57204340273": {"Name": "Groce N.", "AuthorID": "57204340273", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London (UCL)"}}}
