Irradiation of a model drug, indometacin, resulted in formation of a glass. Varying the settings of the laser (power and raster speed) was shown to change the physicochemical properties of the glasses produced and all irradiated glasses were found to be more stable than a reference glass produced by melt-quenching. Irradiation of a powder blend of paracetamol and polyvinylpyrrolidone K30 was found to produce a solid amorphous dispersion. The results suggest that laser-irradiation might be a useful method for making amorphous pharmaceuticals.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Amorphous", "CO2 laser", "Indomethacin", "Paracetamol", "Phase-transformation", "PVP K30", "Solid amorphous dispersion"], "IndexKeywords": ["Chemistry, Pharmaceutical", "Drug Stability", "Eyeglasses", "Indomethacin", "Lasers", "Pharmaceutical Preparations", "Povidone", "Powders", "Technology, Pharmaceutical"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84995695060", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmaceutical Science", "PHAR", "3003"]], "AuthorData": {"57189591783": {"Name": "Titapiwatanakun V.", "AuthorID": "57189591783", "AffiliationID": "60016379, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "36554895100": {"Name": "Tankul J.", "AuthorID": "36554895100", "AffiliationID": "60016379, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "7003826707": {"Name": "Basit A.", "AuthorID": "7003826707", "AffiliationID": "60016379, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "6602683597": {"Name": "Gaisford S.", "AuthorID": "6602683597", "AffiliationID": "60016379, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy, University College London"}}}
