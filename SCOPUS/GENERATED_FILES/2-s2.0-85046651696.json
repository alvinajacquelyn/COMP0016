Adaptive preferences may be problematic where these views are used in resource allocation decisions because they may lead to underestimation of the true benefits of providing services. This research explored the nature and extent of both adaptation (changing to better suit the context) and adaptive preferences (altering preferences in response to restricted options) in individuals approaching the end of life (EoL). Methods: Qualitative data from \u2018thinkaloud\u2019 interviews with 33 hospice patients, 22 close persons and 17 health professionals were used alongside their responses to three health/well-being measures for use in resource allocation decisions: EQ-5D-5L (health status); ICECAP-A (adult capability); and ICECAP-SCM (Supportive Care Measure; EoL capability). Constant comparative analysis combined a focus on both verbalised perceptions across the three groups and responses to the measures. Results: Data collection took place between October 2012 and February 2014. Informants spoke clearly about how patients had adapted their lives in response to symptoms associated with their terminal condition. It was often seen as a positive choice to accept their state and adapt in this way but, at the same time, most patients were fully aware of the health and capability losses that they had faced. Self-assessments of health and capability generally appeared to reflect the pre-adaptation state, although there were exceptions. Conclusion: Despite adapting to their conditions, the reference group for individuals approaching EoL largely remained a healthy, capable population, and most did not show evidence of adaptive preferences.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adaptation, Psychological", "Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Attitude to Death", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Patient Preference", "Patients", "Quality of Life", "Stress, Psychological", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "Terminal Care"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85046651696", "SubjectAreas": [["Nursing (miscellaneous)", "NURS", "2901"]], "AuthorData": {"55971738500": {"Name": "Coast J.", "AuthorID": "55971738500", "AffiliationID": "60171764, 60020650", "AffiliationName": "Health Economics at Bristol, Population Health Sciences, Bristol Medical School, University of Bristol"}, "36650256300": {"Name": "Bailey C.", "AuthorID": "36650256300", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "School of Nursing, Institute of Clinical Sciences, University of Birmingham"}, "55295763500": {"Name": "Orlando R.", "AuthorID": "55295763500", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "CLAHRC Wessex, Health Sciences, University of Southampton"}, "57190049117": {"Name": "Armour K.", "AuthorID": "57190049117", "AffiliationID": "105740991", "AffiliationName": "Marie Curie Hospice West Midlands"}, "57190046872": {"Name": "Perry R.", "AuthorID": "57190046872", "AffiliationID": "105740991", "AffiliationName": "Marie Curie Hospice West Midlands"}, "7403623810": {"Name": "Jones L.", "AuthorID": "7403623810", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Marie Curie Palliative Care Research Department, UCL"}, "55211236400": {"Name": "Kinghorn P.", "AuthorID": "55211236400", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "Health Economics Unit, Institute of Applied Health Research, University of Birmingham"}}}
