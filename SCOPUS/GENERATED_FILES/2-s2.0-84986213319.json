The structural failure of membrane-type liquefied natural gas carrier (LNGC) cargo tank is an important issue in the construction of ultra-large an LNG carrier. However, quasi-static analysis to investigate the structural failure is difficult and tends to give conservative results. To compensate the weak points of the quasi-static analysis, a procedure for the dynamic analysis was developed to assess the structural failure using nonlinear finite element method. A nonlinear finite element method is employed to model metal membrane, insulation and surface contacts. Various element formulations are tested at different points along a corrugated surface to optimise the accuracy of the model with respect to computation time. Material properties used in the model are calibrated based on experimentally measured values at cryogenic conditions (\u2212163 \u00b0C). The model is used to predict the structural failure under different impact pressure loads and loading patterns. It is concluded that the structural damage is less likely to occur under 30 bar.", "AuthorKeywords": ["dynamic structural analysis", "finite element method", "Liquefied natural gas carrier (LNGC)", "membrane-type LNGC cargo containment system", "sloshing impact"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cargo containment systems", "Dynamic structural analysis", "Liquefied natural gas carriers", "Non-linear structural behaviours", "Nonlinear finite element method", "Quasi static analysis", "Quasi static response", "Sloshing impacts"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84986213319", "SubjectAreas": [["Ocean Engineering", "ENGI", "2212"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"]], "AuthorData": {"57204241794": {"Name": "Sohn J.", "AuthorID": "57204241794", "AffiliationID": "60011883", "AffiliationName": "Department of Naval Architecture and Marine Systems Engineering, Pukyong National University"}, "16023845300": {"Name": "Bae D.", "AuthorID": "16023845300", "AffiliationID": "60011883", "AffiliationName": "Department of Naval Architecture and Marine Systems Engineering, Pukyong National University"}, "21739057500": {"Name": "Bae S.", "AuthorID": "21739057500", "AffiliationID": "60011883", "AffiliationName": "Department of Naval Architecture and Marine Systems Engineering, Pukyong National University"}, "35821146600": {"Name": "Paik J.", "AuthorID": "35821146600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}}}
