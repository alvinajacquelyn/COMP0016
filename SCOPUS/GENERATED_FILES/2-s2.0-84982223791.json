All rights reserved.The value of data linkage is well accepted, as it promises considerable time and cost advantages over new data collection for large numbers of individuals. This concluding chapter of the book summarises the issues with data linkage methodologies as they exist today, discusses how new developments will address these issues and highlights future areas of research. Where current linkage approaches fail to provide reasonable solutions, new methodologies are crucial for fully exploiting the opportunities presented by data linkage. Traditional forms of analysis may also need to be refined. Looking forward, it may be that advances in data linkage methodologies require and lead to equally innovative developments in the field of statistical methodology. The chapter also speculates on some of the key issues that arise from a future increasingly dominated by linked administrative and transactional data.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Administrative data", "Data linkage methodologies", "Transactional data"], "IndexKeywords": ["Administrative data", "Cost advantages", "Data collection", "Data linkage", "Key Issues", "Statistical methodologies", "Transactional data"], "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84982223791", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"55249873300": {"Name": "Harron K.", "AuthorID": "55249873300", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "6602795419": {"Name": "Dibben C.", "AuthorID": "6602795419", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "University of Edinburgh"}, "7203025236": {"Name": "Goldstein H.", "AuthorID": "7203025236", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "Graduate School of Education, University of Bristol"}}}
