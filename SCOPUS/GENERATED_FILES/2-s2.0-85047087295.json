A cross-country shift of industrial output would present challenges for controlling emissions since India and SE Asian countries present higher industrial emissions intensity than China. We find that although there is a convergence in emissions intensity in the machinery manufacturing and paper and pulp industries, there are significant variations in all other industrial sectors. Indian emissions intensity is double that of China in the iron and steel and textile and leather industries and almost triple in the cement industry; Indonesian emissions intensity is almost double that of China in the non-metallic minerals and textile and leather industries and 50% higher in the chemical and petrochemical industry. We demonstrate that the expected higher emissions are driven by both a higher carbon fuel mix intensity in the recipient countries and higher energy intensity in their industrial activities. While industrial relocation could benefit certain countries financially, it would impose considerable threats to their energy supply security and capacity to comply with their Paris Agreement commitments.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Carbon intensity", "China", "Energy intensity", "India", "Industrial emissions", "SA Asia"], "IndexKeywords": ["Carbon intensity", "China", "Energy intensity", "India", "SA Asia"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85047087295", "SubjectAreas": [["Building and Construction", "ENGI", "2215"], ["Energy (all)", "ENER", "2100"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"], ["Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law", "ENVI", "2308"]], "AuthorData": {"57194543574": {"Name": "Pappas D.", "AuthorID": "57194543574", "AffiliationID": "60000112, 60122652", "AffiliationName": "Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research, University of East Anglia"}, "25627334400": {"Name": "Chalvatzis K.J.", "AuthorID": "25627334400", "AffiliationID": "60000112, 60122652", "AffiliationName": "Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research, University of East Anglia"}, "57194544958": {"Name": "Ioannidis A.", "AuthorID": "57194544958", "AffiliationID": "60000112, 60122652", "AffiliationName": "Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research, University of East Anglia"}, "15839411900": {"Name": "Guan D.", "AuthorID": "15839411900", "AffiliationID": "60000112, 60122652", "AffiliationName": "Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research, University of East Anglia"}}}
