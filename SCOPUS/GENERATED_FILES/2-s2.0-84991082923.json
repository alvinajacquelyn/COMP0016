Phase contrast X-ray microscopy is used here to capture the microstructures of commercial monolayer, tri-layer, and ceramic-coated lithium-ion battery polymer separators. Spatial variations in key structural parameters, including porosity, tortuosity factor and pore size distribution, are determined through the application of 3D quantification techniques and stereology. The architectures of individual layers in multi-layer membranes are characterised, revealing anisotropy in porosity, tortuosity factor and mean pore size of the three types of separator. Detailed structural properties of the individual layers of multi-layered membranes are then related with their expected effect on safety and rate capability of cells.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Characterisation", "Lithium-ion batteries", "Separator", "Tortuosity", "Transport properties", "X-ray tomography"], "IndexKeywords": ["Characterisation", "Integral components", "Rate capabilities", "Spatial variations", "Structural parameter", "Tortuosity", "Tortuosity factor", "X-ray tomography"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84991082923", "SubjectAreas": [["Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment", "ENER", "2105"], ["Energy Engineering and Power Technology", "ENER", "2102"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"56613490600": {"Name": "Finegan D.P.", "AuthorID": "56613490600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electrochemical Innovation Lab, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "56372219400": {"Name": "Tjaden B.", "AuthorID": "56372219400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electrochemical Innovation Lab, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "55976146800": {"Name": "Taiwo O.O.", "AuthorID": "55976146800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electrochemical Innovation Lab, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "13805905800": {"Name": "Brett D.J.L.", "AuthorID": "13805905800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electrochemical Innovation Lab, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "24178516700": {"Name": "Shearing P.R.", "AuthorID": "24178516700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electrochemical Innovation Lab, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "56595734000": {"Name": "Cooper S.J.", "AuthorID": "56595734000", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Earth Science and Engineering, Imperial College London"}, "24775669300": {"Name": "Gelb J.", "AuthorID": "24775669300", "AffiliationID": "114013155", "AffiliationName": "Carl Zeiss X-ray Microscopy"}, "56140429400": {"Name": "Hinds G.", "AuthorID": "56140429400", "AffiliationID": "60010785", "AffiliationName": "National Physical Laboratory"}}}
