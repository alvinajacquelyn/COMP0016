Haemost.", "Volume": "117", "Issue": 11, "Art.No": null, "PageStart": 2045, "PageEnd": 2052, "CitedBy": 16, "DOI": "10.1160/TH17-03-0176", "Link": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85037138507&origin=inward", "Abstract": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 Schattauer.Management of acute venous thromboembolism (VTE) with anticoagulants in elderly patients and those with chronic kidney disease poses special challenges. The RE-COVER and RE-COVER II trials showed that dabigatran 150 mg twice daily was as effective as warfarin over 6months in preventing recurrent VTE, with a lower bleeding risk.We now assess the effects of old age and renal impairment (RI) on pooled trial outcomes in 5,107 patients: 4,504 aged <75 years and 603 aged \u226575 years. The primary efficacy outcome was symptomatic VTE/VTE-related death. Safety outcomes were centrally adjudicated major bleeding events (MBEs), MBEs or clinically relevant non-major bleeding events (MBEs/CRBEs) and any bleeds. Baseline renal function was categorized as normal,mild RI or moderate RI. A total of 3,698 had normal renal function and 1,100 and 237 hadmild andmoderate RI, respectively (23 patients with severe RI and 49 with missing creatinine clearance data were not included). For dabigatran, VTE/VTE-related death decreased from 3.1% (normal renal function) to 1.9% for mild RI and to 0.0% for moderate RI. For warfarin, the event rates were 2.6, 1.6 and 4.1%, respectively. Overall, major bleeding increased with increasing RI (p = 0.0037) and with age (p = 0.4350), with no apparent difference between the dabigatran and warfarin patients. Dabigatran shows better efficacy than warfarin in RI and in the elderly patients, probably because of an increase in the concentration of dabigatran. However, bleeding risk increases with both dabigatran and warfarin in the presence of RI.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Chronic Kidney Disease", "Dabigatran Etexilate", "Elderly", "Venous Thromboembolism", "Warfarin"], "IndexKeywords": ["Acute Disease", "Adult", "Age Factors", "Aged", "Aging", "Anticoagulants", "Antithrombins", "Clinical Trials, Phase III as Topic", "Dabigatran", "Female", "Hemorrhage", "Humans", "Kidney", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic", "Renal Insufficiency, Chronic", "Risk Factors", "Time Factors", "Treatment Outcome", "Venous Thromboembolism", "Warfarin"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85037138507", "SubjectAreas": [["Hematology", "MEDI", "2720"]], "AuthorData": {"36047973400": {"Name": "Goldhaber S.Z.", "AuthorID": "36047973400", "AffiliationID": "60016782, 60002746", "AffiliationName": "Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School"}, "55792310000": {"Name": "Schulman S.", "AuthorID": "55792310000", "AffiliationID": "60031828, 60106410", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Thrombosis and Atherosclerosis Research Institute, McMaster University"}, "7101866268": {"Name": "Eriksson H.", "AuthorID": "7101866268", "AffiliationID": "60031699", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Sahlgrenska University Hospital-\u00d6stra"}, "6701590968": {"Name": "Feuring M.", "AuthorID": "6701590968", "AffiliationID": "107512699", "AffiliationName": "Boehringer IngelheimGmbH and Co KG"}, "36990035900": {"Name": "Fraessdorf M.", "AuthorID": "36990035900", "AffiliationID": "107512699", "AffiliationName": "Boehringer IngelheimGmbH and Co KG"}, "35425727200": {"Name": "Kreuzer J.", "AuthorID": "35425727200", "AffiliationID": "107512699", "AffiliationName": "Boehringer IngelheimGmbH and Co KG"}, "57198790793": {"Name": "Sch\u00f6ler E.", "AuthorID": "57198790793", "AffiliationID": "100879743", "AffiliationName": "Biostatistics Division, HMS Analytical Software GmbH"}, "55179209800": {"Name": "Schellong S.", "AuthorID": "55179209800", "AffiliationID": "60031737", "AffiliationName": "Medical Division 2, Municipal Hospital Friedrichstadt"}, "57220484675": {"Name": "Kakkar A.", "AuthorID": "57220484675", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60014574", "AffiliationName": "Thrombosis Research Institute and University College London"}}}
