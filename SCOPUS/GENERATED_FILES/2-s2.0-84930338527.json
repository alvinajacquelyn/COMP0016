This isolator has two tunable anti-resonance frequencies capable of attenuating vibrations at one or two frequency excitations simultaneously. A mathematical model of the TDOFFVI is developed. The force transmissibility and the anti-resonance frequencies in conjunction with design parameters are formulated and the optimal design of the TDOFFVI is given. A physical prototype of the TDOFFVI has been designed, built and tested. The experimental results validate the theoretical analysis and show that the TDOFFVI can perform effectively in vibration isolation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Anti-resonance", "floating vibration isolator", "line spectra deduction", "vibration control", "vibration isolation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Anti-resonance", "Design parameters", "Frequency excitation", "Line spectra", "Two-degree of freedom", "Vibration isolation systems", "Vibration isolations", "Vibration isolators"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84930338527", "SubjectAreas": [["Automotive Engineering", "ENGI", "2203"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Aerospace Engineering", "ENGI", "2202"], ["Mechanics of Materials", "ENGI", "2211"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"]], "AuthorData": {"41961245500": {"Name": "Liu C.", "AuthorID": "41961245500", "AffiliationID": "60032356, 60123353", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Advanced Design and Manufacturing for Vehicle Body, Hunan University"}, "56153278700": {"Name": "Xu D.", "AuthorID": "56153278700", "AffiliationID": "60032356, 60123353", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Advanced Design and Manufacturing for Vehicle Body, Hunan University"}, "24472371400": {"Name": "Zhou J.X.", "AuthorID": "24472371400", "AffiliationID": "60032356, 60123353", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Advanced Design and Manufacturing for Vehicle Body, Hunan University"}, "7202504799": {"Name": "Bishop S.", "AuthorID": "7202504799", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University College London"}}}
