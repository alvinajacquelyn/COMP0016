Benedetta Rossi traces the historical transformations that turned a society where slavery was a fundamental institution into one governed by the goals and methods of 'aid'. Over an impressive sweep of time - from the pre-colonial power of the Caliphate of Sokoto to the aid-driven governments of the present - this study explores the problem that has remained the central conundrum throughout Ader's history: how workers could meet subsistence needs and employers fulfil recruitment requirements in an area where natural resources are constantly exposed to the climatic hazards characteristic of the edge of the Sahara.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84953885942", "SubjectAreas": [["Arts and Humanities (all)", "ARTS", "1200"]], "AuthorData": {"7101881918": {"Name": "Rossi B.", "AuthorID": "7101881918", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "School of History and Cultures, University of Birmingham"}}}
