Imagery is particularly relevant to mental contamination, where unwanted intrusive images are hypothesized to evoke feelings of dirtiness and urges to wash (Rachman, 2006). Aims: The aim of this study was to examine the nature of imagery associated with mental contamination. Method: Fifteen people with contaminated-based OCD completed a semi-structured imagery interview designed specifically for this study. Results: Ten participants reported images associated with contamination. These images were vivid and distressing and evoked feelings of dirtiness. Participants engaged in a number of behaviours to neutralize their images, including compulsive washing. A small number of participants also reported images that protected them from contamination. Conclusions: In support of the theory of mental contamination (Rachman, 2006), images can lead to feelings of pollution and compulsive washing. Further research is needed to explore the role of imagery in maintaining contamination fears.", "AuthorKeywords": ["contamination fear", "imagery", "OCD"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Fear", "Female", "Humans", "Imagination", "Interview, Psychological", "Male", "Memory, Episodic", "Middle Aged", "Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84954486859", "SubjectAreas": [["Clinical Psychology", "PSYC", "3203"]], "AuthorData": {"25958950300": {"Name": "Coughtrey A.", "AuthorID": "25958950300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London"}, "7003543961": {"Name": "Shafran R.", "AuthorID": "7003543961", "AffiliationID": "60012197", "AffiliationName": "Reading University"}, "7004303000": {"Name": "Rachman S.", "AuthorID": "7004303000", "AffiliationID": "60010365", "AffiliationName": "University of British Columbia, Vancouver"}}}
