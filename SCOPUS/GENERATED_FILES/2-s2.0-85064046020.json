Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.This article discusses a relatively under-explored phenomenon that we call Tran\u00dfcripting \u2013 writing, designing and digitally generating new scripts with elements from different scriptal and semiotic systems. The data are drawn from examples of such scripts created by multilingual Chinese users in everyday online social interaction. We analyse the dynamic processes of how such scripts are created that transcend language boundaries as well as transforming the subjectivities of the writer and the reader. We are particularly interested in the playful subversiveness of such practices, and discuss it against the background of uni-scriptal language ideology in China. We are also interested in the methodological challenges of researching such practices, including the challenge of drawing distinctions between the \u2018ordinary\u2019 and the \u2018unordinary\u2019. We analyse the data from a translanguaging perspective.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Chinese", "language ideology", "social media", "translanguaging", "Tran\u00dfcripting"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85064046020", "SubjectAreas": [["Language and Linguistics", "ARTS", "1203"], ["Linguistics and Language", "SOCI", "3310"]], "AuthorData": {"7402951126": {"Name": "Wei L.", "AuthorID": "7402951126", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Centre for Applied Linguistics, University College London"}, "23990554100": {"Name": "Hua Z.", "AuthorID": "23990554100", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Department of Applied Linguistics and Communication, Birkbeck College, University of London"}}}
