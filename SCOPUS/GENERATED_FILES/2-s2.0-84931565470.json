All rights reserved.Desmoplastic small round cell tumors (DSRCT) are rare malignancies that typically arise in the abdominopelvic cavities. They are very uncommon in the head and neck region. We present a case of an 11-year-old Caucasian male with a primary cervical lymph node tumor in the neck. Fine-needle aspiration cytology, histopathologic examination, immunohistochemical staining, and molecular genetic testing led to the diagnosis of DSRCT. Due to the very limited number of cases reported and the lack of staging criteria, the preferred management approach remains uncertain.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Biopsy, Fine-Needle", "Child", "Desmoplastic Small Round Cell Tumor", "Diagnostic Imaging", "Head and Neck Neoplasms", "Humans", "Immunohistochemistry", "In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence", "Lymphatic Metastasis", "Male", "Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84931565470", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Oral Surgery", "DENT", "3504"], ["Pathology and Forensic Medicine", "MEDI", "2734"], ["Dentistry (miscellaneous)", "DENT", "3501"], ["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"56453375900": {"Name": "Faras F.", "AuthorID": "56453375900", "AffiliationID": "60069848", "AffiliationName": "Department of ENT, Zain and Al-Sabah Hospitals, Ministry of Health"}, "56453476400": {"Name": "Abo-Alhassan F.", "AuthorID": "56453476400", "AffiliationID": "60069857, 60069848", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery, Al-Adan Hospital, Ministry of Health"}, "7202020388": {"Name": "Hussain A.H.", "AuthorID": "7202020388", "AffiliationID": "60040363, 60069848", "AffiliationName": "COMS, Al-Amiri Hospital, Ministry of Health"}, "57049165000": {"Name": "Sebire N.J.", "AuthorID": "57049165000", "AffiliationID": "115355441", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric and Developmental Pathology, NIHR GOSH BRC Theme Lead Diagnostics and Imaging, Great Ormond Street Hospital and ICH (UCL)"}, "54892048500": {"Name": "Al-Terki A.E.", "AuthorID": "54892048500", "AffiliationID": "107852541", "AffiliationName": "Kuwait Institute of Medical Specialization (KIMS), ENT Department, Zain and Al-Sabah Hospitals"}}}
