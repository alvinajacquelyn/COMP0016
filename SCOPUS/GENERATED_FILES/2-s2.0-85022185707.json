We review some applications of these models in economic applications including: volatility modelling (using both stochastic volatility models and GARCH-type models) with Dirichlet process mixture models, uses in portfolio allocation problems, long memory models with flexible forms of time-dependence, flexible extension of the dynamic Nelson-Siegel model for interest rate yields and multivariate time series models used in macroeconometrics.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Dirichlet process", "Infinite mixture model", "Interest rates", "Long memory", "Normalized random measures with independent increments", "Portfolio allocation", "Time series", "Volatility"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85022185707", "SubjectAreas": [["Statistics and Probability", "MATH", "2613"], ["Statistics, Probability and Uncertainty", "DECI", "1804"]], "AuthorData": {"7403422646": {"Name": "Griffin J.", "AuthorID": "7403422646", "AffiliationID": "60010818", "AffiliationName": "SMSAS, University of Kent"}, "56497790500": {"Name": "Kalli M.", "AuthorID": "56497790500", "AffiliationID": "60019444", "AffiliationName": "Canterbury Christ Church University"}, "7102197241": {"Name": "Steel M.", "AuthorID": "7102197241", "AffiliationID": "60022020", "AffiliationName": "Department of Statistics, University of Warwick"}}}
