Accordingly, elucidating the molecular and cellular mechanisms of angiogenesis has the potential to identify new therapeutic targets to stimulate new vessel formation in ischemic tissues or inhibit pathological vessel growth in disease. This chapter describes the mouse embryo hindbrain and postnatal retina as models to study physiological angiogenesis and provides detailed protocols for tissue dissection, sample staining, and analysis.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Angiogenesis", "Hindbrain", "Retina"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Immunohistochemistry", "Mice", "Microscopy, Confocal", "Models, Animal", "Neovascularization, Physiologic", "Retinal Vessels", "Rhombencephalon"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84939557700", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"]], "AuthorData": {"23007969000": {"Name": "Fantin A.", "AuthorID": "23007969000", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "6602149137": {"Name": "Ruhrberg C.", "AuthorID": "6602149137", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
