This method of activating C-H bonds is an attractive alternative to traditional methodologies as it uses dioxygen, an inherently sustainable and widely accessible oxidant, in place of expensive or toxic metals and/or hazardous peroxides. Reactions developed on the basis of using aerobic C-H activation are also discussed.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["C-h activation", "C-H bond", "Dioxygens", "Metal free", "Toxic metals"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85062880600", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"], ["Organic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1605"]], "AuthorData": {"57050255700": {"Name": "Shamsabadi A.", "AuthorID": "57050255700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "24536976100": {"Name": "Chudasama V.", "AuthorID": "24536976100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}}}
