Objective: To provide an overview of the problem of UTIs in PwMS and offer a practical approach for the diagnosis and management. Methods: A review of the literature through a Pubmed search up to October 2015 was performed using the following keywords: multiple sclerosis, neurogenic bladder, urinary tract infections, relapse, dipsticks, culture, recurrent and prevention. Results: Noteworthy topics include the definition of a confirmed symptomatic UTI as a positive urine culture defined by >105 colony-forming units (CFU)/mL or >104 CFU/mL if a urethral catheter urine sample is taken, or any count of bacteria in a suprapubic bladder puncture specimen, both in addition to symptoms including fever, pain, changes in lower urinary tract symptoms or neurological status. Urinalysis is useful to exclude a UTI; however, on its own is insufficient to confirm a UTI, for which urine culture is required. Experts advise asymptomatic UTIs should not be treated except in the context of an acute relapse. From international guidelines, there is no validated strategy to prevent recurrent UTIs in PwMS. Conclusion: This review provides an overview of the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of UTIs in the setting of multiple sclerosis (MS).", "AuthorKeywords": ["culture", "Multiple sclerosis", "recurrent", "relapse", "urinary dipstick", "urinary tract infection"], "IndexKeywords": ["Anti-Bacterial Agents", "Bacteriological Techniques", "Humans", "Multiple Sclerosis", "Predictive Value of Tests", "Quality of Life", "Reagent Strips", "Recurrence", "Risk Factors", "Treatment Outcome", "Urinalysis", "Urinary Tract Infections"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84973465852", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"24169682200": {"Name": "Ph\u00e9 V.", "AuthorID": "24169682200", "AffiliationID": "60021567, 60001422", "AffiliationName": "Piti\u00e9-Salp\u00eatri\u00e8e Academic Hospital, Department of Urology, Assistance Publique-H\u00f4pitaux de Paris, Pierre and Marie Curie Medical School, Paris 6 University"}, "57189294591": {"Name": "Pakzad M.", "AuthorID": "57189294591", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Uro-Neurology, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "8243945700": {"Name": "Haslam C.", "AuthorID": "8243945700", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Uro-Neurology, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "8862148900": {"Name": "Panicker J.N.", "AuthorID": "8862148900", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Uro-Neurology, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "24511900500": {"Name": "Curtis C.", "AuthorID": "24511900500", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Microbiology, University College London Hospital"}, "7201565381": {"Name": "Porter B.", "AuthorID": "7201565381", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60020736, 60176027", "AffiliationName": "Queen Square Multiple Sclerosis Centre, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "57212501583": {"Name": "Chataway J.", "AuthorID": "57212501583", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60020736, 60176027", "AffiliationName": "Queen Square Multiple Sclerosis Centre, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, UCL Institute of Neurology"}}}
