The tissue motion can also be used to apply motion stabilization and to prescribe dynamic constraints for avoiding critical anatomical structures. Methods: Image-based methods based independently on salient features or on image intensity have limitations when dealing with homogeneous soft tissues or complex reflectance. In this paper, we use a triangular geometric mesh model in order to combine the advantages of both feature and intensity information and track the tissue surface reliably and robustly. Results: Synthetic and in vivo experiments are performed to provide quantitative analysis of the tracking accuracy of our method, and we also show exemplar results for registering multispectral images where there is only a weak image signal. Conclusion: Compared to traditional methods, our hybrid tracking method is more robust and has improved convergence in the presence of larger displacements, tissue dynamics and illumination changes.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Illumination compensation", "Minimally invasive surgery", "Multispectral imaging", "Non-rigid surface tracking"], "IndexKeywords": ["Algorithms", "Humans", "Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted", "Imaging, Three-Dimensional", "Lighting", "Models, Theoretical", "Robotic Surgical Procedures", "Surgery, Computer-Assisted"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84947027486", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"], ["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"], ["Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition", "COMP", "1707"], ["Health Informatics", "MEDI", "2718"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Computer Graphics and Computer-Aided Design", "COMP", "1704"]], "AuthorData": {"55243065000": {"Name": "Du X.", "AuthorID": "55243065000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, Centre for Medical Image Computing, University College London"}, "57203105770": {"Name": "Stoyanov D.", "AuthorID": "57203105770", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, Centre for Medical Image Computing, University College London"}, "34978108100": {"Name": "Clancy N.", "AuthorID": "34978108100", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery and Cancer, Imperial College London"}, "55509779700": {"Name": "Arya S.", "AuthorID": "55509779700", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery and Cancer, Imperial College London"}, "7102486883": {"Name": "Hanna G.", "AuthorID": "7102486883", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery and Cancer, Imperial College London"}, "7005533698": {"Name": "Elson D.", "AuthorID": "7005533698", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery and Cancer, Imperial College London"}, "7404901815": {"Name": "Kelly J.", "AuthorID": "7404901815", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Surgery and Interventional Science, University College London"}}}
