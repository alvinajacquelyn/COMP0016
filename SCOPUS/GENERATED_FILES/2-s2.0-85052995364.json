To that effect, 50 young adults completed the Oxford-Liverpool Inventory of Feelings and Experiences, the Fagerstr\u00f6m Test of Nicotine Dependence, the Edinburgh Handedness Questionnaire, and a dichotic listening task. Analyses revealed a significant right-hemisphere dominance association to positive schizotypy, and a left-hemisphere dominance association to negative schizotypy. Nicotine dependence emerged as a significant correlate of positive and overall schizotypy, and left-hemisphere dominance. Gender-based interactions were significant for females on positive schizotypy, nicotine dependence and right-hemisphere dominance, and on negative schizotypy for males. The findings of this study can be used to advance our understanding of the factors of risk and resilience in the schizophrenia spectrum.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Brain laterality", "Psychosis proneness", "Psychotropic", "Schizotypy"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85052995364", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychology (all)", "PSYC", "3200"]], "AuthorData": {"57196455458": {"Name": "Zartaloudi E.", "AuthorID": "57196455458", "AffiliationID": "60032760", "AffiliationName": "School of Life and Medical Sciences, University of Hertfordshire"}, "55996793900": {"Name": "Polemikou A.", "AuthorID": "55996793900", "AffiliationID": "60017404", "AffiliationName": "School of Humanities, University of the Aegean"}}}
