It corresponds to the compressible Navier-Stokes system with large Mach number equal to \u03b5-1/2 for \u03b5 going to 0. When the initial velocity is related to the gradient of the initial density, the densities solving the compressible Navier-Stokes equations -\u03c1\u03b5 converge to the unique solution to the porous medium equation [14, 13]. For viscosity coefficient \u03bc(\u03c1\u03b5) = \u03c1\u03b5\u03b1 with \u03b1 > 1, we obtain a rate of convergence of \u03c1\u03b5 in L\u221e(0,T;H-1(\u211d)); for 1 < \u03b1 \u2264 3/2 the solution \u03c1\u03b5 converges in L\u221e(0,T;L2(\u211d)). For compactly supported initial data, we prove that most of the mass corresponding to solution \u03c1\u03b5 is located in the support of the solution to the porous medium equation. The mass outside this support is small in terms of \u03b5.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Compressible Navier-Stokes equations", "Large Mach number", "Porous medium equation"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84954288564", "SubjectAreas": [["Analysis", "MATH", "2603"], ["Discrete Mathematics and Combinatorics", "MATH", "2607"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"35092733100": {"Name": "Haspot B.", "AuthorID": "35092733100", "AffiliationID": "60008924, 60105735", "AffiliationName": "Ceremade, UMR CNRS 7534, Universit\u00e9 Paris Dauphine"}, "36717202900": {"Name": "Zatorska E.", "AuthorID": "36717202900", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, Imperial College London"}}}
