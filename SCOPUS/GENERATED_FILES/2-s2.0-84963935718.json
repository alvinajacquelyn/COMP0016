In particular, acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, like huperzine A, may be effective as treatments for cocaine use disorder. Methods: The current report describes results from a double-blind, placebo-controlled study in which participants (n=14-17/group) were randomized to huperzine A (0.4 or 0.8mg) or placebo. Participants received randomized infusions of cocaine (0 and 40mg, IV) on days 1 and 9. On day 10, participants received noncontingent, randomized infusions of cocaine (0 and 20mg, IV) before making 5 choices to receive additional infusions. Results: Huperzine A was safe and well-tolerated and compared with placebo, treatment with huperzine A did not cause significant changes in any cocaine pharmacokinetic parameters (all P>.05). Time-course and peak effects analyses show that treatment with 0.4mg of huperzine A significantly attenuated cocaine-induced increases of \"Any Drug Effect,\" \"High,\" \"Stimulated,\" \"Willing to Pay,\" and \"Bad Effects\" (all P>.05). Conclusions: The current study represents a significant contribution to the addiction field since it serves as the first published report on the safety and potential efficacy of huperzine A as a treatment for cocaine use disorder.", "AuthorKeywords": ["acetylcholine", "acetylcholinesterase inhibitor", "Cocaine", "huperzine A"], "IndexKeywords": ["Administration, Intravenous", "Administration, Oral", "Adult", "Alkaloids", "Blood Pressure", "Cholinesterase Inhibitors", "Cocaine", "Cocaine-Related Disorders", "Dopamine Uptake Inhibitors", "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug", "Double-Blind Method", "Female", "Heart Rate", "Humans", "Male", "Self Administration", "Sesquiterpenes", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84963935718", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"7003906211": {"Name": "De La Garza R.", "AuthorID": "7003906211", "AffiliationID": "60002441", "AffiliationName": "Baylor College of Medicine, Menninger Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences"}, "6603433075": {"Name": "Verrico C.", "AuthorID": "6603433075", "AffiliationID": "60002441", "AffiliationName": "Baylor College of Medicine, Menninger Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences"}, "7102322515": {"Name": "Newton T.", "AuthorID": "7102322515", "AffiliationID": "60002441", "AffiliationName": "Baylor College of Medicine, Menninger Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences"}, "15071197700": {"Name": "Mahoney J.", "AuthorID": "15071197700", "AffiliationID": "60002441", "AffiliationName": "Baylor College of Medicine, Menninger Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences"}, "55990274200": {"Name": "Thompson-Lake D.", "AuthorID": "55990274200", "AffiliationID": "60002441", "AffiliationName": "Baylor College of Medicine, Menninger Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences"}}}
