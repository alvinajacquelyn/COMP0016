However, recent work has demonstrated the potential of eukaryotic microalgae as platforms for light-driven synthesis of such proteins. Expression in the algal chloroplast is particularly attractive since this organelle contains a minimal genome suitable for rapid engineering using synthetic biology approaches; with transgenes precisely targeted to specific genomic loci and amenable to high-level, regulated and stable expression. Furthermore, proteins can be tightly contained and bio-encapsulated in the chloroplast allowing accumulation of proteins otherwise toxic to the host, and opening up possibilities for low-cost, oral delivery of biologics. In this commentary we illustrate the technology with recent examples of hormones, protein antibiotics and immunotoxins successfully produced in the algal chloroplast, and highlight possible future applications.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Biopharmaceuticals", "Chlamydomonas", "Chloroplast", "Microalgae", "Synthetic biology"], "IndexKeywords": ["Anti-Bacterial Agents", "Biological Products", "Chlamydomonas reinhardtii", "Chlorophyta", "Chloroplasts", "Dietary Supplements", "Gene Expression", "Genetic Engineering", "Genetic Vectors", "Genome, Chloroplast", "Human Growth Hormone", "Immunotoxins", "Microalgae", "Recombinant Proteins", "Synthetic Biology", "Transformation, Genetic", "Transgenes"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85030178678", "SubjectAreas": [["Biotechnology", "BIOC", "1305"], ["Bioengineering", "CENG", "1502"], ["Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology", "IMMU", "2402"]], "AuthorData": {"57193542329": {"Name": "Taunt H.", "AuthorID": "57193542329", "AffiliationID": "119131655", "AffiliationName": "Algenuity, Eden Laboratory"}, "54895430300": {"Name": "Stoffels L.", "AuthorID": "54895430300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Algal Research Group, Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London"}, "6701719502": {"Name": "Purton S.", "AuthorID": "6701719502", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Algal Research Group, Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London"}}}
