All rights reserved.In fiber reinforced composite materials, the manufacturing process induces residual stresses and distortions that decrease the mechanical performance of the structure and affect its geometry, especially in thin laminates. Multi-physics simulations were performed to assess the spring-in effect in ultra-thin composite parabolic solar reflectors. For this purpose, a resin kinetic model has been developed by means of differential scanning calorimetry experiments. The kinetic relation has been implemented into the finite element software in order to correctly predict the evolution of the composite degree of cure during the manufacturing process. Specimens were produced in an autoclave and their final geometries were measured by means of a non-contact measuring system and compared with numerical predictions, showing very good agreement.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Composite laminate", "Finite element software", "Kinetic relations", "Manufacturing process", "Mechanical performance", "Multiphysics simulations", "Non-contact measuring systems", "Numerical predictions"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85044581885", "SubjectAreas": [["Civil and Structural Engineering", "ENGI", "2205"], ["Building and Construction", "ENGI", "2215"], ["Mechanics of Materials", "ENGI", "2211"], ["Architecture", "ENGI", "2216"]], "AuthorData": {"55964694900": {"Name": "Bosi F.", "AuthorID": "55964694900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "57201394537": {"Name": "Schlothauer A.", "AuthorID": "57201394537", "AffiliationID": "60025858", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical and Process Engineering, ETH Zurich"}, "35837966600": {"Name": "Pellegrino S.", "AuthorID": "35837966600", "AffiliationID": "60031581", "AffiliationName": "California Institute of Technology"}}}
