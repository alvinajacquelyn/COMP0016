The design is based on a highly modular interferometric, structure, in which OFDMA sub-channels remain in the optical domain. Sub-channel extraction is achieved via waveform splitting and coherent subtraction. Numerical studies have been carried out to validate performance and optimize critical parameters of the add/drop process. Particularly, input parameters like the signal extinction ratio, pulse rise time, switching window, and input power levels have been optimized for single sub-carrier add/drop operation, from an OFDM super-channel comprising seven optical sub-carriers with 10 GHz spacing. Results have shown that the proposed ROADM architecture can accommodate and process both regular and offset based high-order QAM signals.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Add-drop multiplexing", "coherent detection", "OFDMA", "optical superchannel", "QAM signals"], "IndexKeywords": ["Add-drop-multiplexing", "Coherent detection", "OFDMA", "Optical superchannel", "QAM signals"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85070236979", "SubjectAreas": [["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"]], "AuthorData": {"56235152700": {"Name": "Vlachos K.", "AuthorID": "56235152700", "AffiliationID": "60031155", "AffiliationName": "Computer Engineering and Informatics Department, University of Patras"}, "34881593800": {"Name": "Ferreira F.", "AuthorID": "34881593800", "AffiliationID": "60014551", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering and Applied Science, Aston Institute of Photonic Technologies"}, "55372527400": {"Name": "Sygletos S.", "AuthorID": "55372527400", "AffiliationID": "60014551", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering and Applied Science, Aston Institute of Photonic Technologies"}}}
