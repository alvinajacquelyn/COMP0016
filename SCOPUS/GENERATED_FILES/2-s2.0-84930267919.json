A recently developed laser is calibrated and the best method for designing an all-waveguide combining and homogenising system is investigated. Ray tracing simulations are performed and the results are presented. An optical combination of lenses is designed and used for laser beam focusing into a 200 \u03bcm fibre core diameter step index silica core multimode fibre. We also designed and simulated a slab waveguide for beam shaping and beam homogenizing.", "AuthorKeywords": ["3D display", "Auto stereoscopic display", "Backlight", "Display", "Laser display", "Laser display", "Liquid", "Optical waveguide", "RGB laser", "Spatial frequency", "Special light modulator (SLM)", "Speckle", "Speckle contrast"], "IndexKeywords": ["3-D displays", "Auto-stereoscopic display", "Backlight", "Laser display", "RGB laser", "Spatial frequency", "Special light modulator (SLM)", "Speckle contrasts"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84930267919", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"25930251000": {"Name": "Baghsiahi H.", "AuthorID": "25930251000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London (UCL)"}, "7203059023": {"Name": "Day S.", "AuthorID": "7203059023", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London (UCL)"}, "6603738758": {"Name": "Selviah D.", "AuthorID": "6603738758", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London (UCL)"}}}
