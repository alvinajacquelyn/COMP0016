When the droplet volume increased to 0.1 \u03bcL or greater, a mixture of the \u03b1 and \u03b2 forms was seen in a coffee-ring formation. When the droplet volume increased to 10 \u03bcL, needle-like \u03b2 crystals formed in the bulk of the ring and bipyramidal \u03b1 crystals on the outer edge at the air-water interface. The \u03b2 form was stable under ambient conditions for at least 6 weeks. The observations suggest that glycine nucleates to, and remains stable as, the \u03b2 form when constrained in small volumes, because on the nanometer scale the \u03b2 form is thermodynamically stable. As the droplet volume increases, and constraint on crystal growth is reduced, the \u03b1 form becomes thermodynamically stable, and so phase transformation occurs, probably facilitated by a solvent-mediated mechanism. Inkjet printing picoliter droplets may offer a new route to isolation of metastable polymorphs.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Air water interfaces", "Aluminum substrate", "Ambient conditions", "Aqueous glycine", "Nano-meter scale", "Picoliter droplets", "Thermodynamically stable", "Volume constraint"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85014248719", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"]], "AuthorData": {"36020023200": {"Name": "Buanz A.", "AuthorID": "36020023200", "AffiliationID": "60016379, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "6602683597": {"Name": "Gaisford S.", "AuthorID": "6602683597", "AffiliationID": "60016379, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy, University College London"}}}
