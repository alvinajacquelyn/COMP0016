However, empirical evidence on its incidence and effects is largely confined to the private sector. We find that half the 20 percentage point gap in PP incidence in Britain between the public and private sectors is accounted for by differences in occupational composition. The gap falls to 8 percentage points when \u2018matching\u2019 employees in both sectors on their demographic and job characteristics. PP is linked to positive job attitudes among private sector employees, but not among observationally equivalent public sector employees. Furthermore, PP is negatively correlated with workplace performance in the public sector. These findings raise important questions about public policies promoting PP in the public sector.", "AuthorKeywords": ["intrinsic job satisfaction", "organisational commitment", "performance pay", "public sector", "workplace performance"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85018936886", "SubjectAreas": [["Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management", "BUSI", "1407"]], "AuthorData": {"7005546003": {"Name": "Bryson A.", "AuthorID": "7005546003", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Department of Social Science, Institute of Education"}, "57154476100": {"Name": "Forth J.", "AuthorID": "57154476100", "AffiliationID": "60109561", "AffiliationName": "National Institute of Economic and Social Research"}, "55453944500": {"Name": "Stokes L.", "AuthorID": "55453944500", "AffiliationID": "60109561", "AffiliationName": "National Institute of Economic and Social Research"}}}
