We have investigated the effects of the QD layer number, the thickness and the composition of AlGaAs cladding layers on QD laser performance. The results demonstrate, with respect to the net modal gain and the differential quantum efficiency, that the optimized QD layer number is 7 for lasers grown on silicon, which is different from the optimized number of 5 for the counterparts grown on native substrates. The optimized thickness is obtained for the cladding layers of Al0.4Ga0.6As, Al0.6Ga0.4As and Al0.8Ga0.2As. Further, the optimized QD layer number for the net modal gain is nearly independent of the material gain of active regions. More importantly, the optimization strategy provides a comprehensive method to understand the differences in design between QD laser structures on silicon and those on native substrates.", "AuthorKeywords": ["lasers on silicon", "quantum dot lasers", "semiconductor lasers"], "IndexKeywords": ["Active regions", "Cladding layer", "Comprehensive method", "Differential quantum efficiency", "Epitaxially grown", "Material gain", "Metamorphic layers", "Optimization strategy"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85056118494", "SubjectAreas": [["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"], ["Instrumentation", "PHYS", "3105"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering", "ENGI", "2209"]], "AuthorData": {"55960946300": {"Name": "Wang J.", "AuthorID": "55960946300", "AffiliationID": "60016930", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Information Photonics and Optical Communications, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications"}, "56706765700": {"Name": "Cheng Z.", "AuthorID": "56706765700", "AffiliationID": "60016930", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Information Photonics and Optical Communications, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications"}, "35183091500": {"Name": "Huang Y.", "AuthorID": "35183091500", "AffiliationID": "60016930", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Information Photonics and Optical Communications, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications"}, "55627367600": {"Name": "Ren X.", "AuthorID": "55627367600", "AffiliationID": "60016930", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Information Photonics and Optical Communications, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications"}, "14015127400": {"Name": "Bai Y.", "AuthorID": "14015127400", "AffiliationID": "60021227", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Alternate Electrical Power System with Renewable Energy Sources, North China Electric Power University"}, "15765485000": {"Name": "Liu H.", "AuthorID": "15765485000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "55365959800": {"Name": "Tang M.", "AuthorID": "55365959800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "54939079100": {"Name": "Chen S.", "AuthorID": "54939079100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "10141185300": {"Name": "Wu J.", "AuthorID": "10141185300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "56341918300": {"Name": "Papatryfonos K.", "AuthorID": "56341918300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "57204556869": {"Name": "Liu Z.", "AuthorID": "57204556869", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}}}
