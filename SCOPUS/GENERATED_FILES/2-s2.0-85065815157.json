However, the standard of GO characterization is very poor because its structure is irregular, being sensitive to the preparation method, and it has a propensity to transform due to its reactive nature. Atomistic simulations of GO are common, but the nanostructure in these simulations is often based on little evidence or thought. We have written a computer program to generate graphene oxide nanostructures for general purpose atomistic simulation based on theoretical and experimental evidence. The structures generated offer a significant improvement to the current standard of randomly placed oxidized functional groups and successfully recreate the two-phase nature of oxidized and unoxidized graphene domains observed in microscopy experiments. Using this model, we reveal new features of GO structure and predict that a critical point in the oxidation reaction exists as the oxidized region reaches a percolation threshold. Even by a conservative estimate, we show that, if the carbon to oxygen ratio is kept above 6, a continuous aromatic network will remain, preserving many of graphene's desirable properties, irrespective of the oxidation method or the size distribution of graphene sheets. This is an experimentally achievable degree of oxidation and should aid better GO synthesis for many applications.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Atomistic simulations", "Degree of oxidations", "Experimental evidence", "Graphene sheets", "Oxidation reactions", "Oxide nanostructures", "Percolation thresholds", "Preparation method", "Graphite", "Models, Molecular", "Molecular Conformation", "Nanostructures"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85065815157", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Library and Information Sciences", "SOCI", "3309"]], "AuthorData": {"57200180975": {"Name": "Sinclair R.C.", "AuthorID": "57200180975", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Computational Science, University College London"}, "7005747590": {"Name": "Coveney P.V.", "AuthorID": "7005747590", "AffiliationID": "60002483", "AffiliationName": "Computational Science Laboratory, Institute for Informatics, Faculty of Science, University of Amsterdam"}}}
