Blood group incompatible transplantation (ABOi) in children is rare as pretransplant conditioning remains challenging and concerns persist about the potential increased risk of rejection. Methods.We describe the results of 11 ABOi pediatric renal transplant recipients in the 2 largest centers in the United Kingdom, sharing the same tailored desensitization protocol. Patients with pretransplant titers of 1 or more in 8 received rituximab 1 month before transplant; tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil were started 1 week before surgery. Antibody removal was performed to reduce titers to 1 or less in 8 on the day of the operation. No routine postoperative antibody removal was performed. Results. Death-censored graft survival at last follow-up was 100% in the ABOi and 98% in 50 compatible pediatric transplants. One patient developed grade 2A rejection successfully treated with antithymocyte globulin. Another patient had a titer rise of 2 dilutions treated with 1 immunoadsorption session. There was no histological evidence of rejection in the other 9 patients. One patient developed cytomegalovirus and BK and 2 others EBV and BK viremia. Conclusions. Tailored desensitization in pediatric blood group incompatible kidney transplantation results in excellent outcomes with graft survival and rejection rates comparable with compatible transplants.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["ABO Blood-Group System", "Adolescent", "Age Factors", "Blood Group Incompatibility", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Desensitization, Immunologic", "Disease-Free Survival", "Drug Therapy, Combination", "Female", "Graft Rejection", "Graft Survival", "Histocompatibility", "Humans", "Immunosuppressive Agents", "Kaplan-Meier Estimate", "Kidney Transplantation", "London", "Male", "Mycophenolic Acid", "Risk Factors", "Rituximab", "Tacrolimus", "Time Factors", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85020714682", "SubjectAreas": [["Transplantation", "MEDI", "2747"]], "AuthorData": {"56086171700": {"Name": "Stojanovic J.", "AuthorID": "56086171700", "AffiliationID": "60107269", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatric Nephrology and Transplantation at Evelina London Children's Hospital"}, "25929991500": {"Name": "Kessaris N.", "AuthorID": "25929991500", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatric Nephrology and Transplantation at Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}, "36562961900": {"Name": "Walsh G.", "AuthorID": "36562961900", "AffiliationID": "60107269", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatric Nephrology and Transplantation at Evelina London Children's Hospital"}, "23469780100": {"Name": "Jones H.E.", "AuthorID": "23469780100", "AffiliationID": "60107269", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatric Nephrology and Transplantation at Evelina London Children's Hospital"}, "6701402620": {"Name": "Mamode N.", "AuthorID": "6701402620", "AffiliationID": "60009797", "AffiliationName": "Department of Transplant Surgery, Renal Offices"}, "54405299300": {"Name": "Adamusiak A.", "AuthorID": "54405299300", "AffiliationID": "60005518", "AffiliationName": "Department of Transplantation at Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "15822063700": {"Name": "Chandak P.", "AuthorID": "15822063700", "AffiliationID": "60005518", "AffiliationName": "Department of Transplantation at Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "36603996800": {"Name": "Ahmed Z.", "AuthorID": "36603996800", "AffiliationID": "60005518", "AffiliationName": "Department of Transplantation at Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "8889557300": {"Name": "Marks S.D.", "AuthorID": "8889557300", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatric Nephrology and Transplantation at Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57049165000": {"Name": "Sebire N.J.", "AuthorID": "57049165000", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Histopathology at Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
