Our results show that most Li and all Mg isotopic compositions of the Horoman peridotites are constant over 100metres of continuous outcrop, yielding values for pristine mantle of \u03b4<sup>7</sup>Li=3.8\u00b11.4\u2030 (2SD, n=9), \u03b4<sup>25</sup>Mg=-0.12\u00b10.02\u2030 and \u03b4<sup>26</sup>Mg=-0.23\u00b10.04\u2030 (2SD, n=17), in keeping with values for undisturbed mantle xenoliths. However, there are also some anomalously low \u03b4<sup>7</sup>Li values (-0.2\u2030 to 1.6\u2030), which coincide with locations that show enrichment of incompatible elements, indicative of the prior passage of small degree melts. We suggest Li diffused from infiltrating melts with high [Li] into the low [Li] minerals and kinetically fractionated <sup>7</sup>Li/<sup>6</sup>Li as a result. Continued diffusion after the melt flow had ceased would have resulted in the disappearance of this isotopically light signature in less than 15Ma. In order to preserve this feature, the melt infiltration must have been a late stage event and the massif must have subsequently cooled over a maximum of ~0.3Ma from peak temperature (950\u00b0C, assuming the melts were hydrous) to Li closure temperature (700\u00b0C), likely during emplacement. The constant \u03b4<sup>26</sup>Mg values of Horoman peridotites suggest that chemical potential gradients caused by melt infiltration were insufficient to drive associated \u03b4<sup>26</sup>Mg fractionation greater than our external precision of 0.03\u2030.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84931268875", "SubjectAreas": [["Geochemistry and Petrology", "EART", "1906"]], "AuthorData": {"39361881900": {"Name": "Lai Y.J.", "AuthorID": "39361881900", "AffiliationID": "60025858", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Geochemistry and Petrology, ETH Z\u00fcrich"}, "57204707349": {"Name": "Pogge von Strandmann P.A.E.", "AuthorID": "57204707349", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60162128, 60009016", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Earth and Planetary Sciences, UCL, Birkbeck, University of London"}, "36681117900": {"Name": "Dohmen R.", "AuthorID": "36681117900", "AffiliationID": "60005322", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Geology, Mineralogy and Geophysics, Ruhr-University Bochum"}, "22940400900": {"Name": "Elliott T.", "AuthorID": "22940400900", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "Bristol Isotope Group, School of Earth Sciences, University of Bristol"}, "6701767542": {"Name": "Takazawa E.", "AuthorID": "6701767542", "AffiliationID": "60004283", "AffiliationName": "Mantle and Continental Crust Drilling Research Group, Research and Development Center for Ocean Drilling Science, Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology"}}}
