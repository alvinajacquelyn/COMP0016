Graphene quantum dots (GQDs) hold great promise for PDT. However, the photochemical processes leading to GQD-derived ROS generation have not yet been fully elucidated. Materials & methods: Physicochemical characteristics of GQDs were comprehensively investigated, including electron paramagnetic resonance analysis of singlet oxygen production. Dark toxicity was assessed in vitro and in vivo. Results: GQDs demonstrated excellent photoluminescent features, corrosion resistance, high water solubility, high photo/pH-stability, in vitro and in vivo biocompatibility and very efficient singlet oxygen/ROS generation. Conclusion: The enhanced ROS generation, combined with good biocompatibility and minimal toxicity in vitro and in vivo support the potential of GQDs for future PDT application.", "AuthorKeywords": ["biocompatibility", "corrosion resistance", "graphene quantum dots", "photodynamic therapy", "photostability", "reactive oxygen species", "singlet oxygen", "toxicity"], "IndexKeywords": ["3T3 Cells", "Animals", "Biocompatible Materials", "Cell Proliferation", "Cell Survival", "Drug Stability", "Graphite", "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration", "Luminescence", "Male", "Mice", "Particle Size", "Photochemotherapy", "Quantum Dots", "Rats", "Rats, Sprague-Dawley", "Reactive Oxygen Species", "Singlet Oxygen", "Solubility"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85053859620", "SubjectAreas": [["Bioengineering", "CENG", "1502"], ["Medicine (miscellaneous)", "MEDI", "2701"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"]], "AuthorData": {"55484476700": {"Name": "Tabish T.A.", "AuthorID": "55484476700", "AffiliationID": "60026479", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Graphene Science, College of Engineering, University of Exeter"}, "14421489600": {"Name": "Lin L.", "AuthorID": "14421489600", "AffiliationID": "60026479", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Graphene Science, College of Engineering, University of Exeter"}, "55308934100": {"Name": "Zhang S.", "AuthorID": "55308934100", "AffiliationID": "60026479", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Graphene Science, College of Engineering, University of Exeter"}, "8766774500": {"Name": "Scotton C.J.", "AuthorID": "8766774500", "AffiliationID": "60111707", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Biomedical and Clinical Science, University of Exeter Medical School, St Luke's Campus"}, "57203984864": {"Name": "J Ferguson D.C.", "AuthorID": "57203984864", "AffiliationID": "60111707", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Biomedical and Clinical Science, University of Exeter Medical School, St Luke's Campus"}, "57203989896": {"Name": "Der Veen A.V.", "AuthorID": "57203989896", "AffiliationID": "60111707", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Biomedical and Clinical Science, University of Exeter Medical School, St Luke's Campus"}, "57203983859": {"Name": "Lowry S.", "AuthorID": "57203983859", "AffiliationID": "60111707", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Biomedical and Clinical Science, University of Exeter Medical School, St Luke's Campus"}, "7005108335": {"Name": "Winyard P.G.", "AuthorID": "7005108335", "AffiliationID": "60111707", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Biomedical and Clinical Science, University of Exeter Medical School, St Luke's Campus"}, "55647598200": {"Name": "Ali M.", "AuthorID": "55647598200", "AffiliationID": "60034410", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Animal Sciences, Bahauddin Zakariya University"}, "35210272700": {"Name": "Jabeen F.", "AuthorID": "35210272700", "AffiliationID": "60070615", "AffiliationName": "Department of Zoology, Government College University"}}}
