Infection remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality after a VP shunt. There is evidence that a deep skin flora microbiome may have a role to play in post-operative infections. In this technical note, we present a skin preparation technique that addresses the issue of the skin flora beyond the initial incision. Methods : The patient is initially prepped, as standard, with. a single layer of 2% CHG+70% isopropyl alcohol. The novel stage is the \u2018double incision\u2019 whereby an initial superficial incision receives a further application of povidone-iodine prior to completing the full depth incision. Results : Of the 84 shunts inserted using the double-incision method (September 2015 to September 2016), only one developed a shunt infection. Conclusion : The double incision approach to skin preparation is a unique operative stage in VP shunt surgery that may have a role to play in reducing acute shunt infection.", "AuthorKeywords": ["PVP-Iodine", "Skin", "Surgical incision", "Ventriculo-peritoneal shunt", "Wound infection, Surgical"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85061929896", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"56419604800": {"Name": "Craven C.L.", "AuthorID": "56419604800", "AffiliationID": "60020736", "AffiliationName": "Victor Horsley Department of Neurosurgery, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "57192996092": {"Name": "Thompson S.D.", "AuthorID": "57192996092", "AffiliationID": "60020736", "AffiliationName": "Victor Horsley Department of Neurosurgery, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "22958811100": {"Name": "Toma A.K.", "AuthorID": "22958811100", "AffiliationID": "60020736", "AffiliationName": "Victor Horsley Department of Neurosurgery, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "7102438957": {"Name": "Watkins L.D.", "AuthorID": "7102438957", "AffiliationID": "60020736", "AffiliationName": "Victor Horsley Department of Neurosurgery, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}}}
