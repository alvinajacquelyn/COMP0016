Materials and Methods: Of 12 scanned infants, we successfully acquired CBF maps in 7 (postmenstrual age: 32 to 78 weeks) using a Look-Locker ASL scheme and both adult literature-derived and subject-specific model parameters. ASL global CBF measurements were compared with independent global CBF measurements obtained in the same scanning session using phase-contrast angiography. Results: Measured global CBF values ranged from 24 to 56 mL/100g/min in the scanned infants, increasing significantly with postmenstrual age (\u03c1Spearman = 0.89, P-value = 0.01). Using subject-specific model parameters yielded CBF estimates in significantly better agreement with phase-contrast angiography values (P-value: 0.80) than when standard adult parameters were used (P-value: 0.04). Conclusion: Look-Locker ASL can be used to measure CBF in infants and its accuracy is improved with the use of infant-specific auxiliary parameters, particularly blood and tissue T1, which were much more variable in the imaged infants in than adults.", "AuthorKeywords": ["blood flow quantification", "Cerebral perfusion measurements", "magnetic resonance imaging", "neonatal imaging", "pediatric neurology and hemodynamics", "phase contrast angiography"], "IndexKeywords": ["Brain Diseases", "Cerebrovascular Circulation", "Female", "Humans", "Infant", "Infant, Newborn", "Magnetic Resonance Angiography", "Male", "Sensitivity and Specificity", "Spin Labels"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84930038222", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"54931738100": {"Name": "Varela M.", "AuthorID": "54931738100", "AffiliationID": "60015150, 60006757", "AffiliationName": "Imaging Sciences Department, MRC Clinical Sciences Centre, Imperial College London"}, "35430060900": {"Name": "Hajnal J.V.", "AuthorID": "35430060900", "AffiliationID": "60015150, 60006757", "AffiliationName": "Imaging Sciences Department, MRC Clinical Sciences Centre, Imperial College London"}, "7202854826": {"Name": "Petersen E.T.", "AuthorID": "7202854826", "AffiliationID": "60032724", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, University Medical Center"}, "7004309393": {"Name": "Golay X.", "AuthorID": "7004309393", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Neurology, University College London"}}}
