To estimate the potential risk reduction in serious non-AIDS conditions or death from any cause that might be achieved with treatments that reduce inflammation and/or coagulation, we examined associations of interleukin-6 (IL-6), D-dimer, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) levels with serious non-AIDS conditions or death in 3 large cohorts. Methods: In HIV-positive adults on suppressive ART, associations of IL-6, D-dimer, and hsCRP levels at study entry with serious non-AIDS conditions or death were studied using Cox regression. Hazard ratios (HR) adjusted for age, gender, study, and regression dilution bias (due to within-person biomarker variability) were used to predict risk reductions in serious non- AIDS conditions or death associated with lower \"usual\" levels of IL-6 and D-dimer. Results: Over 4.9 years of mean follow-up, 260 of the 3766 participants experienced serious non- AIDS conditions or death. IL-6, D-dimer and hsCRP were each individually associated with risk of serious non-AIDS conditions or death, HR = 1.45 (95% CI: 1.30 to 1.63), 1.28 (95% CI: 1.14 to 1.44), and 1.17 (95% CI: 1.09 to 1.26) per 2x higher biomarker levels, respectively. In joint models, IL-6 and D-dimer were independently associated with serious non- AIDS conditions or death, with consistent results across the 3 cohorts and across serious non-AIDS event types. The association of IL-6 and D-dimer with serious non-AIDS conditions or death was graded and persisted throughout follow-up. For 25% lower \"usual\" IL-6 and D-dimer levels, the joint biomarker model estimates a 37% reduction (95% CI: 28 to 46%) in the risk of serious non-AIDS conditions or death if the relationship is causal. Conclusions: Both IL-6 and D-dimer are independently associated with serious non-AIDS conditions or death among HIV-positive adults with suppressed virus. This suggests that treatments that reduce IL-6 and D-dimer levels might substantially decrease morbidity and mortality in patients on suppressive ART. Clinical trials are needed to test this hypothesis.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Antiretroviral Therapy, Highly Active", "Biomarkers", "C-Reactive Protein", "Endpoint Determination", "Female", "Fibrin Fibrinogen Degradation Products", "HIV Seropositivity", "Humans", "Interleukin-6", "Kaplan-Meier Estimate", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Morbidity", "Risk Reduction Behavior"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84971264750", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"17345906900": {"Name": "Grund B.", "AuthorID": "17345906900", "AffiliationID": "60029445", "AffiliationName": "School of Statistics, University of Minnesota"}, "15070550000": {"Name": "Baker J.", "AuthorID": "15070550000", "AffiliationID": "60029445", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota"}, "7006700221": {"Name": "Deeks S.", "AuthorID": "7006700221", "AffiliationID": "60003214", "AffiliationName": "San Francisco General Hospital"}, "57201661407": {"Name": "Wolfson J.", "AuthorID": "57201661407", "AffiliationID": "60013223, 60029445", "AffiliationName": "Division of Biostatistics, School of Public Health, University of Minnesota"}, "7004800841": {"Name": "Wentworth D.", "AuthorID": "7004800841", "AffiliationID": "60013223, 60029445", "AffiliationName": "Division of Biostatistics, School of Public Health, University of Minnesota"}, "7006720136": {"Name": "Neaton J.", "AuthorID": "7006720136", "AffiliationID": "60013223, 60029445", "AffiliationName": "Division of Biostatistics, School of Public Health, University of Minnesota"}, "55134188900": {"Name": "Cozzi-Lepri A.", "AuthorID": "55134188900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "35372648800": {"Name": "Phillips A.", "AuthorID": "35372648800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "7401692871": {"Name": "Cohen C.", "AuthorID": "7401692871", "AffiliationID": "60002909", "AffiliationName": "Medical Affairs Department, Gilead Sciences"}, "35307337700": {"Name": "Lundgren J.", "AuthorID": "35307337700", "AffiliationID": "60030840, 60006564", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infectious Diseases, Rigshospitalet, University of Copenhagen"}}}
