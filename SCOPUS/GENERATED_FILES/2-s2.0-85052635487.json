Cuijpers et al., after correcting for bias, concluded that the effect of psychotherapy for depression was small (standardised mean difference, SMD, between 0.20 and 0.30), providing evidence that psychotherapy is not as effective as generally accepted.Methods The data for this study were the effect sizes included in Cuijpers et al. (2018). We removed outliers from the data set of effects, corrected for publication bias and segregated psychotherapy from other interventions. In our study, we considered wait-list (WL) controls as the most appropriate estimate of the natural history of depression without intervention.Results The SMD for all interventions and for psychotherapy compared to WL controls was approximately 0.70, a value consistent with past estimates of the effectiveness of psychotherapy. Psychotherapy was also more effective than care-as-usual (SMD = 0.31) and other control groups (SMD = 0.43).Conclusions The re-analysis reveals that psychotherapy for adult patients diagnosed with depression is effective.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Depression", "Eysenck", "meta-analysis", "natural history", "psychotherapy effectiveness"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Depression", "Depressive Disorder", "Humans", "Psychotherapy", "Waiting Lists"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85052635487", "SubjectAreas": [["Epidemiology", "MEDI", "2713"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"56592623500": {"Name": "Munder T.", "AuthorID": "56592623500", "AffiliationID": "109682107", "AffiliationName": "Psychologische Hochschule Berlin"}, "8987162600": {"Name": "Fl\u00fcckiger C.", "AuthorID": "8987162600", "AffiliationID": "60012614", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, University of Z\u00fcrich"}, "7004931699": {"Name": "Leichsenring F.", "AuthorID": "7004931699", "AffiliationID": "60017134", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychosomatics and Psychotherapy, Justus-Liebig-University Giessen"}, "55910900900": {"Name": "Steinert C.", "AuthorID": "55910900900", "AffiliationID": "120707998", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Medical School Berlin"}, "57203076699": {"Name": "Abbass A.A.", "AuthorID": "57203076699", "AffiliationID": "60023750", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, Centre for Emotions and Health, Dalhousie University"}, "7003752478": {"Name": "Hilsenroth M.J.", "AuthorID": "7003752478", "AffiliationID": "60022908", "AffiliationName": "Derner Institute of Advanced Psychological Studies, Adelphi University, Hy Weinberg Center"}, "57203069499": {"Name": "Luyten P.", "AuthorID": "57203069499", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London"}, "8767980700": {"Name": "Rabung S.", "AuthorID": "8767980700", "AffiliationID": "60019660", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Alpen-Adria-Universit\u00e4t Klagenfurt"}, "7003632855": {"Name": "Wampold B.E.", "AuthorID": "7003632855", "AffiliationID": "60032179", "AffiliationName": "University of Wisconsin-Madison"}}}
