Methods: Data from 84,867 adolescents aged 12\u201315 years participating in the Global School-based Student Health Survey were analyzed. Participants reported lifetime frequency of cannabis use (analyzed as 0, 1\u20132, 3\u201319 or \u2265 20 times), whether they had ever had sexual intercourse (yes/no) and, if yes, their lifetime number of sexual partners. We used multivariable logistic regression to analyze associations, adjusting for a range of relevant covariates. Results: 12.7% of the sample reported having had sexual intercourse, and of these adolescents, 53.1% had had multiple sexual partners. The prevalence of lifetime cannabis use of 1\u20132 times, 3\u201319 times, and \u2265 20 times were 1.1%, 1.2%, and 0.4%, respectively. Those who reported using cannabis 1\u20132 times, 3\u20139 times, and \u2265 20 times had 2.32 (95%CI = 1.47\u20133.65), 2.34 (95%CI = 1.34\u20134.07), and 5.45 (95%CI = 2.22\u201313.40) times higher odds of having had sexual intercourse than those who had never used cannabis. Among those who had ever had sexual intercourse, the respective odds ratios (95%CIs) for having multiple sexual partners were 1.56 (0.93\u20132.62), 1.70 (0.92\u20133.14), and 5.66 (2.97\u201310.82). There were no significant interactions by sex for these associations. Conclusions: Adolescents from LMIC who use cannabis are more likely to have ever had sexual intercourse than those who do not. Among those who have had sexual intercourse, those who use cannabis are more likely to have had multiple sexual partners.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Adolescents", "Cannabis use", "Epidemiology", "LMIC", "Sexual behavior"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Child", "Coitus", "Developing Countries", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Marijuana Use", "Sexual Behavior", "Sexual Partners"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85070583546", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (miscellaneous)", "MEDI", "2701"], ["Clinical Psychology", "PSYC", "3203"], ["Toxicology", "PHAR", "3005"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"37117793800": {"Name": "Smith L.", "AuthorID": "37117793800", "AffiliationID": "60000913", "AffiliationName": "The Cambridge Centre for Sport and Exercise Sciences, Anglia Ruskin University"}, "57196323380": {"Name": "Jackson S.E.", "AuthorID": "57196323380", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Behavioural Science and Health, University College London"}, "56779678900": {"Name": "Jacob L.", "AuthorID": "56779678900", "AffiliationID": "60029937", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Medicine, University of Versailles Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines"}, "55965585000": {"Name": "Grabovac I.", "AuthorID": "55965585000", "AffiliationID": "60011394", "AffiliationName": "Department of Social and Preventive Medicine, Center of Public Health, Medical University of Vienna"}, "57199324864": {"Name": "Nisbet L.A.", "AuthorID": "57199324864", "AffiliationID": "60000913", "AffiliationName": "School of Life Sciences, Department of Forensic and Investigative Sciences, Anglia Ruskin University"}, "56371435100": {"Name": "L\u00f3pez-S\u00e1nchez G.F.", "AuthorID": "56371435100", "AffiliationID": "60000130", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Sport Sciences, University of Murcia"}, "26327022900": {"Name": "McDermott D.", "AuthorID": "26327022900", "AffiliationID": "60000913", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology and Sport Science, Anglia Ruskin University"}, "57210411137": {"Name": "Salmeron A.G.", "AuthorID": "57210411137", "AffiliationID": "60002644", "AffiliationName": "Polibienestar Research Institute, University of Valencia"}, "57189045362": {"Name": "Yang L.", "AuthorID": "57189045362", "AffiliationID": "60105825", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cancer Epidemiology and Prevention Research, Alberta Health Services, Holy Cross Centre"}, "57197741912": {"Name": "Koyanagi A.", "AuthorID": "57197741912", "AffiliationID": "60032907", "AffiliationName": "ICREA"}}}
