Child.", "Volume": "101", "Issue": 10, "Art.No": null, "PageStart": 957, "PageEnd": 961, "CitedBy": 6, "DOI": "10.1136/archdischild-2015-308825", "Link": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84973375330&origin=inward", "Abstract": "\u00a9 2016 Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.Aim: Assessment of the efficacy of vitamin D replenishment and maintenance doses required to attain optimal levels in boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Method: 25(OH)-vitamin D levels and concurrent vitamin D dosage were collected from retrospective case-note review of boys with DMD at the Dubowitz Neuromuscular Centre. Vitamin D levels were stratified as deficient at <25 nmol/L, insufficient at 25-49 nmol/L, adequate at 50-75 nmol/L and optimal at >75 nmol/L. Result: 617 vitamin D samples were available from 197 boys (range 2-18 years) - 69% from individuals on corticosteroids. Vitamin D-na\u00efve boys (154 samples) showed deficiency in 28%, insufficiency in 42%, adequate levels in 24% and optimal levels in 6%. The vitamin D-supplemented group (463 samples) was tested while on different maintenance/replenishment doses. Three-month replenishment of daily 3000 IU (23 samples) or 6000 IU (37 samples) achieved optimal levels in 52% and 84%, respectively. 182 samples taken on 400 IU revealed deficiency in 19 (10%), insufficiency in 84 (47%), adequate levels in 67 (37%) and optimal levels in 11 (6%). 97 samples taken on 800 IU showed deficiency in 2 (2%), insufficiency in 17 (17%), adequate levels in 56 (58%) and optimal levels in 22 (23%). 81 samples were on 1000 IU and 14 samples on 1500 IU, with optimal levels in 35 (43%) and 9 (64%), respectively. No toxic level was seen (highest level 230 nmol/L). Conclusions: The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency in DMD is high. A 2-month replenishment regimen of 6000 IU and maintenance regimen of 1000-1500 IU/day was associated with optimal vitamin D levels. These data have important implications for optimising vitamin D dosing in DMD.", "AuthorKeywords": ["General Paediatrics", "Neurology", "Neuromuscular", "Nutrition", "Paediatric Practice"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adrenal Cortex Hormones", "Case-Control Studies", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Dietary Supplements", "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug", "Humans", "Male", "Muscular Dystrophy, Duchenne", "Retrospective Studies", "Treatment Outcome", "Vitamin D", "Vitamin D Deficiency", "Vitamins"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84973375330", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"]], "AuthorData": {"55907925400": {"Name": "Alshaikh N.", "AuthorID": "55907925400", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60018207", "AffiliationName": "Dubowitz Neuromuscular Centre, Great Ormond Street Hospital, UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "6506306108": {"Name": "Brunklaus A.", "AuthorID": "6506306108", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60018207", "AffiliationName": "Dubowitz Neuromuscular Centre, Great Ormond Street Hospital, UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "57189597586": {"Name": "Davis T.", "AuthorID": "57189597586", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60018207", "AffiliationName": "Dubowitz Neuromuscular Centre, Great Ormond Street Hospital, UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "7007147528": {"Name": "Robb S.A.", "AuthorID": "7007147528", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60018207", "AffiliationName": "Dubowitz Neuromuscular Centre, Great Ormond Street Hospital, UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "57208851936": {"Name": "Quinlivan R.", "AuthorID": "57208851936", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60018207", "AffiliationName": "Dubowitz Neuromuscular Centre, Great Ormond Street Hospital, UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "16507468800": {"Name": "Munot P.", "AuthorID": "16507468800", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60018207", "AffiliationName": "Dubowitz Neuromuscular Centre, Great Ormond Street Hospital, UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "7003888450": {"Name": "Sarkozy A.", "AuthorID": "7003888450", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60018207", "AffiliationName": "Dubowitz Neuromuscular Centre, Great Ormond Street Hospital, UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "7102038246": {"Name": "Muntoni F.", "AuthorID": "7102038246", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60018207", "AffiliationName": "Dubowitz Neuromuscular Centre, Great Ormond Street Hospital, UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "7004508063": {"Name": "Manzur A.Y.", "AuthorID": "7004508063", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60018207", "AffiliationName": "Dubowitz Neuromuscular Centre, Great Ormond Street Hospital, UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "null": {"Name": null, "AuthorID": null, "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
