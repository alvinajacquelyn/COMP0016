In these situations, transanal irrigation (TAI) has been shown to reduce these symptoms and improve quality of life. Aim: To investigate the long-term cost-effectiveness of initiating TAI in patients with NBD who have failed standard bowel care (SBC). Methods: A deterministic Markov decision model was developed to project the lifetime health economic outcomes, including quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), episodes of FI, urinary tract infections (UTIs), and stoma surgery when initiating TAI relative to continuing SBC. A data set consisting of 227 patients with NBD due to spinal cord injury (SCI), multiple sclerosis, spina bifida and cauda equina syndrome was used in the analysis. In the model a 30-year old individual with SCI was used as a base-case. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis was applied to evaluate the robustness of the model. Results: The model predicts that a 30-year old SCI patient with a life expectancy of 37 years initiating TAI will experience a 36% reduction in FI episodes, a 29% reduction in UTIs, a 35% reduction in likelihood of stoma surgery and a 0.4 improvement in QALYs, compared with patients continuing SBC. A lifetime cost-saving of \u014121,768 per patient was estimated for TAI versus continuing SBC alone. Conclusion: TAI is a cost-saving treatment strategy reducing risk of stoma surgery, UTIs, episodes of FI and improving QALYs for NBD patients who have failed SBC.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Anal Canal", "Cost-Benefit Analysis", "Fecal Incontinence", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Markov Chains", "Middle Aged", "Neurogenic Bowel", "Quality of Life", "Quality-Adjusted Life Years", "Therapeutic Irrigation", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84991106923", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"7003781894": {"Name": "Emmanuel A.", "AuthorID": "7003781894", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "GI Physiology Unit, University College London Hospital"}, "56699349000": {"Name": "Kumar G.", "AuthorID": "56699349000", "AffiliationID": "60098429", "AffiliationName": "ICON Health Economics"}, "16481212300": {"Name": "Mealing S.", "AuthorID": "16481212300", "AffiliationID": "60098429", "AffiliationName": "ICON Health Economics"}, "7202250340": {"Name": "Christensen P.", "AuthorID": "7202250340", "AffiliationID": "60023882", "AffiliationName": "Pelvic Floor Unit, Aarhus University Hospital"}, "13007429900": {"Name": "St\u00f8rling Z.M.", "AuthorID": "13007429900", "AffiliationID": "60008874", "AffiliationName": "Coloplast A/S"}, "57200834541": {"Name": "Andersen F.", "AuthorID": "57200834541", "AffiliationID": "60008874", "AffiliationName": "Coloplast A/S"}, "7006700768": {"Name": "Kirshblum S.", "AuthorID": "7006700768", "AffiliationID": "60005208, 60010608", "AffiliationName": "Kessler Institute for Rehabilitation, Rutgers New Jersey Medical School"}}}
