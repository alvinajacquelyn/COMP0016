In the UK, there is a significant national variation in early cancer diagnosis. Healthcare providers can offer an insight into local priorities for timely cancer diagnosis. In this study, we aimed to identify the main problems and solutions relating to delay cancer diagnosis according to cancer care clinicians. Methods We developed and implemented a new priority-setting approach called PRIORITIZE and invited North West London cancer care clinicians to identify and prioritize main causes for and solutions to delayed diagnosis of cancer care. Results Clinicians identified a number of concrete problems and solutions relating to delayed diagnosis of cancer. Raising public awareness, patient education as well as better access to specialist care and diagnostic testing were seen as the highest priorities. The identified suggestions focused mostly on the delays during referrals from primary to secondary care. Conclusions Many identified priorities were feasible, affordable and converged around common themes such as public awareness, care continuity and length of consultation. As a timely, proactive and scalable priority-setting approach, PRIORITZE could be implemented as a routine preventative system for determining patient safety issues by frontline staff.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Delayed Diagnosis", "Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice", "Humans", "Patient Education as Topic", "Practice Patterns, Physicians'", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85010460281", "SubjectAreas": [["Health Policy", "MEDI", "2719"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"55203253200": {"Name": "Car L.T.", "AuthorID": "55203253200", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Primary Care and Public Health, School of Public Health, Imperial College"}, "57196396234": {"Name": "Papachristou N.", "AuthorID": "57196396234", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Primary Care and Public Health, School of Public Health, Imperial College"}, "7102027801": {"Name": "Majeed A.", "AuthorID": "7102027801", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Primary Care and Public Health, School of Public Health, Imperial College"}, "57191109177": {"Name": "El-Khatib M.", "AuthorID": "57191109177", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Primary Care and Public Health, School of Public Health, Imperial College"}, "7003627876": {"Name": "Aylin P.", "AuthorID": "7003627876", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Primary Care and Public Health, School of Public Health, Imperial College"}, "6701783618": {"Name": "Car J.", "AuthorID": "6701783618", "AffiliationID": "60005510", "AffiliationName": "Health Services and Outcomes Research Programme, LKCMedicine, Nanyang Technological University"}, "6603798602": {"Name": "Urch C.", "AuthorID": "6603798602", "AffiliationID": "60022871, 60111785", "AffiliationName": "Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, St Mary's Hospital"}, "6602245046": {"Name": "Atun R.", "AuthorID": "6602245046", "AffiliationID": "60032499", "AffiliationName": "Department of Global Health and Population, Department of Health Policy and Management, Harvard School of Public Health"}, "57202463538": {"Name": "Vincent C.", "AuthorID": "57202463538", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Experimental Psychology, Medical Sciences Division, University of Oxford"}}}
