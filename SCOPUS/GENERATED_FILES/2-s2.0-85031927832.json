The aim of this study was to assess the activity of avelumab, a PD-L1 inhibitor, in patients with MBC. Methods In a phase 1 trial (JAVELIN Solid Tumor; NCT01772004), patients with MBC refractory to or progressing after standard-of-care therapy received avelumab intravenously 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks. Tumors were assessed every 6 weeks by RECIST v1.1. Adverse events (AEs) were graded by NCI-CTCAE v4.0. Membrane PD-L1 expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry (Dako PD-L1 IHC 73-10 pharmDx). Results A total of 168 patients with MBC, including 58 patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), were treated with avelumab for 2\u201350 weeks and followed for 6\u201315 months. Patients were heavily pretreated with a median of three prior therapies for metastatic or locally advanced disease. Grade \u2265 3 treatment-related AEs occurred in 13.7% of patients, including two treatment-related deaths. The confirmed objective response rate (ORR) was 3.0% overall (one complete response and four partial responses) and 5.2% in patients with TNBC. A trend toward a higher ORR was seen in patients with PD-L1+ versus PD-L1\u2212 tumor-associated immune cells in the overall population (16.7% vs. 1.6%) and in the TNBC subgroup (22.2% vs. 2.6%). Conclusion Avelumab showed an acceptable safety profile and clinical activity in a subset of patients with MBC. PD-L1 expression in tumor-associated immune cells may be associated with a higher probability of clinical response to avelumab in MBC.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Avelumab", "Metastatic breast cancer", "PD-L1", "Second-line", "Triple-negative breast cancer"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic", "Antibodies, Monoclonal", "B7-H1 Antigen", "Disease-Free Survival", "Female", "Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic", "Humans", "Middle Aged", "Neoplasm Metastasis", "Neoplasm Recurrence, Local", "Triple Negative Breast Neoplasms"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85031927832", "SubjectAreas": [["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Cancer Research", "BIOC", "1306"]], "AuthorData": {"7005397716": {"Name": "Dirix L.", "AuthorID": "7005397716", "AffiliationID": "60012937, 60072273", "AffiliationName": "Sint Augustinus-University of Antwerp"}, "36097079200": {"Name": "Takacs I.", "AuthorID": "36097079200", "AffiliationID": "60024812", "AffiliationName": "Semmelweis University"}, "7003702456": {"Name": "Jerusalem G.", "AuthorID": "7003702456", "AffiliationID": "60016829, 60000964", "AffiliationName": "CHU Sart Tilman Liege and Liege University"}, "6508286958": {"Name": "Nikolinakos P.", "AuthorID": "6508286958", "AffiliationID": "115535327", "AffiliationName": "University Cancer & Blood Center, LLC"}, "6603300234": {"Name": "Arkenau H.", "AuthorID": "6603300234", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London Cancer Institute"}, "8707082500": {"Name": "Forero-Torres A.", "AuthorID": "8707082500", "AffiliationID": "60027086", "AffiliationName": "University of Alabama"}, "6602897706": {"Name": "Boccia R.", "AuthorID": "6602897706", "AffiliationID": "100440081", "AffiliationName": "Center for Cancer and Blood Disorders"}, "35429349500": {"Name": "Lippman M.", "AuthorID": "35429349500", "AffiliationID": "60021519", "AffiliationName": "University of Miami Miller School of Medicine"}, "6507642372": {"Name": "Somer R.", "AuthorID": "6507642372", "AffiliationID": "60017662", "AffiliationName": "Cooper Hospital University Medical Center"}, "24777350200": {"Name": "Smakal M.", "AuthorID": "24777350200", "AffiliationID": "116887809", "AffiliationName": "Nemocnice Horovice"}, "6602099911": {"Name": "Emens L.", "AuthorID": "6602099911", "AffiliationID": "60001117", "AffiliationName": "The John Hopkins University School of Medicine"}, "6505896590": {"Name": "Hrinczenko B.", "AuthorID": "6505896590", "AffiliationID": "60031707", "AffiliationName": "Michigan State University"}, "57201723458": {"Name": "Edenfield W.", "AuthorID": "57201723458", "AffiliationID": "60026333", "AffiliationName": "Greenville Hospital System"}, "8680827900": {"Name": "Gurtler J.", "AuthorID": "8680827900", "AffiliationID": "113521563", "AffiliationName": "Metairie Oncologist LLC"}, "55663817900": {"Name": "von Heydebreck A.", "AuthorID": "55663817900", "AffiliationID": "60018366", "AffiliationName": "Merck KGaA"}, "7005717177": {"Name": "Grote H.", "AuthorID": "7005717177", "AffiliationID": "60018366", "AffiliationName": "Merck KGaA"}, "57191651548": {"Name": "Chin K.", "AuthorID": "57191651548", "AffiliationID": "112797121", "AffiliationName": "EMD Serono"}, "36992109000": {"Name": "Hamilton E.", "AuthorID": "36992109000", "AffiliationID": "60015281", "AffiliationName": "Sarah Cannon Research Institute"}}}
