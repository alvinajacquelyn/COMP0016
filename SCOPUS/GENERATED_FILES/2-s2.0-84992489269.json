To achieve this, a sample of 329 mothers and one father completed the Behavioral Pediatrics Feeding Assessment Scale (BPFAS) and the Child Food Neophobia Scale (CFNS). A Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis indicated that both measures were able to successfully differentiate a known clinical sample from those of typically developing population. Although the BPFAS was more accurate at differentiating ARFID from the general population, the CFNS was acceptable and on some metrics better than its longer counterpart. The ability of a food neophobia scale to differentiate clinical and population samples, and detect gradation of food avoidance within the population sample, suggests that the multitude of psychometric measures available may be measuring similar constructs. Therefore, confidence can be expected in cross-site comparisons despite each using different psychometric measures of food avoidance in children.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder", "Childhood", "Clinical"], "IndexKeywords": ["Child", "Eating", "Feeding and Eating Disorders", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Mass Screening", "Psychometrics"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84992489269", "SubjectAreas": [["Clinical Psychology", "PSYC", "3203"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"8775322000": {"Name": "Dovey T.M.", "AuthorID": "8775322000", "AffiliationID": "60020623", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Environment, Health & Societies, Department of Life Sciences, Marie Jahoda Building, Brunel University London"}, "25923781700": {"Name": "Aldridge V.K.", "AuthorID": "25923781700", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "35230204800": {"Name": "Martin C.I.", "AuthorID": "35230204800", "AffiliationID": "116224341", "AffiliationName": "Midlands Psychology"}, "7004315183": {"Name": "Wilken M.", "AuthorID": "7004315183", "AffiliationID": "113775904", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Pediatric Feeding Tube Management and Weaning"}, "7403586865": {"Name": "Meyer C.", "AuthorID": "7403586865", "AffiliationID": "60101776", "AffiliationName": "Coventry and Warwickshire Partnership NHS Trust"}}}
