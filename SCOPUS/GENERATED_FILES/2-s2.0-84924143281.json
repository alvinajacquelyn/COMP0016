The incidence of CAD, however, is rising rapidly in Asia. In this review, we systematically discuss publications that compare CAD biomarkers between Asians and Caucasians in the general population. A PubMed search yielded 5,570 hits, containing 59 articles describing 47 unique cohorts that directly compare Asians with Caucasians. Ten biomarkers were taken into account for this review: total cholesterol; triglycerides; high-density lipoprotein cholesterol; low-density lipoprotein cholesterol; C-reactive protein; glucose; insulin; glycated hemoglobin; fibrinogen; and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1. Triglycerides were 1.13-fold higher in South Asians than in Caucasians, and insulin levels were 1.33-fold higher. In Japanese and Chinese subjects, lower C-reactive protein levels were reported: 0.52 and 0.36-fold, respectively. Ethnicity-specific prognostic measures of CAD biomarkers were rarely reported. CAD biomarker levels differ between Asians and Caucasians and among Asian ethnic groups in population-based cohorts. The ethnicity-specific prognostic value of CAD biomarkers is yet to be determined.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Asia, Western", "Asian Continental Ancestry Group", "Biomarkers", "Blood Coagulation Factors", "Blood Glucose", "C-Reactive Protein", "Cohort Studies", "Coronary Artery Disease", "Europe", "European Continental Ancestry Group", "Female", "Humans", "Lipid Metabolism", "Male", "Prevalence", "Transients and Migrants"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84924143281", "SubjectAreas": [["Epidemiology", "MEDI", "2713"], ["Community and Home Care", "NURS", "2905"], ["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"55879300600": {"Name": "Gijsberts C.", "AuthorID": "55879300600", "AffiliationID": "60002794", "AffiliationName": "ICIN-Netherlands Heart Institute"}, "14071039800": {"Name": "den Ruijter H.", "AuthorID": "14071039800", "AffiliationID": "60032724", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Experimental Cardiology, University Medical Centre Utrecht"}, "7003654548": {"Name": "de Kleijn D.", "AuthorID": "7003654548", "AffiliationID": "60017161", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery, National University Singapore"}, "6602179811": {"Name": "Hoefer I.", "AuthorID": "6602179811", "AffiliationID": "60032724", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Experimental Cardiology, University Medical Centre Utrecht"}, "7006736234": {"Name": "Asselbergs F.", "AuthorID": "7006736234", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular Science, Population Health Sciences, University College London"}, "23388249600": {"Name": "Chan M.", "AuthorID": "23388249600", "AffiliationID": "60106366, 60017161", "AffiliationName": "Cardiovascular Research Institute, National University Heart Centre Singapore, National University Health System"}}}
