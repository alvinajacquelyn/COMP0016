In some case reports of atypical SCID patients elevated proportions of \u03b3\u03b4 T lymphocytes have been reported. However, it is unknown whether these \u03b3\u03b4 T cells modulate or reflect the patient's clinical phenotype. We investigated the frequency of elevated \u03b3\u03b4 T cell proportions and associations with clinical disease manifestations in a cohort of 76 atypical SCID patients. Increased proportions of \u03b3\u03b4 T lymphocytes were present in approximately 60% of these patients. Furthermore, we identified positive correlations between elevated proportions of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells and the occurrence of CMV infections and autoimmune cytopenias. We discuss that CMV infections might trigger an expansion of \u03b3\u03b4 T lymphocytes, which could drive the development of autoimmune cytopenias. We advocate that atypical SCID patients should be screened for elevated proportions of \u03b3\u03b4 T lymphocytes, CMV infection and autoimmune cytopenias.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Atypical SCID", "Autoimmune cytopenia", "CMV infection", "Lymphopenia", "Viral infection", "\u03b3\u03b4 T lymphocytes"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cytomegalovirus Infections", "Hematologic Diseases", "Humans", "Intraepithelial Lymphocytes", "Lymphocyte Count", "Severe Combined Immunodeficiency"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85062236926", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"]], "AuthorData": {"57207115231": {"Name": "Tometten I.", "AuthorID": "57207115231", "AffiliationID": "60025641", "AffiliationName": "Center for Chronic Immunodeficiency, Medical Center, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg"}, "6506655327": {"Name": "Speckmann C.", "AuthorID": "6506655327", "AffiliationID": "60025641", "AffiliationName": "Center for Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Medical Center, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg"}, "7003630355": {"Name": "Ehl S.", "AuthorID": "7003630355", "AffiliationID": "60025641", "AffiliationName": "Center for Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Medical Center, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg"}, "8930316100": {"Name": "Rohr J.C.", "AuthorID": "8930316100", "AffiliationID": "60025641", "AffiliationName": "Center for Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Medical Center, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg"}, "14045136000": {"Name": "Felgentreff K.", "AuthorID": "14045136000", "AffiliationID": "60010586", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Ulm University"}, "22834943300": {"Name": "H\u00f6nig M.", "AuthorID": "22834943300", "AffiliationID": "60010586", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Ulm University"}, "23995006800": {"Name": "Hauck F.", "AuthorID": "23995006800", "AffiliationID": "60000291, 60028717", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatrics, Dr. von Hauner Children's Hospital, University Hospital, LMU"}, "8908705500": {"Name": "Albert M.H.", "AuthorID": "8908705500", "AffiliationID": "60000291, 60028717", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatrics, Dr. von Hauner Children's Hospital, University Hospital, LMU"}, "55151991100": {"Name": "Niehues T.", "AuthorID": "55151991100", "AffiliationID": "112937622", "AffiliationName": "HELIOS Children's Hospital Krefeld, Pediatric Immunology and Rheumatology"}, "57207110451": {"Name": "Perez R.", "AuthorID": "57207110451", "AffiliationID": "112937622", "AffiliationName": "HELIOS Children's Hospital Krefeld, Pediatric Immunology and Rheumatology"}, "55444405400": {"Name": "Ghosh S.", "AuthorID": "55444405400", "AffiliationID": "60025310", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatric Oncology, Hematology and Clinical Immunology, Medical Faculty, Center of Child and Adolescent Health, Heinrich-Heine-University"}, "7101616884": {"Name": "Picard C.", "AuthorID": "7101616884", "AffiliationID": "60123804, 60123796, 60000905", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Lymphocyte Activation and Susceptibility to EBV Infection, INSERM UMR 1163, Imagine Institute, University Paris Descartes Sorbonne Paris Cit\u00e9"}, "55400994700": {"Name": "Stary J.", "AuthorID": "55400994700", "AffiliationID": "60023469, 60016605", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Charles University and University Hospital Motol"}, "6602573130": {"Name": "Formankova R.", "AuthorID": "6602573130", "AffiliationID": "60023469, 60016605", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Charles University and University Hospital Motol"}, "12786401200": {"Name": "Worth A.", "AuthorID": "12786401200", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital NHS Trust"}, "7006078464": {"Name": "Gilmour K.", "AuthorID": "7006078464", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital NHS Trust"}, "55923378300": {"Name": "Soler-Palac\u00edn P.", "AuthorID": "55923378300", "AffiliationID": "119345399", "AffiliationName": "Jeffrey Model Foundation Excellence Center"}, "57023982600": {"Name": "Garc\u00eda-Prat M.", "AuthorID": "57023982600", "AffiliationID": "119345399", "AffiliationName": "Jeffrey Model Foundation Excellence Center"}, "7004747877": {"Name": "Allende L.M.", "AuthorID": "7004747877", "AffiliationID": "60004024", "AffiliationName": "Immunology Department, Hospital Universitario 12 de Octubre, Research Institute (i+12).
