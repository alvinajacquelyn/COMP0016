Mineral wool waste and waste glass recycled from building construction and demolition (C&D) process were used as major raw materials. In the meanwhile, calcium carbonate (CaCO3), borax (Na2B4O7\u00b710H2O) and sodium phosphate (Na3PO4\u00b712H2O) were added as extra additives, which played the part of foamer, fluxing agent and foam stabilizer, respectively. The effects of different content of each additives and different sintering temperature on the properties of foam glass were investigated. Bulk density, cross-section view and microstructure of the specimens were showed. The experiment results showed that the optimal content of raw materials and additives was 40 wt% mineral wool waste, 60 wt% waste glass, 20 wt% borax, 1\u20132 wt% calcium carbonate and 2 wt% sodium phosphate, and its optimal sintering temperature was 800 \u00b0C. The specimen sintered at this optimal condition had the most uniform foam structure and low bulk density of 0.7 g/cm3. Finally, EnergyPlusTM was used to evaluate the benefit of applying this new foam glass on the reduction on space conditioning loads, especially in relatively colder zones.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Foam glass", "Mineral wool waste", "Solid waste", "Thermal insulation material", "Waste glass"], "IndexKeywords": ["Building construction", "Foam glass", "Optimal conditions", "Optimal sintering", "Sintering temperatures", "Space conditioning", "Thermal insulation materials", "Waste glass"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85064896614", "SubjectAreas": [["Civil and Structural Engineering", "ENGI", "2205"], ["Building and Construction", "ENGI", "2215"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"]], "AuthorData": {"57205480160": {"Name": "Ji R.", "AuthorID": "57205480160", "AffiliationID": "60018273", "AffiliationName": "School of Civil and Resource Engineering, University of Science and Technology Beijing"}, "57205222313": {"Name": "Zheng Y.", "AuthorID": "57205222313", "AffiliationID": "60018273", "AffiliationName": "School of Civil and Resource Engineering, University of Science and Technology Beijing"}, "57205218490": {"Name": "Zou Z.", "AuthorID": "57205218490", "AffiliationID": "60018273", "AffiliationName": "School of Civil and Resource Engineering, University of Science and Technology Beijing"}, "57208499274": {"Name": "Jin X.", "AuthorID": "57208499274", "AffiliationID": "60018273", "AffiliationName": "School of Civil and Resource Engineering, University of Science and Technology Beijing"}, "57201212643": {"Name": "Chen Z.", "AuthorID": "57201212643", "AffiliationID": "60014966", "AffiliationName": "Department of Energy and Resources Engineering, College of Engineering, Peking University"}, "55504215000": {"Name": "Wei S.", "AuthorID": "55504215000", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "The Bartlett School of Construction and Project Management, University College London (UCL)"}, "56183809200": {"Name": "Zhang M.", "AuthorID": "56183809200", "AffiliationID": "60018273", "AffiliationName": "School of Metallurgical and Ecological Engineering, University of Science and Technology Beijing"}}}
