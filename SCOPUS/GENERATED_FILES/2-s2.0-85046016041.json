Such formulation, however, is prone to high-frequency aliasing. The aim of this study was to reduce such errors using an alternative dipole kernel formulation based on the discrete Fourier transform and discrete operators. Methods: The impact of such an approach on forward model calculation and susceptibility inversion was evaluated in contrast to the continuous formulation both with synthetic phantoms and in vivo MRI data. Results: The discrete kernel demonstrated systematically better fits to analytic field solutions, and showed less over-oscillations and aliasing artifacts while preserving low- and medium-frequency responses relative to those obtained with the continuous kernel. In the context of QSM estimation, the use of the proposed discrete kernel resulted in error reduction and increased sharpness. Conclusion: This proof-of-concept study demonstrated that discretizing the dipole kernel is advantageous for QSM. The impact on small or narrow structures such as the venous vasculature might by particularly relevant to high-resolution QSM applications with ultra-high field MRI \u2013 a topic for future investigations. The proposed dipole kernel has a straightforward implementation to existing QSM routines.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Forward model", "Inverse problem", "Iron mapping", "Magnetic susceptibility", "MRI phase", "Ultra-high field MRI", "Venography"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Algorithms", "Artifacts", "Brain", "Female", "Finite Element Analysis", "Fourier Analysis", "Humans", "Image Processing, Computer-Assisted", "Magnetic Resonance Angiography", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Mathematical Computing", "Phantoms, Imaging", "Phlebography", "Whole Body Imaging"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85046016041", "SubjectAreas": [["Biophysics", "BIOC", "1304"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"], ["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"55751317800": {"Name": "Milovic C.", "AuthorID": "55751317800", "AffiliationID": "60029681", "AffiliationName": "Biomedical Imaging Center, Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile"}, "56498464900": {"Name": "Pinto J.", "AuthorID": "56498464900", "AffiliationID": "60029681", "AffiliationName": "Biomedical Imaging Center, Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile"}, "6506111269": {"Name": "Tejos C.", "AuthorID": "6506111269", "AffiliationID": "60029681", "AffiliationName": "Biomedical Imaging Center, Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile"}, "6507041142": {"Name": "Andia M.", "AuthorID": "6507041142", "AffiliationID": "60029681", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, School of Medicine, Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile"}, "55122312100": {"Name": "Uribe S.", "AuthorID": "55122312100", "AffiliationID": "60029681", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, School of Medicine, Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile"}, "8235719600": {"Name": "Acosta-Cabronero J.", "AuthorID": "8235719600", "AffiliationID": "60103674", "AffiliationName": "German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE)"}, "57193311339": {"Name": "Mattern H.", "AuthorID": "57193311339", "AffiliationID": "60018362", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomedical Magnetic Resonance, Institute of Experimental Physics, Otto von Guericke-University"}}}
