Both tissue-specific resident populations and infiltrating myeloid cells can cause tissue injury through aberrant activation and/or dysregulated activity. Reliable identification and quantification of myeloid cells within diseased tissues is important to understand pathological inflammatory processes. Flow cytometry is a valuable technique for leukocyte analysis, but a standardized flow cytometric method for myeloid cell populations in the eye is lacking. Here, we validate a reproducible flow cytometry gating approach to characterize myeloid cells in several commonly used models of ocular inflammation. We profile and quantify myeloid subsets across these models, and highlight the value of this strategy in identifying phenotypic differences using Ccr2-deficient mice. This method will aid standardization in the field and facilitate future investigations into the roles of myeloid cells during ocular inflammation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Choroidal neovascularization", "Endotoxin-induced uveitis", "Experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis", "Flow cytometry", "Monocytes", "Myeloid cells", "Neutrophils", "Retinal microglia"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Autoimmune Diseases", "Cell Count", "Disease Models, Animal", "Flow Cytometry", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Myeloid Cells", "Retinal Pigment Epithelium", "Retinitis", "Uveitis"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84984796653", "SubjectAreas": [["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"], ["Sensory Systems", "NEUR", "2809"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"]], "AuthorData": {"14022959200": {"Name": "Liyanage S.E.", "AuthorID": "14022959200", "AffiliationID": "60013148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "36981692900": {"Name": "Gardner P.J.", "AuthorID": "36981692900", "AffiliationID": "60013148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "56522353400": {"Name": "Ribeiro J.", "AuthorID": "56522353400", "AffiliationID": "60013148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "36702437000": {"Name": "Cristante E.", "AuthorID": "36702437000", "AffiliationID": "60013148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "56318714600": {"Name": "Sampson R.D.", "AuthorID": "56318714600", "AffiliationID": "60013148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "9532683500": {"Name": "Luhmann U.F.O.", "AuthorID": "9532683500", "AffiliationID": "60008201", "AffiliationName": "Roche Pharmaceutical Research and Early Development, Ophthalmology Discovery & Biomarkers, Roche Innovation Center Basel, F.
