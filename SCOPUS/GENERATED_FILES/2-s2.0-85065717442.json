BYL719 (BYL) is a PI3K\u03b1-selective small molecule inhibitor and a prospective drug for advanced solid tumors. We investigated whether acute pharmacological inhibition of PI3K\u03b1 has pro-arrhythmic effects. Methods & Results: In isolated wild-type (WT) cardiomyocytes, pharmacological inhibition of PI3K\u03b1 (BYL719) increased contractility by 28%, Ca2+ release by 20%, and prolonged action potential (AP) repolarization by 10\u201315%. These effects of BYL719 were abolished by inhibition of reverse-mode Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCX) (KB-R7943) or by inhibition of late Na+ current (INa-L) (ranolazine). BYL719 had no effect on PI3K\u03b1-deficient cardiomyocytes, suggesting BYL719 effects were PI3K\u03b1-dependent and mediated via NCX and INa-L. INa-L was suppressed by activation of PI3K\u03b1, application of exogenous intracellular PIP3, or ranolazine. Investigation of AP and Ca2+ release in whole heart preparations using epicardial optical mapping showed that inhibition of PI3K\u03b1 similarly led to prolongation of AP and enhancement of Ca2+ release. In hearts of PI3K\u03b1-deficient mice, \u03b2-adrenergic stimulation in the presence of high Ca2+ concentrations and 12-Hz burst pacing led to delayed afterdepolarizations and ventricular fibrillation. In vivo, administration of BYL719 prolonged QT interval [QTcF (Fridericia) increased by 15%] in WT, but not in PI3K\u03b1-deficient mice. Conclusions: Pharmacological inhibition of PI3K\u03b1 is arrhythmogenic due to activation of INa-L leading to increased sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ load and prolonged QT interval. Monitoring the arrhythmogenic potential of PI3K\u03b1 inhibition in patients receiving PI3K inhibitors is an important PI3K\u03b1 inhibition.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Adrenergic stimulation", "Afterdepolarization", "Arrhythmias", "Long QT", "PI3K\u03b1"], "IndexKeywords": ["Action Potentials", "Animals", "Arrhythmias, Cardiac", "Calcium", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Myocytes, Cardiac", "Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases", "Sodium", "Sodium Channel Blockers", "Sodium-Calcium Exchanger", "Thiazoles"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85065717442", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"6506196125": {"Name": "Zhabyeyev P.", "AuthorID": "6506196125", "AffiliationID": "60030835, 60111305", "AffiliationName": "Mazankowski Alberta Heart Institute, University of Alberta"}, "55327834700": {"Name": "McLean B.", "AuthorID": "55327834700", "AffiliationID": "60030835, 60111305", "AffiliationName": "Mazankowski Alberta Heart Institute, University of Alberta"}, "56507591600": {"Name": "Chen X.", "AuthorID": "56507591600", "AffiliationID": "60030835, 60111305", "AffiliationName": "Mazankowski Alberta Heart Institute, University of Alberta"}, "6603892354": {"Name": "Oudit G.Y.", "AuthorID": "6603892354", "AffiliationID": "60030835, 60111305", "AffiliationName": "Mazankowski Alberta Heart Institute, University of Alberta"}, "7004331309": {"Name": "Vanhaesebroeck B.", "AuthorID": "7004331309", "AffiliationID": "60109234", "AffiliationName": "UCL Cancer Institute"}}}
