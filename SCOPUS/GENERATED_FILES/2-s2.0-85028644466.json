Aim: To systematically review the current literature on the surgical management of penile fracture, focusing on etiology, diagnosis, functional outcomes, and postoperative complications. Methods: The present review was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) declaration standards for systematic reviews. A systematic search for the terms penile fracture, fracture of penis, trauma of penis, rupture of corpora cavernosa, and immediate management of penile fracture was been carried out in the PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane, SCOPUS, and Science Citation Index databases. Main Outcome Measures: Etiology of penile fracture, clinical presentation, types of radiologic investigations and their accuracy, surgical approach, suture material used for tunica repair, timing of surgical exploration, intraoperative findings, surgical complications, and functional outcomes. Results: The total number of patients analyzed was 438, and the patients' an average age was 36 years. The most frequent reported cause of penile fracture was sexual intercourse (80% of cases). The most common finding at examination was a penile hematoma (97.5%). Although operator dependent, in experienced hands, ultrasonography was found to be a useful tool in confirming the location of the albuginea tear and identifying the presence of any concomitant urethral injury, helping the surgeon to choose the best surgical approach. Early surgical repair of a penile fracture was found to be a safe procedure, although long-term complications are not uncommon. Tertiary referral centers that managed a larger number of cases seemed to obtain more satisfactory long-term results with a significantly smaller number of complications. Conclusion: A low incidence of postoperative complications and full satisfactory functional outcomes are reported when early repair is performed in high-volume centers.
