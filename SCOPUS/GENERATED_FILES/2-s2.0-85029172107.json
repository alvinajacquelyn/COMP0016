For a given power budget, we design the precoded symbols subject to the CE constraints, such that the constructive effect of the multiuser interference is maximized. While the objective function for the original problem is not complex differentiable, we consider the smooth approximation of its real representation, and map it onto a Riemannian manifold. By using the Riemmanian conjugate gradient algorithm, a local minimizer can be efficiently found. The complexity of the algorithm is analytically derived in terms of floating-points operations (flops) per iteration. Simulations show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the conventional methods on both symbol error rate and computational complexity.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Constant envelope", "manifold optimization", "massive multi-input multi-output (mMIMO)", "multiuser multi-input single-output (MU-MISO) downlink"], "IndexKeywords": ["Complexity theory", "Constant envelope", "MU-MISO downlink", "Precoding", "Signal processing algorithms"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85029172107", "SubjectAreas": [["Signal Processing", "COMP", "1711"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"57211818673": {"Name": "Liu F.", "AuthorID": "57211818673", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "23467624400": {"Name": "Sun H.", "AuthorID": "23467624400", "AffiliationID": "60016835", "AffiliationName": "School of Information and Electronics, Beijing Institute of Technology"}, "23009493900": {"Name": "Masouros C.", "AuthorID": "23009493900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "56703112800": {"Name": "Amadori P.", "AuthorID": "56703112800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}}}
