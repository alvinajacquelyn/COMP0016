Clinical applications of diffusion imaging have grown exponentially over the past couple of decades in many neurological and neurodegenerative diseases, such as multiple sclerosis (MS). For several reasons, MS has been extensively researched using advanced neuroimaging techniques, which makes it an \u2018example disease\u2019 to illustrate the potential of diffusion imaging for clinical applications. In addition, MS pathology is characterized by several key processes competing with each other, such as inflammation, demyelination, remyelination, gliosis and axonal loss, enabling the specificity of diffusion to be challenged. In this review, we describe how diffusion imaging can be exploited to investigate micro-, meso- and macro-scale properties of the brain structure and discuss how they are affected by different pathological substrates. Conclusions from the literature are that larger studies are needed to confirm the exciting results from initial investigations before current trends in diffusion imaging can be translated to the neurology clinic. Also, for a comprehensive understanding of pathological processes, it is essential to take a multiple-level approach, in which information at the micro-, meso- and macroscopic scales is fully integrated.", "AuthorKeywords": ["diffusion MRI", "functional system", "graph theory", "microstructure", "multiple sclerosis", "structural connectome", "tissue model", "tractography"], "IndexKeywords": ["Diffusion mris", "Functional systems", "Multiple sclerosis", "structural connectome", "Tissue modeling", "Tractography", "Brain", "Diffusion Tensor Imaging", "Humans", "Multiple Sclerosis", "Nerve Net"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85040709208", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Medicine", "BIOC", "1313"], ["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"], ["Spectroscopy", "CHEM", "1607"]], "AuthorData": {"6603813790": {"Name": "Cercignani M.", "AuthorID": "6603813790", "AffiliationID": "60014416", "AffiliationName": "Neuroimaging Laboratory, Santa Lucia Foundation"}, "6602501665": {"Name": "Gandini Wheeler-Kingshott C.", "AuthorID": "6602501665", "AffiliationID": "60083543", "AffiliationName": "Brain MRI 3T Mondino Research Center, C.
