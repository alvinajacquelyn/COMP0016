Interventional MRI (iMRI) can serve as a reference for non-rigid registration based propagation of preoperative MRI. Structural MRI images exhibit spatially varying intensity relationships,which can be captured by a local similarity measure such as the local normalized correlation coefficient (LNCC). However,LNCC weights local neighborhoods using a static spatial kernel and includes voxels from beyond a tissue or resection boundary in a neighborhood centered inside the boundary. We modify LNCC to use locally adaptive weighting inspired by bilateral filtering and evaluate it extensively in a numerical phantom study,a clinical iMRI study and a segmentation propagation study. The modified measure enables increased registration accuracy near tissue and resection boundaries.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Neurosurgery", "Non-rigid registration", "Similarity measure"], "IndexKeywords": ["Bilateral filtering", "Image guided neuro surgeries", "Local normalized correlations", "Local similarity measure", "Nonrigid registration", "Registration accuracy", "Segmentation propagation", "Similarity measure"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84996559735", "SubjectAreas": [["Theoretical Computer Science", "MATH", "2614"], ["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"]], "AuthorData": {"56340716500": {"Name": "Kochan M.", "AuthorID": "56340716500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Image Computing, University College London"}, "24376919100": {"Name": "Modat M.", "AuthorID": "24376919100", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dementia Research Centre, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "23010613000": {"Name": "Vercauteren T.", "AuthorID": "23010613000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Image Computing, University College London"}, "35189849800": {"Name": "White M.", "AuthorID": "35189849800", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, UCLH NHS Foundation Trust"}, "6602233595": {"Name": "Ourselin S.", "AuthorID": "6602233595", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dementia Research Centre, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "57203105770": {"Name": "Stoyanov D.", "AuthorID": "57203105770", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Image Computing, University College London"}, "35722647600": {"Name": "Mancini L.", "AuthorID": "35722647600", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, UCLH NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57204026204": {"Name": "McEvoy A.W.", "AuthorID": "57204026204", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, UCLH NHS Foundation Trust"}, "35316314600": {"Name": "Thornton J.S.", "AuthorID": "35316314600", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, UCLH NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7006486284": {"Name": "Yousry T.", "AuthorID": "7006486284", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, UCLH NHS Foundation Trust"}, "24172309000": {"Name": "Winston G.P.", "AuthorID": "24172309000", "AffiliationID": "60030943", "AffiliationName": "Epilepsy Society MRI Unit"}, "7401893026": {"Name": "Duncan J.S.", "AuthorID": "7401893026", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Experimental Epilepsy, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}}}
