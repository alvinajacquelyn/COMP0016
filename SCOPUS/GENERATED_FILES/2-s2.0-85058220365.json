Such biases are thought to arise, in part, from a comparison between features of one's own self-image and those of another agent, a process known as \u2018bodily resonance\u2019. Recent data have demonstrated that implicit bias can be remarkably plastic, being modulated by brief immersive virtual reality experiences that place participants in a virtual body with features of an out-group member. Here, we provide a mechanistic account of bodily resonance and implicit bias in terms of a putative self-image network that encodes associations between different features of an agent. When subsequently perceiving another agent, the output of this self-image network is proportional to the overlap between their respective features, providing an index of bodily resonance. By combining the self-image network with a drift diffusion model of decision making, we simulate performance on the implicit association test (IAT) and show that the model captures the ubiquitous implicit bias towards in-group members. We subsequently demonstrate that this implicit bias can be modulated by a simulated illusory body ownership experience, consistent with empirical data; and that the magnitude and plasticity of implicit bias correlates with self-esteem. Hence, we provide a simple mechanistic account of bodily resonance and implicit bias which could contribute to the development of interventions for reducing the negative evaluation of social out-groups.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Embodiment", "Implicit association test", "Implicit bias", "Neural network model", "Self-image", "Virtual reality"], "IndexKeywords": ["Association", "Body Image", "Brain", "Humans", "Models, Neurological", "Neurons", "Prejudice", "Self Concept"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85058220365", "SubjectAreas": [["Experimental and Cognitive Psychology", "PSYC", "3205"], ["Language and Linguistics", "ARTS", "1203"], ["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"], ["Linguistics and Language", "SOCI", "3310"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"]], "AuthorData": {"57200112399": {"Name": "Bedder R.L.", "AuthorID": "57200112399", "AffiliationID": "60122566", "AffiliationName": "Max Planck UCL Centre for Computational Psychiatry and Ageing Research"}, "56273570100": {"Name": "Bush D.", "AuthorID": "56273570100", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology"}, "23767252700": {"Name": "Burgess N.", "AuthorID": "23767252700", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology"}, "35190013200": {"Name": "Banakou D.", "AuthorID": "35190013200", "AffiliationID": "60001576", "AffiliationName": "University of Barcelona, Event Lab, Department of Clinical Psychology and Psychobiology"}, "7202932472": {"Name": "Slater M.", "AuthorID": "7202932472", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL, Department of Computer Science"}, "24329980700": {"Name": "Peck T.", "AuthorID": "24329980700", "AffiliationID": "121795714", "AffiliationName": "Mathematics and Computer Science Department"}}}
