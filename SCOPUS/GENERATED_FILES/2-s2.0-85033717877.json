In this paper, we propose an effective NMR quantum state reconstruction method based on CS. Different from the conventional CS-based quantum state reconstruction, our method uses the actual observation data from NMR experiments rather than the data measured by the Pauli operators. We implement measurements on quantum states in practical NMR computing experiments and reconstruct states of two, three, and four qubits using fewer number of measurement settings, respectively. The proposed method is easy to implement and performs more efficiently with the increase of the system dimension size. The performance reveals both efficiency and accuracy, which provides an alternative for the quantum state reconstruction in practical NMR.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Compressive sensing", "Computing Experiments", "NMR experiments", "NMR quantum computing", "Nuclear magnetic resonance(NMR)", "Observation data", "Quantum state reconstruction", "System dimension"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85033717877", "SubjectAreas": [["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"]], "AuthorData": {"57189029345": {"Name": "Yang J.", "AuthorID": "57189029345", "AffiliationID": "60019118", "AffiliationName": "Department of Automation, University of Science and Technology of China"}, "7005067661": {"Name": "Cong S.", "AuthorID": "7005067661", "AffiliationID": "60019118", "AffiliationName": "Department of Automation, University of Science and Technology of China"}, "57196324444": {"Name": "Liu X.", "AuthorID": "57196324444", "AffiliationID": "60019118", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of Science and Technology of China"}, "56075393400": {"Name": "Li Z.", "AuthorID": "56075393400", "AffiliationID": "60019118", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of Science and Technology of China"}, "55488020900": {"Name": "Li K.", "AuthorID": "55488020900", "AffiliationID": "60015879, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "Imperial College London, MRC Institute of Medical Sciences"}}}
