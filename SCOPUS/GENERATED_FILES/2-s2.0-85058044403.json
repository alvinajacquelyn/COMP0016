According to one view, this occurs for the last item in a sequentially presented list (last-item benefit). According to a second view, this occurs when items are externally cued during the retention interval (retro-cue benefit). We investigated both phenomena at the same time to determine whether both result from the same cognitive mechanisms. If that were the case, retro-cue benefits should be reduced when the retro-cue is directed to the item that already benefits from being presented last. We measured speed-accuracy-tradeoff functions with the response-deadline paradigm to measure retrieval dynamics in a short-term recognition task. Across three experiments, we found that retro-cues benefited the last item and other items to the same extent. The additivity of the last-item benefit and the retro-cue benefit points towards the co-existence of at least two distinct forms of attentional prioritization in working memory.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Attention", "Focus of attention", "Hierarchical-Bayes", "Recency", "Retro-cue", "Speed-accuracy trade-off", "Working memory"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Attention", "Cues", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Memory, Short-Term", "Psychomotor Performance", "Reading", "Recognition, Psychology", "Signal Detection, Psychological", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85058044403", "SubjectAreas": [["Experimental and Cognitive Psychology", "PSYC", "3205"], ["Language and Linguistics", "ARTS", "1203"], ["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"], ["Linguistics and Language", "SOCI", "3310"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"]], "AuthorData": {"56208932500": {"Name": "Niklaus M.", "AuthorID": "56208932500", "AffiliationID": "60012614", "AffiliationName": "University of Zurich"}, "46161708800": {"Name": "Singmann H.", "AuthorID": "46161708800", "AffiliationID": "60012614", "AffiliationName": "University of Zurich"}, "7003393216": {"Name": "Oberauer K.", "AuthorID": "7003393216", "AffiliationID": "60012614", "AffiliationName": "University of Zurich"}}}
