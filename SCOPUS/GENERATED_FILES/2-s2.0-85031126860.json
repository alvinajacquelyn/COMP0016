The need for this statement has arisen from the recognition that while technical competence can be rapidly acquired, in practice the performance of a high-quality examination is variable, with an unacceptably high rate of failure to diagnose cancer at endoscopy. The importance of detecting early neoplasia has taken on greater significance in this era of minimally invasive, organ-preserving endoscopic therapy. In this position statement we describe 38 recommendations to improve diagnostic endoscopy quality. Our goal is to emphasise practices that encourage mucosal inspection and lesion recognition, with the aim of optimising the early diagnosis of upper gastrointestinal disease and improving patient outcomes.", "AuthorKeywords": ["early upper gastro-intestinal cancer", "key performance indicators", "OGD", "quality"], "IndexKeywords": ["Barrett Esophagus", "Celiac Disease", "Checklist", "Clinical Competence", "Endoscopy, Digestive System", "Gastrointestinal Diseases", "Gastrointestinal Neoplasms", "Humans", "Informed Consent", "Patient Safety", "Patient Selection", "Precancerous Conditions"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85031126860", "SubjectAreas": [["Gastroenterology", "MEDI", "2715"]], "AuthorData": {"56677496600": {"Name": "Beg S.", "AuthorID": "56677496600", "AffiliationID": "60015138, 60172935, 60030816", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gastroenterology, NIHR Nottingham Digestive Diseases Biomedical Research Centre, Queens Medical Centre, Nottingham University, Hospitals NHS Trust"}, "6603107719": {"Name": "Ragunath K.", "AuthorID": "6603107719", "AffiliationID": "60015138, 60172935, 60030816", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gastroenterology, NIHR Nottingham Digestive Diseases Biomedical Research Centre, Queens Medical Centre, Nottingham University, Hospitals NHS Trust"}, "57196031101": {"Name": "Wyman A.", "AuthorID": "57196031101", "AffiliationID": "60024453", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery, Sheffield Teaching Hospitals"}, "7102259849": {"Name": "Banks M.", "AuthorID": "7102259849", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gastroenterology, University College, 0London Hospitals"}, "6602603949": {"Name": "Trudgill N.", "AuthorID": "6602603949", "AffiliationID": "60025471", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gastroenterology, Sandwell General Hospital"}, "57210718851": {"Name": "Pritchard M.D.", "AuthorID": "57210718851", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cellular and Molecular Physiology, Institute of Translational Medicine, University of Liverpool"}, "7102618898": {"Name": "Riley S.", "AuthorID": "7102618898", "AffiliationID": "60024453", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gastroenterology, Sheffield Teaching Hospitals"}, "56137363700": {"Name": "Anderson J.", "AuthorID": "56137363700", "AffiliationID": "60019573", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gastroenterology, Gloucestershire Hospitals, NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57190301935": {"Name": "Griffiths H.", "AuthorID": "57190301935", "AffiliationID": "60171195", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gastroenterology, Wye Valley NHS Trust"}, "8289974500": {"Name": "Bhandari P.", "AuthorID": "8289974500", "AffiliationID": "60030999", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gastroenterology, Queen Alexandra Hospital"}, "12767174700": {"Name": "Kaye P.", "AuthorID": "12767174700", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "Department of Histopathology, Nottingham University, Hospitals NHS Trust"}, "36762023000": {"Name": "Veitch A.", "AuthorID": "36762023000", "AffiliationID": "60020708", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gastroenterology, New Cross Hospital"}}}
