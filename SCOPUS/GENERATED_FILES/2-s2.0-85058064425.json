Current single-cell genomic methods only provide a transcriptional \u2018snapshot\u2019 of individual cells. The real-time analysis and perturbation of living cells would generate a step change in single-cell analysis. Here we describe minimally invasive nanotweezers that can be spatially controlled to extract samples from living cells with single-molecule precision. They consist of two closely spaced electrodes with gaps as small as 10\u201320 nm, which can be used for the dielectrophoretic trapping of DNA and proteins. Aside from trapping single molecules, we also extract nucleic acids for gene expression analysis from living cells without affecting their viability. Finally, we report on the trapping and extraction of a single mitochondrion. This work bridges the gap between single-molecule/organelle manipulation and cell biology and can ultimately enable a better understanding of living cells.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Dielectrophoretic trapping", "Dynamic behaviours", "Gene expression analysis", "Minimally invasive", "Multicellular systems", "Real time analysis", "Singlecell analysis", "Spatial organization", "Animals", "Axons", "Biopsy", "Cell Line, Tumor", "Cell Nucleus", "DNA", "Electricity", "Electrodes", "Fluorescence", "Humans", "Mice", "Mitochondria", "Nanotechnology", "Optical Tweezers", "RNA, Messenger", "Single-Cell Analysis", "Solutions"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85058064425", "SubjectAreas": [["Bioengineering", "CENG", "1502"], ["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"55382393200": {"Name": "Nadappuram B.P.", "AuthorID": "55382393200", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Imperial College London"}, "57196041715": {"Name": "Cadinu P.", "AuthorID": "57196041715", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Imperial College London"}, "57191285235": {"Name": "Ainscough A.J.", "AuthorID": "57191285235", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Experimental Medicine and Toxicology, Imperial College London"}, "57220917376": {"Name": "Kang M.", "AuthorID": "57220917376", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Imperial College London"}, "57198175480": {"Name": "Gonzalez-Garcia J.", "AuthorID": "57198175480", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Imperial College London"}, "7004364473": {"Name": "Willison K.R.", "AuthorID": "7004364473", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Imperial College London"}, "55554174800": {"Name": "Vilar R.", "AuthorID": "55554174800", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Imperial College London"}, "36144012000": {"Name": "Ivanov A.P.", "AuthorID": "36144012000", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Imperial College London"}, "7005079107": {"Name": "Edel J.B.", "AuthorID": "7005079107", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Imperial College London"}, "56108510600": {"Name": "Barik A.", "AuthorID": "56108510600", "AffiliationID": "60029445", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Minnesota"}, "55005509600": {"Name": "Oh S.H.", "AuthorID": "55005509600", "AffiliationID": "60029445", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Minnesota"}, "6603087792": {"Name": "Wojciak-Stothard B.", "AuthorID": "6603087792", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Experimental Medicine and Toxicology, Imperial College London"}, "35889193800": {"Name": "Devine M.J.", "AuthorID": "35889193800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology, University College London"}, "7102315993": {"Name": "Kittler J.T.", "AuthorID": "7102315993", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology, University College London"}, "15047515100": {"Name": "Actis P.", "AuthorID": "15047515100", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "School of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, Pollard Institute, University of Leeds"}}}
