Method: Textural analysis (TA) using a filtration\u2212histogram technique of T2-weighted pre- and 6-week post-chemoradiotherapy MRI was undertaken using TexRAD, a proprietary software algorithm. Regions of interest enclosing the largest cross-sectional area of the tumour were manually delineated on the axial images and the filtration step extracted features at different anatomical scales (fine, medium and coarse) followed by quantification of statistical features [mean intensity, standard deviation, entropy, skewness, kurtosis and mean of positive pixels (MPP)] using histogram analysis. Cox multiple regression analysis determined which univariate features including textural, radiological and histological independently predicted overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS). Results: MPP [fine texture, hazard ratio (HR) 6.9, 95% CI: 2.43\u201319.55, P < 0.001], mean (medium texture, HR 5.6, 95% CI: 1.4\u201321.7, P = 0.007) and extramural venous invasion (EMVI) on MRI (HR 2.96, 95% CI: 1.04\u20138.37, P = 0.041) independently predicted OS while mean (medium texture, HR 4.53, 95% CI: 1.58\u201312.94, P = 0.003), MPP (fine texture, HR 3.36, 95% CI: 1.36\u20138.31, P = 0.008) and threatened circumferential resection margin (CRM) on MRI (HR 3.1, 95% CI: 1.01\u20139.46, P = 0.046) predicted DFS. For OS, EMVI on MRI (HR 4.23, 95% CI: 1.41\u201312.69, P = 0.01) and for DFS kurtosis (medium texture, HR 3.97, 95% CI: 1.44\u201310.94, P = 0.007) and CRM involvement on MRI (HR 3.36, 95% CI: 1.21\u20139.32, P = 0.02) were the independent post-treatment factors. Only TA independently predicted RFS on pre- or post-treatment analyses. Conclusion: MR based TA of rectal cancers can predict outcome before undergoing surgery and could potentially select patients for individualized therapy.", "AuthorKeywords": ["imaging biomarker", "MRI", "neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy", "rectal cancer", "Textural analysis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Biomarkers, Tumor", "Chemoradiotherapy", "Disease-Free Survival", "Female", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Predictive Value of Tests", "Proportional Hazards Models", "Rectal Neoplasms", "Rectum", "Regression Analysis", "Retrospective Studies", "Time Factors", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85017012301", "SubjectAreas": [["Gastroenterology", "MEDI", "2715"]], "AuthorData": {"36982877400": {"Name": "Jalil O.", "AuthorID": "36982877400", "AffiliationID": "60171758", "AffiliationName": "Colchester University Hospital"}, "7103409605": {"Name": "Boone D.", "AuthorID": "7103409605", "AffiliationID": "60171758", "AffiliationName": "Colchester University Hospital"}, "55914703000": {"Name": "Sizer B.", "AuthorID": "55914703000", "AffiliationID": "60171758", "AffiliationName": "Colchester University Hospital"}, "6603445884": {"Name": "Arulampalam T.", "AuthorID": "6603445884", "AffiliationID": "60171758", "AffiliationName": "Colchester University Hospital"}, "38662206500": {"Name": "Afaq A.", "AuthorID": "38662206500", "AffiliationID": "60090043, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Nuclear Medicine, University College London"}, "8556612100": {"Name": "Ganeshan B.", "AuthorID": "8556612100", "AffiliationID": "60090043, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Nuclear Medicine, University College London"}, "23027243700": {"Name": "Endozo R.", "AuthorID": "23027243700", "AffiliationID": "60090043, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Nuclear Medicine, University College London"}, "7004435019": {"Name": "Groves A.", "AuthorID": "7004435019", "AffiliationID": "60090043, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Nuclear Medicine, University College London"}, "23991063100": {"Name": "Patel U.B.", "AuthorID": "23991063100", "AffiliationID": "60007904", "AffiliationName": "London North-West NHS Trust"}}}
