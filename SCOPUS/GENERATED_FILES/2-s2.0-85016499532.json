In this brief overview, we summarise what we consider to be the state-of-the-art of attachment research, focusing primarily on the nature and significance of attachment in infancy and early childhood. We review 4 major topics that are central issues in the scientific literature on attachment: (1) the role of the environment in the development of attachment, (2) the intergenerational transmission of patterns of attachment, (3) the stability of attachment patterns through early adulthood, and (4) the role of attachment in adjustment and maladjustment. We conclude by highlighting several critical unresolved issues and priorities for future research.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85016499532", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychology (all)", "PSYC", "3200"]], "AuthorData": {"57192924582": {"Name": "Fearon R.M.P.", "AuthorID": "57192924582", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London"}, "6602728149": {"Name": "Roisman G.I.", "AuthorID": "6602728149", "AffiliationID": "60029445", "AffiliationName": "University of Minnesota"}}}
