The Authors. Laboratory measurements of seismic moduli and attenuation in antigorite serpentinite at a confining pressure of 200 MPa and temperatures up to 550 \u00b0C provide new results relevant to the interpretation of geophysical data in subduction zones. A polycrystalline antigorite specimen was tested via forced oscillations at small strain amplitudes and seismic frequencies (millihertz to hertz). The shear modulus has a temperature sensitivity, \u2202G/\u2202T, averaging \u22120.017 GPa/K. Increasing temperature above 500 \u00b0C results in more intensive shear attenuation (Q \u22121 G ) and associated modulus dispersion, with Q \u22121 G increasing monotonically with increasing oscillation period and temperature. This \u201cbackground\u201d relaxation is adequately captured by a Burgers model for viscoelasticity and possibly results from intergranular mechanisms. Attenuation is higher in antigorite (log 10 Q \u22121 G \u2248 -1.5 at 550 \u00b0C and 0.01 Hz) than in olivine (log 10 Q \u22121 G \u00ab \u22122.0 below 800\u25e6C), but such contrast does not appear to be strong enough to allow robust identification of antigorite from seismic models of attenuation only.", "AuthorKeywords": ["antigorite serpentinite", "seismic attenuation", "seismic velocity", "subduction zones", "viscoelastic relaxation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Seismic attenuation", "Seismic velocities", "Serpentinite", "Subduction zones", "Viscoelastic relaxation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85061918476", "SubjectAreas": [["Geophysics", "EART", "1908"], ["Earth and Planetary Sciences (all)", "EART", "1900"]], "AuthorData": {"25645681200": {"Name": "David E.", "AuthorID": "25645681200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, University College London"}, "25924737100": {"Name": "Brantut N.", "AuthorID": "25924737100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, University College London"}, "55435492600": {"Name": "Hansen L.", "AuthorID": "55435492600", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, University of Oxford"}, "35601563500": {"Name": "Jackson I.", "AuthorID": "35601563500", "AffiliationID": "60008950", "AffiliationName": "Research School of Earth Sciences, Australian National University"}}}
