Methods: RCTs that compared either acupuncture with no/sham (placebo) acupuncture or a certain therapy with acupuncture added in the treatment of PCOS were included in the review. Measures of treatment effectiveness were the pooled odds ratios (OR) for women with PCOS having acupuncture compared with women in the control group for the recovery of menstrual cycles, standardized mean difference (SMD) for body mass index (BMI), fasting insulin (FINS), fasting plasma glucose (FPG), luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), and the ratio of LH/FSH. Results: A total of nine RCTs (531 women) met criteria for inclusion into the systematic review. Using the random effects model, pooling of the effect estimates from all RCTs showed recovery of menstrual cycles (OR = 0.20, 95% CI: 0.09-0.41, P < 0.01), BMI (SMD = -0.63, 95% CI: -1.04 to -0.21, P = 0.04), and LH (SMD = -0.39, 95% CI: -0.65 to -0.12, P < 0.01) which favored the acupuncture group. No significant differences were observed for FINS, FPG, FSH and the ratio of LH/FSH between acupuncture and control groups (P > 0.05). Conclusions: Acupuncture appears to significantly improve the recovery of the menstrual cycles and decrease the levels of BMI and LH in women with PCOS. However, the findings should be interpreted with caution due to the limited methodological quality of included RCTs.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Acupuncture", "Menstrual cycle", "Meta-analysis", "Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)", "Systematic review"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84962549917", "SubjectAreas": [["Complementary and Alternative Medicine", "MEDI", "2707"]], "AuthorData": {"15030323000": {"Name": "Qu F.", "AuthorID": "15030323000", "AffiliationID": "60003970", "AffiliationName": "Women's Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University"}, "56060685100": {"Name": "Wu Y.", "AuthorID": "56060685100", "AffiliationID": "60003970", "AffiliationName": "Women's Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University"}, "55740424100": {"Name": "Wang F.F.", "AuthorID": "55740424100", "AffiliationID": "60003970", "AffiliationName": "Women's Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University"}, "7401627425": {"Name": "Ye Y.H.", "AuthorID": "7401627425", "AffiliationID": "60003970", "AffiliationName": "Women's Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University"}, "55957749900": {"Name": "Hu X.Y.", "AuthorID": "55957749900", "AffiliationID": "60031237", "AffiliationName": "School of Health and Social Care, London South Bank University"}, "7201402374": {"Name": "Robinson N.", "AuthorID": "7201402374", "AffiliationID": "60031237", "AffiliationName": "School of Health and Social Care, London South Bank University"}, "24368170900": {"Name": "Barry J.A.", "AuthorID": "24368170900", "AffiliationID": "60029950", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Women's Health, University College London Medical School"}, "7004362582": {"Name": "Hardiman P.J.", "AuthorID": "7004362582", "AffiliationID": "60029950", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Women's Health, University College London Medical School"}, "7405549870": {"Name": "Zhou J.", "AuthorID": "7405549870", "AffiliationID": "60012581", "AffiliationName": "College of Food Science and Biotechnology, Zhejiang Gongshang University"}, "55863548900": {"Name": "Zhang R.", "AuthorID": "55863548900", "AffiliationID": "60014966", "AffiliationName": "Neuroscience Research Institute and Department of Neurobiology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Peking University"}, "7405943870": {"Name": "Han S.P.", "AuthorID": "7405943870", "AffiliationID": "60014966", "AffiliationName": "Neuroscience Research Institute and Department of Neurobiology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Peking University"}, "7406440802": {"Name": "Han J.S.", "AuthorID": "7406440802", "AffiliationID": "60014966", "AffiliationName": "Neuroscience Research Institute and Department of Neurobiology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Peking University"}, "57030959000": {"Name": "Li R.", "AuthorID": "57030959000", "AffiliationID": "60121975", "AffiliationName": "Peking University Third Hospital"}, "6504049283": {"Name": "Taw M.B.", "AuthorID": "6504049283", "AffiliationID": "60005247, 60027550", "AffiliationName": "UCLA Center for East-West Medicine - Westlake Village, UCLA Department of Medicine, David Geffen School of Medicine, UCLA"}}}
