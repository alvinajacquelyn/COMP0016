Here, we hypothesised that this abnormality could relate to a more general deficit in pre-attentive error/deviant detection in patients with dystonia. We therefore tested patients with dystonia and healthy subjects using a mismatch negativity paradigm (MMN), where evoked potentials generated in response to a standard repeated stimulus are subtracted from the responses to a rare \u201codd ball\u201d stimulus. Methods: We assessed MMN for somatosensory and auditory stimuli in patients with cervical dystonia and healthy age matched controls. Results: We found a significant group \u2217 oddball type interaction effect (F (1, 34) = 4.5, p = 0.04, \u03c1I = 0.63). A follow up independent t-test for sMMN data, showed a smaller sMMN amplitude in dystonic patients compared to controls (mean difference control-dystonia: \u22121.0 \u00b5V \u00b1 0.3, p < 0.00, t = \u22123.1). However the amplitude of aMMN did not differ between groups (mean difference control-dystonia: \u22120.2 \u00b5V \u00b1 0.2, p = 0.24, t = \u22121.2). We found a positive correlation between somatosensory MMN and somatosensory temporal discrimination threshold. Conclusion: These results suggest that pre-attentive error/deviant detection, specifically in the somatosensory domain, is abnormal in dystonia. This could underlie some previously reported electrophysiological and psychophysical abnormalities of somatosensory integration in dystonia. Significance: One could hypothesize a deficit in pre-conscious orientation towards potentially salient signals might lead to a more conservative threshold for decision-making in dystonia.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Dystonia", "Mismatch negativity (MMN)", "Somatosensory integration"], "IndexKeywords": ["Acoustic Stimulation", "Aged", "Attention", "Auditory Cortex", "Auditory Perception", "Electroencephalography", "Evoked Potentials, Auditory", "Evoked Potentials, Somatosensory", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Physical Stimulation", "Reaction Time", "Torticollis", "Touch Perception"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85049740256", "SubjectAreas": [["Sensory Systems", "NEUR", "2809"], ["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Physiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2737"]], "AuthorData": {"35722502400": {"Name": "Macerollo A.", "AuthorID": "35722502400", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Sobell Department of Motor Neuroscience and Movement Disorders, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "6507878404": {"Name": "Sadnicka A.", "AuthorID": "6507878404", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Sobell Department of Motor Neuroscience and Movement Disorders, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "55337637000": {"Name": "Korlipara P.", "AuthorID": "55337637000", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Sobell Department of Motor Neuroscience and Movement Disorders, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "25958636400": {"Name": "Bhatia K.", "AuthorID": "25958636400", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Sobell Department of Motor Neuroscience and Movement Disorders, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "55455767400": {"Name": "Rothwell J.C.", "AuthorID": "55455767400", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Sobell Department of Motor Neuroscience and Movement Disorders, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "55983101800": {"Name": "Chen J.C.", "AuthorID": "55983101800", "AffiliationID": "60006988", "AffiliationName": "School of Medicine, China Medical University"}, "57202906864": {"Name": "Lu M.K.", "AuthorID": "57202906864", "AffiliationID": "60006988", "AffiliationName": "School of Medicine, China Medical University"}, "8067346700": {"Name": "Tsai C.H.", "AuthorID": "8067346700", "AffiliationID": "60006988", "AffiliationName": "School of Medicine, China Medical University"}, "55251354800": {"Name": "Edwards M.J.", "AuthorID": "55251354800", "AffiliationID": "60029329", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular and Clinical Sciences, St George's University of London"}}}
