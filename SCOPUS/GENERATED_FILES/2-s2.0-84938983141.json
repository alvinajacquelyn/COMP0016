Methods: Since November 2009, we have used a protocol to treat RCSE including intravenous KE in all patients referred to the Neurology Unit of the Meyer Children's Hospital. Results: From November 2009 to February 2015, 13 children (7 females; age: 2 months-11 years and 5 months) received KE. Eight patients were treated once, two were treated twice, and the remaining three were treated 3 times during different RCSE episodes, for a total of 19 treatments. Most of the RCSE episodes were generalized (14/19). A malformation of cortical development was the most frequent etiology (4/13 children). Ketamine was administered from a minimum of 22 h to a maximum of 17 days, at doses ranging from 7 to 60 mcg/kg/min, obtaining a resolution of the RCSE in 14/19 episodes. Five patients received KE in lieu of conventional anesthetics, thus, avoiding endotracheal intubation. Ketamine was effective in 4 of them. Suppression-burst pattern was observed after the initial bolus of 3 mg/kg in the majority of the responder RCSE episodes (10/14). Conclusions: Ketamine is effective in treating RCSE and represents a practical alternative to conventional anesthetics for the treatment of RCSE. Its use avoids the pitfalls and dangers of endotracheal intubation, which is known to worsen RCSE prognosis.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Children", "Conventional anesthetics", "Endotracheal intubation", "Ketamine", "Refractory status epilepticus", "Status epilepticus"], "IndexKeywords": ["Administration, Intravenous", "Anesthetics, Dissociative", "Cerebral Cortex", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Clinical Protocols", "Critical Care", "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug", "Electroencephalography", "Epilepsy, Generalized", "Female", "Humans", "Infant", "Intubation, Intratracheal", "Ketamine", "Male", "Recurrence", "Salivation", "Status Epilepticus"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84938983141", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Behavioral Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2802"]], "AuthorData": {"55532064000": {"Name": "Ilvento L.", "AuthorID": "55532064000", "AffiliationID": "60073284, 60021859", "AffiliationName": "Pediatric Neurology Unit, Children's Hospital A.
