All rights reserved.A significant amount of myocardial damage during a myocardial infarction (MI) occurs during the reperfusion stage, termed ischaemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury, and accounts for up to 50% of total infarcted tissue post-MI. During the reperfusion phase, a complex interplay of multiple pathways and mechanisms is activated, which ultimately leads to cell death, primarily through apoptosis. There is some evidence from a lupus mouse model that lupus IgG, specifically the antiphospholipid (aPL) antibody subset, is pathogenic in mesenteric I/R injury. Furthermore, it has previously been shown that the immunodominant epitope for the majority of circulating pathogenic aPLs resides in the N-terminal domain I (DI) of beta-2 glycoprotein I (\u03b22GPI). This study describes the enhanced pathogenic effect of purified IgG derived from patients with lupus and/or the antiphospholipid syndrome in a cardiomyocyte H/R in vitro model. Furthermore, we have demonstrated a pathogenic role for aPL containing samples, mediated via aPL-\u03b22GPI interactions, resulting in activation of the pro-apoptotic p38 MAPK pathway. This was shown to be inhibited using a recombinant human peptide of domain I of \u03b22GPI in the fluid phase, suggesting that the pathogenic anti-\u03b22GPI antibodies in this in vitro model target this domain.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Animals", "Antibodies, Antiphospholipid", "Apoptosis", "beta 2-Glycoprotein I", "Cell Hypoxia", "Disease Models, Animal", "Humans", "Immunoglobulin G", "Male", "Mice", "Middle Aged", "Myocardial Infarction", "Myocytes, Cardiac", "p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases", "Rats", "Reperfusion Injury"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85031300041", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"], ["Cancer Research", "BIOC", "1306"]], "AuthorData": {"57078339300": {"Name": "Bourke L.T.", "AuthorID": "57078339300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Arthritis Research UK Centre for Adolescent Rheumatology, University College London, Rayne Building"}, "56042622600": {"Name": "McDonnell T.", "AuthorID": "56042622600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Rheumatology, Division of Medicine University College London, Rayne Institute"}, "15766296400": {"Name": "Pericleous C.", "AuthorID": "15766296400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Rheumatology, Division of Medicine University College London, Rayne Institute"}, "8504949600": {"Name": "Ripoll V.M.", "AuthorID": "8504949600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Rheumatology, Division of Medicine University College London, Rayne Institute"}, "57216022963": {"Name": "Giles I.", "AuthorID": "57216022963", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Rheumatology, Division of Medicine University College London, Rayne Institute"}, "57212819228": {"Name": "Rahman A.", "AuthorID": "57212819228", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Rheumatology, Division of Medicine University College London, Rayne Institute"}, "7003289700": {"Name": "Ioannou Y.", "AuthorID": "7003289700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Arthritis Research UK Centre for Adolescent Rheumatology, University College London, Rayne Building"}, "57197554021": {"Name": "McCormick J.", "AuthorID": "57197554021", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148, 60018207", "AffiliationName": "Biochemistry Research Group, Clinical and Molecular Genetics Unit, Institute of Child Health, Great Ormond Street Hospital, University College London"}, "35446138900": {"Name": "Stephanou A.", "AuthorID": "35446138900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Medical and Molecular Biology Unit, University College London"}}}
