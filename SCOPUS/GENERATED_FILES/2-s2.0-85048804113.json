Recent research indicates that individual and shared music-making in family settings contributes to positive parenting practices and identity development in young children. Children who participate in shared music-making at age 3 are better prepared for school experiences at age 5. These findings suggest music should be a compulsory requirement in any early childhood programme. This article reports the findings of a case study investigation of the provision of music in an Australian Early Childhood Education Centre. Findings suggest that music provision is best supported when there is a high value for music amongst staff, there is a range of value-added as well as integrated uses of music, and there is sustained music professional development for all staff.", "AuthorKeywords": ["early childhood education", "music development", "music early learning", "music participation", "provision"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85048804113", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["Music", "ARTS", "1210"]], "AuthorData": {"26033874000": {"Name": "Barrett M.S.", "AuthorID": "26033874000", "AffiliationID": "60031004", "AffiliationName": "The University of Queensland"}, "57023348700": {"Name": "Flynn L.M.", "AuthorID": "57023348700", "AffiliationID": "60031004", "AffiliationName": "The University of Queensland"}, "7102907357": {"Name": "Welch G.F.", "AuthorID": "7102907357", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Education"}}}
