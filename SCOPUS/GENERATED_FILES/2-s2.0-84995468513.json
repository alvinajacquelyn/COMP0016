Research has focused on severe adverse consequences influenced by contextual variables. However, the literature on community level factors influencing substance use behaviors is relatively limited across Europe so far. Objective: We capitalized on data from a National survey, exploring individual and contextual characteristics, to study adverse consequences among people with substance use disorders. Methods: The impact of area-level deprivation on nonfatal overdose, hepatitis C or B infections, and major involvement with the criminal justice system, was explored. Logistic regression models with cluster-robust errors, modeling subject-level and area-level effects, were used. Results: Living in deprived and intermediate areas, as compared with affluent ones, was associated with greater likelihood of both nonfatal overdose and jail sentences longer than 6 months, though not of active viral hepatitis. Conclusions: Area-level deprivation may play an important role in determining adverse consequences in people with substance use disorders, also after controlling for individual-level characteristics. More research is needed to understand the aspects of social and physical environments that matter for drug outcomes before effective policy and research interventions can be developed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["hepatitis", "overdose", "prison", "socioeconomic status", "Substance use disorder"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Crime", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Drug Overdose", "Female", "Hepatitis B", "Hepatitis C", "Humans", "Italy", "Logistic Models", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Poverty Areas", "Risk Factors", "Socioeconomic Factors", "Substance-Related Disorders", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84995468513", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (miscellaneous)", "MEDI", "2701"], ["Health (social science)", "SOCI", "3306"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"7003818736": {"Name": "Carr\u00e0 G.", "AuthorID": "7003818736", "AffiliationID": "60012306", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine and Surgery, University of Milano Bicocca"}, "55634683100": {"Name": "Crocamo C.", "AuthorID": "55634683100", "AffiliationID": "60015197", "AffiliationName": "Department of Public Health, Experimental and Forensic Medicine, University of Pavia"}, "56291753300": {"Name": "Tabacchi T.", "AuthorID": "56291753300", "AffiliationID": "60012306", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine and Surgery, University of Milano Bicocca"}, "55249556900": {"Name": "Bartoli F.", "AuthorID": "55249556900", "AffiliationID": "60012306", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine and Surgery, University of Milano Bicocca"}, "56926906800": {"Name": "Clerici M.", "AuthorID": "56926906800", "AffiliationID": "60012306", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine and Surgery, University of Milano Bicocca"}, "56653776400": {"Name": "Borrelli P.", "AuthorID": "56653776400", "AffiliationID": "60015197", "AffiliationName": "Department of Public Health, Experimental and Forensic Medicine, University of Pavia"}, "55987923500": {"Name": "Popa I.", "AuthorID": "55987923500", "AffiliationID": "60015197", "AffiliationName": "Department of Public Health, Experimental and Forensic Medicine, University of Pavia"}, "6603687469": {"Name": "Montomoli C.", "AuthorID": "6603687469", "AffiliationID": "60015197", "AffiliationName": "Department of Public Health, Experimental and Forensic Medicine, University of Pavia"}}}
