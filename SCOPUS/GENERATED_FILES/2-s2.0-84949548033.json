All rights reserved.A novel \"slurry method\" was described for the preparation of proliposome powders using soya phosphatidylcholine (SPC) with cholesterol (1:1) and for incorporation of beclometasone dipropionate (BDP) at 2 mole% of the total lipid phase. Proliposomes made with a range of lipid to sucrose carrier ratios were studied in terms of surface morphology using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and thermal properties using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Following hydration of proliposomes, the resultant vesicles were compared to liposomes made using the traditional proliposome method, in terms of vesicle size and drug entrapment efficiency. SEM showed that sucrose was uniformly coated with lipid regardless of lipid to carrier ratio. Liposomes generated using the slurry proliposome method tended to have smaller median size than those generated with the conventional proliposome method, being in the range of 4.72-5.20 \u03bcm and 5.89-7.72 \u03bcm respectively. Following centrifugation of liposomes using deuterium oxide (D2O) as dispersion medium, vesicles entrapping BDP were separated as a floating creamy layer, whilst the free drug was sedimented as crystals. Drug entrapment was dependent on formulation composition and preparation method. When 1:15 w/w lipid to carrier was used, liposomes generated using the slurry method had an entrapment efficiency of 47.05% compared to 18.67% for those generated using the conventional proliposome method. By contrast, liposomes made by the thin-film hydration method had an entrapment efficiency of 25.66%. DSC studies using 50 mole% BDP demonstrated that the drug was amorphous in the proliposome formulation and tended to crystallize on hydration, resulting in low drug entrapment. In conclusion, a novel approach to the preparation of proliposomes using a slurry method has been introduced, offering higher entrapment for BDP than liposomes made using the conventional proliposome method and those prepared by thin-film hydration technique.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Characterization", "Drug development", "Liposome", "Manufacture", "Proliposome"], "IndexKeywords": ["Beclomethasone", "Chemistry, Pharmaceutical", "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid", "Liposomes", "Microscopy, Electron, Scanning", "Powders", "Prodrugs"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84949548033", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmaceutical Science", "PHAR", "3003"]], "AuthorData": {"56248033300": {"Name": "Khan I.", "AuthorID": "56248033300", "AffiliationID": "60031259", "AffiliationName": "School of Pharmacy and Biomedical Sciences, University of Central Lancashire"}, "56998496100": {"Name": "Yousaf S.", "AuthorID": "56998496100", "AffiliationID": "60031259", "AffiliationName": "School of Pharmacy and Biomedical Sciences, University of Central Lancashire"}, "56998115900": {"Name": "Subramanian S.", "AuthorID": "56998115900", "AffiliationID": "60031259", "AffiliationName": "School of Pharmacy and Biomedical Sciences, University of Central Lancashire"}, "56998672200": {"Name": "Korale O.", "AuthorID": "56998672200", "AffiliationID": "60031259", "AffiliationName": "School of Pharmacy and Biomedical Sciences, University of Central Lancashire"}, "26424574500": {"Name": "Alhnan M.A.", "AuthorID": "26424574500", "AffiliationID": "60031259", "AffiliationName": "School of Pharmacy and Biomedical Sciences, University of Central Lancashire"}, "7103287195": {"Name": "Ahmed W.", "AuthorID": "7103287195", "AffiliationID": "60159791", "AffiliationName": "School of Medicine, University of Central Lancashire"}, "7403523237": {"Name": "Taylor K.M.G.", "AuthorID": "7403523237", "AffiliationID": "60016379, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmaceutics, UCL School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "8691124200": {"Name": "Elhissi A.", "AuthorID": "8691124200", "AffiliationID": "60072749", "AffiliationName": "Pharmaceutical Sciences Section, College of Pharmacy, Qatar University"}}}
