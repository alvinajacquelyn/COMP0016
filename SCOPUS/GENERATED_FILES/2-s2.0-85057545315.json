In addition, the bio-effects caused by the combination of EMFs and graphene nanoparticles (GrNPs) have been also assessed. The AgNPs of three shapes (triangular, spherical and colloidal) and GrNPs were added in high concentrations to the culture of human fibroblasts and exposed to EMF of three different frequencies: 900, 2400 and 7500 MHz. The results demonstrated the dependence of the EMF-induced cytotoxicity on the shape and concentration of AgNPs. The maximal cell killing effect was observed at 900 MHz frequency for NPs of all shapes and concentrations. The highest temperature elevation was observed for GrNPs solution irradiated by EMF of 900 MHz frequency. The exposure to EMF led to significant increase of ROS formation in triangular and colloidal AgNPs solutions. However, no impact of EMF on ROS production was detected for spherical AgNPs. GrNPs demonstrated ROS-protective activity that was dependent on their concentration. Our findings indicate the feasibility to control cytotoxicity of AgNPs by means of EMFs. The effect EMF on the biological activity of AgNPs and GrNPs is reported here for the first time.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Electromagnetic field", "fibroblasts", "graphene", "reactive oxygen species", "silver nanoparticles", "toxicity"], "IndexKeywords": ["Bio-effects", "Cell killing", "Different frequency", "Exposed to", "Highest temperature", "Human fibroblast", "Reactive oxygen species", "Silver nanoparticles (AgNps)", "Electromagnetic Fields", "Fibroblasts", "Graphite", "Humans", "Metal Nanoparticles", "Reactive Oxygen Species", "Silver", "Temperature"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85057545315", "SubjectAreas": [["Biophysics", "BIOC", "1304"], ["Medicine (miscellaneous)", "MEDI", "2701"]], "AuthorData": {"52664234800": {"Name": "Saliev T.", "AuthorID": "52664234800", "AffiliationID": "60104301", "AffiliationName": "National Laboratory Astana, Nazarbayev University"}, "6505537260": {"Name": "Nurgozhin T.", "AuthorID": "6505537260", "AffiliationID": "60108730", "AffiliationName": "Research Institute of Fundamental and Applied Medicine named after B.
