Multi-dimensional screeners and single-domain tests ('short tests') are frequently used as alternatives. However, their validity in these circumstances is unknown. We examined the feasibility, reliability, and concurrent validity of three multi-dimensional screeners (Ages and Stages Questionnaires (ASQ-3), Denver Developmental Screening Test (Denver-II), Battelle Developmental Inventory screener (BDI-2)) and two single-domain tests (MacArthur-Bates Short-Forms (SFI and SFII), WHO Motor Milestones (WHO-Motor)) in 1,311 children 6-42 months in Bogota, Colombia. The scores were compared with those on the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development (Bayley-III), taken as the 'gold standard'. The Bayley-III was given at a center by psychologists; whereas the short tests were administered in the home by interviewers, as in a survey setting. Findings indicated good internal validity of all short tests except the ASQ-3. The BDI-2 took long to administer and was expensive, while the single-domain tests were quickest and cheapest and the Denver-II and ASQ-3 were intermediate. Concurrent validity of the multi-dimensional tests' cognitive, language, and fine motor scales with the corresponding Bayley-III scale was low below 19 months. However, it increased with age, becoming moderate-to-high over 30 months. In contrast, gross motor scales' concurrence was high under 19 months and then decreased. Of the single-domain tests, the WHO-Motor had high validity with gross motor under 16 months, and the SFI and SFII expressive scales showed moderate correlations with language under 30 months. Overall, the Denver-II was the most feasible and valid multi-dimensional test and the ASQ-3 performed poorly under 31 months. By domain, gross motor development had the highest concurrence below 19 months, and language above.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Child Development", "Child, Preschool", "Colombia", "Developing Countries", "Female", "Humans", "Infant", "Language Tests", "Male", "Motor Skills", "Neuropsychological Tests", "Poverty", "Psychometrics", "Psychomotor Performance"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84984838209", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"53878432700": {"Name": "Rubio-Codina M.", "AuthorID": "53878432700", "AffiliationID": "60012327", "AffiliationName": "Centre for the Evaluation of Development Policies, Institute for Fiscal Studies"}, "56652515100": {"Name": "Araujo M.", "AuthorID": "56652515100", "AffiliationID": "60007869", "AffiliationName": "Social Protection and Health Division, Inter-American Development Bank"}, "6603862452": {"Name": "Attanasio O.", "AuthorID": "6603862452", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Economics, University College London"}, "57190966357": {"Name": "Mu\u00f1oz P.", "AuthorID": "57190966357", "AffiliationID": "60032619", "AffiliationName": "\u00c9cole de Psychologie, Universit\u00e9 Laval"}, "7006425695": {"Name": "Grantham-McGregor S.", "AuthorID": "7006425695", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Population Health Sciences, Institute of Child Health, University College London"}}}
