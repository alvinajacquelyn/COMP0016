Mobile games can be effective and motivating tools for the promotion of children's health. In our earlier work, we proposed a novel approach for designing computer games aimed at educating children with diabetes. In this article, we apply our game design to a mobile Android game (Mario Brothers). We also introduce four heuristics that are specifically designed for evaluating the mobile game, by adapting traditional usability heuristics. Results of a pilot study (n = 12) to evaluate gameplay over 1-week showed that the children found the game engaging and improved their knowledge of healthy diet and lifestyle.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Child", "Diabetes Mellitus", "Exercise", "Female", "Health Education", "Healthy Diet", "Heuristics", "Humans", "Male", "Mobile Applications", "New Zealand", "Pilot Projects", "Software Design", "Video Games"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84987923237", "SubjectAreas": [["Health (social science)", "SOCI", "3306"], ["Rehabilitation", "MEDI", "2742"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"14020983900": {"Name": "Baghaei N.", "AuthorID": "14020983900", "AffiliationID": "60025045", "AffiliationName": "Unitec Institute of Technology"}, "36461476000": {"Name": "Nandigam D.", "AuthorID": "36461476000", "AffiliationID": "60025045", "AffiliationName": "Unitec Institute of Technology"}, "36878137000": {"Name": "Casey J.", "AuthorID": "36878137000", "AffiliationID": "60025045", "AffiliationName": "Unitec Institute of Technology"}, "56119506800": {"Name": "DIreito A.", "AuthorID": "56119506800", "AffiliationID": "60005686", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health Innovation, University of Auckland"}, "8552158500": {"Name": "Maddison R.", "AuthorID": "8552158500", "AffiliationID": "60084853, 60018805", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Physical Activity and Nutrition, Deakin University Geelong"}}}
