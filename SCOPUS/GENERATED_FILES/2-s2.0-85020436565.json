Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Exosomes and microvesicles (EMVs) are lipid bilayer-enclosed structures released from cells and participate in cell-to-cell communication via transport of biological molecules. EMVs play important roles in various pathologies, including cancer and neurodegeneration. The regulation of EMV biogenesis is thus of great importance and novel ways for manipulating their release from cells have recently been highlighted. One of the pathways involved in EMV shedding is driven by peptidylarginine deiminase (PAD) mediated post-translational protein deimination, which is calcium-dependent and affects cytoskeletal rearrangement amongst other things. Increased PAD expression is observed in various cancers and neurodegeneration and may contribute to increased EMV shedding and disease progression. Here, we review the roles of PADs and EMVs in cancer and neurodegeneration.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cancer", "Chlor-amidine (Cl-Am)", "Cytoskeleton", "Deimination", "Epigenetics", "Exosomes", "Extracellular vesicles (EVs)", "Histone H3", "Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs)", "Microvesicles (MVs)", "Neurodegeneration", "Peptidylarginine deiminases (PADs)"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Cell-Derived Microparticles", "Central Nervous System", "Cytoskeleton", "Enzyme Inhibitors", "Epigenesis, Genetic", "Exosomes", "Extracellular Vesicles", "Histones", "Humans", "Neoplasms", "Neurodegenerative Diseases", "Neuroprotective Agents", "Protein Binding", "Protein Processing, Post-Translational", "Protein-Arginine Deiminases"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85020436565", "SubjectAreas": [["Catalysis", "CENG", "1503"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Spectroscopy", "CHEM", "1607"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"], ["Organic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1605"], ["Inorganic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1604"]], "AuthorData": {"7202237069": {"Name": "Lange S.", "AuthorID": "7202237069", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "57194498069": {"Name": "Gallagher M.", "AuthorID": "57194498069", "AffiliationID": "60002826", "AffiliationName": "Cellular and Molecular Immunology Research Centre, School of Human Sciences, London Metropolitan University"}, "55695790900": {"Name": "Kosgodage U.S.", "AuthorID": "55695790900", "AffiliationID": "60002826", "AffiliationName": "Cellular and Molecular Immunology Research Centre, School of Human Sciences, London Metropolitan University"}, "6701580410": {"Name": "Inal J.M.", "AuthorID": "6701580410", "AffiliationID": "60002826", "AffiliationName": "Cellular and Molecular Immunology Research Centre, School of Human Sciences, London Metropolitan University"}, "36157976600": {"Name": "Kholia S.", "AuthorID": "36157976600", "AffiliationID": "60012259", "AffiliationName": "Molecular Biotechnology Center, Department of Medical Sciences, University of Turin"}, "22937760400": {"Name": "Hristova M.", "AuthorID": "22937760400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Women\u2019s Health, University College London"}, "56210513900": {"Name": "Hardy J.", "AuthorID": "56210513900", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Reta LilaWeston Research Laboratories, Department of Molecular Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology"}}}
