We describe a novel method of hardness sensing that does not require accurate control of contact conditions. A GelSight sensor is a tactile sensor that provides high resolution tactile images, which enables a robot to infer object properties such as geometry and fine texture, as well as contact force and slip conditions. The sensor is pressed on silicone samples by a human or a robot and we measure the sample hardness only with data from the sensor, without a separate force sensor and without precise knowledge of the contact trajectory. We describe the features that show object hardness. For hemispherical objects, we develop a model to measure the sample hardness, and the estimation error is about 4% in the range of 8 Shore 00 to 45 Shore A. With this technology, a robot is able to more easily infer the hardness of the touched objects, thereby improving its object recognition as well as manipulation strategy.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Contact conditions", "Estimation errors", "High resolution", "Manipulation strategy", "Object property", "Slip condition", "Tactile images", "Tactile sensors"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85006489008", "SubjectAreas": [["Control and Systems Engineering", "ENGI", "2207"], ["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition", "COMP", "1707"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"]], "AuthorData": {"56423022900": {"Name": "Yuan W.", "AuthorID": "56423022900", "AffiliationID": "60006320, 60022195", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory(CSAIL), MIT"}, "7203044605": {"Name": "Srinivasan M.", "AuthorID": "7203044605", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL TouchLab, Computer Science Department, UCL"}, "7006021390": {"Name": "Adelson E.", "AuthorID": "7006021390", "AffiliationID": "60006320, 60022195", "AffiliationName": "Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences, CSAIL, MIT"}}}
