In an effort to gain insight into the mechanism and energetic efficiency of these reactions, we investigated Co(salophen)-catalyzed aerobic oxidation of p-hydroquinone. Kinetic and spectroscopic data suggest that the catalyst resting-state consists of an equilibrium between a CoII(salophen) complex, a CoIII-superoxide adduct, and a hydrogen-bonded adduct between the hydroquinone and the CoIII-O2 species. The kinetic data, together with density functional theory computational results, reveal that the turnover-limiting step involves proton-coupled electron transfer from a semi-hydroquinone species and a CoIII-hydroperoxide intermediate. Additional experimental and computational data suggest that a coordinated H2O2 intermediate oxidizes a second equivalent of hydroquinone. Collectively, the results show how Co(salophen) and p-hydroquinone operate synergistically to mediate O2 reduction and generate the reactive p-benzoquinone co-catalyst.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Aerobic oxidations", "Catalyst resting state", "Computational data", "Computational results", "Energetic efficiency", "P-hydroquinones", "Proton coupled electron transfers", "Spectroscopic data"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84964337379", "SubjectAreas": [["Catalysis", "CENG", "1503"], ["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Colloid and Surface Chemistry", "CENG", "1505"]], "AuthorData": {"55004662200": {"Name": "Anson C.W.", "AuthorID": "55004662200", "AffiliationID": "60032179", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Wisconsin - Madison"}, "35575012100": {"Name": "Stahl S.S.", "AuthorID": "35575012100", "AffiliationID": "60032179", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Wisconsin - Madison"}, "57220950529": {"Name": "Ghosh S.", "AuthorID": "57220950529", "AffiliationID": "60000745", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign"}, "7004505104": {"Name": "Hammes-Schiffer S.", "AuthorID": "7004505104", "AffiliationID": "60000745", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign"}}}
