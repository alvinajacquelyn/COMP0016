Its pathophysiology is complex but glial neuronal communication is likely to be disrupted and to impact on oscillatory networks and cortical connectivity. The aim of this study was to use multichannel electroencephalography (EEG) to investigate functional connectivity, as a surrogate for cortical networks, in patients with cirrhosis. Methods: Resting EEGs were recorded in 98 healthy controls and in 264 patients with cirrhosis characterised psychometrically using the Psychometric Hepatic Encephalopathy Score (PHES). Functional connectivity was calculated using the phase-lag index with stratification into standard EEG frequency bands. The findings were validated in a further cohort of 39 healthy controls and 106 patients with cirrhosis. Results: Widespread disruption in functional connectivity was observed in the patients compared with the controls; connectivity was increased in the theta (4\u20138 Hz) band and decreased in the delta (1\u20133.5 Hz), alpha (8.5\u201313 Hz) and beta (13.5\u201326.5 Hz) bands. Changes were apparent even in patients who were psychometrically unimpaired compared with healthy controls viz mean \u00b1 SEM theta 0.107 \u00b1 0.001 vs. 0.103 \u00b1 0.002 (p < 0.05) and alpha 0.139 \u00b1 0.003 vs. 0.154 \u00b1 0.003 (p < 0.01); more pronounced changes were observed with increasing neuropsychometric impairment. The findings were replicated in the second cohort. Conclusions: Cortical networks are disturbed in patients with cirrhosis even in the absence of psychometric impairment. Significance: These findings will facilitate further exploration of the pathophysiology of this condition and provide a robust means for assessing treatment effects in research settings.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cirrhosis", "EEG", "Functional cortical networks", "Hepatic encephalopathy", "Pathophysiology", "Psychometry"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Cerebral Cortex", "Electroencephalography", "Female", "Hepatic Encephalopathy", "Humans", "Liver Cirrhosis", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Nerve Net", "Neuropsychological Tests", "Psychometrics", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85058078288", "SubjectAreas": [["Sensory Systems", "NEUR", "2809"], ["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Physiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2737"]], "AuthorData": {"35293227400": {"Name": "Olesen S.S.", "AuthorID": "35293227400", "AffiliationID": "60015555", "AffiliationName": "Mech-Sense, Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Aalborg University Hospital"}, "42261804200": {"Name": "Gram M.", "AuthorID": "42261804200", "AffiliationID": "60015555", "AffiliationName": "Mech-Sense, Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Aalborg University Hospital"}, "35477645700": {"Name": "Drewes A.M.", "AuthorID": "35477645700", "AffiliationID": "60015555", "AffiliationName": "Mech-Sense, Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Aalborg University Hospital"}, "8076241600": {"Name": "Jackson C.D.", "AuthorID": "8076241600", "AffiliationID": "60032819, 60170516", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurophysiology, Royal Free Hospital, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57190884087": {"Name": "Zacharias H.D.", "AuthorID": "57190884087", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute for Liver & Digestive Health, Division of Medicine, Royal Free Campus, University College London"}, "56765086300": {"Name": "Morgan M.Y.", "AuthorID": "56765086300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute for Liver & Digestive Health, Division of Medicine, Royal Free Campus, University College London"}, "57213664283": {"Name": "Dirks M.", "AuthorID": "57213664283", "AffiliationID": "60024052", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Hannover Medical School"}, "7004209888": {"Name": "Weissenborn K.", "AuthorID": "7004209888", "AffiliationID": "60024052", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Hannover Medical School"}}}
