The analysis draws on Latour\u2019s writings on modes of politicisation to examine the processes and practices that shape contemporary urban governance. It uses the example of diversity planning to examine the \u2018what\u2019 and \u2018how\u2019 of urban politics. It shows that on the one hand diversity is represented in pragmatic, consensual and celebratory terms. Under prevailing conditions of contemporary global capitalism, the \u2018what\u2019 of diversity has been politicised into an agenda for labour market-building and the attraction of \u2018talented\u2019 individuals and foreign investment. However, at the same time this celebratory rhetoric represents part of a wider effort to deflect political attention away from the socially and economically divisive impacts of global models of economic growth and physical development. There is little discussion of the ways in which planning frameworks, the \u2018how\u2019 of diversity policy, are helping to generate new separations in and beyond the city. Moreover, despite claiming that policy is pragmatic and non-ideological, the paper shows how diversity narratives have become an integral part of broader political projects to orientate the city\u2019s economy towards the needs of a relatively small cluster of powerful economic sectors. The paper concludes with reflections on the recent impacts of the vote for Brexit and the election of an openly Muslim London Mayor. It also assesses the broader relevance of a Latourian framework for the analysis of contemporary urban politics.", "AuthorKeywords": ["diversity", "global city", "governance", "planning", "urban policy"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85042144416", "SubjectAreas": [["Environmental Science (miscellaneous)", "ENVI", "2301"], ["Urban Studies", "SOCI", "3322"]], "AuthorData": {"6701820652": {"Name": "Raco M.", "AuthorID": "6701820652", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "37039784300": {"Name": "Kesten J.", "AuthorID": "37039784300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
