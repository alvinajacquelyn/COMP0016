Methods: In this pooled analysis of individual-participant data from three occupational cohort studies (the Finnish Public Sector Study, the British Whitehall II study, and the French GAZEL study), 1088 women and 949 men with diabetes were followed up to determine the duration (number of days) and frequency (number of spells) of work disability. The mean follow-up periods were 3.2 years in the GAZEL study, 4.6 years in the Whitehall II study and 4.7 years in the Finnish Public Sector Study. Psychosocial factors and potential confounding factors were assessed at baseline using standard questionnaires. Study-specific estimates were pooled using fixed-effects meta-analysis. Results: In analysis adjusted for sociodemographic factors, health behaviours and comorbidities, participants with psychological distress had longer (rate ratio 1.66; 95% CI 1.31-2.09) and more frequent absences (rate ratio 1.33; 95% CI 1.19-1.49) compared with those with no psychological distress. Job strain was associated with slightly increased absence frequency (rate ratio 1.19 95% CI 1.05-1.35), but not with absence duration. Living alone and low supervisor support were not associated with absence duration or frequency. We observed no sex differences in these associations. Conclusions: Psychological distress was associated with increased duration and frequency of work disability among employees with diabetes. Job strain was associated with increased absence frequency but not with absence duration.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Absenteeism", "Cohort Studies", "Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)", "Diabetes Complications", "Disabled Persons", "Emotional Adjustment", "Employment", "Family Characteristics", "Female", "Finland", "France", "Health Surveys", "Humans", "Longitudinal Studies", "Male", "Risk Factors", "Self Report", "Single Person", "Social Support", "Stress, Psychological", "United Kingdom", "Workplace"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84955399032", "SubjectAreas": [["Internal Medicine", "MEDI", "2724"], ["Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism", "MEDI", "2712"], ["Endocrinology", "BIOC", "1310"]], "AuthorData": {"23491880900": {"Name": "Ervasti J.", "AuthorID": "23491880900", "AffiliationID": "60010493", "AffiliationName": "Finnish Institute of Occupational Health"}, "7003843149": {"Name": "Pentti J.", "AuthorID": "7003843149", "AffiliationID": "60010493", "AffiliationName": "Finnish Institute of Occupational Health"}, "7003922524": {"Name": "Vahtera J.", "AuthorID": "7003922524", "AffiliationID": "60025765, 60006876", "AffiliationName": "University of Turku and Turku University Hospital"}, "35239241500": {"Name": "Virtanen M.", "AuthorID": "35239241500", "AffiliationID": "60010493", "AffiliationName": "Finnish Institute of Occupational Health"}, "7004391239": {"Name": "Kivim\u00e4ki M.", "AuthorID": "7004391239", "AffiliationID": "60029080, 60002952", "AffiliationName": "Clinicum, Faculty of Medicine, University of Helsinki"}, "7202619429": {"Name": "Head J.", "AuthorID": "7202619429", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "26425858200": {"Name": "Dray-Spira R.", "AuthorID": "26425858200", "AffiliationID": "60001422, 60139056", "AffiliationName": "Sorbonne Universit\u00e9s, UPMC Univ Paris 06"}, "7404395870": {"Name": "Goldberg M.", "AuthorID": "7404395870", "AffiliationID": "60029937", "AffiliationName": "University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines"}, "7005528594": {"Name": "Zins M.", "AuthorID": "7005528594", "AffiliationID": "60029937", "AffiliationName": "University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines"}, "16030844400": {"Name": "Jokela M.", "AuthorID": "16030844400", "AffiliationID": "60002952", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Behavioural Sciences, University of Helsinki"}}}
