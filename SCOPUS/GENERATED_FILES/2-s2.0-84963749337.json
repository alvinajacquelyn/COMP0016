The cornu ammonis area 1 (CA1) of the hippocampus receives gamma frequency inputs from upstream regions (cornu ammonis area 3 and medial entorhinal cortex) and generates itself a faster gamma oscillation. The exact nature and origin of the intrinsic CA1 gamma oscillation is still under debate. Here, we expressed channelrhodopsin-2 under the CaMKII\u03b1 promoter in mice and prepared hippocampal slices to produce a model of intrinsicCA1gammaoscillations. Sinusoidal optical stimulation ofCA1at theta frequency was found to induce robust theta-nested gamma oscillations with a temporal and spatial profile similar to CA1 gamma in vivo. The results suggest the presence of a single gamma rhythm generator with a frequency range of 65\u201375 Hz at 32\u00b0C. Pharmacological analysis found that the oscillations depended on both AMPA and GABAA receptors. Cell-attached and whole-cell recordings revealed that excitatory neuron firing slightly preceded interneuron firing within each gamma cycle, suggesting that this intrinsic CA1 gamma oscillation is generated with a pyramidal\u2013interneuron circuit mechanism.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Circuit", "Hippocampus", "Interneuron", "Mouse", "Network", "Oscillation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "CA1 Region, Hippocampal", "Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinase Type 2", "Entorhinal Cortex", "Excitatory Amino Acid Agonists", "Gamma Rhythm", "In Vitro Techniques", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Mice, Knockout", "Nerve Net", "Neurons", "Optogenetics", "Photic Stimulation", "Promoter Regions, Genetic", "Rhodopsin", "Theta Rhythm"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84963749337", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"]], "AuthorData": {"56325977700": {"Name": "Butler J.", "AuthorID": "56325977700", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physiology, Development and Neuroscience, University of Cambridge, Physiological Laboratory"}, "57188834377": {"Name": "Mendon\u00e7a P.", "AuthorID": "57188834377", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physiology, Development and Neuroscience, University of Cambridge, Physiological Laboratory"}, "56213219800": {"Name": "Robinson H.", "AuthorID": "56213219800", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physiology, Development and Neuroscience, University of Cambridge, Physiological Laboratory"}, "7006225727": {"Name": "Paulsen O.", "AuthorID": "7006225727", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physiology, Development and Neuroscience, University of Cambridge, Physiological Laboratory"}}}
