Developmental Science Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.The \u2018automatic letter-sound integration hypothesis\u2019 (Blomert,) proposes that dyslexia results from a failure to fully integrate letters and speech sounds into automated audio-visual objects. We tested this hypothesis in a sample of English-speaking children with dyslexic difficulties (N = 13) and samples of chronological-age-matched (CA; N = 17) and reading-age-matched controls (RA; N = 17) aged 7\u201313 years. Each child took part in two priming experiments in which speech sounds were preceded by congruent visual letters (congruent condition) or Greek letters (baseline). In a behavioural experiment, responses to speech sounds in the two conditions were compared using reaction times. These data revealed faster reaction times in the congruent condition in all three groups. In a second electrophysiological experiment, responses to speech sounds in the two conditions were compared using event-related potentials (ERPs). These data revealed a significant effect of congruency on (1) the P1 ERP over left frontal electrodes in the CA group and over fronto-central electrodes in the dyslexic group and (2) the P2 ERP in the dyslexic and RA control groups. These findings suggest that our sample of English-speaking children with dyslexic difficulties demonstrate a degree of letter-sound integration that is appropriate for their reading level, which challenges the letter-sound integration hypothesis.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Acoustic Stimulation", "Adolescent", "Case-Control Studies", "Child", "Dyslexia", "Evoked Potentials", "Humans", "Literacy", "Reaction Time", "Speech Perception"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84982834050", "SubjectAreas": [["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"]], "AuthorData": {"13613180500": {"Name": "Nash H.M.", "AuthorID": "13613180500", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, University of Leeds"}, "15831954400": {"Name": "Gooch D.", "AuthorID": "15831954400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychology and Language Sciences, University College"}, "7006105965": {"Name": "Hulme C.", "AuthorID": "7006105965", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychology and Language Sciences, University College"}, "57000454800": {"Name": "Steinmetzger K.", "AuthorID": "57000454800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychology and Language Sciences, University College"}, "35756420400": {"Name": "Mahajan Y.", "AuthorID": "35756420400", "AffiliationID": "60107806, 60017803", "AffiliationName": "The MARCS Institute, University of Western Sydney"}, "7005268526": {"Name": "McArthur G.", "AuthorID": "7005268526", "AffiliationID": "60019544, 60187518", "AffiliationName": "ARC Centre of Excellence in Cognition and its Disorders, Macquarie University"}, "7006347552": {"Name": "Snowling M.J.", "AuthorID": "7006347552", "AffiliationID": "60015166, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "St John's College, University of Oxford"}}}
