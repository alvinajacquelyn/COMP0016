Method Thirty-five doctoral trainee physicians from University College London took part in semistructured interviews in 2015 and 2016. Participants were asked open-ended questions about their career to date, their experiences undertaking a PhD, and their career plans post PhD. The interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed. Thematic analysis was used to generate, review, and define themes from the transcripts. Emerging differences and similarities in participants' reasons for pursuing a PhD were then grouped to produce typologies to explore how their experiences influenced their career decision making. Results Participants described four key reasons for undertaking a PhD, which formed the basis of the four typologies identified. These reasons included the following: to pursue a clinical academic career; to complete an extensive period of research to understand whether a clinical academic career was the desired path forward; to improve clinical career prospects; and to take a break from clinical training. Conclusions These findings highlight the need to target efforts at retaining clinical academic physicians according to their reasons for pursuing a PhD and their subsequent experiences with the process. Those responsible for overseeing clinical training must be well informed of the long-term benefits of training academically qualified physicians. In light of current political uncertainty, universities, hospitals, and external agencies alike must increase their efforts to inspire and assuage early-career clinical academic physicians' fears regarding their academic future.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Academic Medical Centers", "Career Choice", "Decision Making", "Female", "Humans", "Interviews as Topic", "Male", "Qualitative Research", "Risk Factors", "Students, Medical", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85055643495", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"]], "AuthorData": {"56008635900": {"Name": "Ranieri V.", "AuthorID": "56008635900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Academic Careers Office, School of Life and Medical Sciences, Department of Applied Health Research, University College London"}, "7202374409": {"Name": "Rees G.", "AuthorID": "7202374409", "AffiliationID": "114334577", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Life Sciences"}, "56114248400": {"Name": "Barratt H.", "AuthorID": "56114248400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Applied Health Research, University College London"}, "7003777671": {"Name": "Fulop N.", "AuthorID": "7003777671", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Health Care Organization and Management, Department of Applied Health Research, University College London"}}}
