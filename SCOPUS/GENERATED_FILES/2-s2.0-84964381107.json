All rights reserved.Temperature dependent high resolution neutron diffraction studies demonstrate that the sequence and temperatures of the crystallographic phase transitions in NaTaO3 are not impacted by doping with 1% K to form Na0.99K0.01TaO3. Rietveld analysis of the neutron diffraction data shows the structural transitions to be: Pbnm\u2194723Cmcm\u2194803KP4/nbm\u2194893KPm3m. The two orthorhombic polymorphs, Pbnm and Cmcm, differ fundamentally in the distortion and tilting of the octahedra, such that they cannot be obtained from each other via a continuous phase transition resulting in their co-existence between RT and 723 K. Chemical doping, does however, dramatically impact on the amount of the metastable Cmcm phase observed at room temperature.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Crystal structure", "NaTaO3", "Neutron diffraction", "Perovskite", "Phase transitions"], "IndexKeywords": ["Continuous phase transitions", "NaTaO3", "Neutron diffraction data", "Neutron diffraction studies", "Orthorhombic polymorph", "Room temperature polymorphism", "Structural phase transition", "Structural transitions"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84964381107", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Ceramics and Composites", "MATE", "2503"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"], ["Inorganic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1604"], ["Materials Chemistry", "MATE", "2505"]], "AuthorData": {"57056381600": {"Name": "Arulnesan S.W.", "AuthorID": "57056381600", "AffiliationID": "60025709", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, University of Sydney"}, "54792109800": {"Name": "Kayser P.", "AuthorID": "54792109800", "AffiliationID": "60025709", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, University of Sydney"}, "55749015900": {"Name": "Kennedy B.J.", "AuthorID": "55749015900", "AffiliationID": "60025709", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, University of Sydney"}, "7202745497": {"Name": "Knight K.S.", "AuthorID": "7202745497", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, University College London"}}}
