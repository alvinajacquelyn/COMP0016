The American Astronomical Society. All rights reserved.The detection of complex organic molecules (COMs) toward cold sources such as pre-stellar cores (with T < 10 K) has challenged our understanding of the formation processes of COMs in the interstellar medium. Recent modeling on COM chemistry at low temperatures has provided new insight into these processes predicting that COM formation depends strongly on parameters such as visual extinction and the level of CO freeze out. We report deep observations of COMs toward two positions in the L1544 pre-stellar core: the dense, highly extinguished continuum peak with A V \u2265 30 mag within the inner 2700 au; and a low-density shell with average A V \u223c 7.5-8 mag located at 4000 au from the core's center and bright in CH3OH. Our observations show that CH3O, CH3OCH3, and CH3CHO are more abundant (by factors of \u223c2-10) toward the low-density shell than toward the continuum peak. Other COMs such as CH3OCHO, c-C3H2O, HCCCHO, CH2CHCN, and HCCNC show slight enhancements (by factors \u22643), but the associated uncertainties are large. This suggests that COMs are actively formed and already present in the low-density shells of pre-stellar cores. The modeling of the chemistry of O-bearing COMs in L1544 indicates that these species are enhanced in this shell because (i) CO starts freezing out onto dust grains driving an active surface chemistry; (ii) the visual extinction is sufficiently high to prevent the UV photo-dissociation of COMs by the external interstellar radiation field; and (iii) the density is still moderate to prevent severe depletion of COMs onto grains.", "AuthorKeywords": ["astrochemistry", "ISM: individual objects (L1544)", "ISM: molecules", "stars: formation"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84991615294", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"8866110100": {"Name": "Jim\u00e9nez-Serra I.", "AuthorID": "8866110100", "AffiliationID": "60023599", "AffiliationName": "European Southern Observatory (ESO)"}, "7003564783": {"Name": "Viti S.", "AuthorID": "7003564783", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "35461328600": {"Name": "Testi L.", "AuthorID": "35461328600", "AffiliationID": "60021729", "AffiliationName": "INAF-Osservatorio Astrofisico di Arcetri"}, "6507224852": {"Name": "Vasyunin A.I.", "AuthorID": "6507224852", "AffiliationID": "60103702", "AffiliationName": "Ural Federal University"}, "7003920395": {"Name": "Caselli P.", "AuthorID": "7003920395", "AffiliationID": "60021561", "AffiliationName": "Max-Planck-Institut f\u00fcr Extraterrestrische Physik (MPE)"}, "55943663900": {"Name": "Marcelino N.", "AuthorID": "55943663900", "AffiliationID": "60006424, 60006754", "AffiliationName": "Instituto de Ciencia de Materiales de Madrid, CSIC"}, "14630042400": {"Name": "Billot N.", "AuthorID": "14630042400", "AffiliationID": "60026785", "AffiliationName": "Instituto de Radioastronom\u00eda Milim\u00e9trica"}, "36180048900": {"Name": "Vastel C.", "AuthorID": "36180048900", "AffiliationID": "60123782, 60008134", "AffiliationName": "CNRS, IRAP"}, "55917808700": {"Name": "Lefloch B.", "AuthorID": "55917808700", "AffiliationID": "60008134", "AffiliationName": "CNRS, IPAG"}, "56231565100": {"Name": "Bachiller R.", "AuthorID": "56231565100", "AffiliationID": "60068652", "AffiliationName": "Observatorio Astron\u00f3mico Nacional (OAN, IGN)"}}}
