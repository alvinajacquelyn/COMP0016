In this contribution we review our recently developed methodology for calculation of rate constants for diffusion and binding of small molecules to buried protein active sites. The diffusive dynamics of the ligand obtained from molecular dynamics simulation is coarse grained and described by a Markov state model. Diffusion and binding rate constants are then obtained either from the reactive flux formalism or by fitting the time-dependent population of the Markov state model to a phenomenological rate law. The method is illustrated by applications to diffusion of substrate and inhibitors in [NiFe] hydrogenase, CO-dehydrogenase, and myoglobin. We also discuss a recently developed sensitivity analysis that allows one to identify hot spots in proteins, where mutations are expected to have the strongest effects on ligand diffusion rates.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Kinetics", "Ligand diffusion", "Molecular dynamics simulation", "Rate"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aldehyde Oxidoreductases", "Binding Sites", "Biocatalysis", "Catalytic Domain", "Clostridiales", "Cluster Analysis", "Desulfovibrio gigas", "Diffusion", "Humans", "Hydrogenase", "Kinetics", "Ligands", "Markov Chains", "Molecular Dynamics Simulation", "Multienzyme Complexes", "Mutation", "Myoglobin", "Protein Binding", "Thermodynamics"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84978955063", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"]], "AuthorData": {"56086580800": {"Name": "Wang P.H.", "AuthorID": "56086580800", "AffiliationID": "60016648", "AffiliationName": "RIKEN Theoretical Molecular Science Laboratory"}, "9733759000": {"Name": "De Sancho D.", "AuthorID": "9733759000", "AffiliationID": "60104285", "AffiliationName": "Ikerbasque, Basque Foundation for Science"}, "7101781410": {"Name": "Best R.B.", "AuthorID": "7101781410", "AffiliationID": "60008438, 60006577", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Chemical Physics, National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, National Institutes of Health"}, "8669973600": {"Name": "Blumberger J.", "AuthorID": "8669973600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
