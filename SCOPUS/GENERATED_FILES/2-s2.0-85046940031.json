The circuit is based on a coincidence buffer element which is able to output a signal when both of its input lines are triggered. The circuit model for the SNSPD element is simulated in SPICE and optimized to match the experimental SNSPD response data. The two-signal detection scheme is simulated using JSIM which allows for the simulation of Josephson junction elements in a circuit. We demonstrate a model of the two-signal circuit operating with two simulated SNSPD pixel inputs and investigate the response of the scheme when a phase shift is applied to one of the inputs. The scheme shows potential as a useful coincidence detector of single photons. We also present preliminary experimental results of nanobridge-based Josephson junctions to be used in the realization of the coincidence detector circuit. Evidence of the nanobridges exhibiting Josephson behavior (SQUID modulation) are presented.", "AuthorKeywords": ["detector readout", "Single Flux Quantum (SFQ) logic", "superconducting nanowire"], "IndexKeywords": ["Circuit modeling", "Coincidence detectors", "Detector readout", "Josephson-junction", "Single flux quantum", "Single flux quantum logic", "Superconducting nanowire", "Superconducting nanowire single photon detectors"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85046940031", "SubjectAreas": [["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"], ["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"]], "AuthorData": {"36718182200": {"Name": "Shelly C.D.", "AuthorID": "36718182200", "AffiliationID": "60010785", "AffiliationName": "National Physical Laboratory"}, "6701461985": {"Name": "See P.", "AuthorID": "6701461985", "AffiliationID": "60010785", "AffiliationName": "National Physical Laboratory"}, "10739424400": {"Name": "Ireland J.", "AuthorID": "10739424400", "AffiliationID": "60010785", "AffiliationName": "National Physical Laboratory"}, "55728536800": {"Name": "Williams J.M.", "AuthorID": "55728536800", "AffiliationID": "60010785", "AffiliationName": "National Physical Laboratory"}, "6701351606": {"Name": "Romans E.J.", "AuthorID": "6701351606", "AffiliationID": "60175883", "AffiliationName": "London Centre of Nanotechnology"}, "18036875400": {"Name": "Casaburi A.", "AuthorID": "18036875400", "AffiliationID": "60001490", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering, Glasgow University, Rankine Building"}, "6603861704": {"Name": "Hadfield R.H.", "AuthorID": "6603861704", "AffiliationID": "60001490", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering, Glasgow University, Rankine Building"}}}
