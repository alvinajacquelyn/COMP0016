This could provide a basis for risk stratified cancer screening; but acceptability in the target populations has not been explored. Methods: We assessed attitudes to risk-stratified ovarian cancer (OC) screening based on prior genetic risk assessment using a survey design. Home-based interviews were carried out by the UK Office of National Statistics in a population-based sample of 1095 women aged 18-74. Demographic and personal correlates of attitudes to risk-stratified OC screening based on prior genetic risk assessment were determined using univariate analyses and adjusted logistic regression models. Results: Full data on the key analytic questions were available for 829 respondents (mean age 46 years; 27 % 'university educated'; 93 % 'White'). Relatively few respondents felt they were at 'higher' or 'much higher' risk of OC than other women of their age group (7.4 %, n = 61). Most women (85 %) said they would 'probably' or 'definitely' take up OC genetic testing; which increased to 88 % if the test also informed about breast cancer risk. Almost all women (92 %) thought they would 'probably' or 'definitely' participate in risk-stratified OC screening. In multivariate logistic regression models, university level education was associated with lower anticipated uptake of genetic testing (p = 0.009), but with more positive attitudes toward risk-stratified screening (p <0.001). Perceived risk was not significantly associated with any of the outcome variables. Conclusions: These findings give confidence in taking forward research on integration of novel genomic technologies into mainstream healthcare.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Breast cancer", "Implementation", "Ovarian cancer", "Predictive genetic testing", "Risk", "Stratification"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Attitude", "Early Detection of Cancer", "Female", "Genetic Testing", "Humans", "Middle Aged", "Ovarian Neoplasms", "Public Opinion", "Risk Assessment", "State Medicine", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84979596913", "SubjectAreas": [["Reproductive Medicine", "MEDI", "2743"], ["Obstetrics and Gynecology", "MEDI", "2729"]], "AuthorData": {"51565577500": {"Name": "Meisel S.F.", "AuthorID": "51565577500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Health Behaviour Research Centre, University College London, Department of Epidemiology and Public Health"}, "7102146930": {"Name": "Wardle J.", "AuthorID": "7102146930", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Health Behaviour Research Centre, University College London, Department of Epidemiology and Public Health"}, "55320413400": {"Name": "Rahman B.", "AuthorID": "55320413400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "EGA UCL Institute for Women's Health, University College London, Department of Women's Cancer"}, "57218348853": {"Name": "Side L.", "AuthorID": "57218348853", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "EGA UCL Institute for Women's Health, University College London, Department of Women's Cancer"}, "7102793051": {"Name": "Fraser L.", "AuthorID": "7102793051", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "EGA UCL Institute for Women's Health, University College London, Department of Women's Cancer"}, "24480998900": {"Name": "Gessler S.", "AuthorID": "24480998900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "EGA UCL Institute for Women's Health, University College London, Department of Women's Cancer"}, "10040678500": {"Name": "Lanceley A.", "AuthorID": "10040678500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "EGA UCL Institute for Women's Health, University College London, Department of Women's Cancer"}, "null": {"Name": null, "AuthorID": null, "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
