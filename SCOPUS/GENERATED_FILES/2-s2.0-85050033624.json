Robotic simulators of human physiology provide a powerful platform to advance the development of novel treatments, prostheses and therapies. This study focuses on the design, building, testing and characterisation of a novel simulator of the human respiratory system. The comparison between healthy subjects breathing and coughing physiological values and the values achieved utilising our novel bioinspired respiratory simulator shows that the latter is able to reproduce peak flow rates and volumes.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bioinspiration", "Respiratory System", "Robotic Health-Care", "Simulator"], "IndexKeywords": ["Bio-inspiration", "Healthy subjects", "Human physiology", "Human respiratory system", "Medical research", "Respiratory tract", "Robotic simulator"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85050033624", "SubjectAreas": [["Artificial Intelligence", "COMP", "1702"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"], ["Control and Optimization", "MATH", "2606"], ["Modeling and Simulation", "MATH", "2611"]], "AuthorData": {"36682304800": {"Name": "Giannaccini M.E.", "AuthorID": "36682304800", "AffiliationID": "60115485, 60020650", "AffiliationName": "Department of Engineering Mathematics, University of Bristol and Bristol Robotics Laboratory"}, "57202972399": {"Name": "Yue K.", "AuthorID": "57202972399", "AffiliationID": "60115485, 60020650", "AffiliationName": "Department of Engineering Mathematics, University of Bristol and Bristol Robotics Laboratory"}, "56230431100": {"Name": "Rossiter J.", "AuthorID": "56230431100", "AffiliationID": "60115485, 60020650", "AffiliationName": "Department of Engineering Mathematics, University of Bristol and Bristol Robotics Laboratory"}, "55953573900": {"Name": "Graveston J.", "AuthorID": "55953573900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London, Torrington Place"}, "7004957785": {"Name": "Birchall M.", "AuthorID": "7004957785", "AffiliationID": "60011326, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Otolaryngology Head and Neck Surgery, UCL Ear Institute, University College London"}, "16300685400": {"Name": "Conn A.", "AuthorID": "16300685400", "AffiliationID": "60115485, 60020650", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Bristol and Bristol Robotics Laboratory"}}}
