Patients with a clinical suspicion of prostate cancer (PSA range 2.2-11.7, mean 6.2) and a negative (PIRAD 1-2/5) pre-biopsy mp-MRI (pre-contrast T1, T2, diffusion-weighted and dynamic-contrast-enhanced MRI) who underwent 10-core TRUS-guided biopsy were recruited for additional mp-MRI examinations performed at 1, 2 and 6 months post biopsy. We quantified mp-MRI peripheral zone (PZ) and transition zone (TZ) normalized T2 signal intensity (nT2-SI); T1 relaxation time (T 10); diffusion-weighted MRI, apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC); dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI, maximum enhancement (ME); slope of enhancement (SoE) and area-under-the-contrast-enhancement-curve at 120 s (AUC 120). Significant changes in mp-MRI parameters were identified by analysis of variance with Dunnett's post testing.Results:Diffuse signal changes were observed post-biopsy throughout the PZ. No significant signal change occurred following biopsy within the TZ. Left and right PZ mean nT2-SI (left PZ: 5.73, 5.16, 4.90 and 5.12; right PZ: 5.80, 5.10, 4.84 and 5.05 at pre-biopsy, 1, 2 and 6 months post biopsy, respectively) and mean T 10 (left PZ: 1.02, 0.67, 0.78, 0.85; right PZ: 1.29, 0.64, 0.78, 0.87 at pre-biopsy, 1, 2 and 6 months post biopsy, respectively) were reduced significantly (P<0.05) from pre-biopsy values for up to 6 months post biopsy. Significant changes (P<0.05) of PZ-ME and AUC 120 were observed at 1 month but resolved by 2 months post biopsy. PZ ADC did not change significantly following biopsy (P=0.23-1.0). There was no significant change of any TZ mp-MRI parameter at any time point following biopsy (P=0.1-1.0).Conclusions:Significant PZ (but not TZ) T2 signal changes persist up to 6 months post biopsy, whereas PZ and TZ ADC is not significantly altered as early as 1 month post biopsy. Caution must be exercised when interpreting T1- and T2-weighted imaging early post biopsy, whereas ADC images are more likely to maintain clinical efficacy.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Contrast Media", "Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Endoscopic Ultrasound-Guided Fine Needle Aspiration", "Humans", "Image Enhancement", "Image Processing, Computer-Assisted", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Neoplasm Grading", "Prostatic Neoplasms"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84947041161", "SubjectAreas": [["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Urology", "MEDI", "2748"], ["Cancer Research", "BIOC", "1306"]], "AuthorData": {"55961544100": {"Name": "Latifoltojar A.", "AuthorID": "55961544100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Imaging, University College London"}, "15076612600": {"Name": "Dikaios N.", "AuthorID": "15076612600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Imaging, University College London"}, "57203543924": {"Name": "Taylor S.", "AuthorID": "57203543924", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, University College London Hospital"}, "55642708000": {"Name": "Halligan S.", "AuthorID": "55642708000", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, University College London Hospital"}, "7202372276": {"Name": "Atkinson D.", "AuthorID": "7202372276", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Imaging, University College London"}, "17036141700": {"Name": "Punwani S.", "AuthorID": "17036141700", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, University College London Hospital"}, "55983928400": {"Name": "Ridout A.", "AuthorID": "55983928400", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, University College London Hospital"}, "7402982572": {"Name": "Moore C.", "AuthorID": "7402982572", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, University College London Hospital"}, "7004667094": {"Name": "Emberton M.", "AuthorID": "7004667094", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, University College London Hospital"}, "15754175900": {"Name": "Illing R.", "AuthorID": "15754175900", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, University College London Hospital"}, "15053220400": {"Name": "Kirkham A.", "AuthorID": "15053220400", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, University College London Hospital"}, "7402266611": {"Name": "Allen C.", "AuthorID": "7402266611", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, University College London Hospital"}}}
