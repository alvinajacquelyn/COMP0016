All rights reserved.New regenerative materials and approaches need to be assessed through reliable and comparable methods for rapid translation to the clinic. There is a considerable need for proven in vitro assays that are able to reduce the burden on animal testing, by allowing assessment of biomaterial utility predictive of the results currently obtained through in vivo studies. The purpose of this multicentre review was to investigate the correlation between existing in vitro results with in vivo outcomes observed for a range of biomaterials. Members from the European consortium BioDesign, comprising 8 universities in a European multicentre study, provided data from 36 in vivo studies and 47 in vitro assays testing 93 different biomaterials. The outcomes of the in vitro and in vivo experiments were scored according to commonly recognised measures of success relevant to each experiment. The correlation of in vitro with in vivo scores for each assay alone and in combination was assessed. A surprisingly poor correlation between in vitro and in vivo assessments of biomaterials was revealed indicating a clear need for further development of relevant in vitro assays. There was no significant overall correlation between in vitro and in vivo outcome. The mean in vitro scores revealed a trend of covariance to in vivo score with 58 %. The inadequacies of the current in vitro assessments highlighted here further stress the need for the development of novel approaches to in vitro biomaterial testing and validated pre-clinical pipelines.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Biomaterials", "Correlation", "In vitro", "In vivo", "Multicentre study"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Biocompatible Materials", "Bone Regeneration", "Humans", "Materials Testing", "Mice", "Rats"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84973617042", "SubjectAreas": [["Bioengineering", "CENG", "1502"], ["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Biomaterials", "MATE", "2502"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"37461409500": {"Name": "Hulsart-Billstr\u00f6m G.", "AuthorID": "37461409500", "AffiliationID": "60003858", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgical Sciences, Orthopedics, Institute of Medicine, Uppsala University"}, "24075133400": {"Name": "Dawson J.I.", "AuthorID": "24075133400", "AffiliationID": "60025287, 60025225", "AffiliationName": "Bone and Joint Research Group, Centre for Human Development Stem Cells and Regeneration, Institute of Developmental Sciences, University of Southampton"}, "7004135804": {"Name": "Oreffo R.O.C.", "AuthorID": "7004135804", "AffiliationID": "60025287, 60025225", "AffiliationName": "Bone and Joint Research Group, Centre for Human Development Stem Cells and Regeneration, Institute of Developmental Sciences, University of Southampton"}, "7202350241": {"Name": "Larsson S.", "AuthorID": "7202350241", "AffiliationID": "60003858", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgical Sciences, Orthopedics, Institute of Medicine, Uppsala University"}, "55628527888": {"Name": "Hofmann S.", "AuthorID": "55628527888", "AffiliationID": "60032882", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Complex Molecular Systems, Eindhoven University of Technology"}, "36063433800": {"Name": "M\u00fcller R.", "AuthorID": "36063433800", "AffiliationID": "60025858", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Biomechanics, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich (ETHZ)"}, "14066762400": {"Name": "Stoddart M.J.", "AuthorID": "14066762400", "AffiliationID": "60030194", "AffiliationName": "AO Research Institute Davos"}, "7003375963": {"Name": "Alini M.", "AuthorID": "7003375963", "AffiliationID": "60030194", "AffiliationName": "AO Research Institute Davos"}, "7101771621": {"Name": "Redl H.", "AuthorID": "7101771621", "AffiliationID": "60009140, 60091989", "AffiliationName": "Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Experimental and Clinical Traumatology, AUVA Research Centre, Austrian Cluster for Tissue Regeneration, European Institute of Excellence on Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine Research (Expertissues EEIG) Vienna-Branch"}, "7003276974": {"Name": "El Haj A.", "AuthorID": "7003276974", "AffiliationID": "60030210", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Science and Technology in Medicine, Keele University"}, "55574210899": {"Name": "Brown R.", "AuthorID": "55574210899", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Tissue Repair and Engineering Centre, Institute of Orthopaedics"}, "56216499500": {"Name": "Salih V.", "AuthorID": "56216499500", "AffiliationID": "60013985, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Eastman Dental Institute"}, "7005673313": {"Name": "Hilborn J.", "AuthorID": "7005673313", "AffiliationID": "60003858", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, A Science for Life Laboratory, Polymer Chemistry Division, Uppsala University"}}}
