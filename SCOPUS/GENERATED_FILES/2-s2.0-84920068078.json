Furthermore, no general synthetic route has been reported to access 2-amino-pyrido[3,4-d]pyrimidine derivatives. Here we report a versatile and efficient chemical approach to this class of molecules. Our strategy involves the concise preparation of 8-chloro-2-(methylthio)pyrido[3,4-d]pyrimidine intermediates and their efficient derivatisation to give novel compounds with potential as kinase inhibitors.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Chemotypes", "Derivatisation", "Fused pyrimidine", "Kinase inhibitors", "Pyrimidine derivatives", "Synthetic routes", "Adenosine Triphosphate", "Antineoplastic Agents", "Biological Assay", "Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2", "Humans", "Kinetics", "Molecular Docking Simulation", "Protein Kinase Inhibitors", "Pyrimidines", "Structure-Activity Relationship"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84920068078", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"], ["Organic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1605"]], "AuthorData": {"56884095300": {"Name": "Innocenti P.", "AuthorID": "56884095300", "AffiliationID": "60010337, 60012754", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Research UK Centre for Cancer Therapeutics, Institute of Cancer Research"}, "18134644900": {"Name": "Woodward H.", "AuthorID": "18134644900", "AffiliationID": "60010337, 60012754", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Research UK Centre for Cancer Therapeutics, Institute of Cancer Research"}, "56465109800": {"Name": "O'Fee L.", "AuthorID": "56465109800", "AffiliationID": "60010337, 60012754", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Research UK Centre for Cancer Therapeutics, Institute of Cancer Research"}, "12143472700": {"Name": "Hoelder S.", "AuthorID": "12143472700", "AffiliationID": "60010337, 60012754", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Research UK Centre for Cancer Therapeutics, Institute of Cancer Research"}}}
