LDA is based on the 'bag of words' assumption that ignores the spatial structure of images. This problem poses a non-Trivial impact on the performance of the model. There exist a number of methods that attempt to address the limit. One representative work can be Spatial Latent Topic Model (Spatial-LTM) for unsupervised joint object discovery and segmentation, which improves over LDA by assigning locally co-occurring visual words with the same topic. However, this model still ignores the spatial relations between visual words which are spatially distant from each other. In this paper, we add a spatial regularization term to the model's posterior distribution that regulates the difference of multinomial weight between each pair of visual words in a topic based on their spatial distance apart in an image set. We call the improved model Spatially Regularized Latent Topic Model (SR-LTM). Experiment result shows that SR-LTM outperforms Spatial-LTM in both unsupervised object discovery accuracy and segmentation accuracy.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Joint object discovery and segmentation", "LDA", "Spatial-dependency"], "IndexKeywords": ["Latent dirichlet allocations", "Latent topic model", "Number of methods", "Posterior distributions", "Segmentation accuracy", "Spatial dependencies", "Spatial regularizations", "Unsupervised object discoveries"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84964430201", "SubjectAreas": [["Artificial Intelligence", "COMP", "1702"], ["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"], ["Energy Engineering and Power Technology", "ENER", "2102"], ["Information Systems and Management", "DECI", "1802"], ["Control and Systems Engineering", "ENGI", "2207"]], "AuthorData": {"57139944600": {"Name": "Ou W.", "AuthorID": "57139944600", "AffiliationID": "60001419", "AffiliationName": "School of Computer Science, Guangdong Polytechnic Normal University"}, "14519995100": {"Name": "Xie Z.", "AuthorID": "14519995100", "AffiliationID": "60001419", "AffiliationName": "School of Computer Science, Guangdong Polytechnic Normal University"}, "55925162500": {"Name": "Lv Z.", "AuthorID": "55925162500", "AffiliationID": "60102083", "AffiliationName": "Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Science1"}}}
