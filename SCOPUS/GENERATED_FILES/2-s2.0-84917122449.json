All rights reserved.We all face a perplexing array of decisions every day. Straight Choices provides an integrative account of the psychology of decision making, in which clear connections are made between empirical results and how these results can help us to understand our uncertain world. Throughout the text, there is an emphasis on the relationship between learning and decision making. The authors argue that the best way to understand how and why decisions are made is in the context of the learning and knowledge acquisition that precedes them and the feedback that follows them. The mechanisms of learning and the structure of environments in which decisions are made are carefully examined to explore the ways in which they act on our choices. From this, the authors go on to consider whether we are all constrained to fall prey to biases or whether with sufficient exposure can we find optimal decision strategies and improve our decision making. This novel approach integrates findings from the decision and learning literatures to provide a unique perspective on the psychology of decision making. It will be of interest to researchers and students in cognitive psychology, as well as researchers in economics and philosophy interested in the nature of decision making.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84917122449", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychology (all)", "PSYC", "3200"], ["Social Sciences (all)", "SOCI", "3300"]], "AuthorData": {"7003401856": {"Name": "Newell B.R.", "AuthorID": "7003401856", "AffiliationID": "60028333", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, University of New South Wales"}, "6507379819": {"Name": "Lagnado D.A.", "AuthorID": "6507379819", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "7005569087": {"Name": "Shanks D.R.", "AuthorID": "7005569087", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
