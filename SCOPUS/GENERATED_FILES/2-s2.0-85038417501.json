An anatomically realistic forward model of the human adult head with unprecedented detailed specification of the 5 scalp sublayers to account for blood irrigation in the connective tissue layer is introduced. The full model consists of 9 layers, accounts for optical properties ranging from 750nm to 950nm and has a voxel size of 0.5mm. The whole model is validated comparing the predicted remitted spectra, using Monte Carlo simulations of radiation propagation with 108 photons, against continuous wave (CW) broadband fNIRS experimental data. As the true oxy- and deoxy-hemoglobin concentrations during acquisition are unknown, a genetic algorithm searched for the vector of parameters that generates a modelled spectrum that optimally fits the experimental spectrum. Differences between experimental and model predicted spectra was quantified using the Root mean square error (RMSE). RMSE was 0.071 \u00b1 0.004, 0.108 \u00b1 0.018 and 0.235\u00b10.015 at 1, 2 and 3cm interoptode distance respectively. The parameter vector of absolute concentrations of haemoglobin species in scalp and cortex retrieved with the genetic algorithm was within histologically plausible ranges. The new model capability to estimate the contribution of the scalp blood flow shall permit incorporating this information to the regularization of the inverse problem for a cleaner reconstruction of brain hemodynamics.", "AuthorKeywords": ["fNIRS", "forward model", "genetic algorithm", "validation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Connective tissue layer", "fNIRS", "Forward modeling", "Modelling and validation", "Oxy-and deoxy-hemoglobin", "Radiation propagation", "Root mean square errors", "validation"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85038417501", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"6507281171": {"Name": "Herrera-Vega J.", "AuthorID": "6507281171", "AffiliationID": "107085704", "AffiliationName": "Instituto Nacional de Astrofsica \u00d3ptica y Electr\u00f3nica"}, "57015595000": {"Name": "Montero-Hern\u00e1ndez S.", "AuthorID": "57015595000", "AffiliationID": "107085704", "AffiliationName": "Instituto Nacional de Astrofsica \u00d3ptica y Electr\u00f3nica"}, "57201386894": {"Name": "Trevi\u00f1o-Palacios C.G.", "AuthorID": "57201386894", "AffiliationID": "107085704", "AffiliationName": "Instituto Nacional de Astrofsica \u00d3ptica y Electr\u00f3nica"}, "22986331300": {"Name": "Orihuela-Espina F.", "AuthorID": "22986331300", "AffiliationID": "107085704", "AffiliationName": "Instituto Nacional de Astrofsica \u00d3ptica y Electr\u00f3nica"}, "6507301690": {"Name": "Tachtsidis I.", "AuthorID": "6507301690", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
