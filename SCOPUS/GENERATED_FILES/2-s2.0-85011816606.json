Published by Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.Background: Central nervous system (CNS) infiltration by CD8+ T cells is associated with neuroinflammation in many neurodegenerative diseases, including HIV-associated dementia. However, the role of CD8+ T cells in the CNS during acute HIV infection (AHI) is unknown. Methods: We analyzed the phenotype, gene expression, T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire, and HIV specificity of CD8+ T cells in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of a unique cohort captured during the earliest stages of AHI (n = 26), chronic (n = 23), and uninfected (n = 8). Results: CSF CD8+ T cells were elevated in AHI compared with uninfected controls. The frequency of activated CSF CD8+ T cells positively correlated to CSF HIV RNA and to markers of CNS inflammation. In contrast, activated CSF CD8+ T cells during chronic HIV infection were associated with markers of neurological injury and microglial activation. CSF CD8+ T cells in AHI exhibited increased functional gene expression profiles associated with CD8+ T cells effector function, proliferation, and TCR signaling, a unique restricted TCR Vbeta repertoire and contained HIV-specific CD8+ T cells directed to unique HIV epitopes compared with the periphery. Conclusions: These results suggest that CSF CD8+ T cells in AHI expanding in the CNS are functional and directed against HIV antigens. These cells could thus play a beneficial role protective of injury seen in chronic HIV infection if combination antiretroviral therapy is initiated early.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cytotoxic T lymphocytes", "HIV", "HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders", "HIV-specific CD8+ T cells", "Neuroinflammation"], "IndexKeywords": ["CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes", "Cerebrospinal Fluid", "HIV Antigens", "HIV Infections", "Humans", "Immunophenotyping", "T-Lymphocyte Subsets"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85011816606", "SubjectAreas": [["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"56584519900": {"Name": "Kessing C.F.", "AuthorID": "56584519900", "AffiliationID": "60001462", "AffiliationName": "Cari F.
