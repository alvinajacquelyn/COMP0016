The multi-cell distributed amplifier uses four gain cells where each consists of a common collector input stage followed by a cascode gain stage. The chip includes bias, decoupling and terminating circuits for the dc and RF interconnects; it measures 0.72 mm by 0.4 mm. It consumes 210 mW of power and can deliver up to 5.5 dBm of output power at 195 GHz. The amplifier achieves an average gain of 13.5 dB with an overall bandwidth over 200 GHz and a \u00b1 2 dB gain ripple. The measurements indicate that this is the widest band dc-coupled amplifier reported to date and has the highest bandwidth reported among non-cascaded distributed amplifiers.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Common collectors", "Distributed amplifier", "Gain ripples", "InP double heterojunction bipolar transistors", "Input stages", "MMIC amplifiers", "On chip measurements", "Ultra-broadband"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85045883952", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"57201431085": {"Name": "Giannakopoulos S.", "AuthorID": "57201431085", "AffiliationID": "60000990", "AffiliationName": "Department of Microtechnology and Nanoscience, Chalmers University of Technology"}, "57171216500": {"Name": "He Z.", "AuthorID": "57171216500", "AffiliationID": "60000990", "AffiliationName": "Department of Microtechnology and Nanoscience, Chalmers University of Technology"}, "57193219885": {"Name": "Zirath H.", "AuthorID": "57193219885", "AffiliationID": "60000990", "AffiliationName": "Department of Microtechnology and Nanoscience, Chalmers University of Technology"}, "7202998359": {"Name": "Eriksson K.", "AuthorID": "7202998359", "AffiliationID": "120590436", "AffiliationName": "Ruag Space AB"}, "7003497031": {"Name": "Darwazeh I.", "AuthorID": "7003497031", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}}}
