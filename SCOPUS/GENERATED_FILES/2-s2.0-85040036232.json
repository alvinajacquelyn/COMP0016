Thermally activated defect states associated with the GaAsSb matrix material are found to account for the reduction of the performance of the solar cell. The rapid quenching of the PL and EL intensity, along with the shift (above 150 K) of the dominant recombination process during spontaneous emission (EL), further indicates the prevalence of nonradiative processes at elevated temperatures in these systems. These findings are also supported by a reduction in the open-circuit voltage at elevated temperatures in these devices.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Defects", "electroluminescence (EL)", "nonradiative", "recombination"], "IndexKeywords": ["External quantum efficiency", "Non-radiative", "Nonradiative process", "Nonradiative recombination process", "Quantum dot solar cells", "recombination", "Recombination process", "Temperature dependent"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85040036232", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"57007415500": {"Name": "Cheng Y.", "AuthorID": "57007415500", "AffiliationID": "60030931", "AffiliationName": "Homer L.
