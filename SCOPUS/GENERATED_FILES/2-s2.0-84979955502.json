Patients Preterm infants undergoing intensive care recruited to three chronological age groups: 1 to 7 (Group 1; n = 20), 8 to 28 (Group 2; n = 21) & \u2265 29 days of life (Group 3; n = 18). Methods Pre and post-BT anterior cerebral artery (ACA) time averaged mean velocity (TAMV) and superior vena cava (SVC) flow were measured. Cerebral Tissue Haemoglobin Index (cTHI) and Oxygenation Index (cTOI) were measured from 15\u201320 min before to 15\u201320 min post-BT using NIRS. Vital parameters and blood pressure were measured continuously. Results Mean BP increased significantly, and there was no significant change in vital parameters following BT. Pre-BT ACA TAMV was higher in Group 2 and 3 compared to Group 1 (p < 0.001). Pre-BT ACA TAMV decreased significantly (p \u2264 0.04) in all 3 groups; pre-BT SVC flow decreased significantly in Group 1 (p = 0.03) and Group 3 (p < 0.001) following BT. Pre-BT cTOI was significantly lower in Group 3 compared to Group 1 (p = 0.02). cTHI (p < 0.001) and cTOI (p < 0.05) increased significantly post-BT in all three groups. PDA had no effect on these measurements. Conclusion Baseline cTOI decreases and ACA TAMV increases with increasing chronological age. Blood transfusion increased cTOI and cTHI and decreased ACA TAMV in all groups. PDA had no impact on the baseline cerebral oximetry and blood flow as well as changes following blood transfusion.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Blood transfusion", "Cerebral blood flow", "Cerebral oximetry"], "IndexKeywords": ["Blood Transfusion", "Cerebrovascular Circulation", "Female", "Gestational Age", "Humans", "Infant, Extremely Premature", "Infant, Newborn", "Male", "Oximetry", "Oxygen", "Transfusion Reaction"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84979955502", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Obstetrics and Gynecology", "MEDI", "2729"]], "AuthorData": {"57209494338": {"Name": "Banerjee J.", "AuthorID": "57209494338", "AffiliationID": "100670651", "AffiliationName": "Portland Hospital"}, "8880249100": {"Name": "Aladangady N.", "AuthorID": "8880249100", "AffiliationID": "113041666", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatrics, SDM Medical College and Hospitals"}, "7202111031": {"Name": "Leung T.S.", "AuthorID": "7202111031", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}}}
