There is limited research on the development of executive functions in preschool children with sickle cell anemia and the factors that contribute to executive dysfunction. We looked at the relation between biomedical and environmental factors, including family functioning and socioeconomic status, and executive functions in 22 preschool children with sickle cell anemia. We found that family functioning was the strongest predictor of executive outcomes in young children with sickle cell anemia with no evidence for an influence of disease severity at this early stage.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Anemia, Sickle Cell", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Executive Function", "Family", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Quality of Life", "Social Environment", "Socioeconomic Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85071146047", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuropsychology and Physiological Psychology", "PSYC", "3206"], ["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"]], "AuthorData": {"57204024918": {"Name": "Downes M.", "AuthorID": "57204024918", "AffiliationID": "60005141", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, University College Dublin"}, "7004346948": {"Name": "de Haan M.", "AuthorID": "7004346948", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Developmental Neurosciences, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "26643012600": {"Name": "Kirkham F.J.", "AuthorID": "26643012600", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Developmental Neurosciences, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "9744014700": {"Name": "Telfer P.T.", "AuthorID": "9744014700", "AffiliationID": "60159931", "AffiliationName": "Department of Hematology, Barts Health NHS Trust"}}}
