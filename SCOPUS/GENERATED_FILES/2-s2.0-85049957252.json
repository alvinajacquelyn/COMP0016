Lateral flow immunoassays are considered ideal biosensors for POC diagnostics due to their numerous advantages. However, to quantify their results a low power, robust electronic reader is needed. A low power CMOS image sensor is presented that can be used in quantitative lateral flow immunoassay readers. It uses a single low power processing capacitive transimpedance amplifier architecture which includes noise cancellation. A chip containing 4 \u00d7 64 pixels was fabricated in CMOS 0.35-\u03bc m technology. With uniform illumination at 525 nm and 67 frames/s the chip has 1.9 mVrms total output referred noise and a total power consumption of 21 \u03bc W. In tests with lateral flow immunoassays the chip detected concentrations of influenza A nucleoprotein from 0.5 ng/mL to 200 ng/mL.", "AuthorKeywords": ["capacitive transimpedance amplifier", "CMOS image sensor", "lateral flow immunoassays", "point-of-care"], "IndexKeywords": ["Capacitive transimpedance amplifiers", "CMOS image sensor", "Influenza", "Lateral flow immunoassay", "Noise cancellation", "Point of care", "Semiconductor device measurements"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85049957252", "SubjectAreas": [["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"54396088900": {"Name": "Pilavaki E.", "AuthorID": "54396088900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "6603720155": {"Name": "Demosthenous A.", "AuthorID": "6603720155", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "26428589100": {"Name": "Valente V.", "AuthorID": "26428589100", "AffiliationID": "60006288", "AffiliationName": "Department of Microelectronics, Delft University of Technology"}}}
