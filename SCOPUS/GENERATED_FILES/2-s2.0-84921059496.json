Any of the three licensed MCC vaccines could be used for either dose, depending on local availability. Healthy term infants registered at participating general practices (GPs) in Hertfordshire and Gloucestershire, UK, were recruited prospectively to provide a single blood sample four weeks after primary immunisation, which was administered by the GP surgery. Vaccination history was obtained at blood sampling. MenC serum bactericidal antibody (SBA) and IgG antibodies against Haemophilus influenzae b (Hib), pertussis toxin (PT), diphtheria toxoid (DT), tetanus toxoid (TT) and thirteen pneumococcal serotypes were analysed according to MCC vaccines received. MenC SBA responses differed significantly (P<. 0.001) according to MCC vaccine schedule as follows: MenC SBA geometric mean titres (GMTs) were significantly lower in infants receiving a diphtheria cross-reacting material-conjugated MCC (MCC-CRM) vaccine followed by TT-conjugated MCC (MCC-TT) vaccine (82.0; 95% CI, 39-173; n= 14) compared to those receiving two MCC-CRM (418; 95% CI, 325-537; n= 82), two MCC-TT (277; 95% CI, 223-344; n= 79) or MCC-TT followed by MCC-CRM (553; 95% CI, 322-949; n= 18). The same group also had the lowest Hib geometric mean concentrations (0.60. \u03bcg/mL, 0.27-1.34) compared to 1.85. \u03bcg/mL (1.23-2.78), 2.86. \u03bcg/mL (2.02-4.05) and 4.26. \u03bcg/mL (1.94-9.36), respectively. Our results indicate that MCC vaccines with different carrier proteins are not interchangeable. When several MCC vaccines are available, children requiring more than one dose should receive MCC vaccines with the same carrier protein or, alternatively, receive MCC-TT first wherever possible.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Carrier proteins", "Conjugate vaccines", "Interchangeability", "Interference", "Meningococcal capsular group C"], "IndexKeywords": ["Antibodies, Bacterial", "Blood Bactericidal Activity", "Carrier Proteins", "Glycoconjugates", "Great Britain", "Humans", "Infant", "Meningococcal Vaccines", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84921059496", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Medicine", "BIOC", "1313"], ["Immunology and Microbiology (all)", "IMMU", "2400"], ["Veterinary (all)", "VETE", "3400"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"57203627482": {"Name": "Ladhani S.N.", "AuthorID": "57203627482", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "Immunisation, Hepatitis and Blood Safety Department, Public Health England"}, "57208572596": {"Name": "Waight P.", "AuthorID": "57208572596", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "Immunisation, Hepatitis and Blood Safety Department, Public Health England"}, "7404491797": {"Name": "Miller E.", "AuthorID": "7404491797", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "Immunisation, Hepatitis and Blood Safety Department, Public Health England"}, "7103346572": {"Name": "Andrews N.J.", "AuthorID": "7103346572", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "Statistics, Modelling and Economics and Immunisation, Public Health England"}, "6602851980": {"Name": "Hallis B.", "AuthorID": "6602851980", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "Immunoassay Laboratory, Public Health England"}, "8270577600": {"Name": "Matheson M.", "AuthorID": "8270577600", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "Immunoassay Laboratory, Public Health England"}, "36660958300": {"Name": "England A.", "AuthorID": "36660958300", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "Immunoassay Laboratory, Public Health England"}, "14037471900": {"Name": "Findlow H.", "AuthorID": "14037471900", "AffiliationID": "60030886, 60111140", "AffiliationName": "Vaccine Evaluation Unit, Public Health England, Manchester Royal Infirmary"}, "57205269477": {"Name": "Bai X.", "AuthorID": "57205269477", "AffiliationID": "60030886, 60111140", "AffiliationName": "Vaccine Evaluation Unit, Public Health England, Manchester Royal Infirmary"}, "7005410023": {"Name": "Borrow R.", "AuthorID": "7005410023", "AffiliationID": "60030886, 60111140", "AffiliationName": "Vaccine Evaluation Unit, Public Health England, Manchester Royal Infirmary"}, "12800754300": {"Name": "Burbidge P.", "AuthorID": "12800754300", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Immunobiology Unit, Institute of Child Health, University College"}, "56270439700": {"Name": "Pearce E.", "AuthorID": "56270439700", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Immunobiology Unit, Institute of Child Health, University College"}, "7102190212": {"Name": "Goldblatt D.", "AuthorID": "7102190212", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Immunobiology Unit, Institute of Child Health, University College"}}}
