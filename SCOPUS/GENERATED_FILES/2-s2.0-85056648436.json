Traditional search methods may take time to retrieve the archived EEGs that could provide the meaning or cause of the specific pattern which is not acceptable as time can be critical for sick neonates. If neurophysiologists had the ability to quickly recall similar patterns, the prior occurrence of the pattern may help make an earlier diagnosis. This paper presents a system that may be used to assist a clinical neurophysiologist in the recall of neonatal EEG patterns. The proposed system consists of an alignment technique followed by an approximate nearest neighbour search algorithm called locality sensitive hashing. The system was tested on six different neonatal EEG pattern types with 430 events in total and the results are presented in this paper.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Algorithms", "Cluster Analysis", "Electroencephalography", "Humans", "Infant, Newborn"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85056648436", "SubjectAreas": [["Signal Processing", "COMP", "1711"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"], ["Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition", "COMP", "1707"], ["Health Informatics", "MEDI", "2718"]], "AuthorData": {"56941334900": {"Name": "Murphy B.", "AuthorID": "56941334900", "AffiliationID": "60113732, 60025160", "AffiliationName": "Irish Centre for Fetal and Neonatal Translational Research (INFANT), University College Cork"}, "6602292136": {"Name": "Boylan G.", "AuthorID": "6602292136", "AffiliationID": "60113732, 60025160", "AffiliationName": "Irish Centre for Fetal and Neonatal Translational Research (INFANT), University College Cork"}, "7003406304": {"Name": "Lightbody G.", "AuthorID": "7003406304", "AffiliationID": "60113732, 60025160", "AffiliationName": "Irish Centre for Fetal and Neonatal Translational Research (INFANT), University College Cork"}, "36832339300": {"Name": "Marnane W.", "AuthorID": "36832339300", "AffiliationID": "60113732, 60025160", "AffiliationName": "Irish Centre for Fetal and Neonatal Translational Research (INFANT), University College Cork"}}}
