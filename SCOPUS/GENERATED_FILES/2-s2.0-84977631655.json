People with epilepsy are less likely to marry; however, their marital prospects are most seriously compromised in arranged marriages. Aims The aim of this study was to document marital prospects and outcomes in PWE going through arranged marriage and to propose optimal practices for counseling PWE contemplating arranged marriage. Methods A MEDLINE search and literature review were conducted, followed by a cross-disciplinary meeting of experts to generate consensus. Results People with epilepsy experience high levels of felt and enacted stigma in arranged marriages, but the repercussions are heavily biased against women. Hiding epilepsy is common during marital negotiations but may be associated with poor medication adherence, reduced physician visits, and poor marital outcome. Although divorce rates are generally insubstantial in PWE, divorce rates appear to be higher in PWE undergoing arranged marriages. In these marriages, hiding epilepsy during marital negotiations is a risk factor for divorce. Conclusions In communities in which arranged marriages are common, physicians caring for PWE are best-equipped to counsel them about their marital prospects. Marital plans and aspirations should be discussed with the family of the person with epilepsy in a timely and proactive manner. The benefits of disclosing epilepsy during marital negotiations should be underscored.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Divorce", "Epilepsy", "Marriage", "Outcome"], "IndexKeywords": ["Consensus", "Divorce", "Emotions", "Epilepsy", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Marriage", "Truth Disclosure"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84977631655", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Behavioral Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2802"]], "AuthorData": {"57199952188": {"Name": "Singh G.", "AuthorID": "57199952188", "AffiliationID": "60007506", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Dayanand Medical College"}, "8445721200": {"Name": "Paul B.S.", "AuthorID": "8445721200", "AffiliationID": "60007506", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Dayanand Medical College"}, "57190140083": {"Name": "Goel P.", "AuthorID": "57190140083", "AffiliationID": "60007506", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Dayanand Medical College"}, "55016918500": {"Name": "Bansal R.", "AuthorID": "55016918500", "AffiliationID": "60007506", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Dayanand Medical College"}, "6506787374": {"Name": "Pauranik A.", "AuthorID": "6506787374", "AffiliationID": "107363070", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Medical College"}, "12545247500": {"Name": "Menon B.", "AuthorID": "12545247500", "AffiliationID": "60106630", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Narayana Medical College"}, "8412764200": {"Name": "Selai C.", "AuthorID": "8412764200", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "7103206004": {"Name": "Chowdhury D.", "AuthorID": "7103206004", "AffiliationID": "60002537", "AffiliationName": "G.B.
