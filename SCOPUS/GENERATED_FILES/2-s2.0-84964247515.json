This is particularly important following intra-uterine fetal death, where there may be fetal maceration. The aim of this study was to investigate whether any changes seen on a whole body fetal post mortem magnetic resonance imaging (PMMR) correspond to maceration at conventional autopsy. Methods: We performed pre-autopsy PMMR in 75 fetuses using a 1.5 Tesla Siemens Avanto MR scanner (Erlangen, Germany). PMMR images were reported blinded to the clinical history and autopsy data using a numerical severity scale (0 = no maceration changes to 2 = severe maceration changes) for 6 different visceral organs (total 12). The degree of maceration at autopsy was categorized according to severity on a numerical scale (1 = no maceration to 4 = severe maceration). We also generated quantitative maps to measure the liver and lung T2. Results: The mean PMMR maceration score correlated well with the autopsy maceration score (R 2 = 0.93). A PMMR score of \u22654.5 had a sensitivity of 91 %, specificity of 64 %, for detecting moderate or severe maceration at autopsy. Liver and lung T2 were increased in fetuses with maceration scores of 3-4 in comparison to those with 1-2 (liver p = 0.03, lung p = 0.02). Conclusions: There was a good correlation between PMMR maceration score and the extent of maceration seen at conventional autopsy. This score may be useful in interpretation of fetal PMMR.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Autopsy", "Fetuses", "Intrauterine death", "Maceration", "MRI", "Pathology"], "IndexKeywords": ["Autopsy", "Fetal Death", "Fetus", "Humans", "Liver", "Lung", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84964247515", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"56533601800": {"Name": "Montaldo P.", "AuthorID": "56533601800", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Imperial College London, Centre for Perinatal Neuroscience"}, "55390593900": {"Name": "Addison S.", "AuthorID": "55390593900", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Imperial College London, Centre for Perinatal Neuroscience"}, "57095511000": {"Name": "Oliveira V.", "AuthorID": "57095511000", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Imperial College London, Centre for Perinatal Neuroscience"}, "56058701300": {"Name": "Lally P.J.", "AuthorID": "56058701300", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Imperial College London, Centre for Perinatal Neuroscience"}, "24484901000": {"Name": "Thayyil S.", "AuthorID": "24484901000", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Imperial College London, Centre for Perinatal Neuroscience"}, "57195810900": {"Name": "Taylor A.M.", "AuthorID": "57195810900", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Institute of Child Health"}, "7004794073": {"Name": "Sebire N.J.", "AuthorID": "7004794073", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}, "6507902996": {"Name": "Arthurs O.J.", "AuthorID": "6507902996", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
