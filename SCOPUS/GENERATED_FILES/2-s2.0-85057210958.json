Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) images are affected, to some degree, by the relative orientation of antennas and subsurface targets. This is particularly true not only for targets that show a significant directivity, but also for inclined planes, such as fractures and faults. Depending on the relative geometry between the antennas and the orientation of the target, radar waves can be preferentially scattered, which causes changes in the reflected signal amplitude. Therefore, traditional single polarization and single azimuth surveys may produce inadequate results. The work presented here examines the use of a multi-azimuth GPR survey to increase the imaging performance of inclined fractures, showing the shortcomings of single-profile surveying and highlighting the benefits that such a strategy has on detection and characterization.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Fracture imaging", "Geophysical surveys", "Ground penetrating radar", "Multi-azimuth GPR"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85057210958", "SubjectAreas": [["Earth and Planetary Sciences (all)", "EART", "1900"]], "AuthorData": {"56373070600": {"Name": "Lombardi F.", "AuthorID": "56373070600", "AffiliationID": "60023256", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Politecnico di Milano"}, "6701399330": {"Name": "Lualdi M.", "AuthorID": "6701399330", "AffiliationID": "60023256", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Politecnico di Milano"}}}
