Objective: To describe the prevalence and course of endocrine dysfunction in POEMS. Design: Cohort study with systematic review of the endocrinopathy in POEMS. Setting: Seventy-five patients with POEMS were evaluated by the multidisciplinary team at our tertiary specialist center. Patients: Endocrine data were available for 59 patients who attended the clinic from June 1999 to May 2018. Interventions: All patients had regular endocrine screening, including testing for diabetes, pituitary and thyroid dysfunction and assessment of bone metabolism. Main Outcome Measure: Prevalence and survival time to develop endocrinopathy in POEMS. Results: Thirty-four (63%) patients presented with an endocrinopathy at POEMS diagnosis and 54 (92%) had at least one endocrine abnormality at follow-up. The median follow-up was 4.4 (interquartile range, 1.5, 7.9) years. The most common endocrine abnormality was hypogonadism in 68%, followed by hyperprolactinemia (56%), hypothyroidism (54%), abnormal glucose metabolism (24%), adrenal insufficiency (17%), and high IGF-1 levels (15%). Spontaneous resolution of endocrine abnormalities at the end of follow-up was observed: 14% of patients with hypogonadism; 42%, hyperprolactinemia; 34%, hypothyroidism; and 38%, high IGF-1 levels. Conclusions: Endocrinopathy was found in 63% of patients at diagnosis and in 92% of patients during follow-up in our cohort. Therefore, patients with POEMS should be systematically assessed for endocrinopathy. The most common deficiencies were hypogonadism and hypothyroidism; however, but endocrinopathy can normalize, so ongoing treatment should remain under review.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85065445785", "SubjectAreas": [["Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism", "MEDI", "2712"], ["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Endocrinology", "BIOC", "1310"], ["Clinical Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1308"], ["Biochemistry (medical)", "MEDI", "2704"]], "AuthorData": {"56588004200": {"Name": "Caimari F.", "AuthorID": "56588004200", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Endocrinology, University College London, Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "6603340565": {"Name": "Baldeweg S.E.", "AuthorID": "6603340565", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Endocrinology, University College London, Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57201481051": {"Name": "Keddie S.", "AuthorID": "57201481051", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, University College London Institute of Neurology"}, "7004224851": {"Name": "Lunn M.P.", "AuthorID": "7004224851", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, University College London Institute of Neurology"}, "6602503855": {"Name": "D'Sa S.", "AuthorID": "6602503855", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Division, University College London, Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
