We selected, culturally adapted and tested the feasibility of a cognitive-behavioural intervention for adherence and for delivery in a clinic setting in Harare, Zimbabwe. The feasibility of the intervention was evaluated using a mixed-methods assessment, including ratings of provider fidelity of intervention delivery, and qualitative assessments of feasibility using individual semi-structured interviews with counsellors (n=4) and patients (n=15). The intervention was feasible and acceptable when administered to 42 patients and resulted in improved self-reported adherence in a subset of 15 patients who were followed up after 6months.", "AuthorKeywords": ["adherence", "AIDS", "cognitive-behavioural therapy", "culture", "HIV", "intervention"], "IndexKeywords": ["Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome", "Adult", "Aged", "Antirheumatic Agents", "Cognitive Therapy", "Culturally Competent Care", "Female", "HIV Infections", "Humans", "Male", "Medication Adherence", "Middle Aged", "Outcome and Process Assessment (Health Care)", "Young Adult", "Zimbabwe"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85028469207", "SubjectAreas": [["Applied Psychology", "PSYC", "3202"]], "AuthorData": {"56584209900": {"Name": "Bere T.", "AuthorID": "56584209900", "AffiliationID": "60033774", "AffiliationName": "University of Zimbabwe, College of Health Science, Nectar Program"}, "56584672600": {"Name": "Nyamayaro P.", "AuthorID": "56584672600", "AffiliationID": "60033774", "AffiliationName": "University of Zimbabwe, College of Health Science, Nectar Program"}, "6505908396": {"Name": "Chibanda D.", "AuthorID": "6505908396", "AffiliationID": "60033774", "AffiliationName": "University of Zimbabwe, College of Health Science, Nectar Program"}, "25622950500": {"Name": "Chingono A.", "AuthorID": "25622950500", "AffiliationID": "60033774", "AffiliationName": "University of Zimbabwe, College of Health Science, Nectar Program"}, "56584718300": {"Name": "Munjoma R.", "AuthorID": "56584718300", "AffiliationID": "60033774", "AffiliationName": "University of Zimbabwe, College of Health Science, Nectar Program"}, "6507678079": {"Name": "Ndhlovu C.", "AuthorID": "6507678079", "AffiliationID": "60033774", "AffiliationName": "University of Zimbabwe, College of Health Science, Nectar Program"}, "36126628200": {"Name": "Magidson J.", "AuthorID": "36126628200", "AffiliationID": "60029929, 60002746", "AffiliationName": "Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School"}, "6507363206": {"Name": "O'Cleirigh C.", "AuthorID": "6507363206", "AffiliationID": "60029929, 60002746", "AffiliationName": "Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School"}, "56583922700": {"Name": "Macpherson K.", "AuthorID": "56583922700", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London"}, "7004595649": {"Name": "Abas M.", "AuthorID": "7004595649", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London"}, "56154625500": {"Name": "Kidia K.", "AuthorID": "56154625500", "AffiliationID": "115209485", "AffiliationName": "Arnhold Global Health Institute"}, "6603734182": {"Name": "Safren S.", "AuthorID": "6603734182", "AffiliationID": "60029251", "AffiliationName": "University of Miami"}}}
