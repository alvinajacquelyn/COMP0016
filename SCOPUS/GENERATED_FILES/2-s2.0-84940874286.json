Moreover, there is a social gradient in health across society that runs from the top to the bottom in a linear, stepwise fashion. Health promoting behaviours become more difficult to sustain further down the social ladder. Oral health inequalities also exist in Germany. Earlier explanations of social inequalities have mainly focused on individual lifestyle factors, ignoring the broader social determinants of health and disease. Until recently, the dominant approaches to general health promotion focused on actions to reduce specific diseases, separating oral health from general health. An alternative approach is the common risk factor approach (CRFA) where risk factors common to a number of major chronic diseases, including diseases of the mouth and teeth, are tackled. The CRFA focuses on the common underlying determinants of health to improve the overall health of populations, thereby reducing social inequalities. The main implication of the CRFA for oral health policies is to work in partnership with a range of other sectors and disciplines. Oral health issues need to be integrated with recommendations to promote general health. Improvements in oral health and a reduction in oral health inequalities are more likely by working in partnership across sectors and disciplines using strategies that focus upstream on the underlying determinants of oral diseases.", "AuthorKeywords": ["common risk factor approach", "dentistry", "prevention", "public health", "social determinants of health"], "IndexKeywords": ["Clinical Decision-Making", "Delivery of Health Care", "Delivery of Health Care, Integrated", "Dental Care", "Evidence-Based Medicine", "Germany", "Health Care Rationing", "Health Policy", "Health Promotion", "Healthcare Disparities", "Humans", "Models, Organizational", "Oral Health", "Public Health", "Risk Assessment", "Socioeconomic Factors", "Stomatognathic Diseases"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84940874286", "SubjectAreas": [["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"56179387000": {"Name": "Heilmann A.", "AuthorID": "56179387000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "7102814490": {"Name": "Sheiham A.", "AuthorID": "7102814490", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "7102907522": {"Name": "Watt R.", "AuthorID": "7102907522", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "7401610919": {"Name": "Jordan R.", "AuthorID": "7401610919", "AffiliationID": "112751483", "AffiliationName": "Institut der Deutschen Zahn\u00e4rzte (IDZ)"}}}
