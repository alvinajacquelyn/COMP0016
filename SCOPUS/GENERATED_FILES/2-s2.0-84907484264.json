Images were collected with a Phantom Miro 4 high-speed camera at a rate of 1000fps. Wave velocity, amplitude, frequency and wave length at different oil-water flow rates (input ratios, r=0.6-2.5; mixture velocities, Umix=0.8-2m s-1) were calculated from the images. The fluids used were tap water (\u03c1=1000kg m-3, \u03bc=0.001kg m-1s-1) and Exxsol D140 oil (\u03c1=830kg m-3, \u03bc=0.0055kg m-1s-1). The waves formed via a KH mechanism immediately after the junction where the two fluids joined and at a velocity roughly equal to half the mixture velocity with a frequency in the range 11-20Hz for all flowrate combinations. Once formed, and at a short distance from the junction the wave amplitudes decreased while the wave velocities and the wavelengths increased. The frequency, however, remained constant. Experimental data was compared against predictions of the wave theory and the instability analysis. The propagation of interfacial waves at half the mixture velocity was predicted by the theory of dynamic waves. Results from the inviscid stability analysis at the inlet agreed qualitatively with the flow pattern map observed well further downstream the inlet, but quantitative differences were seen, which could be due to the viscosity of the oil phase.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Dynamic waves", "High-speed imaging", "KH instability analysis", "Stratified oil-water flow", "Wave characteristics"], "IndexKeywords": ["Dynamic waves", "High speed imaging", "Instability analysis", "Oil water flow", "Wave characteristics"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84907484264", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"], ["Nuclear Energy and Engineering", "ENER", "2104"], ["Aerospace Engineering", "ENGI", "2202"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"], ["Fluid Flow and Transfer Processes", "CENG", "1507"]], "AuthorData": {"55903458800": {"Name": "Barral A.", "AuthorID": "55903458800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "56976392900": {"Name": "Ebenezer A.", "AuthorID": "56976392900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "7004488806": {"Name": "Angeli P.", "AuthorID": "7004488806", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}}}
