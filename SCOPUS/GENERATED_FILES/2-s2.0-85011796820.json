The present study aims to evaluate a measure of sarcasm comprehension suitable for use with children and adolescents (Experiment 1), and to examine sarcasm comprehension in children and adolescents with TS-alone or TS and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD; Experiment 2). In Experiment 1, the measure of sarcasm comprehension was found to be sensitive to differences in nonliteral language comprehension for typically-developing children aged 10 to 11 years old compared to children aged 8 to 9 years old; the older group performed significantly better on the comprehension of scenarios ending with either direct or indirect sarcastic remarks, whereas the two age groups did not differ on the comprehension of scenarios ending with sincere remarks. In Experiment 2, both the TS-alone and TS+ADHD groups performed below the level of the control participants on the comprehension of indirect sarcasm items but not on the comprehension of direct sarcasm items and sincere items. Those with TS+ADHD also performed below the level of the control participants on measures of interference control and fluency. The findings are discussed with reference to the possible contribution of executive functioning and mentalizing to the patterns of performance.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Child development", "Mentalizing", "Pragmatic language", "Sarcasm", "Social cognition", "Theory of mind", "Tourette\u2019s syndrome"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Child", "Comprehension", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Social Behavior", "Tourette Syndrome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85011796820", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Neuropsychology and Physiological Psychology", "PSYC", "3206"], ["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"]], "AuthorData": {"16030663700": {"Name": "Drury H.", "AuthorID": "16030663700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Experimental Psychology, University College London"}, "57193225289": {"Name": "Shah S.", "AuthorID": "57193225289", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Experimental Psychology, University College London"}, "7202193869": {"Name": "Crawford S.", "AuthorID": "7202193869", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Experimental Psychology, University College London"}, "7006607949": {"Name": "Channon S.", "AuthorID": "7006607949", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Experimental Psychology, University College London"}, "7402955953": {"Name": "Stern J.", "AuthorID": "7402955953", "AffiliationID": "60010426", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, St George\u2019s Hospital"}}}
