The study of oocyte dynamics is needed to understand ovary development and reproductive cycle of fish. Oocytes go through different developmental states in a continuum temporal sequence providing an interesting example of ordinal classification, which is not exploited by the current oocyte analysis software. This promising paradigm of machine learning known as ordinal classification or ordinal regression focus on classification problems where there exist a natural order between the classes, thus requiring specific methods and evaluation metrics. In this paper we compare 11 ordinal and 15 nominal state-of-the-art classifiers using oocytes of three fish species (Merluccius merluccius, Trisopterus luscus and Reinhardtius hippoglossoides). The best results are achieved by SVMOD, an ordinal decomposition method of the labelling space based on the Support Vector Machine, varying strongly with the number of states for each specie (about 95 and 80 % of accuracy with three and six states respectively). The classifiers designed specially for ordinal classification are able to capture the underlying nature of the state ordering much better than common nominal classifiers. This is demonstrated by several metrics specially designed to measure misclassification errors associated to states far in the ranking scale.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Decomposition methods", "Fish oocytes", "Ordinal classification", "Reinhardtius hippoglossoides", "Texture analysis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Decomposition methods", "Fish oocytes", "Ordinal classification", "Reinhardtius hippoglossoides", "Texture analysis"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84945259039", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"], ["Artificial Intelligence", "COMP", "1702"]], "AuthorData": {"35068542300": {"Name": "P\u00e9rez-Ortiz M.", "AuthorID": "35068542300", "AffiliationID": "60086940", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics and Engineering, University of Loyola Andaluc\u00eda"}, "23473354200": {"Name": "Guti\u00e9rrez P.", "AuthorID": "23473354200", "AffiliationID": "60003138", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science and Numerical Analysis, University of C\u00f3rdoba"}, "6603240334": {"Name": "Herv\u00e1s-Mart\u00ednez C.", "AuthorID": "6603240334", "AffiliationID": "60003138", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science and Numerical Analysis, University of C\u00f3rdoba"}, "6603469737": {"Name": "Fern\u00e1ndez-Delgado M.", "AuthorID": "6603469737", "AffiliationID": "60028419", "AffiliationName": "CITIUS: Centro de Investigaci\u00f3n en Tecnolox\u00edas da Informaci\u00f3n da USC, University of Santiago de Compostela"}, "25652608200": {"Name": "Cernadas E.", "AuthorID": "25652608200", "AffiliationID": "60028419", "AffiliationName": "CITIUS: Centro de Investigaci\u00f3n en Tecnolox\u00edas da Informaci\u00f3n da USC, University of Santiago de Compostela"}, "22833958400": {"Name": "Dom\u00ednguez-Petit R.", "AuthorID": "22833958400", "AffiliationID": "60015192", "AffiliationName": "Department of Fisheries Ecology, Instituto de Investigaciones Marinas, Agencia Estatal Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cient\u00edficas"}}}
