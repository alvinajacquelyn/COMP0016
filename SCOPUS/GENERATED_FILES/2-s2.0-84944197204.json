MSCs expressing full-length human TRAIL (flT) or its soluble form (sT) have previously been shown to be effective for cancer killing. However, a comparison between the two forms has never been performed, leaving it unclear which approach is most effective. This study addresses the issue for the possible clinical application of TRAIL-expressing MSCs in the future. Methods: MSCs were transduced with lentiviruses expressing flT or an isoleucine zipper-fused sT. TRAIL expression was examined and cancer cell apoptosis was measured after treatment with transduced MSCs or with MSC-derived soluble TRAIL. Results: The transduction does not adversely affect cell phenotype. The sT-transduced MSCs (MSC-sT) secrete abundant levels of soluble TRAIL but do not present the protein on the cell surface. Interestingly, the flT-transduced MSCs (MSC-flT) not only express cell-surface TRAIL but also release flT into medium. These cells were examined for inducing apoptosis in 20 cancer cell lines. MSC-sT cells showed very limited effects. By contrast, MSC-flT cells demonstrated high cancer cell-killing efficiency. More importantly, MSC-flT cells can overcome some cancer cell resistance to recombinant TRAIL. In addition, both cell surface flT and secreted flT are functional for inducing apoptosis. The secreted flT was found to have higher cancer cell-killing capacity than either recombinant TRAIL or MSC-secreted sT. Conclusions: These observations demonstrate that MSC delivery of flT is superior to MSC delivery of sT for cancer therapy.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Apoptosis", "Cancer", "Mesenchymal stromal cell", "TRAIL", "Tumor"], "IndexKeywords": ["Apoptosis", "Cell Line, Tumor", "Cell Proliferation", "Cell- and Tissue-Based Therapy", "Humans", "Mesenchymal Stromal Cells", "Neoplasms", "TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand", "Transduction, Genetic"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84944197204", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"], ["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Genetics (clinical)", "MEDI", "2716"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"], ["Cancer Research", "BIOC", "1306"], ["Transplantation", "MEDI", "2747"]], "AuthorData": {"15841200000": {"Name": "Yuan Z.Q.", "AuthorID": "15841200000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Lungs for Living Research Centre, UCL Respiratory, Division of Medicine, University College London"}, "55600196300": {"Name": "Kolluri K.K.", "AuthorID": "55600196300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Lungs for Living Research Centre, UCL Respiratory, Division of Medicine, University College London"}, "24554447800": {"Name": "Sage E.K.", "AuthorID": "24554447800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Lungs for Living Research Centre, UCL Respiratory, Division of Medicine, University College London"}, "54383218900": {"Name": "Gowers K.H.C.", "AuthorID": "54383218900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Lungs for Living Research Centre, UCL Respiratory, Division of Medicine, University College London"}, "56514246800": {"Name": "Janes S.M.", "AuthorID": "56514246800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Lungs for Living Research Centre, UCL Respiratory, Division of Medicine, University College London"}}}
