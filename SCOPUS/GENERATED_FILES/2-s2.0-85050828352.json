Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.Existing ancestral sequence reconstruction techniques are ill-suited to investigating substitutions on a single branch of interest. We present SubRecon, an implementation of a hybrid technique integrating joint and marginal reconstruction for protein sequence data. SubRecon calculates the joint probability of states at adjacent internal nodes in a phylogeny, i.e. how the state has changed along a branch. This does not condition on states at other internal nodes and includes site rate variation. Simulation experiments show the technique to be accurate and powerful. SubRecon has a user-friendly command line interface and produces concise output that is intuitive yet suitable for subsequent parsing in an automated pipeline.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Amino Acid Substitution", "Phylogeny", "Software"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85050828352", "SubjectAreas": [["Statistics and Probability", "MATH", "2613"], ["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Computational Theory and Mathematics", "COMP", "1703"], ["Computational Mathematics", "MATH", "2605"]], "AuthorData": {"56857571400": {"Name": "Monit C.", "AuthorID": "56857571400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London"}, "7403005698": {"Name": "Goldstein R.", "AuthorID": "7403005698", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London"}}}
