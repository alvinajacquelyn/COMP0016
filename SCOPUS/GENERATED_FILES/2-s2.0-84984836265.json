The array was characterized using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction. The array was evaluated against a number of environmentally important reducing and oxidizing gases across a range of operating temperatures (300-500 \u00b0C). The highest response achieved was against 100 ppm ethanol by the 50 wt% ZnO-50 wt% SnO2 device, which exhibited a response of 109.1, a 4.5-fold increase with respect to the pure SnO2 counterpart (which displayed a response of 24.4) and a 12.3-fold enhancement with respect to the pure ZnO counterpart (which was associated with a response of 8.9), towards the same concentration of the analyte. Cross sensitivity studies were also carried out against a variety of reducing gases at an operating temperature of 300 \u00b0C. The sensors array showed selectivity towards ethanol. The enhanced behaviour of the mixed oxide materials was influenced by junction effects, composition, the packing structure and the device microstructure. The results show that it is possible to tune the sensitivity and selectivity of a composite sensor, through a simple change in the composition of the composite.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Environmental gas sensing", "Hetero-junctions", "Metal oxide sensors", "SnO2", "ZnO"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84984836265", "SubjectAreas": [["Analytical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1602"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"]], "AuthorData": {"42061931200": {"Name": "Naik A.", "AuthorID": "42061931200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Christopher Ingold Laboratories, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "56217400400": {"Name": "Parkin I.", "AuthorID": "56217400400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Christopher Ingold Laboratories, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "7801602505": {"Name": "Binions R.", "AuthorID": "7801602505", "AffiliationID": "60022109", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering and Materials Science, Queen Mary University of London"}}}
