Literature reviewed within this paper indicates a distinct gap in research, allowing for rising obsolescence-driven investments within asset systems. In addition to further conceptual development, case study testing is required to validate the use of certain existing methods. Design/methodology/approach: This paper has developed a Boolean obsolescence assessment tool, which was then tested within a case study environment. This year-long case study provided real world data across three asset systems within an operational building. Findings: The findings from this preliminary case study indicate that a Boolean tool of this type has the potential to provide significant insight into obsolescence mitigation. Such a tool, implemented in accordance with onsite asset management processes, has the ability to mitigate and avoid obsolescence-driven investments. Research limitations/implications: This case study is limited because of its length and size. To mitigate the effects that may have been captured, this research project has been developed and continued. Originality/value: The model featured within this paper originated from an untested obsolescence indexing technique. This model was adapted and extended to improve its accuracy and functionality, which also involved adding weighting mechanisms, resulting in not only an original model but a novel set of results because of the current lack of explicit testing of similar models.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Asset management", "DMSMS", "Lifecycle", "Obsolescence", "Private finance initiative", "Risk"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85019657427", "SubjectAreas": [["Business and International Management", "BUSI", "1403"], ["Strategy and Management", "BUSI", "1408"], ["Management of Technology and Innovation", "BUSI", "1405"]], "AuthorData": {"57188881097": {"Name": "Mulholland K.", "AuthorID": "57188881097", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "15838056200": {"Name": "Pitt M.", "AuthorID": "15838056200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "57068327900": {"Name": "Mclennan P.", "AuthorID": "57068327900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
