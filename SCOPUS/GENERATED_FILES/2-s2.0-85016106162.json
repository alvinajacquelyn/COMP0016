{"Title": "Variant rs10911021 that associates with coronary heart disease in type 2 diabetes, is associated with lower concentrations of circulating HDL cholesterol and large HDL particles but not with amino acids", "Year": 2016, "Source": "Cardiovasc Diabetol", "Volume": "15", "Issue": 1, "Art.No": null, "PageStart": 115, "PageEnd": null, "CitedBy": 5, "DOI": "10.1186/s12933-016-0435-0", "Link": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85016106162&origin=inward", "Abstract": "AIMS: An intergenic locus on chromosome 1 (lead SNP rs10911021) was previously associated with coronary heart disease (CHD) in type 2 diabetes (T2D). Using data from the UCLEB consortium we investigated the relationship between rs10911021 and CHD in T2D, whether rs10911021 was associated with levels of amino acids involved in the \u03b3-glutamyl cycle or any conventional risk factors (CRFs) for CHD in the T2D participants.METHODS: Four UCLEB studies (n = 6531) had rs10911021 imputation, CHD in T2D, CRF and metabolomics data determined using a nuclear magnetic resonance based platform.RESULTS: The expected direction of effect between rs10911021 and CHD in T2D was observed (1377 no CHD/160 CHD; minor allele OR 0.80, 95 % CI 0.60-1.06) although this was not statistically significant (p = 0.13). No association between rs10911021 and CHD was seen in non-T2D participants (11218 no CHD/1274 CHD; minor allele OR 1.00 95 % CIs 0.92-1.10). In T2D participants, while no associations were observed between rs10911021 and the nine amino acids measured, rs10911021 was associated with HDL-cholesterol (p = 0.0005) but the minor \"protective\" allele was associated with lower levels (-0.034 mmol/l per allele). Focusing more closely on the HDL-cholesterol subclasses measured, we observed that rs10911021 was associated with six large HDL particle measures in T2D (all p < 0.001). No significant associations were seen in non-T2D subjects.CONCLUSIONS: Our findings are consistent with a true association between rs10911021 and CHD in T2D. The protective minor allele was associated with lower HDL-cholesterol and reductions in HDL particle traits. Our results indicate a complex relationship between rs10911021 and CHD in T2D.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Coronary heart disease", "Genetic risk", "HDL-cholesterol", "Metabolomics"], "IndexKeywords":
