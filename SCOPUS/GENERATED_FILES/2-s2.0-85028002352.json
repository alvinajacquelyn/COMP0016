Structural changes in the amygdala have been associated with early adversity and, in principle, may contribute to the later emergence of emotional pathologies by influencing the way that the brain responds to stress provocation. The present study examined the relationship between amygdala volumes and cortisol secretion in response to a social stressor among young adults who were or were not exposed to maternal postnatal depression (PND) early in development (referred to as PND offspring and controls, respectively). Hierarchical Linear Modelling (HLM) revealed that, on a sample-wide level, there was no evidence of a relationship between total amygdala volume, or the volume of the right or left hemisphere amygdala taken separately, and cortisol reactivity. Unexpectedly, for PND offspring, larger right hemisphere amygdala volume was associated with lower cortisol reactivity in response to stress, an effect that was not apparent in control offspring. We conclude that the relationship between amygdala volumes and stress reactivity may not be as clear as previous models suggested.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Amygdala", "Cortisol", "Depression", "Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis", "Stress sensitivity"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Amygdala", "Child of Impaired Parents", "Depression, Postpartum", "Female", "Humans", "Hydrocortisone", "Hypothalamo-Hypophyseal System", "Longitudinal Studies", "Male", "Mothers", "Pituitary-Adrenal System", "Stress, Psychological", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85028002352", "SubjectAreas": [["Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism", "MEDI", "2712"], ["Endocrinology", "BIOC", "1310"], ["Endocrine and Autonomic Systems", "NEUR", "2807"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"], ["Biological Psychiatry", "NEUR", "2803"]], "AuthorData": {"55790235900": {"Name": "Barry T.J.", "AuthorID": "55790235900", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience, King's College London"}, "7202252529": {"Name": "Murray L.", "AuthorID": "7202252529", "AffiliationID": "60000356", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry and Mental Health, University of Cape Town"}, "7004015430": {"Name": "Johnstone T.", "AuthorID": "7004015430", "AffiliationID": "60012197", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology and CLS, University of Reading"}, "7006081489": {"Name": "Halligan S.L.", "AuthorID": "7006081489", "AffiliationID": "60030480", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, University of Bath"}, "7003273958": {"Name": "Fearon P.", "AuthorID": "7003273958", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London"}, "26039358500": {"Name": "Moutsiana C.", "AuthorID": "26039358500", "AffiliationID": "60000508", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Faculty of Science and Technology, University of Westminster"}}}
