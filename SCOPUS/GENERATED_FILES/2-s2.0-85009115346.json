However, tissue in front of the transducer and the deep location of kidney can cause significant losses to the efficiency of the treatment. The effect of attenuation, refraction and reflection due to different tissue types on HIFU therapy of the kidney was studied using a nonlinear ultrasound simulation model. The geometry of the tissue was derived from a computed tomography (CT) dataset of a patient which had been segmented for water, bone, soft tissue, fat and kidney. The combined effect of inhomogeneous attenuation and soundspeed was found to result in an 11.0 dB drop in spatial peak-temporal average (SPTA) intensity in the kidney compared to pure water. The simulation without refraction effects showed a 6.3 dB decrease indicating that both attenuation and refraction contribute to the loss in focal intensity. The losses due to reflections at soft tissue interfaces were less than 0.1 dB. Focal point shifting due to refraction effects resulted in -1.3, 2.6 and 1.3 mm displacements in x-, y- and z-directions respectively. Furthermore, focal point splitting into several smaller subvolumes was observed. The total volume of the secondary focal points was approximately 46% of the largest primary focal point. This could potentially lead to undesired heating outside the target location and longer therapy times.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound Ablation", "Humans", "Imaging, Three-Dimensional", "Kidney Neoplasms", "Nonlinear Dynamics", "Tomography, X-Ray Computed"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85009115346", "SubjectAreas": [["Signal Processing", "COMP", "1711"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"], ["Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition", "COMP", "1707"], ["Health Informatics", "MEDI", "2718"]], "AuthorData": {"56801629600": {"Name": "Suomi V.", "AuthorID": "56801629600", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Engineering Science, University of Oxford"}, "7102377418": {"Name": "Cleveland R.", "AuthorID": "7102377418", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Engineering Science, University of Oxford"}, "13408713400": {"Name": "Jaros J.", "AuthorID": "13408713400", "AffiliationID": "60083321", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Information Technology, Brno University of Technology"}, "16200175900": {"Name": "Treeby B.", "AuthorID": "16200175900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London, Wolfson House"}}}
