The failure of earlier work to recognise the extent of the hysteresis associated with the high temperature (\u223c763 K on heating) Cmcm - Pbnm phase transition, that extends down to room temperature, and probably to 0 K, is due to data having been collected at too low a real-space resolution to characterise the diagnostic pseudocubic fundamental and superlattice reflection multiplicities. The phase fraction of the Cmcm phase increases with increasing temperature from 45 weight % at 298 K, to 74 weight % at 758 K. Throughout the whole temperature interval 298 K-758 K, the volume per formula unit of the Cmcm phase exceeds that of the Pbnm phase by an almost constant \u223c0.01 \u00c53 suggesting the addition of pressure would supress the volume fraction of the higher temperature phase. The crystal structure of both phases, determined from data collected at 298 K, are reported, with the atomic displacement parameters of the Cmcm phase being significantly larger than those associated with the Pbnm phase, probably reflecting a high degree of thermal and static disorder.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Crystal structure", "NaTaO3", "Neutron diffraction", "Phase transitions"], "IndexKeywords": ["Atomic displacement parameters", "High resolution neutron powder diffraction data", "High-resolution neutron powder diffraction", "Increasing temperatures", "NaTaO3", "Orthorhombic structures", "Real-space resolution", "Superlattice reflections"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84925438865", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"]], "AuthorData": {"7202745497": {"Name": "Knight K.S.", "AuthorID": "7202745497", "AffiliationID": "60025352", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, Natural History Museum"}, "55749015900": {"Name": "Kennedy B.J.", "AuthorID": "55749015900", "AffiliationID": "60025709", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, University of Sydney"}}}
