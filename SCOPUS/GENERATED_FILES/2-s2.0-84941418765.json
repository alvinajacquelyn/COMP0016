Our view of L2L2 is a substantial extension of Learning to Learn (L2L): L2L2 consists of learning to collaborate to successfully face L2L challenges. It is inseparable from L2L, as it emerges when individuals face problems that are too difficult for them. The togetherness becomes a necessity then. We describe the first cycle of a design-based research study aimed at promoting L2L2. We rely on previous research to identify collective reflection, mutual engagement and peer assessment as possible directions for desirable L2L2 practices. We describe a CSCL tool: the Metafora system that we designed to provide affordances for L2L2. Through three cases in which Metafora was used in classrooms, we describe the practices and mini-culture that actually developed. In all contexts, groups of students engaged either in mathematical problem solving or in scientific inquiry and argumentation. These cases show that L2L2 is a tangible educational goal, and that it was partially attained. We show how the experiments we undertook refined our view of L2L2 and may help in improving further educational practice.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Collaborative learning", "Inquiry learning", "Learning to learn", "Mathematical problem solving", "Peer assessment"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84941418765", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["Human-Computer Interaction", "COMP", "1709"]], "AuthorData": {"7103059799": {"Name": "Schwarz B.B.", "AuthorID": "7103059799", "AffiliationID": "60007903", "AffiliationName": "Hebrew University of Jerusalem"}, "55099960200": {"Name": "de Groot R.", "AuthorID": "55099960200", "AffiliationID": "60007903", "AffiliationName": "Hebrew University of Jerusalem"}, "25651815200": {"Name": "Mavrikis M.", "AuthorID": "25651815200", "AffiliationID": "60117699, 60006242", "AffiliationName": "London Knowledge Lab, Institute of Education"}, "6507433156": {"Name": "Dragon T.", "AuthorID": "6507433156", "AffiliationID": "60012181", "AffiliationName": "Ithaca College"}}}
