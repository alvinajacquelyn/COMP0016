Presumably, greater attention to such cues renders the challenge of learning two languages easier. Spanish and Catalan are, however, rhythmically and phonologically close languages. This raises the possibility that bilinguals only rely on redundant audiovisual cues when their languages are close. To test this possibility, we exposed 15-month-old and 4- to 6-year-old close-language bilinguals (Spanish/Catalan) and distant-language bilinguals (Spanish/\u201dother\u201d) to videos of a talker uttering Spanish or Catalan (native) and English (non-native) monologues and recorded eye-gaze to the talker's eyes and mouth. At both ages, the close-language bilinguals attended more to the talker's mouth than the distant-language bilinguals. This indicates that language proximity modulates selective attention to a talker's mouth during early childhood and suggests that reliance on the greater salience of audiovisual speech cues depends on the difficulty of the speech-processing task.", "AuthorKeywords": ["audiovisual speech", "bilingualism", "language development", "linguistic distance", "multisensory perception", "selective attention"], "IndexKeywords": ["Attention", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Cues", "Eye", "Female", "Fixation, Ocular", "Humans", "Infant", "Language", "Language Development", "Male", "Mouth", "Multilingualism", "Speech Perception"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85054638584", "SubjectAreas": [["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"]], "AuthorData": {"57202357716": {"Name": "Birul\u00e9s J.", "AuthorID": "57202357716", "AffiliationID": "60001576", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cognition, Development and Educational Psychology, Universitat de Barcelona"}, "7004972632": {"Name": "Bosch L.", "AuthorID": "7004972632", "AffiliationID": "60001576", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cognition, Development and Educational Psychology, Universitat de Barcelona"}, "57204138694": {"Name": "Brieke R.", "AuthorID": "57204138694", "AffiliationID": "60001576", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cognition, Development and Educational Psychology, Universitat de Barcelona"}, "15840830100": {"Name": "Pons F.", "AuthorID": "15840830100", "AffiliationID": "60001576", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cognition, Development and Educational Psychology, Universitat de Barcelona"}, "7003492749": {"Name": "Lewkowicz D.", "AuthorID": "7003492749", "AffiliationID": "60028628", "AffiliationName": "Department of Communication Sciences and Disorders, Northeastern University"}}}
