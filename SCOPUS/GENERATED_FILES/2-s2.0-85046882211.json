We performed a prospective, clinical trial to identify potential biomarkers associated with clinical outcomes. Tumor tissue was obtained from 38 patients with resectable EAC before and after 2 cycles of oxaliplatin-fluorouracil chemotherapy. Pre-treatment mRNA expression of 280 DNA repair (DNAR) genes was tested for association with histopathological regression at surgery, disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). High expression of 13 DNA damage repair genes was associated with DFS less than one year (P < 0.05); expression of 11 DNAR genes were associated with worse OS (P < 0.05). From clinical associations with outcomes, two genes, ERCC1 and EME1, were identified as candidate biomarkers. In cell lines in vitro, we showed the mechanism of action related to repair of oxaliplatin-induced DNA damage by depletion and knockout of protein binding partners of the candidate biomarkers, XPF and MUS81 respectively. In clinical samples from the clinical trial, pre-treatment XPF protein levels were associated with pathological response, and MUS81 protein was associated with 1-year DFS. XPF and MUS81 merit further validation in prospective clinical trials as biomarkers that may predict clinical response of EAC to oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adenocarcinoma", "Aged", "Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols", "Biomarkers, Tumor", "Disease-Free Survival", "DNA Damage", "DNA-Binding Proteins", "Endonucleases", "Esophageal Neoplasms", "Female", "Fluorouracil", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Oxaliplatin", "Protein Biosynthesis"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85046882211", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"47361303100": {"Name": "MacGregor T.P.", "AuthorID": "47361303100", "AffiliationID": "60002634", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Oxford Biomedical Research Centre, Department of Oncology, University of Oxford"}, "57198722693": {"Name": "Carter R.", "AuthorID": "57198722693", "AffiliationID": "60002634", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Oxford Biomedical Research Centre, Department of Oncology, University of Oxford"}, "15759915300": {"Name": "Gillies R.S.", "AuthorID": "15759915300", "AffiliationID": "60021328", "AffiliationName": "Department of Upper GI Surgery, Churchill Hospital"}, "36628476500": {"Name": "Kartsonaki C.", "AuthorID": "36628476500", "AffiliationID": "60026851, 60022323", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council Population Health Research Unit (MRC PHRU), University of Oxford"}, "18041570100": {"Name": "Cazier J.B.", "AuthorID": "18041570100", "AffiliationID": "60019702, 60033481", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Computational Biology, Institute of Cancer and Genomic Sciences, College of Medical and Dental Sciences, University of Birmingham"}, "7004195101": {"Name": "Buffa F.", "AuthorID": "7004195101", "AffiliationID": "60002634", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Oxford Biomedical Research Centre, Department of Oncology, University of Oxford"}, "7103103337": {"Name": "Middleton M.R.", "AuthorID": "7103103337", "AffiliationID": "60002634", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Oxford Biomedical Research Centre, Department of Oncology, University of Oxford"}, "7407243601": {"Name": "Sharma R.A.", "AuthorID": "7407243601", "AffiliationID": "60024544, 60022148, 60109234", "AffiliationName": "NIHR University College London Hospitals Biomedical Research Centre, UCL Cancer Institute, University College London"}, "35332039000": {"Name": "Findlay J.M.", "AuthorID": "35332039000", "AffiliationID": "60099539, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics, University of Oxford"}, "7003827097": {"Name": "Maynard N.D.", "AuthorID": "7003827097", "AffiliationID": "60021328", "AffiliationName": "Department of Upper GI Surgery, Churchill Hospital"}, "15051462400": {"Name": "Castro-Giner F.", "AuthorID": "15051462400", "AffiliationID": "60099539, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics, University of Oxford"}, "7103338177": {"Name": "Tomlinson I.", "AuthorID": "7103338177", "AffiliationID": "60099539, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics, University of Oxford"}, "54892808800": {"Name": "Sahgal N.", "AuthorID": "54892808800", "AffiliationID": "60008936, 60026851, 60109235", "AffiliationName": "Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, University of Oxford, Nuffield Department of Medicine"}, "16644272300": {"Name": "Wang L.M.", "AuthorID": "16644272300", "AffiliationID": "60013022", "AffiliationName": "Department of Laboratory Medicine, Changi General Hospital"}, "16189046400": {"Name": "Chetty R.", "AuthorID": "16189046400", "AffiliationID": "60014468", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory Medicine Programme, University Health Network"}, "7102159978": {"Name": "McHugh P.J.", "AuthorID": "7102159978", "AffiliationID": "60001633, 60002634", "AffiliationName": "Department of Oncology, Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Oxford"}}}
