Results from the first three studies indicate that animation cues can influence a participant\u2019s perception of both systems\u2019 performance. The subsequent three studies, designed to try and identify an explanation for this effect, suggest that this effect is related to the participants\u2019 mental model of the smart system. The last two studies were designed to characterize the effect more in detail, and they revealed that different amounts of animation do not seem to create substantial differences and that the effect persists even when the system\u2019s performance decreases, but only when the difference in performance level between the systems being compared is small.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Automatic systems", "Crowdsourcing platforms", "Follow-up Studies", "Handwriting recognition", "Mental model", "Part of speech tagging", "Performance level", "Smart System"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85045245801", "SubjectAreas": [["Applied Psychology", "PSYC", "3202"], ["Human-Computer Interaction", "COMP", "1709"]], "AuthorData": {"57201559164": {"Name": "Garc\u00eda Garc\u00eda P.", "AuthorID": "57201559164", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Interaction Centre"}, "57191504484": {"Name": "Verame J.", "AuthorID": "57191504484", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Interaction Centre"}, "6603260372": {"Name": "Ramchurn S.D.", "AuthorID": "6603260372", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "University of Southampton, Agents, Interaction and Complexity Research Group"}, "22834126300": {"Name": "Costanza E.", "AuthorID": "22834126300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Interaction Centre"}, "54795610200": {"Name": "Nowacka D.", "AuthorID": "54795610200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Interaction Centre"}}}
