All rights reserved.Hexagonal diamond has been predicted computationally to display extraordinary physical properties including a hardness that exceeds cubic diamond. However, a recent electron microscopy study has shown that so-called hexagonal diamond samples are in fact not discrete materials but faulted and twinned cubic diamond. We now provide a quantitative analysis of cubic and hexagonal stacking in diamond samples by analysing X-ray diffraction data with the DIFFaX software package. The highest fractions of hexagonal stacking in materials previously referred to as hexagonal diamond are below 60%. The remainder of the stacking sequences is cubic. We show that the cubic and hexagonal sequences are interlaced in a complex way and that naturally occurring Lonsdaleite is not a simple physical mixture of cubic and hexagonal diamond. Instead, it is structurally best described as stacking disordered diamond. The future experimental challenge will be to prepare diamond samples beyond 60% hexagonality and towards the so far elusive perfect hexagonal diamond.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Diamond", "Diffraction", "Lonsdaleite", "Memory effects", "Stacking disorder"], "IndexKeywords": ["Hexagonal diamond", "Hexagonal stacking", "Lonsdaleite", "Memory effects", "Naturally occurring", "Stacking disorders", "Stacking sequence", "X-ray diffraction data"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84942416889", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"], ["Materials Chemistry", "MATE", "2505"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"7004272333": {"Name": "Salzmann C.", "AuthorID": "7004272333", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "25643782300": {"Name": "Shephard J.", "AuthorID": "25643782300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "8404544300": {"Name": "Murray B.", "AuthorID": "8404544300", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Climate, Atmospheric Science, School of Earth and Environment, University of Leeds"}}}
