Evolutionary Bioinformatics aims to provide researchers working in this complex, quickly developing field with online, open access to highly relevant scholarly articles by leading international researchers. In a field where the literature is ever-expanding, researchers increasingly need access to up-to-date, high quality scholarly articles on areas of specific contemporary interest. This supplement aims to address this by presenting high-quality articles that allow readers to distinguish the signal from the noise. The editor in chief hopes that through this effort, practitioners and researchers will be aided in finding answers to some of the most complex and pressing issues of our time.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85033444961", "SubjectAreas": [["Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics", "AGRI", "1105"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"]], "AuthorData": {"25651630400": {"Name": "Itan Y.", "AuthorID": "25651630400", "AffiliationID": "60026827", "AffiliationName": "Human Genetics of Infectious Diseases, The Rockefeller University"}, "29067796800": {"Name": "Gerbault P.", "AuthorID": "29067796800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Genetics, Evolution and Environment, University College London"}, "22942241800": {"Name": "Pines G.", "AuthorID": "22942241800", "AffiliationID": "60000221", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering, University of Colorado at Boulder"}}}
