(1974). Acta Cryst. B30, 1872-1873; Bramnik & Ehrenberg (2004). Z. Anorg. Allg. Chem. 630, 1336-1341]. The unit-cell parameters are in excellent agreement with literature data [Swanson et al. (1962). NBS Monograph No. 25, sect. 1, pp. 46-47] and the structural parameters for the molybdate agree very well with those of Bramnik & Ehrenberg (2004). However, the tungstate structure refinement of Okada et al. (1974) stands apart as being conspicuously inaccurate, giving significantly longer W - O distances, 1.819 (8) \u00c5, and shorter Na - O distances, 2.378 (8) \u00c5, than are reported here or in other simple tungstates. As such, this work represents an order-of-magnitude improvement in precision for sodium molybdate and an equally substantial improvement in both accuracy and precision for sodium tungstate. Both compounds adopt the spinel structure type. The Na+ ions have site symmetry .3\u00afm and are in octahedral coordination while the transition metal atoms have site symmetry 4\u00af3m and are in tetrahedral coordination.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Neutron powder diffraction", "Sodium molybdate", "Sodium tungstate"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84988289222", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"]], "AuthorData": {"7004475745": {"Name": "Fortes A.D.", "AuthorID": "7004475745", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences, Birkbeck, University of London"}}}
