Aim of the study was to assess the relative contributions of macro- and microstructural changes of both normal and abnormal brain tissues, probed, respectively, by their volumes and relaxation rates, to the cognitive status and physical disability of MS patients. Methods: MRI studies from 241 patients with relapsing\u2013remitting MS were retrospectively analyzed by fully automated multiparametric relaxometric segmentation. Ordinal backward regression analysis was applied to the resulting volumes and relaxation rates of both normal (gray matter, normal-appearing white matter and CSF) and abnormal (T2-weighted lesions) brain tissues, controlling for age, sex and disease duration, to identify the main independent contributors to the cognitive status, as measured by the percentage of failed tests at a cognitive test battery (Rao\u2019s Brief Repeatable Battery and Stroop test, available in 186 patients), and to the physical disability, as assessed by the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS). Results: The R1 relaxation rate (a putative marker of tissue disruption) of the MS lesions appeared the single most significant contributor to cognitive impairment (p < 0.001). On the contrary, the EDSS appeared mainly affected by the decrease in R2 of the gray matter (p < 0.0001), (possibly influenced by cortical plaques, edema and inflammation). Conclusions: In RR-MS the tissue damage in white matter lesions appears the single main determinant of the cognitive status of patients, likely through disconnection phenomena, while the physical disability appears related to the involvement of gray matter.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Atrophy", "Cognitive impairment", "Multiple sclerosis", "Quantitative MRI", "Relapsing/remitting", "Relaxation rates"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Atrophy", "Cognitive Dysfunction", "Female", "Gray Matter", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Multiple Sclerosis, Relapsing-Remitting", "Severity of Illness Index", "White Matter", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85057892300", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"15623482600": {"Name": "Megna R.", "AuthorID": "15623482600", "AffiliationID": "60021199", "AffiliationName": "Biostructure and Bioimaging Institute, National Research Council"}, "7004520957": {"Name": "Alfano B.", "AuthorID": "7004520957", "AffiliationID": "60021199", "AffiliationName": "Biostructure and Bioimaging Institute, National Research Council"}, "23468630400": {"Name": "Comerci M.", "AuthorID": "23468630400", "AffiliationID": "60021199", "AffiliationName": "Biostructure and Bioimaging Institute, National Research Council"}, "6602601996": {"Name": "Prinster A.", "AuthorID": "6602601996", "AffiliationID": "60021199", "AffiliationName": "Biostructure and Bioimaging Institute, National Research Council"}, "7004524756": {"Name": "Quarantelli M.", "AuthorID": "7004524756", "AffiliationID": "60021199", "AffiliationName": "Biostructure and Bioimaging Institute, National Research Council"}, "57206717484": {"Name": "Lanzillo R.", "AuthorID": "57206717484", "AffiliationID": "60017293", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurosciences, Reproductive Science and Odontostomatology, University \u201cFederico II\u201d"}, "6508355529": {"Name": "Costabile T.", "AuthorID": "6508355529", "AffiliationID": "60017293", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurosciences, Reproductive Science and Odontostomatology, University \u201cFederico II\u201d"}, "57201598911": {"Name": "Vacca G.", "AuthorID": "57201598911", "AffiliationID": "60017293", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurosciences, Reproductive Science and Odontostomatology, University \u201cFederico II\u201d"}, "55173366900": {"Name": "Carotenuto A.", "AuthorID": "55173366900", "AffiliationID": "60017293", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurosciences, Reproductive Science and Odontostomatology, University \u201cFederico II\u201d"}, "36461391900": {"Name": "Moccia M.", "AuthorID": "36461391900", "AffiliationID": "60017293", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurosciences, Reproductive Science and Odontostomatology, University \u201cFederico II\u201d"}, "57188634755": {"Name": "Servillo G.", "AuthorID": "57188634755", "AffiliationID": "60017293", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurosciences, Reproductive Science and Odontostomatology, University \u201cFederico II\u201d"}, "6603751678": {"Name": "Brescia Morra V.", "AuthorID": "6603751678", "AffiliationID": "60017293", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurosciences, Reproductive Science and Odontostomatology, University \u201cFederico II\u201d"}}}
