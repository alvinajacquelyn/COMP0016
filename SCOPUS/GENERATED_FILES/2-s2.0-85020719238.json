The improvements have been confirmed by detailed photoluminescence measurements, which showed up to a 10-fold increase in the intensity of room-temperature photoluminescence from the capped InAs/InP nanowires compared to the sample with core-only InAs nanowires. Moreover, the nanowires exhibit a high stability of total photoluminescence emission strength across temperature range from 10 to 300 K as a result of strong quantum confinement. These findings could be the key to successful implementation of InAs nanowires into optoelectronic devices.", "AuthorKeywords": ["InAs", "Nanowires", "photoluminescence", "self-catalyzed"], "IndexKeywords": ["InAs", "Non-radiative recombinations", "Optical performance", "Photoluminescence emission", "Photoluminescence measurements", "Room-temperature photoluminescence", "Self-catalyzed", "Temperature range"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85020719238", "SubjectAreas": [["Bioengineering", "CENG", "1502"], ["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"]], "AuthorData": {"56897244300": {"Name": "Jurczak P.", "AuthorID": "56897244300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "37017831000": {"Name": "Zhang Y.", "AuthorID": "37017831000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "10141185300": {"Name": "Wu J.", "AuthorID": "10141185300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "15765485000": {"Name": "Liu H.", "AuthorID": "15765485000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "56946096400": {"Name": "Sanchez A.M.", "AuthorID": "56946096400", "AffiliationID": "60022020", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of Warwick"}, "12787101800": {"Name": "Aagesen M.", "AuthorID": "12787101800", "AffiliationID": "60017041, 60030840", "AffiliationName": "Center for Quantum Devices, Niels Bohr Institute, University of Copenhagen"}}}
