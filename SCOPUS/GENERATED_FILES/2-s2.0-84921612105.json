Liver perfusion imaging has the potential to fulfil this need, across a range of hepatic diseases, alongside the assessment of therapeutic response. In this study, the feasibility of hepatic arterial spin labelling (HASL) was assessed for the first time in mice at 9.4T, its variability and repeatability were evaluated, and it was applied to a model of colorectal liver metastasis. Data were acquired using flow-sensitive alternating inversion recovery-arterial spin labelling (FAIR-ASL) with a Look-Locker readout, and analysed using retrospective respiratory gating and a T1-based quantification. This study shows that preclinical HASL is feasible and exhibits good repeatability and reproducibility. Mean estimated liver perfusion was 2.2\u00b10.8mL/g/min (mean\u00b1standard error, n=10), which agrees well with previous measurements using invasive approaches. Estimates of the variation gave a within-session coefficient of variation (CVWS) of 7%, a between-session coefficient of variation (CVBS) of 9% and a between-animal coefficient of variation (CVA) of 15%. The within-session Bland-Altman repeatability coefficient (RCWS) was 18% and the between-session repeatability coefficient (RCBS) was 29%. Finally, the HASL method was applied to a mouse model of liver metastasis, in which significantly lower mean perfusion (1.1\u00b10.5mL/g/min, n=6) was measured within the tumours, as seen by fluorescence histology. These data indicate that precise and accurate liver perfusion estimates can be achieved using ASL techniques, and provide a platform for future studies investigating hepatic perfusion in mouse models of disease.", "AuthorKeywords": ["ASL", "Liver", "Metastasis", "Mouse", "Perfusion", "Preclinical", "Repeatability", "Variability"], "IndexKeywords": ["ASL", "Metastasis", "Mouse", "Perfusion", "Preclinical", "Repeatability", "Variability", "Animals", "Female", "Hepatic Artery", "Liver Neoplasms", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Mice, Inbred BALB C", "Perfusion", "Reproducibility of Results", "Spin Labels"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84921612105", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Medicine", "BIOC", "1313"], ["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"], ["Spectroscopy", "CHEM", "1607"]], "AuthorData": {"55780918900": {"Name": "Ramasawmy R.", "AuthorID": "55780918900", "AffiliationID": "60109234", "AffiliationName": "UCL Cancer Institute"}, "55070698800": {"Name": "Campbell-Washburn A.", "AuthorID": "55070698800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Centre for Advanced Biomedical Imaging"}, "35220662900": {"Name": "Wells J.", "AuthorID": "35220662900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Centre for Advanced Biomedical Imaging"}, "57037614100": {"Name": "Johnson S.", "AuthorID": "57037614100", "AffiliationID": "60109234", "AffiliationName": "UCL Cancer Institute"}, "57203674289": {"Name": "Walker-Samuel S.", "AuthorID": "57203674289", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Centre for Advanced Biomedical Imaging"}, "7004107686": {"Name": "Lythgoe M.", "AuthorID": "7004107686", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Centre for Advanced Biomedical Imaging"}, "7006757998": {"Name": "Pedley R.", "AuthorID": "7006757998", "AffiliationID": "60109234", "AffiliationName": "UCL Cancer Institute"}}}
