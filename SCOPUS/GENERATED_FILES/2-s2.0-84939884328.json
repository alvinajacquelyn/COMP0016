In the latter, it is associated with a set of neurological and psychiatric abnormalities termed hepatic encephalopathy. The aims of our study were: 1. to measure vigilance in a condition of induced hyperammonaemia; 2. to assess whether caffeine modulates the effects of hyperammonaemia on vigilance, if any. Ten healthy volunteers (28.5 \u00b1 5 years; 5 males) underwent three experimental sessions consisting of two-hourly measurements of capillary ammonia, subjective sleepiness (Karolinska Sleepiness Scale) and vigilance (Psychomotor Vigilance Task, PVT), in relation to the intake of breakfast (+/\u2212coffee), an amino acid mixture which induces hyperammonaemia (amino acid challenge; AAC), and AAC+coffee (only for participants who had coffee with their standard breakfast). The AAC resulted in: 1. the expected increase in capillary ammonia levels, with highest values at approximately 4 h after the administration; 2. a significant increase in subjective sleepiness ratings; 3. a sustained increase in PVT-based reaction times. When caffeine was administered after the AAC, both subjective sleepiness and the slowing in RTs were significantly milder than in the AAC-only condition. In conclusion, acute hyperammonaemia induces an increase in subjective sleepiness and a sustained decrease in vigilance, which are attenuated by the administration of a single espresso coffee.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Caffeine", "Hyperammonaemia", "Sleepiness", "Vigilance"], "IndexKeywords": ["Acute Disease", "Adult", "Amino Acids", "Arousal", "Breakfast", "Caffeine", "Capillaries", "Coffee", "Humans", "Hyperammonemia", "Male", "Medical Records", "Psychomotor Performance", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84939884328", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"]], "AuthorData": {"55613454600": {"Name": "Casula E.P.", "AuthorID": "55613454600", "AffiliationID": "60000481", "AffiliationName": "Department of General Psychology, University of Padova"}, "55974812200": {"Name": "Corrias M.", "AuthorID": "55974812200", "AffiliationID": "60000481", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, University of Padova"}, "10639238400": {"Name": "Schiff S.", "AuthorID": "10639238400", "AffiliationID": "60000481", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, University of Padova"}, "7006536276": {"Name": "Merkel C.", "AuthorID": "7006536276", "AffiliationID": "60000481", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, University of Padova"}, "36146600100": {"Name": "Amodio P.", "AuthorID": "36146600100", "AffiliationID": "60000481", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, University of Padova"}, "8778703700": {"Name": "Montagnese S.", "AuthorID": "8778703700", "AffiliationID": "60000481", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, University of Padova"}, "6601971340": {"Name": "Bisiacchi P.S.", "AuthorID": "6601971340", "AffiliationID": "60000481", "AffiliationName": "Department of General Psychology, University of Padova"}}}
