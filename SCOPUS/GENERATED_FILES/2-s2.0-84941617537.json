Previously, the standard of care for such patients was expectant management. These three new criteria are: greater than 60% clonal plasma cells on bone marrow biopsy, a serum free light chain (sFLC) ratio of >100 (the involved sFLC must be >100 mg/l) and greater than one unequivocal focal lesion on advanced imaging (low dose whole body computerized tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, 18F fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography). Although this would appear to affect a small number of patients, the impact of these changes are broad, leading to an increased use of advanced imaging, a debate around the management of patients previously diagnosed with smouldering myeloma, changed terminology and clinical trial design and an extension of the use of biomarkers. For the first time the philosophy of treatment in myeloma will change from treatment initiation only being triggered by overt end organ damage to an era where sub clinical risk factors will also be taken into account.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Imaging", "Multiple myeloma", "Prognostic markers", "Smouldering myeloma"], "IndexKeywords": ["Biomarkers, Tumor", "Humans", "Multiple Myeloma"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84941617537", "SubjectAreas": [["Hematology", "MEDI", "2720"]], "AuthorData": {"7102505417": {"Name": "Pratt G.", "AuthorID": "7102505417", "AffiliationID": "60026493", "AffiliationName": "Heart of England NHS Foundation Trust"}, "6603694557": {"Name": "Bowcock S.", "AuthorID": "6603694557", "AffiliationID": "60010088, 60029685", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, Princess Royal Hospital"}, "56742211200": {"Name": "Chantry A.", "AuthorID": "56742211200", "AffiliationID": "60008750", "AffiliationName": "Department of Oncology, University of Sheffield Medical School"}, "24823929200": {"Name": "Cook G.", "AuthorID": "24823929200", "AffiliationID": "60020454", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, St James's University Hospital"}, "56596067800": {"Name": "Jackson G.", "AuthorID": "56596067800", "AffiliationID": "60006222", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, University of Newcastle"}, "55668311100": {"Name": "Lai M.", "AuthorID": "55668311100", "AffiliationID": "60112393", "AffiliationName": "Myeloma UK"}, "7004380751": {"Name": "Low E.", "AuthorID": "7004380751", "AffiliationID": "60112393", "AffiliationName": "Myeloma UK"}, "55755939400": {"Name": "Mulholland N.", "AuthorID": "55755939400", "AffiliationID": "60021923", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Kings College Hospital"}, "7401888148": {"Name": "Owen R.", "AuthorID": "7401888148", "AffiliationID": "60006866", "AffiliationName": "HMDS Laboratory, Leeds General Infirmary"}, "22136212200": {"Name": "Rabin N.", "AuthorID": "22136212200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, University College London"}, "7102064249": {"Name": "Yong K.", "AuthorID": "7102064249", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, University College London"}, "16242481200": {"Name": "Ramasamy K.", "AuthorID": "16242481200", "AffiliationID": "60170323, 60172675, 60172638", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, Oxford University Hospitals NHS Trust and National Institute for Health Research (NIHR), Oxford Biomedical Research Centre"}, "7005452706": {"Name": "Snowden J.A.", "AuthorID": "7005452706", "AffiliationID": "60006444", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, Royal Hallamshire Hospital"}, "6603177525": {"Name": "Streetly M.", "AuthorID": "6603177525", "AffiliationID": "60005518", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, Guys and St. Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust"}, "6506002568": {"Name": "Wechalekar A.", "AuthorID": "6506002568", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "National Amyloidosis Centre, University College London"}, "7202877812": {"Name": "Bird J.", "AuthorID": "7202877812", "AffiliationID": "60170515", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, University Hospitals Bristol Foundation Trust"}}}
