However, TBI causes profound short-term and long-term side effects, provoking the necessity for alternative regimens. Treosulfan combines a potent immunosuppressive and antileukaemic effect with myeloablative activity and low toxicity profile. We retrospectively studied toxicity and outcome of 71 paediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) undergoing haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) following treosulfan-based conditioning aiming to identify risk factors for treatment failure and dose-depending outcome differences. Early regimen-related toxicity was low. No case of veno-occlusive disease was reported. There was no association of toxicity with age or number of HSCT. Event-free survival (EFS) of infants was significantly better compared to older children. Overall survival (OS) at 3 years was 51 % and not significantly influenced by number of HSCT (first HSCT 54 %, \u2265second HSCT 44 %, p = 0.71). In multivariate analysis, OS and EFS were significantly worse for patients transplanted without complete remission (p = 0.04 and 0.004). Treatment-related mortality was low at 14 %. We conclude that treosulfan-based conditioning is a safe and efficacious approach for paediatric ALL.", "AuthorKeywords": ["ALL", "Paediatrics", "Stem cell transplantation", "Toxicity", "Treosulfan"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols", "Busulfan", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Diarrhea", "Disease-Free Survival", "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug", "Female", "Graft vs Host Disease", "Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation", "Humans", "Infant", "Male", "Multivariate Analysis", "Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma", "Remission Induction", "Retrospective Studies", "Stomatitis", "Transplantation Conditioning", "Transplantation, Homologous", "Treatment Outcome", "Vomiting"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84926614762", "SubjectAreas": [["Hematology", "MEDI", "2720"]], "AuthorData": {"55249715600": {"Name": "Boztug H.", "AuthorID": "55249715600", "AffiliationID": "60011394, 60000852", "AffiliationName": "St. Anna Kinderspital and Children\u2019s Cancer Research Institute, Department of Paediatrics, Medical University of Vienna"}, "6602095305": {"Name": "P\u00f6tschger U.", "AuthorID": "6602095305", "AffiliationID": "60011394, 60000852", "AffiliationName": "St. Anna Kinderspital and Children\u2019s Cancer Research Institute, Department of Paediatrics, Medical University of Vienna"}, "56043166300": {"Name": "Glogova E.", "AuthorID": "56043166300", "AffiliationID": "60011394, 60000852", "AffiliationName": "St. Anna Kinderspital and Children\u2019s Cancer Research Institute, Department of Paediatrics, Medical University of Vienna"}, "7402558760": {"Name": "Peters C.", "AuthorID": "7402558760", "AffiliationID": "60011394, 60000852", "AffiliationName": "St. Anna Kinderspital and Children\u2019s Cancer Research Institute, Department of Paediatrics, Medical University of Vienna"}, "7006091759": {"Name": "Zecca M.", "AuthorID": "7006091759", "AffiliationID": "60026556", "AffiliationName": "Paediatric Haematology/Oncology, Fondazione IRCCS, Policlinico San Matteo Foundation"}, "7005510047": {"Name": "Sykora K.W.", "AuthorID": "7005510047", "AffiliationID": "60024052", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Hematology/Oncology, Hannover Medical School"}, "57203102921": {"Name": "Veys P.", "AuthorID": "57203102921", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children National Health Service Trust"}, "7003607459": {"Name": "Lankester A.", "AuthorID": "7003607459", "AffiliationID": "60015618", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatrics, Leiden University Medical Center"}, "6507443729": {"Name": "Slatter M.", "AuthorID": "6507443729", "AffiliationID": "109666601", "AffiliationName": "Paediatric Immunology Department, Great North Children\u2019s Hospital"}, "7202587597": {"Name": "Skinner R.", "AuthorID": "7202587597", "AffiliationID": "60024240", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric and Adolescent Haematology and Oncology, and Children\u2019s HSCT Unit, Great North Children\u2019s Hospital, Royal Victoria Infirmary"}, "56265101500": {"Name": "Wachowiak J.", "AuthorID": "56265101500", "AffiliationID": "60069010", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Haematology, Oncology, and Haematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, University of Medical Sciences"}}}
