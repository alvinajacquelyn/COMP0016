They are caused by impaired T:B cooperation or intrinsic B cell defects. However, many immunoglobulin CSR-Ds are still undefined at the molecular level. Objective This study's objective was to delineate new causes of immunoglobulin CSR-Ds and thus gain further insights into the process of immunoglobulin class-switch recombination (CSR). Methods Exome sequencing in 2 immunoglobulin CSR-D patients identified variations in the INO80 gene. Functional experiments were performed to assess the function of INO80 on immunoglobulin CSR. Results We identified recessive, nonsynonymous coding variations in the INO80 gene in 2 patients affected by defective immunoglobulin CSR. Expression of wild-type INO80 in patients' fibroblastic cells corrected their hypersensitivity to high doses of \u03b3-irradiation. In murine CH12-F3 cells, the INO80 complex accumulates at S\u03b1 and E\u03bc regions of the IgH locus, and downregulation of INO80 as well as its partners Reptin and Pontin impaired CSR. In addition, Reptin and Pontin were shown to interact with activation-induced cytidine deaminase. Finally, an abnormal separation of sister chromatids was observed upon INO80 downregulation in CH12-F3 cells, pinpointing its role in cohesin activity. Conclusion INO80 deficiency appears to be associated with defective immunoglobulin CSR. We propose that the INO80 complex modulates cohesin function that may be required during immunoglobulin switch region synapsis.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Chromatin remodeling", "class-switch recombination defect", "cohesin", "CSR synapse"], "IndexKeywords": ["Carrier Proteins", "Cell Cycle Proteins", "Cell Line", "Cell Survival", "Chromatin Assembly and Disassembly", "Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone", "DNA Helicases", "DNA Repair", "Gene Expression Regulation", "Gene Rearrangement", "Genetic Variation", "Humans", "Immunoglobulin Class Switching", "Immunoglobulin Isotypes", "Immunoglobulin Switch Region", "Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes", "Models, Biological", "Protein Binding", "Protein Transport"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84926209058", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"]], "AuthorData": {"16637781900": {"Name": "Kracker S.", "AuthorID": "16637781900", "AffiliationID": "60123796, 60123804", "AffiliationName": "Paris Descartes Sorbonne Paris Cit\u00e9 University, Imagine Institute"}, "56354711800": {"Name": "Deau M.C.", "AuthorID": "56354711800", "AffiliationID": "60123796, 60123804", "AffiliationName": "Paris Descartes Sorbonne Paris Cit\u00e9 University, Imagine Institute"}, "56060661500": {"Name": "Cavazzana M.", "AuthorID": "56060661500", "AffiliationID": "60021567, 60000905", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Investigation Center (CIC)-Biotherapy GHU Ouest, INSERM-APHP (Assistance Publique des H\u00f4pitaux de Paris)"}, "36047665000": {"Name": "Fischer A.", "AuthorID": "36047665000", "AffiliationID": "107897667", "AffiliationName": "Coll\u00e8ge de France"}, "57204341996": {"Name": "Durandy A.", "AuthorID": "57204341996", "AffiliationID": "60026877", "AffiliationName": "Department of Immunology and Hematology, H\u00f4pital Necker Enfants Malades"}, "9739375100": {"Name": "Di Virgilio M.", "AuthorID": "9739375100", "AffiliationID": "60026827, 60009470", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Molecular Immunology, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Rockefeller University"}, "7006565414": {"Name": "McBride K.M.", "AuthorID": "7006565414", "AffiliationID": "60026827, 60009470", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Molecular Immunology, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Rockefeller University"}, "6603147611": {"Name": "Gazumyan A.", "AuthorID": "6603147611", "AffiliationID": "60026827, 60009470", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Molecular Immunology, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Rockefeller University"}, "7005243263": {"Name": "Nussenzweig M.C.", "AuthorID": "7005243263", "AffiliationID": "60026827, 60009470", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Molecular Immunology, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Rockefeller University"}, "25226022600": {"Name": "Schwartzentruber J.", "AuthorID": "25226022600", "AffiliationID": "60002494", "AffiliationName": "Department of Human Genetics, McGill University and Genome Quebec Innovation Centre"}, "35986079400": {"Name": "Majewski J.", "AuthorID": "35986079400", "AffiliationID": "60002494", "AffiliationName": "Department of Human Genetics, McGill University and Genome Quebec Innovation Centre"}, "6603484704": {"Name": "Cuenin C.", "AuthorID": "6603484704", "AffiliationID": "60024610", "AffiliationName": "International Agency for Research on Cancer"}, "7004082002": {"Name": "Herceg Z.", "AuthorID": "7004082002", "AffiliationID": "60024610", "AffiliationName": "International Agency for Research on Cancer"}, "6602928525": {"Name": "Forveille M.", "AuthorID": "6602928525", "AffiliationID": "60026877", "AffiliationName": "Center for Primary Immunodeficiencies, H\u00f4pital Necker Enfants Malades"}, "7003499455": {"Name": "Seneviratne S.", "AuthorID": "7003499455", "AffiliationID": "60170516, 60176023", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Immunity and Transplantation, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Tust"}, "26643476400": {"Name": "Grimbacher B.", "AuthorID": "26643476400", "AffiliationID": "60024805, 60025641", "AffiliationName": "Centre of Chronic Immunodeficiency, University Medical Center Freiburg, University of Freiburg"}, "7006914574": {"Name": "Kutukculer N.", "AuthorID": "7006914574", "AffiliationID": "60009761", "AffiliationName": "Ege University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Pediatric Immunology"}, "56238459200": {"Name": "Jabado N.", "AuthorID": "56238459200", "AffiliationID": "60006558, 60002494", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatrics, McGill University and McGill University Health Center"}}}
