All rights reserved.The addition of wealth-attained advantage (WAA) to the Yard-Sale Model (YSM) of asset exchange has been demonstrated to induce wealth condensation. In models of WAA for which the bias is a continuous function of the wealth difference of the transacting agents, the condensation arises from a second-order phase transition to a coexistence regime. In this paper, we present the first analytic time-dependent results for this model, by showing that the condensed wealth obeys a simple logistic equation in time.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Asset exchange model", "Fokker-planck equation", "Gibrat's law", "Gini coefficient", "Lorenz curve", "Lorenz-pareto exponent", "Pareto distribution", "Phase coexistence", "Phase transitions", "Wealth condensation", "Yard-sale model"], "IndexKeywords": ["Exchange models", "Gibrat's laws", "Gini coefficients", "Lorenz curves", "Pareto distributions", "Pareto exponent", "Phase co-existence", "Yard-sale"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84979544805", "SubjectAreas": [["Information Systems", "COMP", "1710"]], "AuthorData": {"7003751139": {"Name": "Boghosian B.M.", "AuthorID": "7003751139", "AffiliationID": "60023143", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, Tufts University"}, "57188845407": {"Name": "Devitt-Lee A.", "AuthorID": "57188845407", "AffiliationID": "60023143", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, Tufts University"}, "57190373837": {"Name": "Wang H.", "AuthorID": "57190373837", "AffiliationID": "60023143", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, Tufts University"}}}
