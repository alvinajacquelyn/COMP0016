The as-prepared nanopowders were characterized via a range of analytical techniques including powder X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X-ray fluorescence spectrometry, transmission electron microscopy, thermogravimetric analysis and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area measurements. Doped SnO2 materials were grouped into two classes according to the potential redox activity of the dopant (those presumed to be redox inactive: Nb, Ti, Zr; and those presumed to be redox active: Fe, Co, Cu, Zn, Mn, Ni). The role of the transition metal ion dopant on the cycling performance (overall capacity and voltage hysteresis), was elucidated for the first cycle via cyclic voltammetry measurements in half cells versus lithium metal. In particular, the authors were able to evaluate whether the initial Coulombic efficiency and the delithiation potential (vs. Li/Li+) of the doped samples, would be likely to offer any increased energy density (compared to undoped SnO2) for lithium ion batteries.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Anode", "Continuous Hydrothermal Flow Synthesis", "Lithium ion battery", "Nano", "Tin dioxide"], "IndexKeywords": ["Brunauer-emmett-teller surface areas", "Continuous hydrothermal flow synthesis", "Hydrothermal process", "Initial Coulombic efficiency", "Nano", "Negative electrode material", "Powder X ray diffraction", "Voltammetry measurements"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85019560610", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"], ["Electrochemistry", "CHEM", "1603"]], "AuthorData": {"55226279200": {"Name": "L\u00fcbke M.", "AuthorID": "55226279200", "AffiliationID": "60030743, 60025710", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Materials Research and Engineering (IMRE), A\u22c6STAR (Agency for Science, Technology and Research)"}, "57190813721": {"Name": "Howard D.", "AuthorID": "57190813721", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "6603926697": {"Name": "Darr J.", "AuthorID": "6603926697", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "57194285749": {"Name": "Ning D.", "AuthorID": "57194285749", "AffiliationID": "60030743, 60025710", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Materials Research and Engineering (IMRE), A\u22c6STAR (Agency for Science, Technology and Research)"}, "57193522107": {"Name": "Armer C.", "AuthorID": "57193522107", "AffiliationID": "60008950", "AffiliationName": "College of Engineering and Computer Science, Australian National University"}, "55820974500": {"Name": "Liu Z.", "AuthorID": "55820974500", "AffiliationID": "60030743, 60025710", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Materials Research and Engineering (IMRE), A\u22c6STAR (Agency for Science, Technology and Research)"}, "13805905800": {"Name": "Brett D.", "AuthorID": "13805905800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electrochemical Innovation Lab, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}}}
