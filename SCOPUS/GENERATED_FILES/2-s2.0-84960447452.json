This is performed in a mathematically rigorous way using the ORAC optimal estimation retrieval framework, which includes the facility to use such independent a priori information. Key to the use of a priori information is a characterisation of their associated uncertainty. This paper demonstrates the improvements that are possible using this approach and also considers their impact on the microphysical cloud parameters retrieved. The Along-Track Scanning Radiometer (AATSR) instrument has two views and three thermal channels, so it is well placed to demonstrate the synergy of the two techniques. The stereo retrieval is able to improve the accuracy of the retrieved cloud top height when compared to collocated Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO), particularly in the presence of boundary layer inversions and high clouds. The impact of the stereo a priori information on the microphysical cloud properties of cloud optical thickness (COT) and effective radius (RE) was evaluated and generally found to be very small for single-layer clouds conditions over open water (mean RE differences of 2.2 (\u00b15.9) microns and mean COD differences of 0.5 (\u00b11.8) for single-layer ice clouds over open water at elevations of above 9 km, which are most strongly affected by the inclusion of the a priori).", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84960447452", "SubjectAreas": [["Atmospheric Science", "EART", "1902"]], "AuthorData": {"37115472400": {"Name": "Fisher D.", "AuthorID": "37115472400", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Earth and Environmental Dynamics Research Group, Department of Geography, King's College London"}, "7404871794": {"Name": "Muller J.P.", "AuthorID": "7404871794", "AffiliationID": "60084281, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Imaging Group, Mullard Space Science Laboratory, University College London"}, "15840467900": {"Name": "Poulsen C.A.", "AuthorID": "15840467900", "AffiliationID": "60023254", "AffiliationName": "Rutherford Appleton Laboratory"}, "56920790500": {"Name": "Thomas G.E.", "AuthorID": "56920790500", "AffiliationID": "60023254", "AffiliationName": "Rutherford Appleton Laboratory"}}}
