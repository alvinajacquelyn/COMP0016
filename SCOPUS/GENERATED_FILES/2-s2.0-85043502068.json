Aims: To investigate the effect of cholinesterase inhibitors or memantine on survival and function in adults with Down syndrome and Alzheimer's disease. Method: This was a naturalistic longitudinal follow-up of a clinical cohort of 310 people with Down syndrome diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease collected from specialist community services in England. Results: Median survival time (5.59 years, 95% CI 4.67-6.67) for those on medication (n = 145, mainly cholinesterase inhibitors) was significantly greater than for those not prescribed medication (n = 165) (3.45 years, 95% CI 2.91-4.13, log-rank test P<0.001). Sequential assessments demonstrated an early effect in maintaining cognitive function. Conclusions: Cholinesterase inhibitors appear to offer benefit for people with Down syndrome and Alzheimer's disease that is comparable with sporadic Alzheimer's disease; a trial to test the effect of earlier treatment (prodromal Alzheimer's disease) in Down syndrome may be indicated.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Alzheimer Disease", "Cholinesterase Inhibitors", "Cohort Studies", "Comorbidity", "Down Syndrome", "Excitatory Amino Acid Antagonists", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Memantine", "Middle Aged"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85043502068", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"57193882365": {"Name": "Eady N.", "AuthorID": "57193882365", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, University College London, 6th Floor Maple House, 149 Tottenham Court Rd."}, "55749264700": {"Name": "Sheehan R.", "AuthorID": "55749264700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, University College London, 6th Floor Maple House, 149 Tottenham Court Rd."}, "35192349200": {"Name": "Sinai A.", "AuthorID": "35192349200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, University College London, 6th Floor Maple House, 149 Tottenham Court Rd."}, "6701753786": {"Name": "Hassiotis A.", "AuthorID": "6701753786", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, University College London, 6th Floor Maple House, 149 Tottenham Court Rd."}, "36830984200": {"Name": "Walker Z.", "AuthorID": "36830984200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, University College London, 6th Floor Maple House, 149 Tottenham Court Rd."}, "56079439400": {"Name": "Strydom A.", "AuthorID": "56079439400", "AffiliationID": "119045724", "AffiliationName": "LonDownS Consortium"}, "15061701400": {"Name": "Rantell K.", "AuthorID": "15061701400", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Education Unit, Institute of Neurology"}, "14033847500": {"Name": "Bernal J.", "AuthorID": "14033847500", "AffiliationID": "60170524", "AffiliationName": "Cornwall Partnership Foundation Trust"}, "55260803400": {"Name": "Bohnen I.", "AuthorID": "55260803400", "AffiliationID": "110014103", "AffiliationName": "Westminster Learning Disability Partnership"}, "48060961600": {"Name": "Bonell S.", "AuthorID": "48060961600", "AffiliationID": "110013759", "AffiliationName": "Plymouth Community Learning Disabilities Team"}, "6602795544": {"Name": "Courtenay K.", "AuthorID": "6602795544", "AffiliationID": "60099553", "AffiliationName": "Haringey Learning Disability Partnership, Barnet Enfield Haringey Mental Health NHS Trust"}, "36349697100": {"Name": "Dodd K.", "AuthorID": "36349697100", "AffiliationID": "60170280", "AffiliationName": "Surrey and Borders Partnership NHS Foundation Trust"}, "6507317009": {"Name": "Gazizova D.", "AuthorID": "6507317009", "AffiliationID": "100451729", "AffiliationName": "Hillingdon Learning Disabilities Service"}, "57200037240": {"Name": "Hillier R.", "AuthorID": "57200037240", "AffiliationID": "114027629", "AffiliationName": "Islington Learning Disabilities Partnership"}, "6602695908": {"Name": "McBrien J.", "AuthorID": "6602695908", "AffiliationID": "60029723", "AffiliationName": "Plymouth Teaching Primary Care Trust"}, "56111038300": {"Name": "Mukherji K.", "AuthorID": "56111038300", "AffiliationID": "60170490", "AffiliationName": "Hertfordshire Partnership NHS Foundation Trust"}, "56527594600": {"Name": "Sharma V.", "AuthorID": "56527594600", "AffiliationID": "60170490", "AffiliationName": "Hertfordshire Partnership NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7004232540": {"Name": "Naeem A.", "AuthorID": "7004232540", "AffiliationID": "60025781", "AffiliationName": "South West London and St George's Mental Health NHS Trust"}, "26667199800": {"Name": "Perez-Achiaga N.", "AuthorID": "26667199800", "AffiliationID": "100423854", "AffiliationName": "Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea Learning Disability Service"}, "57207809760": {"Name": "Thomas D.", "AuthorID": "57207809760", "AffiliationID": "60099152", "AffiliationName": "Hackney Learning Disability Team, East London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57200265354": {"Name": "McCarthy J.", "AuthorID": "57200265354", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London"}}}
