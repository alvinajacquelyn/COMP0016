Areas covered: This paper reviews studies in which the long-term effects of guided ICBT were investigated. Following literature searches in PubMed and other sources meta-analytic statistics were calculated for 14 studies involving a total of 902 participants, and an average follow-up period of three years. Studies were from Sweden (n = 11) or the Netherlands (n = 3). Long-term outcome studies were found for panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, depression, mixed anxiety and depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, pathological gambling, stress and chronic fatigue. The duration of the treatments was usually short (8\u201315 weeks). The pre-to follow-up effect size was Hedge\u2019s g = 1.52, but with a significant heterogeneity. The average symptom improvement across studies was 50%. Treatment seeking in the follow-up period was not documented and few studies mentioned negative effects. Expert commentary: While effects may be overestimated, it is likely that therapist-supported ICBT can have enduring effects. Long-term follow-up data should be collected for more conditions and new technologies like smartphone-delivered treatments.", "AuthorKeywords": ["anxiety", "cognitive behaviour therapy", "depression", "Internet delivery", "long-term effects", "somatic problems"], "IndexKeywords": ["Anxiety Disorders", "Chronic Disease", "Cognitive Behavioral Therapy", "Depressive Disorder", "Fatigue", "Gambling", "Humans", "Internet", "Mental Disorders", "Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder", "Smartphone", "Stress, Psychological", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85037989813", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"7202645907": {"Name": "Andersson G.", "AuthorID": "7202645907", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Neuroscience, Psychiatry Section, Karolinska Institutet"}, "55933429800": {"Name": "Rozental A.", "AuthorID": "55933429800", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "6603291354": {"Name": "Carlbring P.", "AuthorID": "6603291354", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "7003543961": {"Name": "Shafran R.", "AuthorID": "7003543961", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Child Health, University College London"}}}
