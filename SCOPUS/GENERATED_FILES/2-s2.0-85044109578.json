It was then co-dissolved with the pH-sensitive polymer Eudragit\u00ae L100-55 (EL100-55) and processed into fibers using electrospinning. Ketoprofen (KET), a model drug, was also incorporated into the composite fibers, and fibers based on a single polymer additionally prepared. The fibers had smooth cylindrical morphologies, and no obvious phase separation could be seen. Using X-ray diffraction, KET was determined to be present in the amorphous state in the fiber matrix. FTIR spectroscopy also indicated the successful incorporation of amorphous KET in the fibers. In vitro drug release studies in media at different pH (4.5 or 7.4) or temperature (25 and 37 \u00b0C) showed that the release of KET from the blend PNIPAAm/EL100-55 fibers was dependent both on environmental temperature and pH, reflecting the dual-responsive properties of the fibers. The MTT assay was used to explore the biocompatibility of the PNIPAAm/EL100-55 composite fibers towards L929 fibroblasts. Viability was always found to be >80%, even at polymer concentrations of 100 mg/L. Therefore, the fibers prepared here could lead to the development of multi-responsive materials for drug delivery and tissue engineering.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Drug delivery system", "Dual-responsive", "Electrospinning", "Eudragit\u00ae L100-55", "Poly(N-isopropylacrylamide)"], "IndexKeywords": ["Acrylic Resins", "Animals", "Cell Line", "Cell Survival", "Drug Delivery Systems", "Drug Liberation", "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration", "Ketoprofen", "Mice", "Nanofibers", "Technology, Pharmaceutical"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85044109578", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmaceutical Science", "PHAR", "3003"]], "AuthorData": {"56184012500": {"Name": "Li H.", "AuthorID": "56184012500", "AffiliationID": "60010953", "AffiliationName": "College of Chemistry, Chemical Engineering and Biotechnology, Donghua University"}, "57193390160": {"Name": "Sang Q.", "AuthorID": "57193390160", "AffiliationID": "60010953", "AffiliationName": "College of Chemistry, Chemical Engineering and Biotechnology, Donghua University"}, "57116662400": {"Name": "Wu J.", "AuthorID": "57116662400", "AffiliationID": "60010953", "AffiliationName": "College of Chemistry, Chemical Engineering and Biotechnology, Donghua University"}, "57194201473": {"Name": "Wang H.", "AuthorID": "57194201473", "AffiliationID": "60010953", "AffiliationName": "College of Chemistry, Chemical Engineering and Biotechnology, Donghua University"}, "57193713166": {"Name": "Niu S.", "AuthorID": "57193713166", "AffiliationID": "60010953", "AffiliationName": "College of Chemistry, Chemical Engineering and Biotechnology, Donghua University"}, "57194273124": {"Name": "Wu J.", "AuthorID": "57194273124", "AffiliationID": "60010953", "AffiliationName": "College of Chemistry, Chemical Engineering and Biotechnology, Donghua University"}, "55710395600": {"Name": "Zhu L.", "AuthorID": "55710395600", "AffiliationID": "60010953", "AffiliationName": "College of Chemistry, Chemical Engineering and Biotechnology, Donghua University"}, "7406083266": {"Name": "Williams G.", "AuthorID": "7406083266", "AffiliationID": "60016379, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy, University College London"}}}
