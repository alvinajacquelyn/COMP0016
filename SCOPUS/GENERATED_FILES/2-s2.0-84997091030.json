We aimed to assess the effectiveness of the interventions on kidney function. Design, participants, settings, & methods In 2012\u20132013, we conducted extended follow-up of a total of 1271 individuals aged \u226540 years with hypertension (systolic BP \u2265140 mmHg, diastolic BP \u226590 mmHg, or receipt of antihypertensive treatment) and serum creatinine measurements with 2 years in-trial and 5 years of post-trial period in 12 randomly selected low-income communities in Karachi, Pakistan. The change in eGFR from baseline to 7 years was assessed among randomized groups using a generalized estimating equation method with multiple imputation of missing values. Results At 7 years of follow-up, adjusted mean eGFR remained unchanged, with a change of -0.3 (95% confidence interval [95% CI], -3.5 to 2.9) ml/min per 1.73 m2 among adults randomly assigned to the combined home health education plus trained general practitioner intervention compared with a significant decline of -3.6 (95% CI, -5.7 to -2.0) ml/min per 1.73 m2 in those assigned to usual care (P=0.01, modified intention-to-treat analysis). The risk for the combined intervention of death from kidney failure or >20% decline in eGFR relative to usual care was significantly reduced (risk ratio, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.25 to 0.89). Conclusions The combined home health education plus trained general practitioner intervention is beneficial in preserving kidney function among adults with hypertension in communities in Karachi. These findings highlight the importance of scaling up simple strategies for renal risk reduction in low- and middle-income countries.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Creatinine", "Follow-up studies", "Glomerular filtration rate", "Health education", "Home health education", "Humans", "Hypertension", "Pakistan", "Renal insufficiency", "Training general practitioners"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cause of Death", "Creatinine", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "General Practice", "Glomerular Filtration Rate", "Humans", "Hypertension", "Kidney", "Kidney Failure, Chronic", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Pakistan", "Patient Education as Topic", "Time Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84997091030", "SubjectAreas": [["Epidemiology", "MEDI", "2713"], ["Critical Care and Intensive Care Medicine", "MEDI", "2706"], ["Nephrology", "MEDI", "2727"], ["Transplantation", "MEDI", "2747"]], "AuthorData": {"6603889430": {"Name": "Jafar T.H.", "AuthorID": "6603889430", "AffiliationID": "60001344", "AffiliationName": "Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, Tufts Medical Center"}, "55319472000": {"Name": "Saffari S.E.", "AuthorID": "55319472000", "AffiliationID": "60017161", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Quantitative Medicine, Office of Clinical Sciences, Duke-National University of Singapore Graduate Medical School"}, "20734462300": {"Name": "Jehan I.", "AuthorID": "20734462300", "AffiliationID": "60052016", "AffiliationName": "Department of Community Health Science, Aga Khan University"}, "55261756800": {"Name": "Allen J.C.", "AuthorID": "55261756800", "AffiliationID": "60067302, 60052016", "AffiliationName": "Section of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Aga Khan University"}, "57108765200": {"Name": "Hameed A.", "AuthorID": "57108765200", "AffiliationID": "60067302, 60052016", "AffiliationName": "Section of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Aga Khan University"}, "56500020000": {"Name": "Ebrahim S.", "AuthorID": "56500020000", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"}, "7006154423": {"Name": "Poulter N.", "AuthorID": "7006154423", "AffiliationID": "60020413, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "International Centre for Circulatory Health and Imperial Clinical Trials Unit, Imperial College London"}, "7005513520": {"Name": "Chaturvedi N.", "AuthorID": "7005513520", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences, University College London"}}}
