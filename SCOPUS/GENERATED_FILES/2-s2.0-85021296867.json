Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.There are approximately 6.6 million dwellings in the UK built before 1919, predominantly constructed with suspended timber ground floors whose thermal performance has not been extensively investigated. The results are presented from an in-situ heat-flow measuring campaign conducted at 27 locations on a suspended timber ground floor, and the estimated whole-floor U-value compared with modelled results. Findings highlight a significant variability in heat flow, with increased heat loss near the external perimeter. In-situ measured-point U-values ranged from 0.54 \u00b1 0.09 Wm\u22122 K\u22121, when away from the external wall perimeter, to nearly four times as high (2.04 \u00b1 0.21 Wm\u22122 K\u22121) when near the perimeter. The results highlight the fact that observing only a few measurements is likely to bias any attempts to derive a whole-floor U-value, which was estimated to be 1.04 \u00b1 0.12 Wm\u22122 K\u22121 and nearly twice that derived from current models. This raises questions about the validity of using such models in housing stock models to inform retrofit decision-making and space-heating-reduction interventions. If this disparity between models and measurements exists in the wider stock, a reappraisal of the performance of suspended timber ground floors and heat-loss-reduction potential through this element will be required to support the UK\u2019s carbon-emission-reduction targets.", "AuthorKeywords": ["housing", "performance gap", "retrofit", "suspended timber ground floors", "thermal conductivity", "thermal performance", "U-value"], "IndexKeywords": ["Ground floor", "Performance gaps", "retrofit", "Thermal Performance", "U values"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85021296867", "SubjectAreas": [["Civil and Structural Engineering", "ENGI", "2205"], ["Building and Construction", "ENGI", "2215"]], "AuthorData": {"55318904000": {"Name": "Pelsmakers S.", "AuthorID": "55318904000", "AffiliationID": "60001881", "AffiliationName": "School of Architecture, University of Sheffield"}, "6602994480": {"Name": "Croxford B.", "AuthorID": "6602994480", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute for Environmental Design and Engineering, University College London"}, "55756255300": {"Name": "Elwell C.A.", "AuthorID": "55756255300", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Energy Institute, University College London"}}}
