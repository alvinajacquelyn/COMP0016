We discuss the mechanisms of deep pains arising from somatic and visceral structures and how this can lead to widespread manifestations and chronification. We include how both altered peripheral and central sensory neurotransmission lead to deep pain states and comment on key areas such as top-down modulation where little is known. It is vital that the clinical characterization of deep pain in patients is improved to allow for back translation to preclinical models so that the missing links can be ascertained. The contribution of deeper somatic and visceral tissues to various chronic pain syndromes is common but there is much we need to know.", "AuthorKeywords": ["allodynia", "central sensitization", "convergence", "cutaneous", "herniotomy", "hyperalgesia", "hysterectomy", "joints", "monoamines", "muscle", "neuropeptides NGF", "nociception", "osteoarthritis", "pain"], "IndexKeywords": ["Chronic Pain", "Humans", "Joints", "Muscles", "Nociception", "Peripheral Nervous System", "Viscera", "Visceral Pain"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85050580291", "SubjectAreas": [["Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine", "MEDI", "2703"]], "AuthorData": {"23669242900": {"Name": "Sikandar S.", "AuthorID": "23669242900", "AffiliationID": "60030840, 60006564", "AffiliationName": "KBH \u00d8, Section for Surgical Pathophysiology, Julianne Marie Centre, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen University"}, "7101706308": {"Name": "Dickenson A.", "AuthorID": "7101706308", "AffiliationID": "60030840, 60006564", "AffiliationName": "KBH \u00d8, Section for Surgical Pathophysiology, Julianne Marie Centre, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen University"}, "6505834336": {"Name": "Aasvang E.", "AuthorID": "6505834336", "AffiliationID": "60030840, 60006564", "AffiliationName": "KBH \u00d8, Section for Surgical Pathophysiology, Julianne Marie Centre, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen University"}}}
