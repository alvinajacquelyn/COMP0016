All rights reserved.We consider a boundary value problem involving a Riemann-Liouville fractional derivative of order \u03b1\u2208(3/2,2) on the unit interval (0,1). The standard Galerkin finite element approximation converges slowly due to the presence of singularity term x\u03b1-1 in the solution representation. In this work, we develop a simple technique, by transforming it into a second-order two-point boundary value problem with nonlocal low order terms, whose solution can reconstruct directly the solution to the original problem. The stability of the variational formulation, and the optimal regularity pickup of the solution are analyzed. A novel Galerkin finite element method with piecewise linear or quadratic finite elements is developed, and L2(D) error estimates are provided. The approach is then applied to the corresponding fractional Sturm-Liouville problem, and error estimates of the eigenvalue approximations are given. Extensive numerical results fully confirm our theoretical study.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Finite element method", "Fractional boundary value problem", "Riemann-Liouville derivative", "Singularity reconstruction", "Sturm-Liouville problem"], "IndexKeywords": ["Eigenvalue approximations", "Galerkin finite element approximations", "Galerkin finite element methods", "Quadratic finite elements", "Riemann-Liouville derivatives", "Riemann-Liouville fractional derivatives", "Sturm-Liouville problem", "Two point boundary value problems"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84941260935", "SubjectAreas": [["Computational Mathematics", "MATH", "2605"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"8268296700": {"Name": "Jin B.", "AuthorID": "8268296700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "7003806023": {"Name": "Lazarov R.", "AuthorID": "7003806023", "AffiliationID": "60020547", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, Texas AandM University"}, "55649851300": {"Name": "Zhou Z.", "AuthorID": "55649851300", "AffiliationID": "60020547", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, Texas AandM University"}, "24468723000": {"Name": "Lu X.", "AuthorID": "24468723000", "AffiliationID": "60029306", "AffiliationName": "School of Mathematics and Statistics, Wuhan University"}}}
