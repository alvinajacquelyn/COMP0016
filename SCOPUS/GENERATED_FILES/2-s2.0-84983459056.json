Focusing on the collective sharing of a social resource and the (contradictory) social and spatial dynamics of conviviality, the paper argues that adult participants found primary schools to be a source of social exchange. Their relationships with other parents varied from interactions consisting of casual greetings to close friendships within school spaces but also outside of these, in the social spaces of the schools\u2019 localities and in participants\u2019 home spaces. We suggest that even if exchange is mostly avoided or is slight, the situated and sustained nature of being part of primary school worlds require social interactions between different others which we describe as civic conviviality. Exploring this process, the paper argues that attention to the micro-social geographies of conviviality, friendship-making and the collective use of shared resources show how complex, stratified populations manage encounters that are shaped by sustained proximities.", "AuthorKeywords": ["conviviality", "ethnic diversity", "everyday multiculturalism", "extended encounter", "friendship", "Primary schools", "social difference", "space"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84983459056", "SubjectAreas": [["Cultural Studies", "SOCI", "3316"], ["History", "ARTS", "1202"], ["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"]], "AuthorData": {"35834079600": {"Name": "Neal S.", "AuthorID": "35834079600", "AffiliationID": "60001881", "AffiliationName": "Department of Sociological Studies, University of Sheffield"}, "7202132753": {"Name": "Vincent C.", "AuthorID": "7202132753", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Education, UCL"}, "57062268300": {"Name": "Iqbal H.", "AuthorID": "57062268300", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Education, UCL"}}}
