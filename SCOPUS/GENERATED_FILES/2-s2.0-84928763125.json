Affecting approximately 3% of the population, OCD, with its damaging effect on psychosocial function, is among the most severe and impairing of mental disorders. In Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-5 (DSM-5), OCD and related disorders form a separate classification, consistent with convergent research that indicates OCD is distinct from anxiety disorders in psychopathology and treatment requirements. Although evidence-based treatments have been developed for OCD, these are not accessible to many sufferers. Timely evidence-based treatment is recommended to avoid unnecessary progression to chronicity, disability, and intransigence of symptoms. Improvement in existing training models is needed to disseminate advanced specialty clinical skills to optimize illness recovery. This special series by The Canadian Institute for Obsessive Compulsive Disorders (CIOCD) Accreditation Task Force (ATF) critically reviews evidence-based psychological and pharmacological treatments for OCD throughout the lifespan. The ATF mandate is to establish specialty OCD certification/accreditation standards and competencies. This pioneering initiative aims to achieve transformational change in accessibility to evidence-based clinical care so urgently needed for young people and adults suffering from OCD.", "AuthorKeywords": ["CIOCD Accreditation Task Force", "Cognitive behavior therapy", "Obsessive compulsive disorder", "Pharmacotherapy", "Specialty competencies"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Canada", "Humans", "Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84928763125", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"], ["Biological Psychiatry", "NEUR", "2803"]], "AuthorData": {"6603487228": {"Name": "Sookman D.", "AuthorID": "6603487228", "AffiliationID": "60002494", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, McGill University"}, "35413253200": {"Name": "Fineberg N.A.", "AuthorID": "35413253200", "AffiliationID": "60020400, 60170490", "AffiliationName": "Highly Specialized Obsessive Compulsive Disorders Service, Hertfordshire Partnership University NHS Foundation Trust, Queen Elizabeth II Hospital"}}}
