The final measurement of the atmospheric neutrino oscillation parameters, \u0394m322 and \u03b823, came from a full three flavour oscillation analysis of the combined CC \u03bd\u03bc and CC \u03bd\u203e\u03bc beam and atmospheric samples and the CC \u03bde and CC \u03bd\u203ee appearance samples. This analysis yielded the most precise measurement of the atmospheric mass splitting \u0394m322 performed to date. The results are |\u0394m322|=[2.28\u20132.46]\u00d710\u22123 eV2 (68%) and sin2\u2061\u03b823=0.35\u20130.65 (90%) in the normal hierarchy, and |\u0394m322|=[2.32\u20132.53]\u00d710\u22123 eV2 (68%) and sin2\u2061\u03b823=0.34\u20130.67 (90%) in the inverted hierarchy. The successor to MINOS in the NO\u03bdA era at FNAL, MINOS+, is now collecting data mostly in the 3\u201310 GeV region, and an analysis of \u03bd\u03bc disappearance using the first 2.99\u00d71020 POT of data produced results very consistent with those from MINOS. Future data will further test the standard neutrino oscillation paradigm and allow for improved searches for exotic phenomena including sterile neutrinos, large extra dimensions and non-standard interactions.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84960970758", "SubjectAreas": [["Nuclear and High Energy Physics", "PHYS", "3106"]], "AuthorData": {"57171887200": {"Name": "Whitehead L.", "AuthorID": "57171887200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}}}
