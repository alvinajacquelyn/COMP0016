Recently its source code was optimised using \"Genetic Improvement\". Results: The genetically improved (GI) code is up to three times faster on short paired end reads from The 1000 Genomes Project and 60% more accurate on a short BioPlanet.com GCAT alignment benchmark. GPGPU BarraCUDA running on a single K80 Tesla GPU can align short paired end nextGen sequences up to ten times faster than bwa on a 12 core server. Conclusions: The speed up was such that the GI version was adopted and has been regularly downloaded from SourceForge for more than 12 months.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Double-ended DNA sequence", "Genetic improvement", "GPGPU", "Nextgen NGS", "Parallel computing"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85026662801", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Computational Theory and Mathematics", "COMP", "1703"], ["Computational Mathematics", "MATH", "2605"]], "AuthorData": {"8724450500": {"Name": "Langdon W.", "AuthorID": "8724450500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "7102023588": {"Name": "Lam B.", "AuthorID": "7102023588", "AffiliationID": "60031101, 60017488", "AffiliationName": "University of Cambridge Metabolic Research Laboratories, Addenbrooke's Hospital"}}}
