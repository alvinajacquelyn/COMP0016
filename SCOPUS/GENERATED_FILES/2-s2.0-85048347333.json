Generating such tissue is a lengthy process, often taking over 6 months of cell culture, and current approaches do not always generate large quantities of the major retinal cell types required. Methods: We adapted our previously described differentiation protocol to investigate the use of stirred-tank bioreactors. We used immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry and electron microscopy to characterise retinal organoids grown in standard and bioreactor culture conditions. Results: Our analysis revealed that the use of bioreactors results in improved laminar stratification as well as an increase in the yield of photoreceptor cells bearing cilia and nascent outer-segment-like structures. Conclusions: Bioreactors represent a promising platform for scaling up the manufacture of retinal cells for use in disease modelling, drug screening and cell transplantation studies.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bioreactors", "Photoreceptors", "Pluripotent stem cells", "Retinal organoids"], "IndexKeywords": ["Bioreactors", "Humans", "Organoids", "Photoreceptor Cells", "Pluripotent Stem Cells", "Retina"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85048347333", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (miscellaneous)", "MEDI", "2701"], ["Molecular Medicine", "BIOC", "1313"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (miscellaneous)", "BIOC", "1301"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"56275215100": {"Name": "Ovando-Roche P.", "AuthorID": "56275215100", "AffiliationID": "60013148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genetics, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "36702150800": {"Name": "West E.L.", "AuthorID": "36702150800", "AffiliationID": "60013148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genetics, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "55329553200": {"Name": "Branch M.J.", "AuthorID": "55329553200", "AffiliationID": "60013148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genetics, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "56318714600": {"Name": "Sampson R.D.", "AuthorID": "56318714600", "AffiliationID": "60013148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genetics, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "57195435994": {"Name": "Fernando M.", "AuthorID": "57195435994", "AffiliationID": "60013148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genetics, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "56386931400": {"Name": "Munro P.", "AuthorID": "56386931400", "AffiliationID": "60013148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genetics, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "6701653389": {"Name": "Georgiadis A.", "AuthorID": "6701653389", "AffiliationID": "60013148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genetics, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "57220529096": {"Name": "Rizzi M.", "AuthorID": "57220529096", "AffiliationID": "60013148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genetics, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "57191408440": {"Name": "Kloc M.", "AuthorID": "57191408440", "AffiliationID": "60013148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genetics, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "55851051300": {"Name": "Naeem A.", "AuthorID": "55851051300", "AffiliationID": "60013148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genetics, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "56522353400": {"Name": "Ribeiro J.", "AuthorID": "56522353400", "AffiliationID": "60013148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genetics, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "57203012241": {"Name": "Smith A.J.", "AuthorID": "57203012241", "AffiliationID": "60013148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genetics, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "50261517000": {"Name": "Gonzalez-Cordero A.", "AuthorID": "50261517000", "AffiliationID": "60013148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genetics, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "7201812544": {"Name": "Ali R.R.", "AuthorID": "7201812544", "AffiliationID": "60016691, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}}}
