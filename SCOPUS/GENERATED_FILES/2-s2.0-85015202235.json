Owing to the optical system's particular focusing properties, which could generate a dark-centered or peak-centered intensity distribution in the focal region when selecting an appropriate truncation parameter in front of the focusing lens, the proposed FCL optical tweezers could selectively trap and manipulate dielectric mesoscopic particles with low- or high-refractive indices by appropriately adjusting the radius of the pupil or the beam. Finally, the stability conditions for effective trapping and manipulation Rayleigh particles are analyzed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Laser trapping", "optical confinement and manipulation", "propagation."], "IndexKeywords": ["High refractive index", "Intensity distribution", "Laser trapping", "Mesoscopic particles", "Optical confinement and manipulation", "Rayleigh dielectrics", "Stability condition", "Truncation parameter"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85015202235", "SubjectAreas": [["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"55586270100": {"Name": "Liu Z.", "AuthorID": "55586270100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "55474788000": {"Name": "Jones P.", "AuthorID": "55474788000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}}}
