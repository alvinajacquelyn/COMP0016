All rights reserved.Pili are crucial virulence factors for many Gram-negative pathogens. These surface structures provide bacteria with a link to their external environments by enabling them to interact with, and attach to, host cells, other surfaces or each other, or by providing a conduit for secretion. Recent high-resolution structures of pilus filaments and the machineries that produce them, namely chaperone-usher pili, type IV pili, conjugative type IV secretion pili and type V pili, are beginning to explain some of the intriguing biological properties that pili exhibit, such as the ability of chaperone-usher pili and type IV pili to stretch in response to external forces. By contrast, conjugative pili provide a conduit for the exchange of genetic information, and recent high-resolution structures have revealed an integral association between the pilin subunit and a phospholipid molecule, which may facilitate DNA transport. In addition, progress in the area of cryo-electron tomography has provided a glimpse of the overall architecture of the type IV pilus machinery. In this Review, we examine recent advances in our structural understanding of various Gram-negative pilus systems and discuss their functional implications.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Bacterial Adhesion", "Conjugation, Genetic", "Fimbriae Proteins", "Fimbriae, Bacterial", "Gram-Negative Bacteria", "Virulence Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85018926252", "SubjectAreas": [["Microbiology", "IMMU", "2404"], ["Immunology and Microbiology (all)", "IMMU", "2400"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"55638169500": {"Name": "Hospenthal M.", "AuthorID": "55638169500", "AffiliationID": "60009016, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London and Birkbeck, University of London"}, "56644167900": {"Name": "Costa T.", "AuthorID": "56644167900", "AffiliationID": "60009016, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London and Birkbeck, University of London"}, "7004804200": {"Name": "Waksman G.", "AuthorID": "7004804200", "AffiliationID": "60009016, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London and Birkbeck, University of London"}}}
