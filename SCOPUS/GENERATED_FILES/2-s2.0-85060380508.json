No commercial re-use. See rights and permissions. Published by BMJ.Ultrasound (US) is usually the first and most commonly used tool in the diagnostic algorithm for liver disease. It is widely available, non-invasive and offers a real-time assessment of the liver in several anatomic planes, using different US modalities such as greyscale imaging, Doppler, elastography and contrast-enhanced US. This multiparametric ultrasound (MPUS) provides more information of the examined structures and allows for a faster and more accurate diagnosis, usually at the point of care, thus reducing the requirement for some invasive and more expensive methods. Current data on the MPUS in hepatology are summarised in this review, mostly focused on its use for non-invasive staging of liver fibrosis, detection and classification of portal hypertension and oesophageal varices, prognosis in chronic liver diseases and characterisation of focal liver lesions (FLLs). Based on the available data, we propose practical algorithms for clinical use of MPUS in chronic liver disease and FLL.", "AuthorKeywords": ["doppler", "elasticity imaging techniques", "Liver Diseases", "ultrasonography"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85060380508", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"15053077600": {"Name": "Grgurevic I.", "AuthorID": "15053077600", "AffiliationID": "60103663, 60008408, 60006461", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Pharmacy and Biochemistry, University of Zagreb, School of Medicine"}, "57204906496": {"Name": "Tjesic Drinkovic I.", "AuthorID": "57204906496", "AffiliationID": "60006461", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, University Hospital Dubrava"}, "7005412715": {"Name": "Pinzani M.", "AuthorID": "7005412715", "AffiliationID": "60032819, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute for Liver and Digestive Health, Sheila Sherlock Liver Centre, Royal Free Hospital"}}}
