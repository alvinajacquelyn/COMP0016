The management of these injuries is challenging and often requires prolonged and potentially painful treatment. The Ilizarov technique of bone transport using circular external fixators is widely used for limb reconstruction of large bone defects. Other techniques include vascularised fibular grafting, the use of induced pseudosynovial membranes combined with cancellous autologous bone grafts and the use of autologous, allogeneic or synthetic bone grafts on their own for smaller defects. Future directions include further research on bone tissue engineering using stem cell therapy and growth factors such as bone morphogenetic proteins. The purpose of this Continuing Medical Education article is to describe the key limb reconstructive techniques that may be employed to treat traumatic bone loss. In particular, this article is intended to serve as a revision tool for those preparing for postgraduate examinations.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bone defects", "Ilizarov technique", "Limb reconstruction", "Vascularised fibular grafts"], "IndexKeywords": ["Blood Vessel Prosthesis", "Bone Morphogenetic Proteins", "Bone Transplantation", "Education, Medical, Graduate", "External Fixators", "Fibula", "Humans", "Ilizarov Technique", "Limb Salvage", "Reconstructive Surgical Procedures", "Stem Cell Transplantation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84889573188", "SubjectAreas": [["Emergency Medicine", "MEDI", "2711"], ["Orthopedics and Sports Medicine", "MEDI", "2732"]], "AuthorData": {"36550164000": {"Name": "Chimutengwende-Gordon M.", "AuthorID": "36550164000", "AffiliationID": "60024067", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Orthopaedics and Musculoskeletal Science, Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital"}, "35229756200": {"Name": "Khan W.", "AuthorID": "35229756200", "AffiliationID": "60024067", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Orthopaedics and Musculoskeletal Science, Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital"}, "55953473900": {"Name": "Mbogo A.", "AuthorID": "55953473900", "AffiliationID": "60007321", "AffiliationName": "North Manchester General Hospital"}, "7005431482": {"Name": "Wilkes R.", "AuthorID": "7005431482", "AffiliationID": "60002063", "AffiliationName": "Limb Reconstruction Unit, Hope Hospital"}}}
