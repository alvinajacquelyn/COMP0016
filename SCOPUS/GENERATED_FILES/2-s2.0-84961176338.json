However, there are few archaeobotanical data with which to characterise the plant-based subsistence and crop husbandry activities during this time, which hinders the understanding of the factors that triggered the appearance of plant domestication. In this paper, analyses of non-woody plant macro-remains provide new insights into subsistence activities such as crop cultivation (husbandry activities and storage) and plant use (wild plant gathering and food preparation) during the EPPNB at Tell Qarassa North (south Syria). We make comparisons between Tell Qarassa North and the evidence at earlier and later periods as to how plants were used, and highlight similarities and differences in the practices attested, as well as describing some of the consequences that these plant-related activities may have had in terms of labour and social organization during EPPNB.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Arable flora", "Cereal domestication", "Crop husbandry", "Neolithic", "Southwest Asia", "Wild plant gathering"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84961176338", "SubjectAreas": [["Archeology (arts and humanities)", "ARTS", "1204"], ["Plant Science", "AGRI", "1110"], ["Paleontology", "EART", "1911"]], "AuthorData": {"56520313600": {"Name": "Arranz-Otaegui A.", "AuthorID": "56520313600", "AffiliationID": "60030840", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cross-Cultural and Regional Studies, University of Copenhagen"}, "6506782318": {"Name": "Colledge S.", "AuthorID": "6506782318", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Archaeology, University College London"}, "36696314000": {"Name": "Iba\u00f1ez J.J.", "AuthorID": "36696314000", "AffiliationID": "60028181, 60006754", "AffiliationName": "Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cient\u00edficas, Instituto Mil\u00e1 y Fontanals"}, "8293557800": {"Name": "Zapata L.", "AuthorID": "8293557800", "AffiliationID": "60103709", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography, Prehistory and Archaeology, University of the Basque Country \u2013 Euskal Herriko Unibertsitatea"}}}
