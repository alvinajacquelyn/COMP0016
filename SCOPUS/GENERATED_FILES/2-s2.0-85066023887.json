They present with symptoms that are typically investigated via the same diagnostic pathway. However, diagnosing these cancers can be challenging, especially for kidney cancer, as many of the symptoms are non-specific and occur commonly in patients without cancer. Furthermore, the recognition and evaluation of these symptoms may differ because of the lack of supporting high-quality evidence to inform management, a problem also reflected in currently ambiguous guidelines. The majority of these two cancers are diagnosed following a referral from a general practitioner. In this article, we summarise current UK and United States (US) guidelines for investigating common symptoms of bladder and kidney cancer\u2014visible haematuria, non-visible haematuria and urinary tract infections. Our article aims to support clinicians in recognising and investigating patients with symptoms of possible bladder and kidney cancer in a timely fashion. We discuss challenges during the diagnostic process and possible future interventions for improvement.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bladder cancer", "Early diagnosis", "Kidney cancer", "Primary care", "Urological cancer"], "IndexKeywords": ["Early Detection of Cancer", "Hematuria", "Humans", "Kidney Neoplasms", "Primary Health Care", "Referral and Consultation", "United Kingdom", "United States", "Urinary Bladder Neoplasms"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85066023887", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"56166689900": {"Name": "Zhou Y.", "AuthorID": "56166689900", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Primary Care Unit, Department of Public Health and Primary Care, University of Cambridge"}, "53263559400": {"Name": "Funston G.", "AuthorID": "53263559400", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Primary Care Unit, Department of Public Health and Primary Care, University of Cambridge"}, "7103067740": {"Name": "Walter F.M.", "AuthorID": "7103067740", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Primary Care Unit, Department of Public Health and Primary Care, University of Cambridge"}, "6603557582": {"Name": "Lyratzopoulos G.", "AuthorID": "6603557582", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "ECHO (Epidemiology of Cancer Healthcare and Outcomes) Research Group, Department of Behavioural Science and Health, University College London"}}}
