Solubilities were determined using a spectrophotometric method based on the Beer-Lambert law. Abraham model correlations were derived by combining the measured solubility data determined in the present study with published experimental values taken from our earlier publications. Fifty experimental data points were used in determining the Abraham model correlations presented in this study. The mathematical expressions were found to back-calculate the observed solubility to within standard deviations of 0.113 log units (or less).", "AuthorKeywords": ["4-Methyl-2-pentanol solvent", "Abraham solvation parameter model", "Crystalline organic compounds", "Molar solubility ratios"], "IndexKeywords": ["1 ,4-Dibromobenzene", "4-Chlorobenzoic acids", "Abraham solvation parameter model", "Experimental values", "Mathematical expressions", "Molar solubility ratios", "Spectro-photometric method", "Standard deviation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85060075329", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Spectroscopy", "CHEM", "1607"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"], ["Materials Chemistry", "MATE", "2505"]], "AuthorData": {"57194716069": {"Name": "Qian E.", "AuthorID": "57194716069", "AffiliationID": "60024438", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of North Texas"}, "57202917265": {"Name": "Gupta A.", "AuthorID": "57202917265", "AffiliationID": "60024438", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of North Texas"}, "57202914986": {"Name": "Neal R.", "AuthorID": "57202914986", "AffiliationID": "60024438", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of North Texas"}, "57200413891": {"Name": "Lee G.", "AuthorID": "57200413891", "AffiliationID": "60024438", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of North Texas"}, "57201777067": {"Name": "Che M.", "AuthorID": "57201777067", "AffiliationID": "60024438", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of North Texas"}, "57202853682": {"Name": "Wang L.", "AuthorID": "57202853682", "AffiliationID": "60024438", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of North Texas"}, "57202911665": {"Name": "Yue D.", "AuthorID": "57202911665", "AffiliationID": "60024438", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of North Texas"}, "57205362830": {"Name": "Wang S.", "AuthorID": "57205362830", "AffiliationID": "60024438", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of North Texas"}, "57205362441": {"Name": "Liu K.", "AuthorID": "57205362441", "AffiliationID": "60024438", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of North Texas"}, "57205455866": {"Name": "Zhang A.", "AuthorID": "57205455866", "AffiliationID": "60024438", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of North Texas"}, "35496753700": {"Name": "Acree W.", "AuthorID": "35496753700", "AffiliationID": "60024438", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of North Texas"}, "7202901240": {"Name": "Abraham M.", "AuthorID": "7202901240", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}}}
