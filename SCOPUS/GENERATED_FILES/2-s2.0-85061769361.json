Here, \u201ccomplex\u201d means one or more of: low-template, degraded and mixed-source. Although software for complex DNA profile analysis has made great strides in recent years, the ability of courts to effectively scrutinise and challenge the reliability of the resulting evidence remains problematic. One key step is to compare different software on the same evidence, but there are currently few published comparisons in part because of the problems posed by restricted access to commercial software. We present here an extensive comparison between two open-source software, LikeLTD and EuroForMix. We find that despite different modelling assumptions the two programs generate similar results. The differences that we do identify can inform future improvements and can provide a benchmark for acceptable discrepancies between alternative programs.", "AuthorKeywords": ["DNA profile", "Low template", "Software validation", "Weight of evidence"], "IndexKeywords": ["DNA", "DNA Fingerprinting", "Humans", "Likelihood Functions", "Polymerase Chain Reaction", "Software"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85061769361", "SubjectAreas": [["Pathology and Forensic Medicine", "MEDI", "2734"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"]], "AuthorData": {"57206660057": {"Name": "You Y.", "AuthorID": "57206660057", "AffiliationID": "60118644", "AffiliationName": "Melbourne Integrative Genomics, School of BioSciences and School of Mathematics and Statistics, University of Melbounrne"}, "7004169857": {"Name": "Balding D.", "AuthorID": "7004169857", "AffiliationID": "60118644", "AffiliationName": "Melbourne Integrative Genomics, School of BioSciences and School of Mathematics and Statistics, University of Melbounrne"}}}
