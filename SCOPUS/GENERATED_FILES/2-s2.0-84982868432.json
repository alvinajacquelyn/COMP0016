In this study we measured phosphorylated tau (p-tau) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) as a potential marker for premature central nervous system (CNS) aging. P-tau increases with normal aging but is not affected by HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders. Methods: With a cross-sectional retrospective design, p-tau, total tau (t-tau), neopterin and HIV-RNA were measured in CSF together with plasma HIV-RNA and blood CD4+ T-cells of 225 HIV-infected patients <50 y of age, subdivided into 3 groups: untreated neuroasymptomatic (NA) (n = 145), on suppressive antiretroviral treatment (cART) (n = 49), and HIV-associated dementia (HAD) (n = 31). HIV-negative healthy subjects served as controls (n = 79). Results: P-tau was not significantly higher in any HIV-infected group compared to HIV-negative controls. Significant increases in t-tau were found as expected in patients with HAD compared to NA, cART, and control groups (p < 0.001). Conclusions: P-tau was not higher in HIV-infected patients compared to uninfected controls, thus failing to support a role for premature or accelerated brain aging in HIV infection.", "AuthorKeywords": ["biomarker analysis", "cerebrospinal fluid", "HIV", "HIV-1 associated cognitive motor complex", "tau protein"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aging, Premature", "AIDS Dementia Complex", "Antiretroviral Therapy, Highly Active", "Biomarkers", "Brain", "Cohort Studies", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Female", "HIV", "HIV Infections", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Neopterin", "Phosphorylation", "Retrospective Studies", "RNA, Viral", "tau Proteins"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84982868432", "SubjectAreas": [["Parasitology", "IMMU", "2405"], ["Microbiology", "IMMU", "2404"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"], ["Microbiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2726"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"35317668300": {"Name": "Krut J.J.", "AuthorID": "35317668300", "AffiliationID": "60079626, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infectious Diseases, Institute of Biomedicine, University of Gothenburg"}, "20234417500": {"Name": "Hagberg L.", "AuthorID": "20234417500", "AffiliationID": "60079626, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infectious Diseases, Institute of Biomedicine, University of Gothenburg"}, "7101627980": {"Name": "Yilmaz A.", "AuthorID": "7101627980", "AffiliationID": "60079626, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infectious Diseases, Institute of Biomedicine, University of Gothenburg"}, "57201969798": {"Name": "Gissl\u00e9n M.", "AuthorID": "57201969798", "AffiliationID": "60079626, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infectious Diseases, Institute of Biomedicine, University of Gothenburg"}, "57213628929": {"Name": "Price R.W.", "AuthorID": "57213628929", "AffiliationID": "60023691", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, University of California San Francisco"}, "6701454676": {"Name": "Zetterberg H.", "AuthorID": "6701454676", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "35414205100": {"Name": "Fuchs D.", "AuthorID": "35414205100", "AffiliationID": "60008222", "AffiliationName": "Division of Biological Chemistry, Biocenter, Innsbruck Medical University"}, "7005246423": {"Name": "Cinque P.", "AuthorID": "7005246423", "AffiliationID": "60082964", "AffiliationName": "Clinic of Infectious Diseases, San Raffaele Hospital"}, "35479725000": {"Name": "Nilsson S.", "AuthorID": "35479725000", "AffiliationID": "60000990", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematical Sciences, Chalmers University of Technology"}}}
