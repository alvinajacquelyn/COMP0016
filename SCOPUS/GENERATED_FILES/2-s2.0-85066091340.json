Free-breathing motion-corrected (MOCO) LGE has potential advantages over breath-held (bh) LGE including minimal user input for the short axis (SAX) stack without breath-holds. It has previously been shown that MOCO-LGE delivers high image quality compared to bh-LGE. We sought to conduct an independent validation study to investigate real-world performance of bh-LGE versus MOCO-LGE in a high-throughput CMR center immediately after the introduction of the MOCO-LGE sequence and with elementary staff induction in its use. Four-hundred consecutive patients, referred for CMR and graded by clinical complexity, underwent CMR on either of two scanners (1.5 T, both Siemens) in a UK tertiary cardiac center. Scar imaging was by bh-LGE or MOCO-LGE (both with phase sensitive inversion recovery). Image quality, scan time, reader confidence and report reproducibility were compared between those scanned by bh-LGE versus MOCO-LGE. Readers had > 3 years CMR experience. Categorical variables were compared by \u03c72 or Fisher\u2019s exact tests and continuous variables by unpaired Student\u2019s t-test. Inter-rater agreement of LGE reports was by Cohen\u2019s kappa. Image quality (low score = better) was better for MOCO-LGE (median, interquartile range [Q1\u2013Q3]: 0 [0\u20130] vs. 2 [0\u20133], P < 0.0001). This persisted when just clinically complex patients were assessed (0 [0\u20131] vs. 2 [1\u20134] P < 0.0001). Readers were more confident in their MOCO-LGE rulings (P < 0.001) and reports more reproducible [bh-LGE vs. MOCO-LGE: kappa 0.76, confidence interval (CI) 0.7\u20130.9 vs. 0.82, CI 0.7\u20130.9]. MOCO-LGE significantly shortened LGE acquisition times compared to bh-LGE (for left ventricle SAX stack: 03:22 \u00b1 01:14 vs 06:09 \u00b1 01:47 min respectively, P < 0.0001). In a busy clinical service, immediately after its introduction and with elementary staff training, MOCO-LGE is demonstrably faster to bh-LGE, providing better images that are easier to interpret, even in the sickest of patients.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cardiac imaging", "Fibrosis", "Image quality", "Late gadolinium enhancement"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Contrast Media", "Efficiency, Organizational", "Female", "Fibrosis", "Heart Diseases", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Cine", "Male", "Meglumine", "Middle Aged", "Myocardium", "Organometallic Compounds", "Predictive Value of Tests", "Reproducibility of Results", "Tertiary Care Centers", "Time Factors", "Ventricular Function, Left", "Workflow"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85066091340", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"], ["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"6506837383": {"Name": "Captur G.", "AuthorID": "6506837383", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}, "57202314649": {"Name": "Moon J.C.", "AuthorID": "57202314649", "AffiliationID": "60004093", "AffiliationName": "Barts Heart Centre, The Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance Imaging Unit, St Bartholomew\u2019s Hospital"}, "57202030544": {"Name": "Lobascio I.", "AuthorID": "57202030544", "AffiliationID": "60004093", "AffiliationName": "Barts Heart Centre, The Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance Imaging Unit, St Bartholomew\u2019s Hospital"}, "57208898322": {"Name": "Ye Y.", "AuthorID": "57208898322", "AffiliationID": "60118427, 60003970, 60117854", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University"}, "57191619729": {"Name": "Culotta V.", "AuthorID": "57191619729", "AffiliationID": "60004093", "AffiliationName": "Barts Heart Centre, The Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance Imaging Unit, St Bartholomew\u2019s Hospital"}, "56108683100": {"Name": "Boubertakh R.", "AuthorID": "56108683100", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Cardiovascular Biomedical Research Unit, Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London"}, "52365249300": {"Name": "Xue H.", "AuthorID": "52365249300", "AffiliationID": "60005281, 60006577", "AffiliationName": "National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, DHHS"}, "7004851504": {"Name": "Kellman P.", "AuthorID": "7004851504", "AffiliationID": "60005281, 60006577", "AffiliationName": "National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, DHHS"}}}
