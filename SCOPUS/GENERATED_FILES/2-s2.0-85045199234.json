This investigation looked to combine OCT and AFM as a multi-scale approach to understand the role sucrose concentration and age play in the morphological and mechanical properties of oral, microcosm biofilms, in-vitro. Biofilms with low (0.1% w/v) and high (5% w/v) sucrose concentrations were grown on hydroxyapatite (HAP) discs from pooled human saliva and incubated for 3 and 5 days. Distinct mesoscale features of biofilms such as regions of low and high extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) were identified through observations made by OCT. Mechanical analysis revealed increasing sucrose concentration decreased Young's modulus and increased cantilever adhesion (p < 0.0001), relative to the biofilm. Increasing age was found to decrease adhesion only (p < 0.0001). This was due to mechanical interactions between the indenter and the biofilm increasing as a function of increased EPS content, due to increasing sucrose. An expected decrease in EPS cantilever contact decreased adhesion due to bacteria proliferation with biofilm age. The application OCT and AFM revealed new structure-property relationships in oral biofilms, unattainable if the techniques were used independently.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Bacteria", "Bacterial Adhesion", "Biofilms", "Durapatite", "Elastic Modulus", "Extracellular Polymeric Substance Matrix", "Humans", "In Vitro Techniques", "Microscopy, Atomic Force", "Mouth", "Saliva", "Sucrose", "Tomography, Optical Coherence"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85045199234", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"57201526046": {"Name": "Pattem J.", "AuthorID": "57201526046", "AffiliationID": "60013985, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Biomaterials and Tissue Engineering, Eastman Dental Institute, University College London"}, "56492783200": {"Name": "Aguayo S.", "AuthorID": "56492783200", "AffiliationID": "60013985, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Biomaterials and Tissue Engineering, Eastman Dental Institute, University College London"}, "6602787947": {"Name": "Bozec L.", "AuthorID": "6602787947", "AffiliationID": "60013985, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Biomaterials and Tissue Engineering, Eastman Dental Institute, University College London"}, "57201527068": {"Name": "Davrandi M.", "AuthorID": "57201527068", "AffiliationID": "60013985, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Microbial Diseases, Eastman Dental Institute, University College London"}, "35848365800": {"Name": "Allan E.", "AuthorID": "35848365800", "AffiliationID": "60013985, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Microbial Diseases, Eastman Dental Institute, University College London"}, "7004394482": {"Name": "Spratt D.", "AuthorID": "7004394482", "AffiliationID": "60013985, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Microbial Diseases, Eastman Dental Institute, University College London"}}}
