In this paper, an all-atom flow/glycocalyx system is constructed with the bulk flow velocity in the physiologically relevant ranges for the first time. The system is simulated by molecular dynamics using 5.8 million atoms. Flowdynamics and statistics in the presence of the glycocalyx are presented and discussed. Complex dynamic behaviours of the glycocalyx, particularly the sugar chains, are observed in response to blood flow. In turn, the motion of the glycocalyx, including swing and swirling, disturbs the flow by altering the velocity profiles and modifying the vorticity distributions. As a result, the initially one-dimensional forcing is spread to all directions in the region near the endothelial cell surface. Furthermore, the coupled dynamics exist not only between the flow and the glycocalyx but also within the glycocalyxmolecular constituents. Shear stress distributions between one-dimer and three-dimer cases are also conducted. Finally, potential force transmission pathways are discussed based on the dynamics of the glycocalyx constituents,which provides newinsight into the mechanismof mechanotransduction of the glycocalyx. These findings have relevance in the pathologies of glycocalyx-related diseases, for example in renal or cardiovascular conditions.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Coupled dynamics", "Endothelial cells", "Flow shear stress", "Glycocalyx", "Molecular dynamics"], "IndexKeywords": ["Biological process", "Coupled dynamics", "Flow shear stress", "Glycocalyx", "Large-scale molecular dynamics", "Mechanotransduction", "Velocity profiles", "Vorticity distribution", "Computer Simulation", "Endothelial Cells", "Glycocalyx", "Lipid Bilayers", "Models, Biological", "Molecular Dynamics Simulation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85040248517", "SubjectAreas": [["Biotechnology", "BIOC", "1305"], ["Biophysics", "BIOC", "1304"], ["Bioengineering", "CENG", "1502"], ["Biomaterials", "MATE", "2502"], ["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"]], "AuthorData": {"57188682262": {"Name": "Jiang X.Z.", "AuthorID": "57188682262", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "7102436109": {"Name": "Luo K.H.", "AuthorID": "7102436109", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "6603704133": {"Name": "Ventikos Y.", "AuthorID": "6603704133", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "57205067584": {"Name": "Gong H.", "AuthorID": "57205067584", "AffiliationID": "60025278, 60123061", "AffiliationName": "MOE Key Laboratory of Bioinformatics, School of Life Sciences, Tsinghua University"}}}
