A wide array of nitroalkenes and imines derived from commercially available aromatic aldehydes and 2-chloroanalines were subjected to a key reductive conjugate addition nitro-Mannich reaction to give diastereomerically pure \u03b2-nitro amines. Sequential reduction of the nitro function followed by Pd-catalyzed intramolecular N-arylation of the resultant primary amine onto the 2-chloroanailine gives highly substituted 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoxalines. Non basic imines were found to participate better in the nitro-Mannich reaction if the stronger acid methanesulfonic acid was used to promote the reaction. The 3 step reaction sequence should be useful for the array synthesis of drug like scaffolds.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Conjugate addition", "Diastereo-selectivity", "Divergent synthesis", "Methane sulfonic acid", "Nitro-Mannich reaction", "Reaction sequences", "Sequential reductions", "Stereoselective synthesis"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84984908536", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"], ["Organic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1605"]], "AuthorData": {"55553734284": {"Name": "Anderson J.", "AuthorID": "55553734284", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "56798261700": {"Name": "Rundell C.", "AuthorID": "56798261700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "56430543200": {"Name": "Shannon J.", "AuthorID": "56430543200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "55414472700": {"Name": "Campbell I.", "AuthorID": "55414472700", "AffiliationID": "60020649", "AffiliationName": "GlaxoSmithKline, Medicines Research Centre"}, "56430605300": {"Name": "Campos S.", "AuthorID": "56430605300", "AffiliationID": "60020649", "AffiliationName": "GlaxoSmithKline, Medicines Research Centre"}, "56870808400": {"Name": "Reid I.", "AuthorID": "56870808400", "AffiliationID": "60020649", "AffiliationName": "GlaxoSmithKline, Medicines Research Centre"}, "6505775443": {"Name": "Tizzard G.", "AuthorID": "6505775443", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "National Crystallography Service, School of Chemistry, University of Southampton"}}}
