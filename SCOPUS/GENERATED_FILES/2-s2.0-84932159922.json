Relating information at different resolution scales is challenging. Reconstructing 3D volumes from histology images could be the key to interpreting and relating the radiological image signal to tissue microstructure. The goal of this study is to determine the minimum sampling (maximum spacing between histological sections through a fixed surgical specimen) required to create a 3D reconstruction of the specimen to a specific tolerance. We present initial results for one lumpectomy specimen case where 33 consecutive histology slides were acquired.", "AuthorKeywords": ["3D histology reconstruction", "Breast histopathology-radiology correlation", "Tissue sampling"], "IndexKeywords": ["3D histology reconstruction", "Different resolutions", "Histological section", "Lumpectomy specimen", "Radiological images", "Tissue microstructures", "Tissue sampling", "Treatment outcomes"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84932159922", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Biomaterials", "MATE", "2502"], ["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"], ["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"56694014000": {"Name": "Reis S.", "AuthorID": "56694014000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Image Computing, University College London"}, "42361164100": {"Name": "Eiben B.", "AuthorID": "42361164100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Image Computing, University College London"}, "36172530200": {"Name": "Mertzanidou T.", "AuthorID": "36172530200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Image Computing, University College London"}, "6602192523": {"Name": "Hipwell J.", "AuthorID": "6602192523", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Image Computing, University College London"}, "35464300200": {"Name": "Hawkes D.", "AuthorID": "35464300200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Image Computing, University College London"}, "56694305400": {"Name": "Hermsen M.", "AuthorID": "56694305400", "AffiliationID": "60002573", "AffiliationName": "Radboud University Medical Centre, Diagnostic Image Analysis Group"}, "6701833644": {"Name": "Van Der Laak J.", "AuthorID": "6701833644", "AffiliationID": "60002573", "AffiliationName": "Radboud University Medical Centre, Diagnostic Image Analysis Group"}, "7005904555": {"Name": "Pinder S.", "AuthorID": "7005904555", "AffiliationID": "60009797, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "Breast Research Pathology, King's College London, Guy's Hospital"}, "6602193995": {"Name": "Bult P.", "AuthorID": "6602193995", "AffiliationID": "60002573", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, Radboud University Medical Centre"}}}
