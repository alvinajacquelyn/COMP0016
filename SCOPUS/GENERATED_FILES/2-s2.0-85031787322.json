A second-order sliding-mode-based adaptation law is designed for estimating the frequency and the damping factor, while amplitude and phase are obtainable from the said parameters by straightforward algebra. The stability and robustness analysis in presence of an additive disturbance proves the existence of a tuning parameter set for which the estimator's dynamics are asymptotic stable and the estimation error asymptotically converges to a residual set whose size depends on the amplitude of the disturbance. Numerical and comparative examples show the effectiveness of the proposed estimation approach.", "AuthorKeywords": ["damped sinusoidal signal", "observers", "sinusoidal estimation", "sliding-mode"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85031787322", "SubjectAreas": [["Control and Systems Engineering", "ENGI", "2207"]], "AuthorData": {"57188647069": {"Name": "Wang Y.", "AuthorID": "57188647069", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Dept. of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Imperial College London"}, "56021899900": {"Name": "Chen B.", "AuthorID": "56021899900", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Dept. of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Imperial College London"}, "55161538500": {"Name": "Parisini T.", "AuthorID": "55161538500", "AffiliationID": "60018363", "AffiliationName": "Dept. of Engineering and Architecture, University of Trieste"}, "23991087000": {"Name": "Pin G.", "AuthorID": "23991087000", "AffiliationID": "60019612", "AffiliationName": "Electrolux Italia S.p.A"}}}
