A five-fold increase in activity for the highly polymerised urea derived g-C3N4 is achieved compared to alternative precursors. Transient absorption, time-resolved and steady-state emission studies indicate that the enhanced activity is related to both an increased driving force for photoelectron transfer and a greater availability of photogenerated charges.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84987984719", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"]], "AuthorData": {"35473503600": {"Name": "Walsh J.J.", "AuthorID": "35473503600", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Stephenson Institute for Renewable Energy, University of Liverpool"}, "7101977633": {"Name": "Cowan A.J.", "AuthorID": "7101977633", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Stephenson Institute for Renewable Energy, University of Liverpool"}, "56329410000": {"Name": "Jiang C.", "AuthorID": "56329410000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Solar Energy Group, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "7404638641": {"Name": "Tang J.", "AuthorID": "7404638641", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Solar Energy Group, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}}}
