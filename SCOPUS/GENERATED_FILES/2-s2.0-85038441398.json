Secondary prevention trials have been started in autosomal-dominant AD (ADAD) individuals without cognitive dysfunction and in cognitively healthy subjects at risk of developing sporadic AD (SAD). Areas covered: Herein, the authors discuss prevention trials in ADAD and SAD, with a focus on the anti-A\u03b2 monoclonal antibodies solanezumab and gantenerumab presently in Phase III clinical development. These therapies are also being tested in the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer\u2019s Network Trials Unit (DIAN-TU). Expert opinion: Anti-A\u03b2 monoclonal antibodies are being tested in subjects at the preclinical stage of ADAD and even in symptom-free subjects at risk of developing SAD. The subsequent DIAN-TU Adaptive Prevention Trial is a 4-year study that will assess whether such biomarker effects may stop the progress of the AD process, preventing cognitive symptoms. The hope is to interfere in the disease course when it is not too late. A clinical success of these prevention trials would represent the proof of the A\u03b2 hypothesis of AD.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alzheimer\u2019s disease", "API trials", "BAN2401", "dementia", "DIAN-TU trials", "gantenerumab", "Monoclonal antibodies", "prevention trials", "solanezumab"], "IndexKeywords": ["Alzheimer Disease", "Amyloid beta-Peptides", "Antibodies, Monoclonal", "Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized", "Clinical Trials as Topic", "Humans", "Mutation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85038441398", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"], ["Drug Discovery", "PHAR", "3002"], ["Clinical Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1308"]], "AuthorData": {"57190310649": {"Name": "Panza F.", "AuthorID": "57190310649", "AffiliationID": "60070410", "AffiliationName": "Geriatric Unit and Gerontology-Geriatrics Research Laboratory, Department of Medical Sciences, IRCCS Casa Sollievo della Sofferenza"}, "35753443500": {"Name": "Lozupone M.", "AuthorID": "35753443500", "AffiliationID": "60022778", "AffiliationName": "Unit of Neurodegenerative Disease, Department of Basic Medicine Sciences, Neuroscience, and Sense Organs, University of Bari \u2018Aldo Moro\u2019"}, "57195638815": {"Name": "Stallone R.", "AuthorID": "57195638815", "AffiliationID": "60022778", "AffiliationName": "Unit of Neurodegenerative Disease, Department of Basic Medicine Sciences, Neuroscience, and Sense Organs, University of Bari \u2018Aldo Moro\u2019"}, "7004888005": {"Name": "Logroscino G.", "AuthorID": "7004888005", "AffiliationID": "60022778", "AffiliationName": "Unit of Neurodegenerative Disease, Department of Clinical Research in Neurology, University of Bari \u2018Aldo Moro\u2019 at \u2018Pia Fondazione Card.
