However, the molecular and circuit properties underlying neuromodulation of arousal states such as sleep and wakefulness remain unclear. To tackle this challenge in a systematic and unbiased manner, we performed a genetic overexpression screen to identify genes that affect larval zebrafish arousal. We found that the neuropeptide neuromedin U (Nmu) promotes hyperactivity and inhibits sleep in zebrafish larvae, whereas nmu mutant animals are hypoactive. We show that Nmu-induced arousal requires Nmu receptor 2 and signaling via corticotropin releasing hormone (Crh) receptor 1. In contrast to previously proposed models, we find that Nmu does not promote arousal via the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, but rather probably acts via brainstem crh-expressing neurons. These results reveal an unexpected functional and anatomical interface between the Nmu system and brainstem arousal systems that represents a novel wake-promoting pathway. Video Abstract: Chiu et al. perform a genetic screen in zebrafish and identify Nmu as a regulator of sleep/wake behaviors. They show that Nmu overexpression activates brainstem Crh neurons and that Nmu-induced arousal requires Crh signaling, thus identifying a novel vertebrate arousal circuit.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Age Factors", "Aniline Compounds", "Animals", "Brain Stem", "Gene Expression Regulation", "Humans", "Hypothalamo-Hypophyseal System", "Larva", "Mice, Transgenic", "Motor Activity", "Neurons", "Neuropeptides", "Pituitary-Adrenal System", "Pyrimidines", "Receptors, Complement 3b", "Receptors, Neurotransmitter", "Signal Transduction", "Sleep", "Wakefulness", "Zebrafish", "Zebrafish Proteins"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84958212456", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"]], "AuthorData": {"36914396100": {"Name": "Chiu C.", "AuthorID": "36914396100", "AffiliationID": "60007363", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurobiology, Northwestern University"}, "36185752700": {"Name": "Lee D.", "AuthorID": "36185752700", "AffiliationID": "60031581", "AffiliationName": "Division of Biology and Biological Engineering, California Institute of Technology"}, "56937780900": {"Name": "Singh C.", "AuthorID": "56937780900", "AffiliationID": "60031581", "AffiliationName": "Division of Biology and Biological Engineering, California Institute of Technology"}, "6602439939": {"Name": "Mosser E.", "AuthorID": "6602439939", "AffiliationID": "60007363", "AffiliationName": "Program in Biological Sciences, Northwestern University"}, "57192605510": {"Name": "Chen S.", "AuthorID": "57192605510", "AffiliationID": "60031581", "AffiliationName": "Division of Biology and Biological Engineering, California Institute of Technology"}, "7003837914": {"Name": "Sapin V.", "AuthorID": "7003837914", "AffiliationID": "60031581", "AffiliationName": "Division of Biology and Biological Engineering, California Institute of Technology"}, "57202974749": {"Name": "Pham U.", "AuthorID": "57202974749", "AffiliationID": "60031581", "AffiliationName": "Division of Biology and Biological Engineering, California Institute of Technology"}, "57117444800": {"Name": "Engle J.", "AuthorID": "57117444800", "AffiliationID": "60031581", "AffiliationName": "Division of Biology and Biological Engineering, California Institute of Technology"}, "48662620600": {"Name": "Niles B.", "AuthorID": "48662620600", "AffiliationID": "60031581", "AffiliationName": "Division of Biology and Biological Engineering, California Institute of Technology"}, "57118315600": {"Name": "Montz C.", "AuthorID": "57118315600", "AffiliationID": "60031581", "AffiliationName": "Division of Biology and Biological Engineering, California Institute of Technology"}, "57117400500": {"Name": "Chakravarthy S.", "AuthorID": "57117400500", "AffiliationID": "60031581", "AffiliationName": "Division of Biology and Biological Engineering, California Institute of Technology"}, "7006332145": {"Name": "Prober D.", "AuthorID": "7006332145", "AffiliationID": "60031581", "AffiliationName": "Division of Biology and Biological Engineering, California Institute of Technology"}, "15037103000": {"Name": "Rihel J.", "AuthorID": "15037103000", "AffiliationID": "60007363", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurobiology, Northwestern University"}, "35583802100": {"Name": "Zimmerman S.", "AuthorID": "35583802100", "AffiliationID": "60009982", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Harvard University"}, "7005617966": {"Name": "Schier A.", "AuthorID": "7005617966", "AffiliationID": "60009982", "AffiliationName": "Division of Sleep Medicine, Harvard University"}, "6602886663": {"Name": "Salehi-Ashtiani K.", "AuthorID": "6602886663", "AffiliationID": "60104576", "AffiliationName": "Division of Science and Math, and Center for Genomics and Systems Biology (CGSB), New York University Abu Dhabi"}, "7202764997": {"Name": "Vidal M.", "AuthorID": "7202764997", "AffiliationID": "60002746, 60014334", "AffiliationName": "Center for Cancer Systems Biology and Department of Cancer Biology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, and Department of Genetics, Harvard Medical School"}}}
