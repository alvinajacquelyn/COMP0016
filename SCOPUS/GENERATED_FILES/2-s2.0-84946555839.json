In the fabrication, 3D vertical graphene is first prepared on carbon cloth by a micro-wave plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (MPCVD) and then few-layers MoS2 nanosheets are in-situ synthesized on the surface of the vertical graphene through a simple hydrothermal reaction. This integrated catalyst exhibits an excellent HER electrocatalytic activity including an onset potential of 50mV, an overpotential at 10mAcm-2 (\u03b710) of 78mV, a Tafel slop of 53mVdec-1, and an excellent cycling stability in acid solution. The excellent catalytic performance can be ascribed to the abundant active edges provided by the vertical MoS2 nanosheets, as well as the effective electron transport route provided by the graphene arrays on the conductive substrate. Moreover, the vertical graphene offers robust anchor sites for MoS2 nanosheets and appropriate intervals for electrolyte infiltration. This not only benefits hydrogen convection and release but also avoids the damaging or restacking of catalyst in electrochemical processes.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Carbon cloth", "Few-layers MoS2 nanosheets", "Hydrogen evolution reaction", "Vertical graphene"], "IndexKeywords": ["Carbon cloths", "Catalytic performance", "Electrocatalytic activity", "Electrochemical process", "Hierarchical composite", "Hydrogen evolution reactions", "Hydrothermal reaction", "Molybdenum disulfide nanosheets"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84946555839", "SubjectAreas": [["Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment", "ENER", "2105"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"56150320000": {"Name": "Zhang Z.", "AuthorID": "56150320000", "AffiliationID": "60013983", "AffiliationName": "Center of Super-Diamond and Advanced Films (COSDAF), Department of Physics and Materials Science, City University of Hong Kong"}, "54882046300": {"Name": "Yuen M.", "AuthorID": "54882046300", "AffiliationID": "60013983", "AffiliationName": "Center of Super-Diamond and Advanced Films (COSDAF), Department of Physics and Materials Science, City University of Hong Kong"}, "24822626900": {"Name": "Ng T.", "AuthorID": "24822626900", "AffiliationID": "60013983", "AffiliationName": "Center of Super-Diamond and Advanced Films (COSDAF), Department of Physics and Materials Science, City University of Hong Kong"}, "16464316100": {"Name": "Lee C.", "AuthorID": "16464316100", "AffiliationID": "60013983", "AffiliationName": "Center of Super-Diamond and Advanced Films (COSDAF), Department of Physics and Materials Science, City University of Hong Kong"}, "37070726100": {"Name": "Zhang W.", "AuthorID": "37070726100", "AffiliationID": "60013983", "AffiliationName": "Center of Super-Diamond and Advanced Films (COSDAF), Department of Physics and Materials Science, City University of Hong Kong"}, "56193117100": {"Name": "Li W.", "AuthorID": "56193117100", "AffiliationID": "60102083, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "Functional Thin Films Research Centre, Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "25823954600": {"Name": "Tang Y.", "AuthorID": "25823954600", "AffiliationID": "60102083, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "Functional Thin Films Research Centre, Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "55936425600": {"Name": "Chen X.", "AuthorID": "55936425600", "AffiliationID": "60008524", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry and Forensic Sciences, Faculty of Life Sciences, University of Bradford"}}}
