Twins are at higher risk of aneuploidy, structural anomalies, and placental abnormalities. Some of the placental and umbilical cord abnormalities found in twin gestations are nonspecific and can be found in singleton gestations (ie, placenta previa, placental abruption, single umbilical artery, velamentous cord insertion, vasa previa, etc). However, other anomalies are unique to twin gestations, and are mainly associated with monochorionic twins-these include intraplacental anastomosis and cord entanglement. Most of these conditions can be diagnosed with ultrasound. An accurate and early diagnosis is important in the management of twin gestations. Determination of chorionicity, amnionicity, and the identification of placental anomalies are key issues for the adequate management of twin pregnancies. Pathologic placental examination after delivery can help in assessing the presence of placental and umbilical cord abnormalities, as well as providing information about chorionicity and gaining insight into the potential mechanisms of disease affecting twin gestations.", "AuthorKeywords": ["chorionicity", "cord entanglement", "discordant growth", "fetal placental ratio", "intertwin septum", "multiple gestation", "twin to twin transfusion syndrome", "vascular anatomosis", "zygosity"], "IndexKeywords": ["Chorion", "Female", "Fetal Development", "Humans", "Hydatidiform Mole", "Placenta", "Placenta Diseases", "Pregnancy", "Pregnancy, Twin", "Twins, Dizygotic", "Twins, Monozygotic", "Ultrasonography, Prenatal", "Umbilical Cord", "Vascular Fistula"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84942626575", "SubjectAreas": [["Obstetrics and Gynecology", "MEDI", "2729"]], "AuthorData": {"7004267655": {"Name": "Hubinont C.", "AuthorID": "7004267655", "AffiliationID": "60012936, 60000874", "AffiliationName": "Department of Obstetrics, Saint Luc University Hospital, Universit\u00e9 de Louvain"}, "35130569600": {"Name": "Bernard P.", "AuthorID": "35130569600", "AffiliationID": "60012936, 60000874", "AffiliationName": "Department of Obstetrics, Saint Luc University Hospital, Universit\u00e9 de Louvain"}, "17345325700": {"Name": "Debi\u00e8ve F.", "AuthorID": "17345325700", "AffiliationID": "60012936, 60000874", "AffiliationName": "Department of Obstetrics, Saint Luc University Hospital, Universit\u00e9 de Louvain"}, "36726340300": {"Name": "Marbaix E.", "AuthorID": "36726340300", "AffiliationID": "60012936, 60000874", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, Saint Luc University Hospital, Universit\u00e9 de Louvain"}, "6602231004": {"Name": "Lewi L.", "AuthorID": "6602231004", "AffiliationID": "60031069, 60025063", "AffiliationName": "Department of Obstetrics, University Hospitals, Department of Development and Regeneration, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven"}, "57203176734": {"Name": "Jauniaux E.", "AuthorID": "57203176734", "AffiliationID": "60029950", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Women's Health, University College London Medical School"}}}
