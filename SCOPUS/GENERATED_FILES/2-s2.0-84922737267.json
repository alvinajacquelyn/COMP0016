Methods: A randomized study with blinded observers was performed comparing parameters such as thickness, transparency, viable endothelial cell density (VECD), morphology, and overall quality (OQ) of the corneal tissues preserved in synthetic and a serum-based medium, respectively. Seven human paired corneas were randomly selected and assessed at day 0 (initial), day 2 (before organ culture), day 30 (before deturgescence/ deswelling storage), and 48 hours post deswelling. Thickness was determined with optical coherence tomography and transparency with a validated, custom device. The morphology and VECD were observed after treating the tissues with trypan blue and sucrose. Data were compared using paired t tests with p<0.05 deemed significant. Results: Parameters were similar at the initial stage between the groups with no statistically significant difference. However, after preservation in the deturgescent medium, the corneas stored in a serum-based medium showed a higher and statistically significant OQ value (p = 0.0317). Conclusions: The OQ of a serum-based medium was higher than that of the synthetic medium. A higher rate of transparency and reduction in thickness was observed in the serum-based medium at the end of the storage. Although complete synthetic media may have distinct advantages of being serum/animal-free, the quality of the cornea is of a reasonable concern when it is deemed for transplantation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Conventional organ culture storage", "Cornea", "Synthetic medium"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Cell Count", "Cell Survival", "Cornea", "Cryopreservation", "Culture Media", "Double-Blind Method", "Endothelium, Corneal", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Organ Culture Techniques", "Organ Preservation", "Serum", "Tomography, Optical Coherence"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84922737267", "SubjectAreas": [["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"]], "AuthorData": {"54795700400": {"Name": "Parekh M.", "AuthorID": "54795700400", "AffiliationID": "60172700", "AffiliationName": "International Center for Ocular Physiopathology, The Veneto Eye Bank Foundation"}, "57190211074": {"Name": "Ferrari S.", "AuthorID": "57190211074", "AffiliationID": "60172700", "AffiliationName": "International Center for Ocular Physiopathology, The Veneto Eye Bank Foundation"}, "6503974063": {"Name": "Salvalaio G.", "AuthorID": "6503974063", "AffiliationID": "60172700", "AffiliationName": "International Center for Ocular Physiopathology, The Veneto Eye Bank Foundation"}, "6603422101": {"Name": "Ponzin D.", "AuthorID": "6603422101", "AffiliationID": "60172700", "AffiliationName": "International Center for Ocular Physiopathology, The Veneto Eye Bank Foundation"}}}
