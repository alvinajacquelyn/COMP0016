In particular, by designing the PhC cavities so as they possess two optical modes separated by the Raman frequency of silicon, one can achieve large optical field enhancement at both the pump and Stokes frequencies. As a consequence, the effective Raman susceptibility of the nonlinear metasurface, calculated using a novel homogenization technique, is significantly larger than the intrinsic Raman susceptibility of silicon. Implications to technological applications of our theoretical study are discussed, too.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Homogenization techniques", "Optical field enhancement", "Orders of magnitude", "Periodic distribution", "Raman frequencies", "Stimulated Raman amplification", "Technological applications", "Theoretical study"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85056848890", "SubjectAreas": [["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"]], "AuthorData": {"57203316923": {"Name": "Ren Q.", "AuthorID": "57203316923", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "55487309400": {"Name": "You J.", "AuthorID": "55487309400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "7004097868": {"Name": "Panoiu N.", "AuthorID": "7004097868", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}}}
