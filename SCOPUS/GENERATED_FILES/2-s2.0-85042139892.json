Some of these schemes for quantum batteries rely on the use of global many-body interactions that take the batteries through a correlated shortcut in state space. Here we extend the notion of a quantum battery from a collection of a priori isolated systems to a many-body quantum system with intrinsic interactions. Specifically, we consider a one-dimensional spin chain with physically realistic two-body interactions. We find that the spin-spin interactions can yield an advantage in charging power over the noninteracting case and we demonstrate that this advantage can grow superextensively when the interactions are long ranged. However, we show that, unlike in previous work, this advantage is a mean-field interaction effect that does not involve correlations and that relies on the interactions being intrinsic to the battery.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Isolated systems", "Many-body interactions", "Many-body quantum systems", "Mean-field interactions", "One dimensional spin chains", "Spin chain models", "Spin-spin interaction", "Two-body interactions"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85042139892", "SubjectAreas": [["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"]], "AuthorData": {"57203386239": {"Name": "Le T.P.", "AuthorID": "57203386239", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "6508193614": {"Name": "Levinsen J.", "AuthorID": "6508193614", "AffiliationID": "60019578, 60170544", "AffiliationName": "ARC Centre of Excellence in Future Low-Energy Electronics Technologies, Monash University"}, "57204254646": {"Name": "Modi K.", "AuthorID": "57204254646", "AffiliationID": "60019578", "AffiliationName": "School of Physics and Astronomy, Monash University"}, "9240980200": {"Name": "Parish M.M.", "AuthorID": "9240980200", "AffiliationID": "60019578, 60170544", "AffiliationName": "ARC Centre of Excellence in Future Low-Energy Electronics Technologies, Monash University"}, "55814176100": {"Name": "Pollock F.A.", "AuthorID": "55814176100", "AffiliationID": "60019578", "AffiliationName": "School of Physics and Astronomy, Monash University"}}}
