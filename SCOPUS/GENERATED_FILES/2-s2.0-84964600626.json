Using comprehensive matched employer-employee data covering the entire workforce in one large metropolitan labour market combined with unique survey data linked to administrative records, we provide evidence that workers earn higher wages and are less inclined to leave their firms if they have obtained their job through a referral. These effects are particularly strong at the beginning of the employment relationship and decline with tenure in the firm, suggesting that firms and workers learn about workers' productivity over time. Overall, our findings imply that job search networks help to reduce informational deficiencies in the labour market and lead to productivity gains for workers and firms.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Networks", "Referrals", "Uncertainty"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84964600626", "SubjectAreas": [["Economics and Econometrics", "ECON", "2002"]], "AuthorData": {"7004410022": {"Name": "Dustmann C.", "AuthorID": "7004410022", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London (UCL), Centre for Research and Analysis of Migration (CREAM)"}, "25960551600": {"Name": "Glitz A.", "AuthorID": "25960551600", "AffiliationID": "60105207", "AffiliationName": "Universitat Pompeu Fabra and Barcelona GSE"}, "17344617400": {"Name": "Sch\u00f6nberg U.", "AuthorID": "17344617400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London (UCL), Centre for Research and Analysis of Migration (CREAM), Institute for Employment Research (IAB)"}, "8520213900": {"Name": "Br\u00fccker H.", "AuthorID": "8520213900", "AffiliationID": "60011372", "AffiliationName": "University of Bamberg, Institute for Employment Research (IAB)"}}}
