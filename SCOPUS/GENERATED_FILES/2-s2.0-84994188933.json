An intersectional framework was used which took the viewpoint that socio-demographic identities should be considered simultaneously in order to challenge universalist, gender and ethnic neutral assumptions of leadership. One hundred and thirty women of white, black, Asian and mixed ethnicity in senior management and leadership positions from a broad range of sectors participated in focus groups and interviews exploring leadership constructions and enactment. White women\u2019s leadership definitions reflected contemporary leadership models. In contrast, minority ethnic women defined leadership using predominantly ethno-cultural lenses, which informed their self-identities and orientation towards others. Regarding enacting leader identities, white women described historical gender and class barriers to enacting leadership, while minority ethnic women described current barriers linked to ethnic and religious identities. Practical implications for women\u2019s leader identity development and theoretical implications for developing more inclusive leadership theories are discussed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["ethnicity", "gender", "identity", "Intersectionality", "leadership", "qualitative"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84994188933", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["Strategy and Management", "BUSI", "1408"]], "AuthorData": {"55775837900": {"Name": "Showunmi V.", "AuthorID": "55775837900", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "Department of Lifelong Learning and Comparative Education, UCL IOE"}, "55102808000": {"Name": "Atewologun D.", "AuthorID": "55102808000", "AffiliationID": "60022109", "AffiliationName": "School of Business and Management, Queen Mary University of London"}, "57200861462": {"Name": "Bebbington D.", "AuthorID": "57200861462", "AffiliationID": "117628541", "AffiliationName": "Knowledge Perspectives Ltd"}}}
