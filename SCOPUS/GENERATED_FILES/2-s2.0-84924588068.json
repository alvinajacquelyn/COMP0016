In this article, we reveal a reciprocal interaction whereby circulating human plasmablasts are potent inducers of the Tfh cell-differentiation program, including the expression of their key transcription factor Bcl-6. The markedly increased propensity of plasmablasts, compared with naive B cells, to induce Tfh cell differentiation was due to their increased production of IL-6. Specific targeting of IL-6 using tocilizumab therapy in patients with rheumatoid arthritis led to a significant reduction in circulating Tfh cell numbers and IL-21 production, which was correlated with reduced plasmablast formation. Our data uncover a positive-feedback loop between circulating plasmablasts and Tfh cells that could sustain autoimmunity and spread Ab-driven inflammation to unaffected sites; this represents an important therapeutic target, as well as reveals a novel mechanism of action for tocilizumab.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized", "Antigens, CD19", "Arthritis, Rheumatoid", "B-Lymphocytes", "CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes", "Cell Differentiation", "Cell Proliferation", "Cells, Cultured", "Coculture Techniques", "DNA-Binding Proteins", "Flow Cytometry", "Humans", "Inducible T-Cell Co-Stimulator Protein", "Interleukin-6", "Interleukins", "Plasma Cells", "Receptors, CXCR5", "T-Lymphocytes, Helper-Inducer"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84924588068", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"]], "AuthorData": {"35073506800": {"Name": "Chavele K.", "AuthorID": "35073506800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Medicine, Centre for Rheumatology, University College London"}, "56545554300": {"Name": "Merry E.", "AuthorID": "56545554300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Medicine, Centre for Rheumatology, University College London"}, "7004262550": {"Name": "Ehrenstein M.", "AuthorID": "7004262550", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Medicine, Centre for Rheumatology, University College London"}}}
