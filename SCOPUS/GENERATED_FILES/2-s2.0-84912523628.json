We examined multivariable associations between household income, social class, education, area deprivation for each SEP indicator (including a 5-point composite SEP score computed by aggregating individual SEP indicators) and each ST indicator using generalised linear models.Results: Accelerometry-measured total ST and occupational sitting/standing were positively associated with SEP score and most of its constituent SEP indicators, while television time was negatively associated with SEP score and education level. Arealevel deprivation was largely unrelated to ST. Those in the lowest composite SEP group spent 64 (95% CIs 52 to 76) and 72 (48 to 98), fewer minutes/day in total ST and occupational sitting/standing compared to those in the top SEP group, and an additional 48 (35-60) min/day watching television (p0.001 for linear trend). Stratified analyses showed that these associations between composite SEP score and total ST were evident only among participants who were in employment.Conclusions: Occupational sitting seems to drive the positive association between SEP and total ST. Lower SEP is linked to higher TV viewing times.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "England", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Sedentary Lifestyle", "Self Report", "Socioeconomic Factors", "Television", "Time Factors", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84912523628", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"55847987800": {"Name": "Stamatakis E.", "AuthorID": "55847987800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "PARG (Physical Activity Research Group), Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "55322175100": {"Name": "Coombs N.", "AuthorID": "55322175100", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "Department of Social Sciences, University of Southampton"}, "6601962405": {"Name": "Shelton N.", "AuthorID": "6601962405", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "PARG (Physical Activity Research Group), Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "7006247540": {"Name": "Rowlands A.", "AuthorID": "7006247540", "AffiliationID": "60031846", "AffiliationName": "Division of Health Sciences, University of South Australia"}, "6603507307": {"Name": "Hillsdon M.", "AuthorID": "6603507307", "AffiliationID": "60026479", "AffiliationName": "Department of Sport and Health Sciences, College of Life and Environmental Sciences, University of Exeter"}}}
