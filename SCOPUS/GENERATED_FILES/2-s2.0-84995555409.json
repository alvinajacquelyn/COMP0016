The synthesized materials were characterized by elemental analysis, infrared spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, nitrogen adsorption, X-rays diffraction, thermogravimetry and scanning and transmission electron microscopy. The functionalized material showed highly ordered mesoporous network with a surface area of 629.0 m2 g\u2212 1. The incorporation of long hydrophobic amine chains on silica surface resulted in high drug loading capacity (21% Mass/Mass) and prolonged release of ibuprofen up till 75.5 h. The preliminary investigations suggests that the synthesized materials could be proposed as controlled release devices to prolong the therapeutic effect of short life drugs such as ibuprofen to increase its efficacy and to reduce frequent dosage.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Ibuprofen and controlled drug release", "Mesoporous silica", "Surface modification"], "IndexKeywords": ["Controlled drug release", "Controlled release devices", "Drug release system", "Functionalized materials", "Mesoporous Silica", "Scanning and transmission electron microscopy", "Synthesized materials", "Therapeutic effects", "Adsorption", "Amines", "Drug Carriers", "Drug Liberation", "Hydrophobic and Hydrophilic Interactions", "Ibuprofen", "Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy", "Microscopy, Electron, Scanning", "Microscopy, Electron, Transmission", "Porosity", "Scattering, Small Angle", "Silicon Dioxide", "Thermogravimetry", "X-Ray Diffraction"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84995555409", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Mechanics of Materials", "ENGI", "2211"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"]], "AuthorData": {"55973463500": {"Name": "Rehman F.", "AuthorID": "55973463500", "AffiliationID": "60105168", "AffiliationName": "Interdisciplinary Research Centre in Biomedical Materials (IRCBM), COMSATS Institute of Information Technology"}, "7202086843": {"Name": "Ahmed K.", "AuthorID": "7202086843", "AffiliationID": "60029570", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Chemistry, University of Campinas"}, "7004870189": {"Name": "Airoldi C.", "AuthorID": "7004870189", "AffiliationID": "60029570", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Chemistry, University of Campinas"}, "7102913880": {"Name": "Volpe P.", "AuthorID": "7102913880", "AffiliationID": "60029570", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Chemistry, University of Campinas"}, "56556155600": {"Name": "Rahim A.", "AuthorID": "56556155600", "AffiliationID": "60105168", "AffiliationName": "Interdisciplinary Research Centre in Biomedical Materials (IRCBM), COMSATS Institute of Information Technology"}, "36118089500": {"Name": "Muhammad N.", "AuthorID": "36118089500", "AffiliationID": "60105168", "AffiliationName": "Interdisciplinary Research Centre in Biomedical Materials (IRCBM), COMSATS Institute of Information Technology"}, "6602683597": {"Name": "Gaisford S.", "AuthorID": "6602683597", "AffiliationID": "60016379, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "36020023200": {"Name": "Buanz A.", "AuthorID": "36020023200", "AffiliationID": "60016379, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy, University College London"}}}
