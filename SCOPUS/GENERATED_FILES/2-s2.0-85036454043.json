Methylene blue, stearic acid, and sulfamethoxazole were used as dye, organic, and antibiotic model pollutants, respectively, to demonstrate the efficiency of these nanocomposite coatings for water decontamination or self-cleaning surfaces applications. Raman investigations revealed the formation of anatase polymorph of TiO2 in all synthesized coatings with a shifting of the main vibrational mode peak to higher wavenumber in the case of Au-TiO2 coating, indicating an increase number of crystalline defects within this coating. Because of the difference of the chemical potentials of each of the investigated noble metals, the sputtered metal layers exhibit different morphology. Pt sputtered atoms, with high surface adhesion, promote formation of a smooth 2D layer. On the other hand, Au sputtered atoms with higher cohesive forces promote the formation of 5-10 nm nanoparticles. As a result, the surface plasmon resonance phenomenon was observed in the Au-TiO2 coatings. UV photoactivity of the nanocomposite coatings was enhanced 1.5-3 times and 1.3 times for methylene blue and stearic acid, respectively, thanks to the enhancement of electron trapping in the noble metal layer. This electron trapping phenomenon is higher in the Pt-TiO2 coating because of its larger work function. On the other hand, the enhancement of the visible photoactivity was more pronounced (3 and 7 times for methylene blue and stearic acid, respectively) in the case of Au-TiO2 thanks to the surface plasmon resonance. Finally, these nanocomposite TiO2 coatings exhibited also a good ability for the degradation of antibiotics usually found in wastewater such as sulfamethoxazole. However, a complementary test have showed an increase of the toxicity of the liquid medium after photocatalysis, which could be due the presence of sulfamethoxazole's transformation byproducts.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Au-TiO2", "ecotoxicity evaluation", "photocatalysis", "plasmonic TiO2", "Pt-TiO2", "stearic acid degradation", "sulfamethoxazole degradation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Acid degradation", "Ecotoxicity evaluation", "Nano-composite coating", "plasmonic TiO2", "Self-cleaning surfaces", "Sulfamethoxazole", "Transformation by-products", "Water decontamination"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85036454043", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"]], "AuthorData": {"55314997800": {"Name": "Baba K.", "AuthorID": "55314997800", "AffiliationID": "60105942", "AffiliationName": "Materials Research and Technology Department, Luxembourg Institute of Science and Technology"}, "36184896800": {"Name": "Bulou S.", "AuthorID": "36184896800", "AffiliationID": "60105942", "AffiliationName": "Materials Research and Technology Department, Luxembourg Institute of Science and Technology"}, "57191366242": {"Name": "Quesada-Gonzalez M.", "AuthorID": "57191366242", "AffiliationID": "60105942", "AffiliationName": "Materials Research and Technology Department, Luxembourg Institute of Science and Technology"}, "12139371400": {"Name": "Boscher N.", "AuthorID": "12139371400", "AffiliationID": "60105942", "AffiliationName": "Materials Research and Technology Department, Luxembourg Institute of Science and Technology"}, "7003947764": {"Name": "Choquet P.", "AuthorID": "7003947764", "AffiliationID": "60105942", "AffiliationName": "Materials Research and Technology Department, Luxembourg Institute of Science and Technology"}, "35788792600": {"Name": "Bonot S.", "AuthorID": "35788792600", "AffiliationID": "60105942", "AffiliationName": "Environmental Research and Innovation Department, Luxembourg Institute of Science and Technology"}, "57198352807": {"Name": "Collard D.", "AuthorID": "57198352807", "AffiliationID": "60105942", "AffiliationName": "Environmental Research and Innovation Department, Luxembourg Institute of Science and Technology"}}}
