Method A systematic literature search resulted in 29 publications describing original research on the neuropsychology of LOS/VLOSLP and 46 studies focussing on neurobiology. Results Although mildly progressive cognitive impairment is usually present, only a subgroup of LOS/VLOSLP develops dementia during a 10-year follow-up succeeding the onset of psychosis. This coincides with the absence of neuropathological evidence for neurodegeneration in many cases. Cognitive deterioration is characterized by deficits in (working) memory, language, psychomotor speed and executive functioning. Underlying neurobiological changes encompass white matter pathology, increased ventricle-to-brain ratio (VBR) with coinciding atrophy and hypo-metabolism of frontal, temporal and subcortical areas. Conclusions Multiple changes in neurobiology and cognition contributing to LOS/VLOSLP may reflect stress-related accelerated brain aging rather than neurodegenerative pathology. Their involvement in the onset of illness, however, might be inversely proportional to pre-existing (psychosocial and/or genetic) vulnerability to psychosis.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Elderly", "Neurobiology", "Neuropsychology", "Schizophrenia"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cognition Disorders", "Humans", "Neurobiology", "Neuropsychological Tests", "Psychotic Disorders", "Schizophrenia", "Schizophrenic Psychology"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85029213406", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuropsychology and Physiological Psychology", "PSYC", "3206"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"], ["Behavioral Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2802"]], "AuthorData": {"55443648800": {"Name": "Van Assche L.", "AuthorID": "55443648800", "AffiliationID": "60031069, 60025063", "AffiliationName": "Section of Old Age Psychiatry, Department of Psychiatry, University Hospitals Leuven, KUL"}, "55444545000": {"Name": "Van de Ven L.", "AuthorID": "55444545000", "AffiliationID": "60031069, 60025063", "AffiliationName": "Section of Old Age Psychiatry, Department of Psychiatry, University Hospitals Leuven, KUL"}, "8731868400": {"Name": "Vandenbulcke M.", "AuthorID": "8731868400", "AffiliationID": "60031069, 60025063", "AffiliationName": "Section of Old Age Psychiatry, Department of Psychiatry, University Hospitals Leuven, KUL"}, "15765840300": {"Name": "Morrens M.", "AuthorID": "15765840300", "AffiliationID": "119211581", "AffiliationName": "University Psychiatric Hospital Antwerp, Campus Duffel"}, "57203069499": {"Name": "Luyten P.", "AuthorID": "57203069499", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London"}}}
