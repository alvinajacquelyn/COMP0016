Many of the longstanding concerns about fMRI adaptation have received empirical support from neurophysiological studies over the last decade. We review these studies here, and also consider neuroimaging studies that have investigated how fMRI adaptation effects are influenced by high-level perceptual processes. The results of these studies further emphasize the need to interpret fMRI adaptation results with caution, but they also provide helpful guidance for more accurate interpretation and better experimental design. In addition, we argue that rather than being used as a proxy for measurements of neuronal stimulus selectivity, fMRI adaptation may be most useful for studying population-level adaptation effects across cortical processing hierarchies.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Adaptation", "Function imaging", "Repetition suppression", "Surround suppression"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adaptation, Physiological", "Brain Mapping", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Photic Stimulation", "Visual Cortex", "Visual Perception"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84950257738", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuropsychology and Physiological Psychology", "PSYC", "3206"], ["Experimental and Cognitive Psychology", "PSYC", "3205"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"]], "AuthorData": {"34571079300": {"Name": "Larsson J.", "AuthorID": "34571079300", "AffiliationID": "60020595", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Royal Holloway, University of London"}, "7401460528": {"Name": "Solomon S.G.", "AuthorID": "7401460528", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Experimental Psychology, University College London"}, "7102474884": {"Name": "Kohn A.", "AuthorID": "7102474884", "AffiliationID": "60002388", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences, Albert Einstein College of Medicine"}}}
