Methods: We assessed serum glucose, triglycerides (TG) and total cholesterol (TC) measured prospectively 3 months to 3 years before diagnosis in 1798 Swedish women diagnosed with any type of BC between 1985 and 1999. In addition to using Cox regression, we employed latent class proportional hazards models to capture any heterogeneity of associations between these markers and BC death. The latter method was extended to include the primary outcome (BC death) and competing outcomes (CV death and death from other causes), allowing latent class-specific hazard estimation for cause-specific deaths. Results: A lack of association between prediagnostic glucose, TG or TC with BC death was observed with Cox regression. With latent class proportional hazards model, two latent classes (Class I and II) were suggested. Class I, comprising the majority (81.5 %) of BC patients, had an increased risk of BC death following higher TG levels (HR: 1.87, 95 % CI: 1.01-3.45 for every log TG increase). Lower overall survival was observed in Class II, but no association for BC death was found. On the other hand, TC positively corresponded to CV death in Class II, and similarly, glucose to death from other causes. Conclusion: Addressing cohort heterogeneity in relation to BC survival is important in understanding the relationship between metabolic markers and cause-specific death in presence of competing outcomes.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Breast cancer", "Competing risk", "Glucose", "Latent class", "Lipid", "Survival"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Blood Glucose", "Breast Neoplasms", "Cholesterol", "Female", "Humans", "Middle Aged", "Neoplasm Recurrence, Local", "Prognosis", "Risk Factors", "Triglycerides"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84946949845", "SubjectAreas": [["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Cancer Research", "BIOC", "1306"]], "AuthorData": {"55372637900": {"Name": "Wulaningsih W.", "AuthorID": "55372637900", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "King's College London, Cancer Epidemiology Group, Division of Cancer Studies"}, "56569493800": {"Name": "Vahdaninia M.", "AuthorID": "56569493800", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "King's College London, Cancer Epidemiology Group, Division of Cancer Studies"}, "34770502400": {"Name": "Holmberg L.", "AuthorID": "34770502400", "AffiliationID": "112954122", "AffiliationName": "Regional Cancer Centre"}, "6603460135": {"Name": "Garmo H.", "AuthorID": "6603460135", "AffiliationID": "112954122", "AffiliationName": "Regional Cancer Centre"}, "25932351400": {"Name": "Van Hemelrijck M.", "AuthorID": "25932351400", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Environmental Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Department of Epidemiology"}, "37111319700": {"Name": "Rowley M.", "AuthorID": "37111319700", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "King's College London, Institute for Mathematical and Molecular Biomedicine"}, "7006622143": {"Name": "Coolen A.C.", "AuthorID": "7006622143", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "King's College London, Institute for Mathematical and Molecular Biomedicine"}, "55794071700": {"Name": "Lambe M.", "AuthorID": "55794071700", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Karolinska Institutet, Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics"}, "7004699997": {"Name": "Malmstrom H.", "AuthorID": "7004699997", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Environmental Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Department of Epidemiology"}, "7006083229": {"Name": "Hammar N.", "AuthorID": "7006083229", "AffiliationID": "60000666", "AffiliationName": "AstraZeneca Sverige"}, "55530293100": {"Name": "Walldius G.", "AuthorID": "55530293100", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Environmental Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Department of Cardiovascular Epidemiology"}, "6603058283": {"Name": "Jungner I.", "AuthorID": "6603058283", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Karolinska Institutet and CALAB Research, Department of Medicine, Clinical Epidemiological Unit"}}}
