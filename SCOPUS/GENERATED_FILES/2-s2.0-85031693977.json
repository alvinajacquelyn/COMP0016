Comprehensive evidence syntheses, including meta-analyses, were performed to summarise all available evidence relevant to the Task Force\u2019s questions. The evidence was appraised using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach and the results were summarised in evidence profiles. The evidence syntheses were discussed and recommendations formulated by a multidisciplinary Task Force of COPD experts. After considering the balance of desirable and undesirable consequences, quality of evidence, feasibility, and acceptability of various interventions, the Task Force made: 1) a strong recommendation for noninvasive mechanical ventilation of patients with acute or acute-on-chronic respiratory failure; 2) conditional recommendations for oral corticosteroids in outpatients, oral rather than intravenous corticosteroids in hospitalised patients, antibiotic therapy, home-based management, and the initiation of pulmonary rehabilitation within 3 weeks after hospital discharge; and 3) a conditional recommendation against the initiation of pulmonary rehabilitation during hospitalisation. The Task Force provided recommendations related to corticosteroid therapy, antibiotic therapy, noninvasive mechanical ventilation, home-based management, and early pulmonary rehabilitation in patients having a COPD exacerbation. These recommendations should be reconsidered as new evidence becomes available.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adrenal Cortex Hormones", "Bronchodilator Agents", "Disease Management", "Disease Progression", "Europe", "Hospitalization", "Humans", "Noninvasive Ventilation", "Practice Guidelines as Topic", "Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive", "Respiratory Insufficiency", "Societies, Medical", "United States"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85031693977", "SubjectAreas": [["Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine", "MEDI", "2740"]], "AuthorData": {"7005667185": {"Name": "Wedzicha J.A.", "AuthorID": "7005667185", "AffiliationID": "60010719, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "Airways Disease Section, National Heart and Lung Institute, Imperial College London"}, "7004909276": {"Name": "Miravitlles M.", "AuthorID": "7004909276", "AffiliationID": "60012486", "AffiliationName": "Pneumology Dept., Hospital Universitari Vall d\u2019Hebron, CIBER de Enfermedades Respiratorias (CIBERES)"}, "57201513306": {"Name": "Hurst J.R.", "AuthorID": "57201513306", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Respiratory, University College London"}, "7005728897": {"Name": "Calverley P.M.A.", "AuthorID": "7005728897", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Ageing and Chronic Disease, University of Liverpool"}, "16410621100": {"Name": "Albert R.K.", "AuthorID": "16410621100", "AffiliationID": "60028392", "AffiliationName": "Dept. of Medicine, University of Colorado"}, "7005579878": {"Name": "Anzueto A.", "AuthorID": "7005579878", "AffiliationID": "60018573, 60014232", "AffiliationName": "University of Texas Health Science Center, South Texas Veterans Health Care System"}, "57214687096": {"Name": "Criner G.J.", "AuthorID": "57214687096", "AffiliationID": "60013936, 60030398", "AffiliationName": "Dept. of Thoracic Medicine and Surgery, Lewis Katz School of Medicine at Temple University"}, "7006239532": {"Name": "Papi A.", "AuthorID": "7006239532", "AffiliationID": "60024690", "AffiliationName": "Respiratory Medicine, Dept. of Medical Sciences, University of Ferrara"}, "7102576614": {"Name": "Rabe K.F.", "AuthorID": "7102576614", "AffiliationID": "60012345", "AffiliationName": "Dept of Internal Medicine, Christian-Albrechts University, Kiel and LungenClinic Grosshansdorf, Airway Research Centre North, German Centre for Lung Research"}, "6508202804": {"Name": "Rigau D.", "AuthorID": "6508202804", "AffiliationID": "112671021", "AffiliationName": "Iberoamerican Cochrane Center"}, "35421031800": {"Name": "Sliwinski P.", "AuthorID": "35421031800", "AffiliationID": "60073381", "AffiliationName": "2nd Dept. of Respiratory Medicine, Institute of Tuberculosis and Lung Diseases"}, "8665754600": {"Name": "Tonia T.", "AuthorID": "8665754600", "AffiliationID": "60105053, 60020486", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine, University of Bern"}, "34573970200": {"Name": "Vestbo J.", "AuthorID": "34573970200", "AffiliationID": "60172345, 60003771", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection, Immunity and Respiratory Medicine, University of Manchester"}, "7403726459": {"Name": "Wilson K.C.", "AuthorID": "7403726459", "AffiliationID": "60006385", "AffiliationName": "Dept. of Medicine, Boston University School of Medicine"}, "7006557124": {"Name": "Krishnan J.A.", "AuthorID": "7006557124", "AffiliationID": "60138105", "AffiliationName": "University of Illinois Hospital and Health Sciences System"}}}
