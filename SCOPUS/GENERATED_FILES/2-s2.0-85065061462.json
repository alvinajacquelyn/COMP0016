The reviewed neuroimaging studies provide new evidence about the role of brain areas of the semantic network involved in the encoding of some types of information during processing of abstract and concrete concepts, better characterizing the neural underpinnings and the organizational principles of semantic representation of these types of word.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Concrete words", "Fmri", "Semantic representation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Brain", "Humans", "Reading", "Semantics", "Speech Perception"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85065061462", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Physiology", "BIOC", "1314"]], "AuthorData": {"55735884100": {"Name": "Montefinese M.", "AuthorID": "55735884100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Experimental Psychology, University College London"}}}
