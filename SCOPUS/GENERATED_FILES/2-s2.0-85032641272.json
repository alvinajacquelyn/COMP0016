In this Letter, we propose a statistical phase transition model which accurately describes the ordering of the CH3NH3 + cations and the whole phase transition sequence of the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite. The model is based on the available structural information and involves the short-range strain-mediated and long-range dipolar interactions between the cations. It is solved using Monte Carlo simulations on a three-dimensional lattice allowing us to study the heat capacity and electric polarization of the CH3NH3 + cations. The temperature dependence of the polarization indicates the antiferroelectric nature of these perovskites. We support this result by performing pyrocurrent measurements of CH3NH3PbX3 (X = I, Br, Cl) single crystals. We also address the possible occurrence of the multidomain phase and the ordering entropy of our model.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Electric polarization", "High power conversion", "Methylammonium cations", "Phase transition model", "Structural information", "Temperature dependence", "Three-dimensional lattices", "Transition sequences"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85032641272", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"]], "AuthorData": {"55865561500": {"Name": "\u0160imenas M.", "AuthorID": "55865561500", "AffiliationID": "60059987", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Physics, Vilnius University"}, "56755340700": {"Name": "Bal\u010diunas S.", "AuthorID": "56755340700", "AffiliationID": "60059987", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Physics, Vilnius University"}, "7003687871": {"Name": "Banys J.", "AuthorID": "7003687871", "AffiliationID": "60059987", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Physics, Vilnius University"}, "15725818100": {"Name": "M\u0105czka M.", "AuthorID": "15725818100", "AffiliationID": "60089023, 60014383", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Low Temperature and Structure Research, Polish Academy of Sciences"}, "56962710000": {"Name": "Tornau E.E.", "AuthorID": "56962710000", "AffiliationID": "60105695", "AffiliationName": "Semiconductor Physics Institute, Center for Physical Sciences and Technology"}}}
