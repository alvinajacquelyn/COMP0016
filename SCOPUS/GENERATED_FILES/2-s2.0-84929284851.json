There are limited reports of its use in the setting of radiorecurrent disease. Our aim was to assess mp-MRI for detection of radiorecurrent prostate cancer and examine the added value of its functional sequences.Methods:Thirty-seven men with mean age of 69.7 (interquartile range, 66-74) with biochemical failure after external beam radiotherapy underwent mp-MRI (T2-weighted, high b-value, multi-b-value apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) imaging); then transperineal systematic template prostate mapping (TPM) biopsy. Using a locked sequential read paradigm (with the sequence order above), two experienced radiologists independently reported mp-MRI studies using score 1-5. Radiologist scores were matched with TPM histopathology at the hemigland level (n=74). Accuracy statistics were derived for each reader. Interobserver agreement was evaluated using kappa statistics.Results:Receiver-operator characteristic area under curve (AUC) for readers 1 and 2 increased from 0.67 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.55-0.80) to 0.80 (95% CI, 0.69-0.91) and from 0.67 (95% CI, 0.55-0.80) to 0.84 (95% CI, 0.76-0.93), respectively, between T2-weighted imaging alone and full mp-MRI reads. Addition of ADC maps and DCE imaging to the examination did not significantly improve AUC for either reader (P=0.08 and 0.47 after adding ADC, P=0.90 and 0.27 after adding DCE imaging) compared with T2+high b-value review. Inter-reader agreement increased from k=0.39 to k=0.65 between T2 and full mp-MRI review.Conclusions:mp-MRI can detect radiorecurrent prostate cancer. The optimal examination included T2-weighted imaging and high b-value DWI; adding ADC maps and DCE imaging did not significantly improve the diagnostic accuracy.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Biopsy", "Contrast Media", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Neoplasm Recurrence, Local", "Prostate", "Prostatic Neoplasms"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84929284851", "SubjectAreas": [["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Urology", "MEDI", "2748"], ["Cancer Research", "BIOC", "1306"]], "AuthorData": {"55556214500": {"Name": "Abd-Alazeez M.", "AuthorID": "55556214500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Surgery and Interventional Science, University College London"}, "8147855500": {"Name": "Ahmed H.U.", "AuthorID": "8147855500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Surgery and Interventional Science, University College London"}, "7004667094": {"Name": "Emberton M.", "AuthorID": "7004667094", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Surgery and Interventional Science, University College London"}, "7005977360": {"Name": "Arya M.", "AuthorID": "7005977360", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London"}, "8833101600": {"Name": "Ramachandran N.", "AuthorID": "8833101600", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, University College London Hospital"}, "15076612600": {"Name": "Dikaios N.", "AuthorID": "15076612600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Imaging, University College London"}, "15053220400": {"Name": "Kirkham A.", "AuthorID": "15053220400", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, University College London Hospital"}, "57203543924": {"Name": "Taylor S.", "AuthorID": "57203543924", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Imaging, University College London"}, "55642708000": {"Name": "Halligan S.", "AuthorID": "55642708000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Imaging, University College London"}, "17036141700": {"Name": "Punwani S.", "AuthorID": "17036141700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Imaging, University College London"}}}
