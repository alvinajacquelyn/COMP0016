Cross sections are collected and reviewed for total scattering, elastic scattering, momentum transfer, excitations of rotational and vibrational states, dissociation, ionization, and dissociative attachment. For each of these processes, the recommended values of the cross sections are presented. The literature has been surveyed until end of 2016.", "AuthorKeywords": ["attachment", "dissociation", "electron collisions", "evaluation", "ionization", "total cross sections"], "IndexKeywords": ["attachment", "Cross section data", "Dissociative attachment", "Electron collision", "evaluation", "Nitrogen trifluoride", "Recommended values", "total cross sections"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85038613860", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"]], "AuthorData": {"36615843600": {"Name": "Song M.Y.", "AuthorID": "36615843600", "AffiliationID": "60104266", "AffiliationName": "Plasma Technology Research Center, National Fusion Research Institute"}, "7403587920": {"Name": "Yoon J.S.", "AuthorID": "7403587920", "AffiliationID": "60104266", "AffiliationName": "Plasma Technology Research Center, National Fusion Research Institute"}, "7403936982": {"Name": "Cho H.", "AuthorID": "7403936982", "AffiliationID": "60022417", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Chungnam National University"}, "35600812200": {"Name": "Karwasz G.P.", "AuthorID": "35600812200", "AffiliationID": "60021858", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Physics, Astronomy and Applied Informatics, University Nicolaus Copernicus"}, "6603870414": {"Name": "Kokoouline V.", "AuthorID": "6603870414", "AffiliationID": "60022144", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of Central Florida"}, "57218971249": {"Name": "Nakamura Y.", "AuthorID": "57218971249", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "57139414500": {"Name": "Hamilton J.R.", "AuthorID": "57139414500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "7101645601": {"Name": "Tennyson J.", "AuthorID": "7101645601", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}}}
