HBD2 is encoded by the DEFB4 gene, which exhibits extensive copy number variation. Previous studies have demonstrated a relationship between HBD copy number and serum HBD2 protein levels; however, our current understanding of the influence of copy number on mucosal AMP function remains limited. This study explores the relationship between HBD copy number, cervicovaginal HBD2 protein levels and antimicrobial activity in 203 women with risk factors for preterm birth. We provide evidence that suggests HBD copy number modulates cervical antimicrobial immunity.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["beta-Defensins", "DNA Copy Number Variations", "Female", "Gene Dosage", "Humans", "Immunity, Innate", "Pregnancy", "Pregnancy Complications, Infectious", "Uterus"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85040906947", "SubjectAreas": [["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Genetics (clinical)", "MEDI", "2716"]], "AuthorData": {"56454785400": {"Name": "James C.P.", "AuthorID": "56454785400", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "55737131800": {"Name": "Forya F.", "AuthorID": "55737131800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute for Women's Health"}, "7402605276": {"Name": "David A.L.", "AuthorID": "7402605276", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute for Women's Health"}, "7006889522": {"Name": "Peebles D.M.", "AuthorID": "7006889522", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute for Women's Health"}, "6603047821": {"Name": "Bajaj-Elliott M.", "AuthorID": "6603047821", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "7201775981": {"Name": "Klein N.", "AuthorID": "7201775981", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "56080920200": {"Name": "Abujaber R.", "AuthorID": "56080920200", "AffiliationID": "60033125", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genetics and Genome Biology, University of Leicester"}, "6602777968": {"Name": "Hollox E.J.", "AuthorID": "6602777968", "AffiliationID": "60033125", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genetics and Genome Biology, University of Leicester"}}}
