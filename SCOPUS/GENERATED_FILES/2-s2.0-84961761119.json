Traditionally, therapeutic approaches have sought to modulate the pro- or anti-inflammatory limbs of inflammation, with mixed success. However, insight into the pathways by which inflammation is resolved has highlighted novel opportunities to pharmacologically manipulate these processes-a strategy that might represent a complementary (and perhaps even superior) therapeutic approach. This Review discusses the state of the art in the biology of resolution of inflammation, highlighting the opportunities and challenges for translational research in this field.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Anti-Inflammatory Agents", "Disease Models, Animal", "Humans", "Inflammation", "Inflammation Mediators", "Mice", "Rats", "Signal Transduction", "Zebrafish"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84961761119", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"], ["Drug Discovery", "PHAR", "3002"]], "AuthorData": {"34067562100": {"Name": "Fullerton J.", "AuthorID": "34067562100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Division of Medicine, University College London"}, "7006273046": {"Name": "Gilroy D.", "AuthorID": "7006273046", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Division of Medicine, University College London"}}}
