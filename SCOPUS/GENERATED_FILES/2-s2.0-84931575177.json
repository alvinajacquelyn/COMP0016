It explores the contradiction whereby the big toe, in spite of its anatomical importance in distinguishing human beings from their ancestors and their genetic cousins, that is, from other hominids and other primates, has been systematically demeaned or denigrated in representations of the body. Following an introduction, the argument unfolds in two main sections. The first of these is anthropological or palaeo-anatomical in focus, and reconstructs the determining role of the big toe in the evolution of human beings as bipedal as opposed to quadrupedal creatures. The second shifts attention to the iconography of the big toe, and uses the Italian novelist Carlo Emilio Gadda to propose a reorganisation of the history of representations of the human body in terms of this digit; it looks at several Renaissance paintings in this light. Finally, in a polemical concluding section, this article returns to Bataille's reflections on the big toe and argues again for its central importance for a materialist philosophy.", "AuthorKeywords": ["base materialism", "big toe", "bipedalism", "Carlo Emilio Gadda", "Georges Bataille"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84931575177", "SubjectAreas": [["Literature and Literary Theory", "ARTS", "1208"]], "AuthorData": {"26033058300": {"Name": "Beaumont M.", "AuthorID": "26033058300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
