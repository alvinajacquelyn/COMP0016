Solubilities were also measured at 298.15 K for 31 crystalline nonelectrolyte organic solutes including several polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and substituted benzoic acid derivatives. The experimental results of the headspace chromatographic and spectroscopic solubility measurements were converted to gas-to-diethylene glycol and water-to-diethylene glycol partition coefficients, and molar solubility ratios using standard thermodynamic relationships. Expressions were derived for solute transfer into diethylene glycol from the calculated partition coefficients and solubility ratios. Mathematical correlations based on the Abraham model describe the observed partition coefficient and solubility data to within 0.14 log10 units (or less).", "AuthorKeywords": ["Diethylene glycol solvent", "Infinite dilution activity coefficients", "Linear free energy relationships", "Partition coefficients", "Solubilities of crystalline nonelectrolyte solutes"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85009905261", "SubjectAreas": [["Biophysics", "BIOC", "1304"], ["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"]], "AuthorData": {"57200148048": {"Name": "Sedov I.", "AuthorID": "57200148048", "AffiliationID": "60070941", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Kazan Federal University"}, "56724070200": {"Name": "Magsumov T.", "AuthorID": "56724070200", "AffiliationID": "60070941", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Kazan Federal University"}, "56222214400": {"Name": "Hart E.", "AuthorID": "56222214400", "AffiliationID": "60024438", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of North Texas"}, "57188536870": {"Name": "Higgins E.", "AuthorID": "57188536870", "AffiliationID": "60024438", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of North Texas"}, "56538081100": {"Name": "Grover D.", "AuthorID": "56538081100", "AffiliationID": "60024438", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of North Texas"}, "56538213300": {"Name": "Zettl H.", "AuthorID": "56538213300", "AffiliationID": "60024438", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of North Texas"}, "56829468300": {"Name": "Zad M.", "AuthorID": "56829468300", "AffiliationID": "60024438", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of North Texas"}, "35496753700": {"Name": "Acree W.", "AuthorID": "35496753700", "AffiliationID": "60024438", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of North Texas"}, "7202901240": {"Name": "Abraham M.", "AuthorID": "7202901240", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}}}
