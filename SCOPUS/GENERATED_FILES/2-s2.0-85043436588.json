All rights reserved.Confabulation, a form of false memory, has been puzzling clinicians and academics since the 1880s. To date, limited consensus has been reached regarding the definition, classification, differential diagnosis, and cognitive mechanisms underlying this disorder. Three main explanatory frameworks have been proposed, each putting forward and testing different predictions regarding the psychopathology and clinical course of confabulation.
