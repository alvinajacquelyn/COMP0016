These seek to improve upon the versatility offered by conventional phosphor-based TLD forms such as that of doped LiF. Fabrication and irradiation-dependent factors are seen to produce defects of differing origin, influencing the luminescence of the media. In coming to a close, we illustrate the utility of Ge-doped silica media for ionizing radiation dosimetry, first showing results from gamma-irradiated Ag-decorated nanoparticles, in the particular instance pointing to an extended dynamic range of dose. For the fibres, at radiotherapy dose levels, we show high spatial resolution (0.1 mm) depth-dose results for proton irradiations. For novel microstructured fibres (photonic crystal fibres, PCFs) we show first results from a study of undisturbed and technologically modified naturally occurring radioactivity environments, measuring doses of some 10 s of \u03bcGy over a period of several months.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Defects", "Environmental radioactivity", "Optical fibres", "Proton beam", "Thermoluminescence dosimetry"], "IndexKeywords": ["Environmental radioactivity", "Extended dynamic ranges", "High spatial resolution", "Microstructured fibre", "Modified chemical vapour depositions (MCVD)", "Naturally occurring", "Thermoluminescence dosimeter", "Thermoluminescence dosimetry"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84955305850", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiation", "PHYS", "3108"]], "AuthorData": {"7403122642": {"Name": "Bradley D.A.", "AuthorID": "7403122642", "AffiliationID": "60029157", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of Malaya"}, "57055428300": {"Name": "Alanazi A.H.", "AuthorID": "57055428300", "AffiliationID": "60021097", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of Surrey"}, "56817074800": {"Name": "Jafari S.M.", "AuthorID": "56817074800", "AffiliationID": "60030999", "AffiliationName": "Radiotherapy Physics, Level B, Queen Alexandra Hospital"}, "7005065727": {"Name": "Nisbet A.N.", "AuthorID": "7005065727", "AffiliationID": "60028760", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics, Royal Surrey County Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "25723019800": {"Name": "Alkhorayef M.", "AuthorID": "25723019800", "AffiliationID": "60014510, 60013183", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiological Sciences, College of Applied Medical Sciences, King Saud University"}, "24766257100": {"Name": "Alzimami K.", "AuthorID": "24766257100", "AffiliationID": "60014510, 60013183", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiological Sciences, College of Applied Medical Sciences, King Saud University"}, "57056466500": {"Name": "Siti Rozaila Z.", "AuthorID": "57056466500", "AffiliationID": "60029157", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of Malaya"}, "56800952600": {"Name": "Sabtu S.N.", "AuthorID": "56800952600", "AffiliationID": "60029157", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of Malaya"}, "54416938100": {"Name": "Abdul Sani S.F.", "AuthorID": "54416938100", "AffiliationID": "60029157", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of Malaya"}, "56027969100": {"Name": "Siti Shafiqah A.S.", "AuthorID": "56027969100", "AffiliationID": "60016775", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, International Islamic University Malaysia"}, "24463441000": {"Name": "Amouzad Mahdiraji G.", "AuthorID": "24463441000", "AffiliationID": "60029157", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Malaya"}, "6506541848": {"Name": "Mahamd Adikan F.R.", "AuthorID": "6506541848", "AffiliationID": "60029157", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Malaya"}, "56678693500": {"Name": "Maah M.J.", "AuthorID": "56678693500", "AffiliationID": "60029157", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Malaya"}, "6602339543": {"Name": "Tamchek N.", "AuthorID": "6602339543", "AffiliationID": "60025577", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Universiti Putra Malaysia"}, "8689253200": {"Name": "Abdul Rashid H.A.", "AuthorID": "8689253200", "AffiliationID": "60012005", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Engineering, Multimedia University"}}}
