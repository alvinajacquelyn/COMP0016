This new technology, which in particular is designed to be suitable to big data, is used to construct an open consolidated database from raw data on 4 million patents taken from the US patent office from 1976 onward. To build the pattern network, not only do we look at each patent title, but we also examine their full abstract and extract the relevant keywords accordingly. We refer to this classification as semantic approach in contrast with the more common technological approach which consists in taking the topology when considering US Patent office technological classes. Moreover, we document that both approaches have highly different topological measures and strong statistical evidence that they feature a different model. This suggests that our method is a useful tool to extract endogenous information.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Data Mining", "Databases, Factual", "Humans", "Models, Statistical", "Patents as Topic"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85018166764", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"56523322200": {"Name": "Bergeaud A.", "AuthorID": "56523322200", "AffiliationID": "60108957, 60109908, 60025070", "AffiliationName": "Paris School of Economics, EHESS and Bank of France"}, "57192699726": {"Name": "Potiron Y.", "AuthorID": "57192699726", "AffiliationID": "60025997", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Business and Commerce, Keio University"}, "57193993383": {"Name": "Raimbault J.", "AuthorID": "57193993383", "AffiliationID": "60105092, 60026651", "AffiliationName": "UMR-T 9403 IFSTTAR LVMT, Ecole Nationale des Ponts et Chauss\u00e9es"}}}
