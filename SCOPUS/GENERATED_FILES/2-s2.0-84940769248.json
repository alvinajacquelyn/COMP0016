Fifteen cohorts from 12 different centres with either enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays or Luminex\u00ae measurements were selected for this study. Each centre sent nine new cerebrospinal fluid aliquots that were used to measure total tau, phosphorylated tau and amyloid-\u03b2<inf>1-42</inf> in the Gothenburg laboratory. Seven centres showed a high correlation with the new Gothenburg measurements; therefore, 10 cohorts from these centres are included in the analyses here (1233 healthy control subjects, 40-84 years old). Amyloid-\u03b2 amyloid status (negative or positive) and neurodegeneration status (negative or positive) was established based on the pathological cerebrospinal fluid Alzheimer's disease cut-off values for cerebrospinal fluid amyloid-\u03b2<inf>1-42</inf> and total tau, respectively. While gender did not affect these biomarker values, APOE genotype modified the age-associated changes in cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers such that APOE \u03b54 carriers showed stronger age-related changes in cerebrospinal fluid phosphorylated tau, total tau and amyloid-\u03b2<inf>1-42</inf> values and APOE \u03b52 carriers showed the opposite effect. At 40 years of age, 76% of the subjects were classified as amyloid negative, neurodegeneration negative and their frequency decreased to 32% at 85 years. The amyloid-positive neurodegeneration-negative group remained stable. The amyloid-negative neurodegeneration-positive group frequency increased slowly from 1% at 44 years to 16% at 85 years, but its frequency was not affected by APOE genotype. The amyloid-positive neurodegeneration-positive frequency increased from 1% at 53 years to 28% at 85 years. Abnormally low cerebrospinal fluid amyloid-\u03b2<inf>1-42</inf> levels were already frequent in midlife and APOE genotype strongly affects the levels of cerebrospinal fluid amyloid-\u03b2<inf>1-42</inf>, phosphorylated tau and total tau across the lifespan without influencing the frequency of subjects with suspected non-amyloid pathology.", "AuthorKeywords":
