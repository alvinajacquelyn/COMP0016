This wide applicability suggests that larger quantities of the chemical reagents for copper-free click chemistry will be required in the future. However, the large-scale synthesis of such chemicals has been barely investigated. A possible reason is the shortage of reliable synthetic protocols to obtain large quantities of these building blocks. We therefore present in this paper an improved synthetic protocol to obtain a cyclopropene-based carbonate, a key building block for the well-known copper-free click chemistry. Method: Our protocol builds upon an already available method to obtain a cyclopropene-based carbonate. When scaled up, several parameters of this method were changed in order to obtain an improved yield. First, the use of lower temperatures and slower addition rates of the chemicals avoided the formation of detrimental hotspots in the reaction system. Second, the use of less hygroscopic solvents minimized the decomposition of the cyclopropene carbonate. Finally, chromatographic purifications were minimized and improved by using deactivated silica. Results: We obtained the compound (2-methylcycloprop-2-en-1-yl)methyl (4-nitrophenyl) carbonate, a key building block for copper-free click chemistry, in an unprecedented 60% overall yield on a six-gram scale. Conclusions: Our improved synthetic protocol demonstrates the potential of large-scale production of improved materials using click chemistry, with potential future applications in the fields of molecular imaging, vascular surgery, ophthalmology, and theranostics.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Biomaterials", "contrast agent", "copper-free click chemistry", "methyl cyclopropenes", "synthesis", "vascular grafts"], "IndexKeywords": ["Biocompatible Materials", "Click Chemistry", "Contrast Media", "Cyclopropanes", "Tissue Engineering"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85068557195", "SubjectAreas": [["Biophysics", "BIOC", "1304"], ["Bioengineering", "CENG", "1502"], ["Biomaterials", "MATE", "2502"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"]], "AuthorData": {"57213585291": {"Name": "Meloni M.M.", "AuthorID": "57213585291", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Centre for Biomaterials, University College London"}, "57202841331": {"Name": "Kaski J.C.", "AuthorID": "57202841331", "AffiliationID": "60029329", "AffiliationName": "The Cardiology Academy Group, St George\u2019s University of London"}, "34570131700": {"Name": "He T.", "AuthorID": "34570131700", "AffiliationID": "60009009, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "Royal Brompton Hospital, Imperial College London"}, "7201744039": {"Name": "Barton S.", "AuthorID": "7201744039", "AffiliationID": "60033359", "AffiliationName": "School of Pharmacy and Chemistry, Kingston University"}, "7401655806": {"Name": "Song W.", "AuthorID": "7401655806", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Centre for Biomaterials, University College London"}}}
