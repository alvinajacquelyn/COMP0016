The Janus objects have special surfaces that have two or more asymmetric physical properties at different areas. In JOLED, they are levitated in mid-air and controllably rotated to reveal their different physical properties. We made voxels by coating the hemispheres of expanded polystyrene beads with different materials, and applied a thin patch of titanium dioxide to induce electrostatic charge on them. Transparent indium tin oxide electrodes are used around the levitation volume to create a tailored electric field to control the orientation of the voxels. We propose a novel method to control the angular position of individual voxels in a grid using electrostatic rotation and their 3D position using acoustic levitation. We present a display in which voxels can be flipped independently, and two mid-air physical games with a voxel as the playable character that moves in 3D across other physical structures and rotates to reflect its status in the games. We demonstrate a voxel update speed of 37.8 ms/flip, which is video-rate.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Acoustic levitation", "Actuated surfaces", "Electrostatic actuation", "Emerging interfaces", "Human-computer interaction", "Janus particles", "Mid-air displays", "Shape-changing displays", "Three-dimensional displays"], "IndexKeywords": ["Acoustic levitation", "Actuated surfaces", "Electrostatic actuation", "Janus particles", "Shape-changing displays", "Three-dimensional display"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84995810447", "SubjectAreas": [["Human-Computer Interaction", "COMP", "1709"], ["Software", "COMP", "1712"]], "AuthorData": {"57204438010": {"Name": "Sahoo D.R.", "AuthorID": "57204438010", "AffiliationID": "60017317", "AffiliationName": "Department of Informatics, University of Sussex"}, "57191998053": {"Name": "Asakawa M.", "AuthorID": "57191998053", "AffiliationID": "60017317", "AffiliationName": "Department of Informatics, University of Sussex"}, "35389893300": {"Name": "Subramanian S.", "AuthorID": "35389893300", "AffiliationID": "60017317", "AffiliationName": "Department of Informatics, University of Sussex"}, "56155340000": {"Name": "Nakamura T.", "AuthorID": "56155340000", "AffiliationID": "60032315", "AffiliationName": "University of Electro-Communications"}, "37006934700": {"Name": "Marzo A.", "AuthorID": "37006934700", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University of Bristol"}, "57015514400": {"Name": "Omirou T.", "AuthorID": "57015514400", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University of Bristol"}}}
