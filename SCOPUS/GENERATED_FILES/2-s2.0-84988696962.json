The atoms, initially traveling in pulsed supersonic beams, were photoexcited from the metastable 1s2sS13 level to the outermost, m=0 Rydberg-Stark state with n=55 in the presence of a strong electric field and weak perpendicular magnetic field. Following excitation, the electric field was adiabatically switched off causing the atoms to evolve into the circular state with m=+54 defined with respect to the magnetic-field quantization axis. The circular states were detected by ramped electric-field ionization along the magnetic-field axis. The dependence of the circular state production efficiency on the strength of the excitation electric field, and the electric-field switch-off time was studied, and microwave spectroscopy of the circular-to-circular |55,54,+54)\u2192|56,55,+55) transition at \u223c38.5 GHz was performed.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Crossed electric and magnetic fields", "Electric field ionization", "Magnetic-field axis", "Perpendicular magnetic fields", "Production efficiency", "Quantization axis", "Rydberg Stark state", "Strong electric fields"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84988696962", "SubjectAreas": [["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"]], "AuthorData": {"56176066600": {"Name": "Zhelyazkova V.", "AuthorID": "56176066600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "17434872000": {"Name": "Hogan S.", "AuthorID": "17434872000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}}}
