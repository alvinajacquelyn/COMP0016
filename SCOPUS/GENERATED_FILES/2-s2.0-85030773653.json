Methods This is an international (Sheffield, UK, and Singapore) collaborative, retrospective case review of 69 patients (38 from Singapore National Eye Centre and 31 from Royal Hallamshire Hospital, Sheffield) with orbital inflammatory biopsies between 2002 and 2016. Clinical information and histology were reviewed and cases were classified into three groups: Group 1: IgG4-RD orbital inflammation (n=43); Group 2: Idiopathic OID (n=12) and Group 3: Autoimmune OID (n=14). Serum IgG1, IgG2, IgG3 and IgG4 levels were collated where available and immunohistochemistry (IHC) for tissue IgG2 plasma cells was performed. Results Dual IHC showed IgG2 plasma cells as a distinct population from IgG4 plasma cells. Significant (twofold) serum IgG2 elevation was noted among IgG4-RD (group 1), idiopathic (group 2) and autoimmune OID (group 3). Similarly, significant elevation of tissue IgG2 plasma cells was also seen among IgG4-RD (group 1), idiopathic and autoimmune OID (groups 2 and 3). Conclusions Significant elevations of serum IgG2 and tissue IgG2 plasma cells are present in orbital IgG4-RD in comparison with non-IgG4 orbital inflammation (idiopathic and autoimmune OID), suggesting that IgG2 may play a role in IgG4-RD. A serum IgG2 cut-off >5.3 g/L was found to be 80% sensitive and 91.7% specific for orbital IgG4-RD, with an accuracy of 0.90. Tissue IgG2 and IgG4 subclass reporting may provide additional insight regarding the IgG4-RD' pathogenesis.", "AuthorKeywords": ["IgG2", "IgG4", "IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD)", "orbital inflammatory disorders (OID)"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Autoimmune Diseases", "Biopsy", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Humans", "Immunoglobulin G", "Immunohistochemistry", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Orbit", "Orbital Pseudotumor", "Plasma Cells", "Retrospective Studies", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85030773653", "SubjectAreas": [["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"], ["Sensory Systems", "NEUR", "2809"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"]], "AuthorData": {"36058625600": {"Name": "Chan A.S.Y.", "AuthorID": "36058625600", "AffiliationID": "60017958", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anatomical Pathology, Singapore General Hospital"}, "13613109100": {"Name": "Shen S.Y.", "AuthorID": "13613109100", "AffiliationID": "60024285, 60008970", "AffiliationName": "Singapore Eye Research Institute, Singapore National Eye Centre"}, "57188963807": {"Name": "Lang S.S.", "AuthorID": "57188963807", "AffiliationID": "60024285, 60008970", "AffiliationName": "Singapore Eye Research Institute, Singapore National Eye Centre"}, "57190465586": {"Name": "Hilmy M.H.", "AuthorID": "57190465586", "AffiliationID": "60017958", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anatomical Pathology, Singapore General Hospital"}, "26121083300": {"Name": "Al Jajeh I.", "AuthorID": "26121083300", "AffiliationID": "60017958", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anatomical Pathology, Singapore General Hospital"}, "6603505647": {"Name": "Mudhar H.", "AuthorID": "6603505647", "AffiliationID": "60006444", "AffiliationName": "Department of Histopathology, Royal Hallamshire Hospital, National Specialist Ophthalmic Pathology Service (NSOPS)"}, "7102284656": {"Name": "Fernando M.", "AuthorID": "7102284656", "AffiliationID": "60017958", "AffiliationName": "Department of Histopathology, Singapore General Hospital"}, "15925729500": {"Name": "Guppy N.J.", "AuthorID": "15925729500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Advanced Diagnostics, University College London"}, "7006936511": {"Name": "Rennie I.", "AuthorID": "7006936511", "AffiliationID": "60001881, 60006444", "AffiliationName": "Department of Oncology, University of Sheffield, Royal Hallamshire Hospital"}, "54941469500": {"Name": "Dunkley L.", "AuthorID": "54941469500", "AffiliationID": "60006444", "AffiliationName": "Department of Rheumatology, Royal Hallamshire Hospital"}}}
