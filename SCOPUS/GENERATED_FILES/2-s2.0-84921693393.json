Nevertheless, all known such examples consider games where the two parties have a common interest, since they jointly win or lose the game. The main question we ask here is whether the nonlocal feature of quantum mechanics can offer an advantage in a scenario where the two parties have conflicting interests. We answer this in the affirmative by presenting a simple conflicting interest game, where quantum strategies outperform classical ones. Moreover, we show that our game has a fair quantum equilibrium with higher payoffs for both players than in any fair classical equilibrium. Finally, we play the game using a commercial entangled photon source and demonstrate experimentally the quantum advantage.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Classical theory", "Common interests", "Entangled photons", "Non-local features", "Nonlocalities"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84921693393", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"54387248300": {"Name": "Pappa A.", "AuthorID": "54387248300", "AffiliationID": "60123660, 60123796, 60008134", "AffiliationName": "LIAFA, CNRS-Universit\u00e9 Paris 7"}, "36519030400": {"Name": "Lawson T.", "AuthorID": "36519030400", "AffiliationID": "60072950, 60008134, 60029116", "AffiliationName": "LTCI, CNRS-T\u00e9l\u00e9com ParisTech"}, "9844731900": {"Name": "Diamanti E.", "AuthorID": "9844731900", "AffiliationID": "60072950, 60008134, 60029116", "AffiliationName": "LTCI, CNRS-T\u00e9l\u00e9com ParisTech"}, "7004090337": {"Name": "Santha M.", "AuthorID": "7004090337", "AffiliationID": "60095887, 60017161", "AffiliationName": "CQT, National University of Singapore"}, "6506210561": {"Name": "Kerenidis I.", "AuthorID": "6506210561", "AffiliationID": "60095887, 60017161", "AffiliationName": "CQT, National University of Singapore"}, "56492025400": {"Name": "Kumar N.", "AuthorID": "56492025400", "AffiliationID": "60021988", "AffiliationName": "Indian Institute of Technology"}, "57196102012": {"Name": "Zhang S.", "AuthorID": "57196102012", "AffiliationID": "60002798", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science and Engineering, ITCSC, Chinese University of Hong Kong"}}}
