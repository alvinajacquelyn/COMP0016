Traditional traffic-engineering methods can hardly cope with these surges, as they are unpredictable by nature. Consequently, networks either have to be overprovisioned, which is expensive and wastes resources, or risk to periodically incur congestion, which infuriates customers. This demonstration shows how Fibbing [1] can improve network performance and preserve users' quality of experience when accessing video streams, by implementing a fine-grained load-balancing service. This service leverages two unique features of Fibbing: programming per destination load-balancing and implementing uneven splitting ratios.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Fibbing", "Link-state routing", "Traffic engineering"], "IndexKeywords": ["Fibbing", "Link-state routing", "Quality of experience (QoE)", "Splitting ratio", "Traffic Engineering", "Traffic pattern", "Unique features", "Video delivery"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84986587206", "SubjectAreas": [["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"], ["Communication", "SOCI", "3315"], ["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"], ["Signal Processing", "COMP", "1711"]], "AuthorData": {"56516959800": {"Name": "Tilmans O.", "AuthorID": "56516959800", "AffiliationID": "60000874", "AffiliationName": "Universit\u00e9 Catholique de Louvain"}, "35220581300": {"Name": "Vissicchio S.", "AuthorID": "35220581300", "AffiliationID": "60000874", "AffiliationName": "Universit\u00e9 Catholique de Louvain"}, "25927686300": {"Name": "Vanbever L.", "AuthorID": "25927686300", "AffiliationID": "60025858", "AffiliationName": "ETH Z\u00fcrich"}, "7003493334": {"Name": "Rexford J.", "AuthorID": "7003493334", "AffiliationID": "60003269", "AffiliationName": "Princeton University"}}}
