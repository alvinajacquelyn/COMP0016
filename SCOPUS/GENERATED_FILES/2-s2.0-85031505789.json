We aimed to provide comprehensive data on international patterns of AF stroke prevention treatment. Methods Demographics, comorbidities, and stroke risk of the patients in the GARFIELD-AF (n = 51,270), ORBIT-AF I (n = 10,132), and ORBIT-AF II (n = 11,602) registries were compared (overall N = 73,004 from 35 countries). Stroke prevention therapies were assessed among patients with new-onset AF (\u22646 weeks). Results Patients from GARFIELD-AF were less likely to be white (63% vs 89% for ORBIT-AF I and 86% for ORBIT-AF II) or have coronary artery disease (19% vs 36% and 27%), but had similar stroke risk (85% CHA2DS2-VASc \u22652 vs 91% and 85%) and lower bleeding risk (11% with HAS-BLED \u22653 vs 24% and 15%). Oral anticoagulant use was 46% and 57% for patients with a CHA2DS2-VASc = 0 and 69% and 87% for CHA2DS2-VASc \u22652 in GARFIELD-AF and ORBIT-AF II, respectively, but with substantial geographic heterogeneity in use of oral anticoagulant (range: 31%-93% [GARFIELD-AF] and 66%-100% [ORBIT-AF II]). Among patients with new-onset AF, non\u2013vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant use increased over time to 43% in 2016 for GARFIELD-AF and 71% for ORBIT-AF II, whereas use of antiplatelet monotherapy decreased from 36% to 17% (GARFIELD-AF) and 18% to 8% (ORBIT-AF I and II). Conclusions Among new-onset AF patients, non\u2013vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant use has increased and antiplatelet monotherapy has decreased. However, anticoagulation is used frequently in low-risk patients and inconsistently in those at high risk of stroke. Significant geographic variability in anticoagulation persists and represents an opportunity for improvement.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Administration, Oral", "Aged", "Anticoagulants", "Atrial Fibrillation", "Female", "Global Health", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Prevalence", "Prospective Studies", "Registries", "Risk Assessment", "Risk Factors", "Stroke"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85031505789", "SubjectAreas": [["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"7102870320": {"Name": "Steinberg B.A.", "AuthorID": "7102870320", "AffiliationID": "60030982", "AffiliationName": "Duke Clinical Research Institute"}, "8513824700": {"Name": "Piccini J.P.", "AuthorID": "8513824700", "AffiliationID": "60030982", "AffiliationName": "Duke Clinical Research Institute"}, "36065734400": {"Name": "Peterson E.D.", "AuthorID": "36065734400", "AffiliationID": "60030982", "AffiliationName": "Duke Clinical Research Institute"}, "24462587400": {"Name": "Shrader P.", "AuthorID": "24462587400", "AffiliationID": "60030982", "AffiliationName": "Duke Clinical Research Institute"}, "35404167300": {"Name": "Pieper K.", "AuthorID": "35404167300", "AffiliationID": "60030982", "AffiliationName": "Duke Clinical Research Institute"}, "57203591775": {"Name": "Thomas L.", "AuthorID": "57203591775", "AffiliationID": "60030982", "AffiliationName": "Duke Clinical Research Institute"}, "57196056140": {"Name": "Gao H.", "AuthorID": "57196056140", "AffiliationID": "60014574", "AffiliationName": "Thrombosis Research Institute"}, "56402821900": {"Name": "Kakkar A.", "AuthorID": "56402821900", "AffiliationID": "60014574", "AffiliationName": "Thrombosis Research Institute"}, "57204743826": {"Name": "Camm A.J.", "AuthorID": "57204743826", "AffiliationID": "60029329", "AffiliationName": "St George's University of London"}, "7005832524": {"Name": "Ezekowitz M.D.", "AuthorID": "7005832524", "AffiliationID": "60006187, 60032420", "AffiliationName": "Thomas Jefferson Medical College, Lankenau Medical Center"}, "7004451284": {"Name": "Fonarow G.C.", "AuthorID": "7004451284", "AffiliationID": "60005247", "AffiliationName": "UCLA Division of Cardiology"}, "35371853600": {"Name": "Gersh B.J.", "AuthorID": "35371853600", "AffiliationID": "60005558", "AffiliationName": "Mayo Clinic"}, "36047973400": {"Name": "Goldhaber S.", "AuthorID": "36047973400", "AffiliationID": "60016782, 60002746", "AffiliationName": "Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women's Hospital"}, "7201364240": {"Name": "Haas S.", "AuthorID": "7201364240", "AffiliationID": "60019722", "AffiliationName": "Technical University of Munich"}, "57211286149": {"Name": "Hacke W.", "AuthorID": "57211286149", "AffiliationID": "60003280", "AffiliationName": "University Hospital of Heidelberg"}, "55628584472": {"Name": "Kowey P.R.", "AuthorID": "55628584472", "AffiliationID": "60006187", "AffiliationName": "Lankenau Institute for Medical Research"}, "7103285264": {"Name": "Ansell J.", "AuthorID": "7103285264", "AffiliationID": "60107658", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Hofstra Northwell School of Medicine"}, "57203051418": {"Name": "Mahaffey K.W.", "AuthorID": "57203051418", "AffiliationID": "60032838", "AffiliationName": "Stanford University School of Medicine"}, "7004656631": {"Name": "Naccarelli G.", "AuthorID": "7004656631", "AffiliationID": "60027671", "AffiliationName": "Penn State University School of Medicine"}, "7006089753": {"Name": "Reiffel J.A.", "AuthorID": "7006089753", "AffiliationID": "60011605", "AffiliationName": "Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons"}, "16837601300": {"Name": "Turpie A.", "AuthorID": "16837601300", "AffiliationID": "60031828", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, McMaster University"}, "35379802700": {"Name": "Verheugt F.", "AuthorID": "35379802700", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Onze Lieve Vrouwe Gasthuis (OLVG), Amsterdam"}, "35377460800": {"Name": "Fox K.A.A.", "AuthorID": "35377460800", "AffiliationID": "60110825, 60027272", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cardiovascular Science, University of Edinburgh"}, "null": {"Name": null, "AuthorID": null, "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
