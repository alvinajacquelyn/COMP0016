Human artificial chromosomes can fulfil this essential requirement; moreover, they do not integrate into the host genome. However, drawbacks such as the low efficiency of chromosome transfer and their relatively complex engineering still limit their widespread use. In this article, I summarise the key steps that brought human artificial chromosomes into preclinical research for Duchenne muscular dystrophy, an X-linked, monogenic disorder. I will also review possible future pre-clinical and clinical perspectives for this technology.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cell therapy", "Gene therapy", "Human Artificial Chromosome", "Muscular dystrophy", "Stem cells"], "IndexKeywords": ["Chromosomes, Artificial, Human", "Genetic Engineering", "Genetic Therapy", "Genetic Vectors", "Humans", "Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells", "Muscular Dystrophy, Duchenne"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84925495812", "SubjectAreas": [["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"]], "AuthorData": {"7006168683": {"Name": "Tedesco F.", "AuthorID": "7006168683", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University College London"}}}
