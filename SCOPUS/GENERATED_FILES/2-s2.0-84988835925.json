Published by WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimAligned poly(l-lactide)/poly(methyl methacrylate) binary blend fibers and mats loaded with a chimeric green fluorescence protein having a bioactive peptide with hydroxyapatite binding and mineralization property are prepared by pressurized gyration. The effect of processing parameters on the product morphologies, and the shape memory properties of these samples are investigated. Integration of hydroxyapatite nanoparticles into the fiber assembly is self-directed using the hydroxyapatite-binding property of the peptide genetically engineered to green fluorescence protein. Fluorescence microscopy analysis corroborated with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) data confirms the integration of the chimeric protein with the fibers. An enzyme based remineralization assay is conducted to study the effects of peptide-mediated mineralization within the fiber mats. Raman and FTIR spectral changes observed following the peptide-mediated mineralization provides an initial step toward a soft-hard material transition. These results show that programmable shape memory properties can be obtained by incorporating genetically engineered bioactive peptide domains into polymer fibers.
