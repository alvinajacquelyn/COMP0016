However, low body mass index (BMI) as opposed to cachexia is often used, particularly when calculating the BODE (BMI, Obstruction, Dyspnea and Exercise) index. For this reason, we examined mortality using a consensus definition and a weight-loss definition of cachexia among COPD cases and compared two new COPD severity indices with BODE. Methods: In the current report, the consensus definition for cachexia incorporated weight-loss > 5% in 12-months or low BMI in addition to 3/5 of decreased muscle strength, fatigue, anorexia, low FFMI and inflammation. The weight-loss definition incorporated weight-loss > 5% or weight-loss > 2% (if low BMI) in 12-months. The low BMI component in BODE was replaced with the consensus definition to create the CODE (Consensus cachexia, Obstruction, Dyspnea and Exercise) index and the weight-loss definition to create the WODE (Weight loss, Obstruction, Dyspnea and Exercise) index. Mortality was assessed using Kaplan-Meier survival and Cox Regression. Performance of models was compared using C-statistics. Results: Among 1483 COPD cases, the prevalences of cachexia by the consensus and weight-loss definitions were 4.7 and 10.4%, respectively. Cachectic patients had a greater than three-fold increased mortality by either the consensus or the weight-loss definition of cachexia independent of BMI and lung function. The CODE index predicted mortality slightly more accurately than the BODE and WODE indices. Conclusions: Cachexia is associated with increased mortality among COPD patients. Monitoring cachexia using weight-loss criteria is relatively simple and predictive of mortality among COPD cases who may be missed if only low BMI is used.", "AuthorKeywords": ["BMI", "BODE", "Cachexia", "COPD", "Weight loss"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Body Mass Index", "Cachexia", "Consensus", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Mortality", "Prevalence", "Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive", "Weight Loss"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85066483741", "SubjectAreas": [["Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine", "MEDI", "2740"]], "AuthorData": {"23050994300": {"Name": "McDonald M.L.N.", "AuthorID": "23050994300", "AffiliationID": "60119088, 60027086", "AffiliationName": "Center for Exercise Medicine, University of Alabama at Birmingham"}, "6603516755": {"Name": "Dransfield M.", "AuthorID": "6603516755", "AffiliationID": "60027086", "AffiliationName": "Division of Pulmonary, Allergy and Critical Care Medicine, University of Alabama at Birmingham"}, "57200681301": {"Name": "Wouters E.F.M.", "AuthorID": "57200681301", "AffiliationID": "60007895", "AffiliationName": "Centre of Expertise for Chronic Organ Failure, Horn, Netherlands and Department of Respiratory Medicine, Maastricht University Medical Center"}, "8697498600": {"Name": "Rutten E.", "AuthorID": "8697498600", "AffiliationID": "60007895", "AffiliationName": "Centre of Expertise for Chronic Organ Failure, Horn, Netherlands and Department of Respiratory Medicine, Maastricht University Medical Center"}, "57207894283": {"Name": "Casaburi R.", "AuthorID": "57207894283", "AffiliationID": "60016081, 60138297", "AffiliationName": "Rehabilitation Clinical Trials Center, Los Angeles Biomedical Research Institute, Harbor Harbor-UCLA Medical Center"}, "57202945380": {"Name": "Rennard S.I.", "AuthorID": "57202945380", "AffiliationID": "60004219", "AffiliationName": "Biopharma RandD, AstraZeneca"}, "56892645500": {"Name": "Lomas D.A.", "AuthorID": "56892645500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Respiratory, University College London"}, "6701363476": {"Name": "Bamman M.", "AuthorID": "6701363476", "AffiliationID": "60119088, 60027086", "AffiliationName": "Center for Exercise Medicine and Departments of Cell, Developmental and Integrative Biology; Medicine; and Neurology, University of Alabama at Birmingham"}, "7007048536": {"Name": "Celli B.", "AuthorID": "7007048536", "AffiliationID": "60016782", "AffiliationName": "Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care, Brigham and Women's Hospital"}, "6701515147": {"Name": "Hersh C.P.", "AuthorID": "6701515147", "AffiliationID": "60016782, 60010869", "AffiliationName": "Channing Division of Network Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital"}, "57203069737": {"Name": "Silverman E.K.", "AuthorID": "57203069737", "AffiliationID": "60016782, 60010869", "AffiliationName": "Channing Division of Network Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital"}, "7101749378": {"Name": "Agusti A.", "AuthorID": "7101749378", "AffiliationID": "60001576, 60030315, 60010814", "AffiliationName": "Thorax Institute, Hospital Clinic, IDIBAPS, Univ.
