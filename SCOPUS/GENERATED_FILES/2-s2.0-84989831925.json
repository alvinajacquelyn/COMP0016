It is still unclear, however, if these stromal changes are of benefit to the host or the tumour. We hypothesise that stromal maturity is an important reflection of tumour biology, and thus can be used to predict prognosis. The aim of this study is to develop a texture analysis methodology which will automatically classify stromal regions from images of hematoxylin and eosin-stained (H and E) sections into two categories: mature and immature. Subsequently we will investigate whether stromal maturity could be used as a predictor of survival and also as a means to better understand the relationship between the radiological imaging signal and the underlying tissue microstructure. We present initial results for 118 regions-of-interest from a dataset of 39 patients diagnosed with invasive breast cancer.", "AuthorKeywords": ["breast cancer stroma", "Histopathological texture analysis", "stroma maturity", "tumour microenvironment"], "IndexKeywords": ["Breast Cancer", "Different mechanisms", "Microenvironments", "Radiological imaging", "Regions of interest", "stroma maturity", "Texture analysis", "Tissue microstructures"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84989831925", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Biomaterials", "MATE", "2502"], ["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"], ["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"56694014000": {"Name": "Reis S.", "AuthorID": "56694014000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Image Computing, University College London"}, "6602192523": {"Name": "Hipwell J.", "AuthorID": "6602192523", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Image Computing, University College London"}, "36172530200": {"Name": "Mertzanidou T.", "AuthorID": "36172530200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Image Computing, University College London"}, "35464300200": {"Name": "Hawkes D.", "AuthorID": "35464300200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Image Computing, University College London"}, "55376574900": {"Name": "Gazinska P.", "AuthorID": "55376574900", "AffiliationID": "119209378", "AffiliationName": "Breast Cancer Now Unit, Research Oncology, Division of Cancer Studies"}, "55261312700": {"Name": "Naidoo K.", "AuthorID": "55261312700", "AffiliationID": "60010337", "AffiliationName": "Breakthrough Breast Cancer Research Centre, Institute of Cancer Research"}, "7005904555": {"Name": "Pinder S.", "AuthorID": "7005904555", "AffiliationID": "119209378", "AffiliationName": "Breast Research Pathology, Research Oncology, Division of Cancer Studies"}}}
