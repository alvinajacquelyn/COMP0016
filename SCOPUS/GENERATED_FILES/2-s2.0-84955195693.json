The other case instead represents duplicated left pulmonary artery with pulmonary sling caused by the retro-tracheal course of the lower left pulmonary artery associated with Christmas Tree arrangement of the tracheo-bronchial system. In both patients with pseudo-pulmonary sling and Kabuki syndrome, the abnormal finding was incidental during echocardiographic examination and neither of the patients required surgical repair for the condition. To the best of our knowledge, they represent the third and fourth cases in which such an anomaly of the pulmonary artery branches not forming a sling is seen in association with Kabuki syndrome. Another case represents our second experience and the second case reported in literature with duplicated left pulmonary artery in the setting of a complex tracheal anatomy. In this symptomatic patient, surgical repair of atrial septal defect and relief of the vascular ring were indicated, and the surgical repair was performed successfully at the age of 3 years.", "AuthorKeywords": ["accessory left pulmonary artery", "anomalous left pulmonary artery", "Kabuki syndrome", "pulmonary artery sling"], "IndexKeywords": ["Abnormalities, Multiple", "Angiography", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Diagnosis, Differential", "Echocardiography", "Face", "Hematologic Diseases", "Humans", "Male", "Pulmonary Artery", "Vascular Malformations", "Vestibular Diseases"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84955195693", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"57214272408": {"Name": "Giudici V.", "AuthorID": "57214272408", "AffiliationID": "60002200, 60030318", "AffiliationName": "Paediatric Department Hospital Luigi Sacco, University of Milan"}, "6507427755": {"Name": "Kanani M.", "AuthorID": "6507427755", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children"}, "15062970000": {"Name": "Muthialu N.", "AuthorID": "15062970000", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children"}, "57197672071": {"Name": "Carr M.", "AuthorID": "57197672071", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children"}, "23481036600": {"Name": "Calder A.D.", "AuthorID": "23481036600", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children"}, "7102511623": {"Name": "Owens C.M.", "AuthorID": "7102511623", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children"}, "17635293700": {"Name": "Marek J.", "AuthorID": "17635293700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences, University College London"}, "37078948800": {"Name": "Cook A.C.", "AuthorID": "37078948800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences, University College London"}}}
