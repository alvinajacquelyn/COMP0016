Nineteen disease-causing genes (BBS1-19) have been identified, of which mutations in BBS1 are most common in North America and Europe. A hallmark of the disease, renal malformation is heterogeneous and is a cause of morbidity and mortality through the development of CKD. We studied the prevalence and severity of CKD in 350 patients with Bardet-Biedl syndrome-related renal disease attending the United Kingdom national Bardet-Biedl syndrome clinics to further elucidate the phenotype and identify risk indicators of CKD. Overall, 31% of children and 42%of adults had CKD; 6%of children and 8%of adults had stage 4-5 CKD. In children, renal disease was often detected within the first year of life. Analysis of the most commonly mutated disease-Associated genes revealed that, compared with two truncating mutations, two missense mutations associated with less severe CKDin adults.Moreover, comparedwithmutations in BBS10,mutations inBBS1 associated with less severeCKD or lack ofCKDin adults. Finally,51%of patientswith available ultrasounds had structural renal abnormalities, and 35% of adults were hypertensive. The presence of structural abnormalities or antihypertensive medication also correlated statistically with stage 3b-5 CKD. This study describes the largest reported cohort of patients with renal disease in Bardet-Biedl syndrome and identifies risk factors to be considered in genetic counseling.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Bardet-Biedl Syndrome", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Female", "Humans", "Infant", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Mutation", "Prevalence", "Renal Insufficiency, Chronic", "Retrospective Studies", "Risk Factors", "Severity of Illness Index", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85021850481", "SubjectAreas": [["Nephrology", "MEDI", "2727"]], "AuthorData": {"55250336400": {"Name": "Forsythe E.", "AuthorID": "55250336400", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Genetics, National Bardet-Biedl Syndrome Service, Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "57194738284": {"Name": "Best S.", "AuthorID": "57194738284", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Genetics and Genomic Medicine Program, University College London Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "7004556611": {"Name": "Beales P.L.", "AuthorID": "7004556611", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Genetics, National Bardet-Biedl Syndrome Service, Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "56092081300": {"Name": "Sparks K.", "AuthorID": "56092081300", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Genetics, National Bardet-Biedl Syndrome Service, Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "17342162500": {"Name": "Borrows S.", "AuthorID": "17342162500", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Genetics, National Bardet-Biedl Syndrome Service, Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "6507441020": {"Name": "Foggensteiner L.", "AuthorID": "6507441020", "AffiliationID": "60027403, 60018207", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital, University College Hospital Center for Nephrology"}, "7101630968": {"Name": "Hoskins B.", "AuthorID": "7101630968", "AffiliationID": "60020400", "AffiliationName": "Nephrology Unit, Queen Elizabeth II Hospital"}, "57210900752": {"Name": "Sabir A.", "AuthorID": "57210900752", "AffiliationID": "100650207", "AffiliationName": "Nephrology Unit"}, "7102057832": {"Name": "Goldsmith D.", "AuthorID": "7102057832", "AffiliationID": "100650207", "AffiliationName": "Nephrology Unit"}, "7007173212": {"Name": "Milford D.V.", "AuthorID": "7007173212", "AffiliationID": "100650207", "AffiliationName": "Nephrology Unit"}, "37036794700": {"Name": "Barrett T.", "AuthorID": "37036794700", "AffiliationID": "60022357", "AffiliationName": "Department of Endocrinology, Birmingham Children's Hospital"}, "57213469054": {"Name": "Williams D.", "AuthorID": "57213469054", "AffiliationID": "60015857", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Genetics Unit, Birmingham Women's Hospital"}, "57198220331": {"Name": "Mohammed S.", "AuthorID": "57198220331", "AffiliationID": "100400129", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Genetics Unit"}, "6602980434": {"Name": "Bockenhauer D.", "AuthorID": "6602980434", "AffiliationID": "60009797", "AffiliationName": "Nephrology Unit, Guy's Hospital"}}}
