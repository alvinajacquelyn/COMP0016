Setting Primary care setting in the UK. The analysis was from the National Health Service perspective. Participants 1000 individuals with SMI from The Health Improvement Network Database, aged 30-74 years and without existing CVD, populated the model. Interventions Four cardiovascular risk algorithms were assessed: (1) general population lipid, (2) general population body mass index (BMI), (3) SMI-specific lipid and (4) SMI-specific BMI, compared against no algorithm. At baseline, each cardiovascular risk algorithm was applied and those considered high risk (> 10%) were assumed to be prescribed statin therapy while others received usual care. Primary and secondary outcome measures Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and costs were accrued for each algorithm including no algorithm, and cost-effectiveness was calculated using the net monetary benefit (NMB) approach. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to test assumptions made and uncertainty around parameter estimates. Results The SMI-specific BMI algorithm had the highest NMB resulting in 15 additional QALYs and a cost saving of approximately \u00a353 000 per 1000 patients with SMI over 10 years, followed by the general population lipid algorithm (13 additional QALYs and a cost saving of \u00a346 000). Conclusions The general population lipid and SMI-specific BMI algorithms performed equally well. The ease and acceptability of use of an SMI-specific BMI algorithm (blood tests not required) makes it an attractive algorithm to implement in clinical settings.", "AuthorKeywords": ["coronary heart disease", "health economics", "mental health"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Algorithms", "Body Mass Index", "Cardiovascular Diseases", "Cost-Benefit Analysis", "Databases, Factual", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Mental Disorders", "Middle Aged", "Models, Economic", "Primary Health Care", "Quality-Adjusted Life Years", "Risk Assessment", "Risk Factors", "Sampling Studies", "State Medicine", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85029023010", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"23101858900": {"Name": "Zomer E.", "AuthorID": "23101858900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Primary Care and Population Health, Faculty of Population Health Sciences, University College London"}, "55334594200": {"Name": "Nazareth I.", "AuthorID": "55334594200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Primary Care and Population Health, Faculty of Population Health Sciences, University College London"}, "14029946400": {"Name": "Hardoon S.", "AuthorID": "14029946400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Primary Care and Population Health, Faculty of Population Health Sciences, University College London"}, "6603627308": {"Name": "Marston L.", "AuthorID": "6603627308", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Primary Care and Population Health, Faculty of Population Health Sciences, University College London"}, "23009891600": {"Name": "Petersen I.", "AuthorID": "23009891600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Primary Care and Population Health, Faculty of Population Health Sciences, University College London"}, "57203175207": {"Name": "Walters K.", "AuthorID": "57203175207", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Primary Care and Population Health, Faculty of Population Health Sciences, University College London"}, "55541432300": {"Name": "Hunter R.M.", "AuthorID": "55541432300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Primary Care and Population Health, Faculty of Population Health Sciences, University College London"}, "7101639320": {"Name": "Osborn D.", "AuthorID": "7101639320", "AffiliationID": "60161451", "AffiliationName": "Camden and Islington National Health Service Foundation Trust"}, "35067740700": {"Name": "Blackburn R.", "AuthorID": "35067740700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, Faculty of Brain Sciences, University College London"}, "34879409900": {"Name": "Burton A.", "AuthorID": "34879409900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, Faculty of Brain Sciences, University College London"}, "56591241100": {"Name": "King M.", "AuthorID": "56591241100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, Faculty of Brain Sciences, University College London"}, "8736780500": {"Name": "Holt R.I.G.", "AuthorID": "8736780500", "AffiliationID": "60025287", "AffiliationName": "Human Development and Health Academic Unit, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton"}, "56449994300": {"Name": "Morris S.", "AuthorID": "56449994300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Applied Health Research, Faculty of Population Health Sciences, University College London"}, "7005718930": {"Name": "Omar R.", "AuthorID": "7005718930", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Statistical Science, Faculty of Mathematical and Physical Sciences, University College London"}}}
