Re-use permitted under CC BY. Published by BMJ.Objective Human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA has been detected in vaginal samples from adolescent girls who report no previous sex and, in high-income settings, from fingertips, raising the possibility of non-sexual transmission. No such studies originate from East Africa which bears among the highest cervical cancer incidence and HPV prevalence worldwide. HPV-related oral cancer incidence is increasing, but oral HPV prevalence data from East Africa are limited. We aimed to describe the HPV DNA prevalence in genital and non-genital sites and in the bathroom of unvaccinated adolescent girls, and examine genotype concordance between sites. Methods We nested a cross-sectional study of HPV in genital and extragenital sites within a cohort study of vaginal HPV acquisition. Unvaccinated girls age 16-18 years in Tanzania, who reported ever having had sex, were consented, enrolled and tested for the presence of HPV DNA in vaginal samples collected using self-administered swabs, oral samples collected using an oral rinse, and on fingertips and bathroom surfaces collected using a cytobrush. Results Overall, 65 girls were enrolled and 23 (35%, 95% CI 23% to 47%) had detectable vaginal HPV. Adequate (\u03b2-globin positive) samples were collected from 36 girls' fingertips and HPV was detected in 7 (19%, 95% CI 6% to 33%). 63 girls provided adequate oral samples, 4 (6%, 95% CI 0% to 13%) of which had HPV DNA detected. In bathroom samples from 58 girls, 4 (7%, 95% CI 0% to 14%) had detectable HPV DNA. Of the 11 girls with extragenital HPV, six had the same genotype in >1 site. Conclusion We found a high prevalence of HPV in non-genital sites in adolescent girls and in their bathrooms, in this region with a high cervical cancer incidence. Concordance of genotypes between sites supports the possibility of autoinoculation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["adolescent", "Africa", "epidemiology (general)", "hpv"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "DNA, Viral", "Female", "Fingers", "Humans", "Mouth", "Papillomaviridae", "Papillomavirus Infections", "Prevalence", "Tanzania", "Toilet Facilities", "Vagina"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85060061870", "SubjectAreas": [["Dermatology", "MEDI", "2708"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"35324299700": {"Name": "Houlihan C.F.", "AuthorID": "35324299700", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Research, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "57202658170": {"Name": "Watson-Jones D.", "AuthorID": "57202658170", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Research, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "6602372286": {"Name": "Baisley K.", "AuthorID": "6602372286", "AffiliationID": "60031331, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Tropical Epidemiology Group, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "57199458877": {"Name": "Ross D.A.", "AuthorID": "57199458877", "AffiliationID": "60031331, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Tropical Epidemiology Group, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "7402082478": {"Name": "Hayes R.J.", "AuthorID": "7402082478", "AffiliationID": "60031331, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Tropical Epidemiology Group, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "7006628878": {"Name": "Bravo I.G.", "AuthorID": "7006628878", "AffiliationID": "60008134, 60025735, 60108493", "AffiliationName": "French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS), Laboratory MIVEGEC (CNRS IRD Uni Montp)"}, "36762022600": {"Name": "Pav\u00f3n M.A.", "AuthorID": "36762022600", "AffiliationID": "60011805", "AffiliationName": "CIBER-ONC, Hospitalet de Llobregat"}, "6701736397": {"Name": "Changalucha J.", "AuthorID": "6701736397", "AffiliationID": "60071565", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Medical Research"}, "7003980583": {"Name": "Kapiga S.", "AuthorID": "7003980583", "AffiliationID": "109512885", "AffiliationName": "Mwanza Interventional Trials Unit"}, "54790529200": {"Name": "De Sanjos\u00e9 S.", "AuthorID": "54790529200", "AffiliationID": "60028934", "AffiliationName": "Sexual and Reproductive Health, PATH"}}}
