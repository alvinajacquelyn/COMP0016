Yet, there is a paucity of research on how to bring together the various disciplines involved in a multidomain synergistic collaboration to create new living environments for aging. This paper aims to explore the key domains of skills and knowledge that need to be considered for a conceptual prototype of an enabling educational process and environments where healthcare professionals, architects, planners, and entrepreneurs may establish a shared theoretical and experiential knowledge base, vocabulary, and implementation strategies, for the creation of the next generation of living communities of active healthy adults, for persons with disabilities and chronic disease conditions. We focus on synergistic, paradigmatic, simple, and practical issues that can be easily upscaled through market mechanisms. This practical and physically concrete approach may also become linked with more elaborate neuroscientific and technologically sophisticated interventions. We examine the domains of knowledge to be included in establishing a learning model that focuses on the still-understudied impact of the benefits toward active and healthy aging, where architects, urban planners, clinicians, and healthcare facility managers are educated toward a synergistic approach at the operational level.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84987715165", "SubjectAreas": [["Geriatrics and Gerontology", "MEDI", "2717"]], "AuthorData": {"57202862542": {"Name": "Chrysikou E.", "AuthorID": "57202862542", "AffiliationID": "60085003", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of the Built Environment, UCL Bartlett School of Architecture"}, "57213032690": {"Name": "Rabnett R.", "AuthorID": "57213032690", "AffiliationID": "119204646", "AffiliationName": "AM-GAR"}, "6505983693": {"Name": "Tziraki C.", "AuthorID": "6505983693", "AffiliationID": "60007903", "AffiliationName": "MELABEV-Community Elders Club, Research and Evaluation Department, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Israel Gerontological Data Center"}}}
