In the case of sputtered amorphous oxides, the presence of columnar structure enables efficient resistance switching by providing an initial structured distribution of defects that can act as precursors for the formation of chains of conductive oxygen vacancies under the application of appropriate electrical bias. Increasing electrode interface roughness decreases electroforming voltages and reduces the distribution of switching voltages. Any contribution to these effects from field enhancement at rough interfaces is secondary to changes in oxide microstructure templated by interface structure.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Amorphous oxides", "Columnar structures", "Electrode interface", "Field enhancement", "Interface structures", "Resistance switching", "Rough interfaces", "Switching voltages"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85061837684", "SubjectAreas": [["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"]], "AuthorData": {"7005715736": {"Name": "Kenyon A.J.", "AuthorID": "7005715736", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, UCL"}, "56386662300": {"Name": "Ng W.H.", "AuthorID": "56386662300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, UCL"}, "56500553700": {"Name": "Buckwell M.", "AuthorID": "56500553700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, UCL"}, "57206660028": {"Name": "Joksas D.", "AuthorID": "57206660028", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, UCL"}, "55236732600": {"Name": "Mehonic A.", "AuthorID": "55236732600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, UCL"}, "57206656821": {"Name": "Singh Munde M.", "AuthorID": "57206656821", "AffiliationID": "60012556", "AffiliationName": "Materials Science Center and Faculty of Physics (WZMW), Philipps University Marburg"}}}
