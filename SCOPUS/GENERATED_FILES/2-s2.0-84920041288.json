Yet it is unclear whether training during adulthood, at a post-developmental stage of the adult visual system, can overcome such developmental impairments. Here, we visually trained LG, a developmental object and face agnosic individual. Prior to training, at the age of 20, LG's basic and mid-level visual functions such as visual acuity, crowding effects, and contour integration were underdeveloped relative to normal adult vision, corresponding to or poorer than those of 5-6 year olds (Gilaie-Dotan, Perry, Bonneh, Malach & Bentin, 2009). Intensive visual training, based on lateral interactions, was applied for a period of 9 months. LG's directly trained but also untrained visual functions such as visual acuity, crowding, binocular stereopsis and also mid-level contour integration improved significantly and reached near-age-level performance, with long-term (over 4 years) persistence. Moreover, mid-level functions that were tested post-training were found to be normal in LG. Some possible subtle improvement was observed in LG's higher-order visual functions such as object recognition and part integration, while LG's face perception skills have not improved thus far. These results suggest that corrective training at a post-developmental stage, even in the adult visual system, can prove effective, and its enduring effects are the basis for a revival of a developmental cascade that can lead to reduced perceptual impairments.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Agnosia", "Face", "Follow-Up Studies", "Functional Laterality", "Humans", "Male", "Photic Stimulation", "Psychomotor Performance", "Recognition (Psychology)", "Recovery of Function", "Teaching", "Visual Acuity", "Visual Perception", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84920041288", "SubjectAreas": [["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"]], "AuthorData": {"54796686900": {"Name": "Lev M.", "AuthorID": "54796686900", "AffiliationID": "60005681", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Medicine, Goldschleger Eye Research Institute, Tel Aviv University"}, "56090913800": {"Name": "Gotthilf-Nezri D.", "AuthorID": "56090913800", "AffiliationID": "60005681", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Medicine, Goldschleger Eye Research Institute, Tel Aviv University"}, "8609105400": {"Name": "Yehezkel O.", "AuthorID": "8609105400", "AffiliationID": "60005681", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Medicine, Goldschleger Eye Research Institute, Tel Aviv University"}, "57207515694": {"Name": "Polat U.", "AuthorID": "57207515694", "AffiliationID": "60005681", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Medicine, Goldschleger Eye Research Institute, Tel Aviv University"}, "6505604248": {"Name": "Gilaie-Dotan S.", "AuthorID": "6505604248", "AffiliationID": "60109771, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, University College London"}, "7402788683": {"Name": "Brooks J.L.", "AuthorID": "7402788683", "AffiliationID": "60010818", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, University of Kent"}, "26647787400": {"Name": "Perry A.", "AuthorID": "26647787400", "AffiliationID": "60025038", "AffiliationName": "Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute"}, "7004360550": {"Name": "Bentin S.", "AuthorID": "7004360550", "AffiliationID": "60007903", "AffiliationName": "Center for Neural Computation, Hebrew University of Jerusalem"}, "6603614594": {"Name": "Bonneh Y.", "AuthorID": "6603614594", "AffiliationID": "60002999", "AffiliationName": "Department of Human Biology, University of Haifa"}}}
