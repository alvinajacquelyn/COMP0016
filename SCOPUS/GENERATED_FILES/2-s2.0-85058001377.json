To test the hypothesis that negative interpretation bias contributes to worry and rumination, we assessed the effects of inducing more positive interpretations in reducing RNT. Method: Volunteers diagnosed with GAD (66) or depression (65) were randomly allocated to one of two versions of cognitive bias modification for interpretation (CBM-I), either with or without RNT priming prior to training, or a control condition, each involving 10 Internet-delivered sessions. Outcome measures of interpretation bias, a behavioral RNT task and self-reported worry, rumination, anxiety and depression were obtained at baseline, after home-based training and at 1-month follow-up (self-report questionnaires only). Results: CBM-I training, across diagnostic groups, promoted a more positive interpretation bias and led to reductions in worry, rumination, and depressive symptoms, which were maintained at follow-up. Anxiety symptoms were reduced only in the GAD group at follow-up. There were no differences between CBM-I versions; brief priming of RNT did not influence CBM-I effectiveness. Level of interpretation bias post training partially mediated the effects of CBM-I on follow-up questionnaire scores. Conclusions: In contrast to some recent failures to demonstrate improvements following Internet-delivered CBM, we found that selfreported RNT and negative mood were reduced by CBM-I. This is consistent with a causal role for negative interpretation bias in both worry and rumination, suggesting a useful role for CBM-I within treatments for anxiety and depression.", "AuthorKeywords": ["cognitive bias modification (CBM)", "depression", "Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)", "interpretation bias", "repetitive negative thinking"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Anxiety Disorders", "Cognitive Behavioral Therapy", "Cues", "Depressive Disorder", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Humans", "Internet", "Male", "Pessimism", "Rumination, Cognitive", "Self Report", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85058001377", "SubjectAreas": [["Clinical Psychology", "PSYC", "3203"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"7101825299": {"Name": "Hirsch C.", "AuthorID": "7101825299", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "King's College London, Department of Psychology, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience"}, "56116805300": {"Name": "Krah\u00e9 C.", "AuthorID": "56116805300", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "King's College London, Department of Psychology, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience"}, "57192557634": {"Name": "Whyte J.", "AuthorID": "57192557634", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "King's College London, Department of Psychology, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience"}, "57204929630": {"Name": "Loizou S.", "AuthorID": "57204929630", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "King's College London, Department of Psychology, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience"}, "57204931126": {"Name": "Bridge L.", "AuthorID": "57204931126", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "King's College London, Department of Psychology, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience"}, "15837698200": {"Name": "Norton S.", "AuthorID": "15837698200", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "King's College London, Department of Psychology, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience"}, "57203614872": {"Name": "Mathews A.", "AuthorID": "57203614872", "AffiliationID": "60014439", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, University of California"}}}
