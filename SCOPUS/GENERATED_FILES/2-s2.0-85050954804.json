KGaA, WeinheimThe use of 2,3,4,5,6-pentafluorobenzyl methacrylate (PFBMA) as a core-forming monomer in ethanolic reversible addition\u2013fragmentation chain transfer dispersion polymerization formulations is presented. Poly[poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate] (pPEGMA) macromolecular chain transfer agents were chain-extended with PFBMA leading to nanoparticle formation via polymerization-induced self-assembly (PISA). pPEGMA-pPFBMA particles exhibited the full range of morphologies (spheres, worms, and vesicles), including pure and mixed phases. Worm phases formed gels that underwent a thermo-reversible degelation and morphological transition to spheres (or spheres and vesicles) upon heating. Postsynthesis, the pPFBMA cores were modified through thiol\u2013para-fluoro substitution reactions in ethanol using 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene as the base. For monothiols, conversions were 64% (1-octanethiol) and 94% (benzyl mercaptan). Spherical and worm-shaped nano-objects were core cross-linked using 1,8-octanedithiol, which prevented their dissociation in nonselective solvents. For a temperature-responsive worm sample, cross-linking additionally resulted in the loss of the temperature-triggered morphological transition. The use of the reactive monomer PFBMA in PISA formulations presents a simple method to prepare well-defined nano-objects similar to those produced with nonreactive monomers (e.g., benzyl methacrylate) and to retain morphologies independent of solvent and temperature.", "AuthorKeywords": ["nanoparticle cross-linking", "PISA", "postpolymerization modification", "temperature-responsiveness", "thiol\u2013para-fluoro reaction"], "IndexKeywords": ["1 ,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene", "Dispersion polymerization", "Nanoparticle cross-linking", "PISA", "Poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate (PEG-MMA)", "Postpolymerization modifications", "Reversible addition fragmentation chain transfer", "Thiol-para-fluoro reaction", "Benzyl Alcohols", "Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic", "Chemistry Techniques, Synthetic", "Methacrylates", "Microscopy, Electron, Scanning Transmission", "Models, Chemical", "Molecular Structure", "Nanoparticles", "Polymerization", "Polymers", "Sulfhydryl Compounds", "Temperature", "Transition Temperature"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85050954804", "SubjectAreas": [["Organic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1605"], ["Polymers and Plastics", "MATE", "2507"], ["Materials Chemistry", "MATE", "2505"]], "AuthorData": {"57195906050": {"Name": "Busatto N.", "AuthorID": "57195906050", "AffiliationID": "60021097", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Surrey"}, "7201446163": {"Name": "Roth P.", "AuthorID": "7201446163", "AffiliationID": "60021097", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Surrey"}, "6602589117": {"Name": "Stolojan V.", "AuthorID": "6602589117", "AffiliationID": "60021097", "AffiliationName": "Advanced Technology Institute, University of Surrey"}, "7006175934": {"Name": "Keddie J.", "AuthorID": "7006175934", "AffiliationID": "60021097", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of Surrey"}, "57169472300": {"Name": "Shaw M.", "AuthorID": "57169472300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}}}
