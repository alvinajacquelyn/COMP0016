In this study, we investigated how cognitive factors such as beliefs influence subjective craving and neural activities in nicotine-addicted individuals using model-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and neuropharmacology. Deprived smokers (N = 24) participated in a two-by-two balanced placebo design, which crossed beliefs about nicotine (told \"nicotine\" vs. told \"no nicotine\") with the nicotine content in a cigarette (nicotine vs. placebo) which participants smoked immediately before performing a fMRI task involving reward learning. Subjects' reported craving was measured both before smoking and after the fMRI session. We found that first, in the presence of nicotine, smokers demonstrated significantly reduced craving after smoking when told \"nicotine in cigarette\" but showed no change in craving when told \"no nicotine.\" Second, neural activity in the insular cortex related to craving was only significant when smokers were told \"nicotine\" but not when told \"no nicotine.\" Both effects were absent in the placebo condition. Third, insula activation related to computational learning signals was modulated by belief about nicotine regardless of nicotine's presence. These results suggest that belief about nicotine has a strong impact on subjective craving and insula responses related to both craving and learning in deprived smokers, providing insights into the complex nature of belief-drug interactions.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Belief", "Craving", "fMRI", "Insula", "Interoception", "Nicotine addiction"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84981506659", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"16232881500": {"Name": "Gu X.", "AuthorID": "16232881500", "AffiliationID": "60009415", "AffiliationName": "School of Behavioral and Brain Sciences, The University of Texas at Dallas"}, "7004572764": {"Name": "Montague P.R.", "AuthorID": "7004572764", "AffiliationID": "60027090", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Virginia Polytechnic Institute, State University"}, "6506984553": {"Name": "Lohrenz T.", "AuthorID": "6506984553", "AffiliationID": "60138707", "AffiliationName": "Human Neuroimaging Laboratory, Virginia Tech Carilion Research Institute"}, "7005039618": {"Name": "Salas R.", "AuthorID": "7005039618", "AffiliationID": "60002441", "AffiliationName": "Menninger Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Baylor College of Medicine"}, "7006212812": {"Name": "Baldwin P.R.", "AuthorID": "7006212812", "AffiliationID": "60002441", "AffiliationName": "Menninger Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Baylor College of Medicine"}, "12801819500": {"Name": "Soltani A.", "AuthorID": "12801819500", "AffiliationID": "60010756", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences, Dartmouth College"}, "24765108300": {"Name": "Kirk U.", "AuthorID": "24765108300", "AffiliationID": "60019160", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Psychology, University of Southern Denmark"}, "7003557687": {"Name": "Cinciripini P.M.", "AuthorID": "7003557687", "AffiliationID": "60015023", "AffiliationName": "Department of Behavioral Science, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center"}}}
