The American Astronomical Society. All rights reserved.The interaction between Alfv\u00e9n-wave turbulence and the background solar wind affects the cross helicity (\u222b d3x v B) in two ways. Non-WKB reflection converts outward-propagating Alfv\u00e9n waves into inwardpropagating Alfv\u00e9n waves and vice versa, and the turbulence transfers momentum to the background flow. When both effects are accounted for, the total cross helicity is conserved. In the special case that the background density and flow speed are independent of time, the equations of cross-helicity conservation and total-energy conservation can be combined to recover a well-known equation derived by Heinemann and Olbert that has been interpreted as a non-WKB generalization of wave-action conservation. This latter equation (in contrast to cross-helicity and energy conservation) does not hold when the background varies in time.", "AuthorKeywords": ["magnetohydrodynamics (MHD)", "solar wind", "Sun: corona", "turbulence", "waves"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84945564004", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"7005700637": {"Name": "Chandran B.", "AuthorID": "7005700637", "AffiliationID": "60027576", "AffiliationName": "Space Science Center and Department of Physics, University of New Hampshire"}, "8680679500": {"Name": "Perez J.", "AuthorID": "8680679500", "AffiliationID": "60027576", "AffiliationName": "Space Science Center and Department of Physics, University of New Hampshire"}, "24503852100": {"Name": "Verscharen D.", "AuthorID": "24503852100", "AffiliationID": "60027576", "AffiliationName": "Space Science Center and Department of Physics, University of New Hampshire"}, "56108555200": {"Name": "Klein K.", "AuthorID": "56108555200", "AffiliationID": "60027576", "AffiliationName": "Space Science Center and Department of Physics, University of New Hampshire"}, "47761874800": {"Name": "Mallet A.", "AuthorID": "47761874800", "AffiliationID": "60027576", "AffiliationName": "Space Science Center and Department of Physics, University of New Hampshire"}}}
