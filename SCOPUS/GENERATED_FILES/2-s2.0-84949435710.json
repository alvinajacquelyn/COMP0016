This extends the conceptual model of resilience as applied to retail, and is operationalised through a novel methodology that develops two indices that balance both supply and demand influences. We describe the creation of a composite e-resilience indicator, and then calculate it for retail centres across England. Our findings suggest a geographic polarising effect, with least vulnerable centres identified as large and more attractive or as smaller local destinations with a focus on convenience shopping. Mid-sized centres were typically shown to be the most exposed, and are argued as having a less clearly defined function in contemporary retail. Such findings have wide policy relevance to stakeholders of retail interested in the future configuration of sustainable and resilient provision.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84949435710", "SubjectAreas": [["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"]], "AuthorData": {"25723810200": {"Name": "Singleton A.", "AuthorID": "25723810200", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography and Planning, University of Liverpool"}, "53979500700": {"Name": "Dolega L.", "AuthorID": "53979500700", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography and Planning, University of Liverpool"}, "55217675100": {"Name": "Riddlesden D.", "AuthorID": "55217675100", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography and Planning, University of Liverpool"}, "7003966507": {"Name": "Longley P.", "AuthorID": "7003966507", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography, University College London"}}}
