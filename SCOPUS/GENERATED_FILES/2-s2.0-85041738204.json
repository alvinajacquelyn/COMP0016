However, it is unclear whether RSC representations of permanence are a purely spatial phenomenon or whether they extend into behavioral and conceptual domains. To test this, during functional MRI scanning, we had people (males and females) read three different types of sentences that described either something permanent or transient. The first two sentence types were imageable, with a focus either on a spatial landmark or on an action. The third type of sentence involved non-imageable abstract concepts. We found that, in addition to being more active for sentences describing landmarks with a permanent location in space, RSC was also significantly engaged by sentences describing stable and consistent behaviors or actions, as long as they were rooted within a concrete imageable setting. RSC was not responsive to abstract concepts, even those that embodied the notion of stability. Similarly, it was not engaged by imageable sentences with transient contents. In contrast, parahippocampal cortex was more engaged by imageable sentences describing landmarks, whereas the hippocampus was active for all imageable sentences. In addition, for imageable sentences describing permanence, there was bidirectional functional coupling between RSC and these medial temporal lobe structures. It appears, therefore, that RSC-mediated permanence representations could be helpful for more than spatially mapping environments and may also provide information about the reliability of events occurring within them.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Actions", "Concepts", "Fmri", "Landmarks", "Retrosplenial", "Scenes"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Brain Mapping", "Cerebral Cortex", "Cognition", "Female", "Humans", "Imagination", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Parahippocampal Gyrus", "Space Perception", "Spatial Processing", "Temporal Lobe", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85041738204", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"]], "AuthorData": {"55338681800": {"Name": "Auger S.", "AuthorID": "55338681800", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60084279, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "7005945840": {"Name": "Maguire E.", "AuthorID": "7005945840", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60084279, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}}}
