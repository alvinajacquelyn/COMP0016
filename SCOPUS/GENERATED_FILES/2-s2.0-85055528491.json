Pediatric Transplantation published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc Phase 2, parallel-group, multicenter, open-label, 4-week study, comparing PK of PR-T vs IR-T in de novo pediatric patients undergoing primary kidney, liver, or heart transplantation. Patients randomized 1:1 to receive once daily, PR-T-, or twice-daily, IR-T-based regimens; dose adjustments permitted after Day 1. Twenty-four-hour PK profiles collected on Days 1, 7, and 28. Primary endpoint: tacrolimus AUC 24 . Secondary end points included tacrolimus C 24 and C max . Endpoints compared between PR-T and IR-T on Days 1, 7, and 28. Predefined similarity interval for CIs of LSM ratios: 80%-125%. PK analysis set comprised 33 patients (PR-T, n = 15; IR-T, n = 18). Overall, AUC 24 and C max were lower on Day 1 vs 7 and 28. Geometric LSM ratios of PR-T:IR-T on Days 1, 7, and 28 were 66.3%, 92.5%, 99.9%, respectively, for AUC 24 ; 66.3%, 82.2%, 90.9% for C 24 ; and 77.3%, 120.3%, 92.2% for C max . AUC 24 90% CI within predefined similarity interval on Day 28; other 90% CIs fell outside. Linear relationship was similar between AUC 24 and C 24 , and between tacrolimus formulations, suggesting that the same therapeutic drug monitoring method can be used with both formulations in de novo pediatric allograft recipients.", "AuthorKeywords": ["heart transplantation", "kidney transplantation", "liver transplantation", "pediatrics", "pharmacokinetics", "tacrolimus"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Allografts", "Area Under Curve", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Delayed-Action Preparations", "Female", "Heart Transplantation", "Humans", "Infant", "Kidney Transplantation", "Linear Models", "Liver Transplantation", "Male", "Pediatrics", "Tacrolimus"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85055528491", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Transplantation", "MEDI", "2747"]], "AuthorData": {"6603032157": {"Name": "Vondrak K.", "AuthorID": "6603032157", "AffiliationID": "60023469, 60016605", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatrics, University Hospital Motol, Second School of Medicine, Charles University"}, "24545802400": {"Name": "Dhawan A.", "AuthorID": "24545802400", "AffiliationID": "60021923", "AffiliationName": "Paediatric Liver GI and Nutrition Center, King's College Hospital"}, "7006775777": {"Name": "Parisi F.", "AuthorID": "7006775777", "AffiliationID": "60017905", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatric Cardiology and Cardiac Surgery, Thoracic Transplant Unit, Osp Pediatrico Bambino Ges\u00f9"}, "13606275800": {"Name": "Grenda R.", "AuthorID": "13606275800", "AffiliationID": "60087496", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nephrology and Kidney Transplantation, The Children's Memorial Health Institute"}, "7004317787": {"Name": "Debray D.", "AuthorID": "7004317787", "AffiliationID": "60026877, 60021567", "AffiliationName": "Pediatric Hepatology Unit, APHP-H\u00f4pital Universitaire Necker-Enfants Malades"}, "8889557300": {"Name": "Marks S.D.", "AuthorID": "8889557300", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Nephrology, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children, NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7102172274": {"Name": "Webb N.J.A.", "AuthorID": "7102172274", "AffiliationID": "60023969, 60120605", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Nephrology, Royal Manchester Children's Hospital, Manchester University Foundation Trust"}, "55005319500": {"Name": "Lachaux A.", "AuthorID": "55005319500", "AffiliationID": "60023578", "AffiliationName": "Service d'H\u00e9patologie P\u00e9diatrique, Universit\u00e9 Lyon 1 et Hospices Civils de Lyon, HFME"}, "24335221300": {"Name": "Kazeem G.", "AuthorID": "24335221300", "AffiliationID": "121500601", "AffiliationName": "BENKAZ Consulting Ltd"}, "55958577900": {"Name": "Undre N.", "AuthorID": "55958577900", "AffiliationID": "60111592", "AffiliationName": "Astellas Pharma Europe Ltd"}}}
