Surprisingly, direct evidence for their interrelatedness is lacking, as is an understanding of why they might be related. There is debate about whether they are linked by an underlying memory-related process or, as has more recently been suggested, because they each require the endogenous construction of scene imagery. Here, using a large sample of participants and multiple cognitive tests with a wide spread of individual differences in performance, we found that these functions are indeed related. Mediation analyses further showed that scene construction, and not memory, mediated (explained) the relationships between the functions. These findings offer a fresh perspective on autobiographical memory, future thinking, navigation, and also on the hippocampus, where scene imagery appears to play an influential role.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Autobiographical memory", "Future thinking", "Individual differences", "Navigation", "Scene construction"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Cognition", "Female", "Hippocampus", "Humans", "Male", "Memory, Episodic", "Neuropsychological Tests", "Spatial Navigation", "Task Performance and Analysis", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85062303919", "SubjectAreas": [["Experimental and Cognitive Psychology", "PSYC", "3205"], ["Psychology (all)", "PSYC", "3200"], ["Developmental Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2806"]], "AuthorData": {"55597134100": {"Name": "Clark I.", "AuthorID": "55597134100", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "57193616593": {"Name": "Hotchin V.", "AuthorID": "57193616593", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "56237018700": {"Name": "Monk A.", "AuthorID": "56237018700", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "56097630200": {"Name": "Pizzamiglio G.", "AuthorID": "56097630200", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "57207206880": {"Name": "Liefgreen A.", "AuthorID": "57207206880", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "7005945840": {"Name": "Maguire E.", "AuthorID": "7005945840", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
