However, the exhibition marginalized an account of the specific relations between these objects in favor of a more encompassing global curatorial narrative. While seeking to outline the parameters of the exhibition, and its implications in regard to contemporary trends in art history and museology, the text aims to highlight some of the instances of transmission and contact, both real and imagined, between the objects displayed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Curatorial models", "Eastern Europe", "Global art history", "Historiography", "Latin America"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84971220863", "SubjectAreas": [["Cultural Studies", "SOCI", "3316"], ["Visual Arts and Performing Arts", "ARTS", "1213"], ["History", "ARTS", "1202"]], "AuthorData": {"56644826900": {"Name": "Selejan I.", "AuthorID": "56644826900", "AffiliationID": "60009828", "AffiliationName": "Linda Wyatt Gruber Curatorial Fellow in Photography, Davis Museum, Wellesley College"}}}
