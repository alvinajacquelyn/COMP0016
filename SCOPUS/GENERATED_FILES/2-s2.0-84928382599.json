Aromatic [ 18 F]fluorination of drug-like small molecules is particularly challenging as their functional group compositions often impair the labelling efficiency. Herein, we report a new strategy for incorporation of 18 F into highly functionalized aromatic compounds using sulfonium salts as leaving groups. The method is compatible with pharmacologically relevant functional groups, including aliphatic amines and basic heterocycles. Activated substrates react with [ 18 F]fluoride at room temperature, and with heating the reaction proceeds in the presence of hydrogen bond donors. Furthermore, the use of electron rich spectator ligands allows efficient and regioselective [ 18 F]fluorination of non-activated aromatic moieties. The method provides a broadly applicable route for 18 F labelling of biologically active small molecules, and offers immediate practical benefits for drug discovery and imaging with PET.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Fluorine Radioisotopes", "Isotope Labeling", "Mice", "Models, Animal", "Positron-Emission Tomography", "Radiopharmaceuticals", "Salts", "Sulfonium Compounds", "Tomography, X-Ray Computed"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84928382599", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"8626055500": {"Name": "Sander K.", "AuthorID": "8626055500", "AffiliationID": "60090043, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Nuclear Medicine - Radiochemistry, University College London"}, "56605140400": {"Name": "Gendron T.", "AuthorID": "56605140400", "AffiliationID": "60090043, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Nuclear Medicine - Radiochemistry, University College London"}, "6507965888": {"Name": "\u00c5rstad E.", "AuthorID": "6507965888", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "55819254700": {"Name": "Yiannaki E.", "AuthorID": "55819254700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "56605035700": {"Name": "Cybulska K.", "AuthorID": "56605035700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Biosciences, University College London"}, "9434519300": {"Name": "Kalber T.L.", "AuthorID": "9434519300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Advanced Biomedical Imaging, University College London"}, "7004107686": {"Name": "Lythgoe M.F.", "AuthorID": "7004107686", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Advanced Biomedical Imaging, University College London"}}}
