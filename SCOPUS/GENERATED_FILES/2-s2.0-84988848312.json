Here we illustrate that value for the Campanian, Pliensbachian, Toarcian, and Valanginian ages by comparing87Sr/86Sr profiles for different localities and comparing those to the87Sr/86Sr profile through time. The analysis reveals possible problems both with current time scales and with some astrochronological calibrations. Our analysis is neither comprehensive nor final; rather, with a few examples, we show how Sr-isotope stratigraphy can be used to moderate other methods of assigning numerical ages to sediments.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84988848312", "SubjectAreas": [["Geology", "EART", "1907"]], "AuthorData": {"23047645000": {"Name": "McArthur J.", "AuthorID": "23047645000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Earth Sciences, University College London"}, "36053457200": {"Name": "Steuber T.", "AuthorID": "36053457200", "AffiliationID": "60104134", "AffiliationName": "Petroleum Geosciences, Petroleum Institute"}, "7102901784": {"Name": "Page K.", "AuthorID": "7102901784", "AffiliationID": "60024779", "AffiliationName": "Geological Sciences, Plymouth University, Drake Circus"}, "6603836287": {"Name": "Landman N.", "AuthorID": "6603836287", "AffiliationID": "60011425", "AffiliationName": "American Museum of Natural History, Division of Paleontology (Invertebrates)"}}}
