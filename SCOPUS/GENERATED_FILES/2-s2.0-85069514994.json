We denote by when G1 = \u22ef = Gk = G. Haxell, Kohayakawa and \u0141uczak showed that the size-Ramsey number of a cycle Cn is linear in n, for some constant ck. Their proof, however, is based on Szemer\u00e9di's regularity lemma so no specific constant ck is known. In this paper, we give various upper bounds for the size-Ramsey numbers of cycles. We provide an alternative proof of , avoiding use of the regularity lemma, where ck is exponential and doubly exponential in k, when n is even and odd, respectively. In particular, we show that for sufficiently large n we have , where c = 6.5 if n is even and c = 1989 otherwise.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["2010 MSC Codes", "Edge-colouring", "Large N", "Primary 05C55", "Regularity lemma", "Secondary 05D10", "Size-Ramsey number", "Upper Bound"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85069514994", "SubjectAreas": [["Theoretical Computer Science", "MATH", "2614"], ["Statistics and Probability", "MATH", "2613"], ["Computational Theory and Mathematics", "COMP", "1703"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"26029869400": {"Name": "Javadi R.", "AuthorID": "26029869400", "AffiliationID": "60028174", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematical Sciences, Isfahan University of Technology"}, "57202009894": {"Name": "Khoeini F.", "AuthorID": "57202009894", "AffiliationID": "60028174", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematical Sciences, Isfahan University of Technology"}, "13609587200": {"Name": "Omidi G.R.", "AuthorID": "13609587200", "AffiliationID": "60017853, 60001610", "AffiliationName": "School of Mathematics, Institute for Research in Fundamental Sciences (IPM)"}, "37087562400": {"Name": "Pokrovskiy A.", "AuthorID": "37087562400", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Department of Economics, Mathematics, and Statistics, Birkbeck University of London"}}}
