Different models have been proposed for the Bronze Age Argaric society of SE Iberia. One includes a highly centralised hierarchical production system, and the other consists of decentralised production at a local scale.Though metallurgical debris has been found in more than 30 sites in the Argaric society, and despite metallurgy being a core subject of discussion, very little research has been conducted on these finds. In this article, we draw from provenance studies using lead isotope analysis to gain a better understanding of the organisation of metal production and distribution.We present new MC-ICP-MS lead isotope and SC-ICP-MS trace element analyses of 23 arsenical copper and bronze objects from two Argaric sites: Cerro de la Encina and Cerro San Crist\u00f3bal. Both sites are located in the Granada basin. These results, contextualised with metallurgical evidence already published, allow us to depict a decentralised system of metal production in which different and distantly located copper mines were being exploited.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Argar culture", "Copper provenance", "Early bronze age", "Iberia", "Lead isotope analysis", "Metallurgy"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84922632887", "SubjectAreas": [["Archeology (arts and humanities)", "ARTS", "1204"], ["Archeology", "SOCI", "3302"]], "AuthorData": {"35574554200": {"Name": "Murillo-Barroso M.", "AuthorID": "35574554200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Archaeology"}, "25621603800": {"Name": "Montero Ruiz I.", "AuthorID": "25621603800", "AffiliationID": "60015464", "AffiliationName": "CCHS-CSIC"}, "26631691700": {"Name": "Aranda Jim\u00e9nez G.", "AuthorID": "26631691700", "AffiliationID": "60027844", "AffiliationName": "Universidad de Granada, Dpto. de Prehistoria y Arqueolog\u00eda"}}}
