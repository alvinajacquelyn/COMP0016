Methods: Sixty-six IPF patients with serial CT imaging (6-24 months apart) had CT features scored visually and with a computer software tool: ground glass opacity, reticulation and honeycombing (all three variables summed as interstitial lung disease extent [ILD]) and emphysema. Pulmonary vessel volume (PVV) was estimated by computer only. Relationships between changes in CT features and forced vital capacity (FVC) were examined using univariate and multivariate linear regression analyses. Results: On univariate analysis, changes in computer variables demonstrated stronger linkages to FVC change than changes in visual scores (CALIPER ILD:R2=0.53, p<0.0001; Visual ILD:R2=0.16, p=0.001). PVV increase correlated most strongly with relative FVC change (R2=0.57). When PVV constituents (vessel size and location) were examined, an increase in middle zone vessels linked most strongly to FVC decline (R2=0.57) and was independent of baseline disease severity (characterised by CT fibrosis extent, FVC, or DLco). Conclusions: An increase in PVV, specifically an increase in middle zone lung vessels, was the strongest CT determinant of FVC decline in IPF and was independent of baseline disease severity. Key Points: \u2022 Computer analysis improves on visual CT scoring in evaluating deterioration on CT \u2022 Increasing pulmonary vessel volume is the strongest CT predictor of functional deterioration \u2022 Increasing pulmonary vessel volume predicts functional decline independent of baseline disease severity.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Blood vessels", "Computer-assisted image Analysis", "Idiopathic interstitial pneumonias", "Multidetector-row computed tomography", "Pulmonary fibrosis, idiopathic"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Female", "Humans", "Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis", "Lung", "Male", "Respiratory Function Tests", "Tomography, X-Ray Computed", "Vital Capacity"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85030181244", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"57200973324": {"Name": "Jacob J.", "AuthorID": "57200973324", "AffiliationID": "60032610", "AffiliationName": "Division of Radiology, Mayo Clinic Rochester"}, "6602803945": {"Name": "Bartholmai B.J.", "AuthorID": "6602803945", "AffiliationID": "60032610", "AffiliationName": "Division of Radiology, Mayo Clinic Rochester"}, "8596434600": {"Name": "Rajagopalan S.", "AuthorID": "8596434600", "AffiliationID": "60032610", "AffiliationName": "Division of Radiology, Mayo Clinic Rochester"}, "36614291500": {"Name": "Kokosi M.", "AuthorID": "36614291500", "AffiliationID": "60022023, 60009009", "AffiliationName": "Interstitial Lung Disease Unit, Royal Brompton Hospital, Royal Brompton and Harefield NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57201532967": {"Name": "Wells A.U.", "AuthorID": "57201532967", "AffiliationID": "60022023, 60009009", "AffiliationName": "Interstitial Lung Disease Unit, Royal Brompton Hospital, Royal Brompton and Harefield NHS Foundation Trust"}, "6701782045": {"Name": "Egashira R.", "AuthorID": "6701782045", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Saga Daigaku"}, "24069928400": {"Name": "Brun A.L.", "AuthorID": "24069928400", "AffiliationID": "60000641", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Whittington Hospital"}, "36241963000": {"Name": "Nair A.", "AuthorID": "36241963000", "AffiliationID": "60005518", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Guys and St Thomas\u2019 NHS Foundation Trust"}, "36555011900": {"Name": "Walsh S.L.F.", "AuthorID": "36555011900", "AffiliationID": "60029685", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Kings College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "6603861094": {"Name": "Karwoski R.", "AuthorID": "6603861094", "AffiliationID": "60032610", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physiology and Biomedical Engineering, Mayo Clinic Rochester"}}}
