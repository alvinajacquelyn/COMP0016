In recent years reminiscence groups have extended to include family members, but carers\u2019 experience of attending joint sessions is undocumented. This qualitative study explored the experience of 18 family carers attending \u2018Remembering Yesterday Caring Today\u2019 groups. Semi-structured interviews were transcribed and subjected to thematic analysis. Five themes were identified: experiencing carer support; shared experience; expectations (met and unmet), carer perspectives of the person with dementia\u2019s experience; and learning and comparing. Family carers\u2019 experiences varied, with some experiencing the intervention as entirely positive whereas others had more mixed feelings. Negative aspects included the lack of respite from their relative, the lack of emphasis on their own needs, and experiencing additional stress and guilt through not being able to implement newly acquired skills. These findings may explain the failure of a recent trial of joint reminiscence groups to replicate previous findings of positive benefit. More targeted research within subgroups of carers is required to justify the continued use of joint reminiscence groups in dementia care.", "AuthorKeywords": ["caregiving", "dementia", "family carers", "psychosocial interventions", "reminiscence", "RYCT", "thematic analysis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Caregivers", "Dementia", "Family", "Female", "Humans", "Interviews as Topic", "Male", "Memory", "Middle Aged", "Qualitative Research", "Quality of Life", "Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84946407131", "SubjectAreas": [["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"], ["Social Sciences (all)", "SOCI", "3300"]], "AuthorData": {"56946765000": {"Name": "Melunsky N.", "AuthorID": "56946765000", "AffiliationID": "60107401", "AffiliationName": "Department of Research and Development, North East London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "55390090800": {"Name": "Crellin N.", "AuthorID": "55390090800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Mental Health Sciences Unit, University College London"}, "7006161600": {"Name": "Orrell M.", "AuthorID": "7006161600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Mental Health Sciences Unit, University College London"}, "23996250600": {"Name": "Wenborn J.", "AuthorID": "23996250600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Mental Health Sciences Unit, University College London"}, "6602617245": {"Name": "Charlesworth G.", "AuthorID": "6602617245", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Clinical, Health & Educational Psychology, University College London"}, "56946805100": {"Name": "Dudzinski E.", "AuthorID": "56946805100", "AffiliationID": "60000112", "AffiliationName": "University of East Anglia"}, "6507156058": {"Name": "Poland F.", "AuthorID": "6507156058", "AffiliationID": "60000112", "AffiliationName": "University of East Anglia"}, "7101638963": {"Name": "Woods B.", "AuthorID": "7101638963", "AffiliationID": "60025779", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Medical and Social Care Research, Bangor University"}}}
