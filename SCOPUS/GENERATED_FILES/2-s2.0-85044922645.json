Combined pulmonary fibrosis and emphysema (CPFE) has occasionally been described in never-smokers with HP, but epidemiological data regarding its prevalence is sparse. CTs in a large HP cohort were therefore examined to identify the prevalence and effects of PPFE and emphysema. Methods: 233 HP patients had CT extents of interstitial lung disease (ILD) and emphysema quantified to the nearest 5%. Lobar percentage pleural involvement of PPFE was quantified on a 4-point categorical scale: 0 = absent, 1 = affecting <10%, 2 = affecting 10\u201333%, 3 = affecting >33%. Marked PPFE reflected a total lung score of \u22653/18. Results were evaluated against FVC, DLco and mortality. RESULTS: Marked PPFE prevalence was 23% whilst 23% of never-smokers had emphysema. Following adjustment for patient age, gender, smoking status, and ILD and emphysema extents, marked PPFE independently linked to reduced baseline FVC (p = 0.0002) and DLco (p = 0.002) and when examined alongside the same covariates, independently linked to worsened survival (p = 0.01). CPFE in HP demonstrated a characteristic functional profile of artificial lung volume preservation and disproportionate DLco reduction. CPFE did not demonstrate a worsened outcome when compared to HP patients without emphysema beyond that explained by CT extents of ILD and emphysema. CONCLUSIONS: PPFE is not uncommon in HP, and is independently associated with impaired lung function and increased mortality. Emphysema was identified in 23% of HP never-smokers. CPFE appears not to link to a malignant microvascular phenotype as outcome is explained by ILD and emphysema extents.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Emphysema", "Hypersensitivity pneumonia", "Interstitial lung disease", "Pleuroparenchymal fibroelastosis", "Radiology thoracic"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Alveolitis, Extrinsic Allergic", "Elastic Tissue", "Female", "Fibrosis", "Forced Expiratory Volume", "Humans", "London", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Pleura", "Prevalence", "Prognosis", "Pulmonary Emphysema", "Respiratory Function Tests", "Smoking", "Tomography, X-Ray Computed", "Vital Capacity"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85044922645", "SubjectAreas": [["Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine", "MEDI", "2740"]], "AuthorData": {"57202517377": {"Name": "Jacob J.", "AuthorID": "57202517377", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Computing, University College London"}, "16837342000": {"Name": "Odink A.", "AuthorID": "16837342000", "AffiliationID": "60032114", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology"}, "24069928400": {"Name": "Brun A.L.", "AuthorID": "24069928400", "AffiliationID": "60019163, 60123796", "AffiliationName": "Imaging Department, H\u00f4pital Cochin, Paris-Descartes University"}, "57189348601": {"Name": "Macaluso C.", "AuthorID": "57189348601", "AffiliationID": "60022023, 60009009", "AffiliationName": "Interstitial Lung Disease Unit, Royal Brompton Hospital, Royal Brompton and Harefield NHS Foundation Trust"}, "36614291500": {"Name": "Kokosi M.", "AuthorID": "36614291500", "AffiliationID": "60022023, 60009009", "AffiliationName": "Interstitial Lung Disease Unit, Royal Brompton Hospital, Royal Brompton and Harefield NHS Foundation Trust"}, "6602708198": {"Name": "Renzoni E.", "AuthorID": "6602708198", "AffiliationID": "60022023, 60009009", "AffiliationName": "Interstitial Lung Disease Unit, Royal Brompton Hospital, Royal Brompton and Harefield NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57201532967": {"Name": "Wells A.U.", "AuthorID": "57201532967", "AffiliationID": "60022023, 60009009", "AffiliationName": "Interstitial Lung Disease Unit, Royal Brompton Hospital, Royal Brompton and Harefield NHS Foundation Trust"}, "15724585900": {"Name": "de Lauretis A.", "AuthorID": "15724585900", "AffiliationID": "116459193", "AffiliationName": "Division of Pneumology, \u201cGuido Salvini\u201d Hospital"}, "22955579800": {"Name": "Devaraj A.", "AuthorID": "22955579800", "AffiliationID": "60022023, 60009009", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Royal Brompton Hospital, Royal Brompton and Harefield NHS Foundation Trust"}, "55901104100": {"Name": "Desai S.", "AuthorID": "55901104100", "AffiliationID": "60022023, 60009009", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Royal Brompton Hospital, Royal Brompton and Harefield NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
