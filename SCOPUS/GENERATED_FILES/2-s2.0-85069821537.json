In both methods women have Combined test markers measured. With recall screening, women with a high Combined test risk are recalled for counselling and offered a DNA blood test or invasive diagnostic testing. With reflex screening, a DNA analysis is automatically performed on plasma collected when blood was collected for measurement of the Combined test markers. Methods Published data were used to estimate, for each method, using various unit costs and risk cut-offs, the cost per woman screened, cost per affected pregnancy diagnosed, and for a given number of women screened, numbers of affected pregnancies diagnosed, unaffected pregnancies with positive results, and women with unaffected pregnancies having invasive diagnostic testing. Results Cost per woman screened is lower with reflex v recall screening: \u00a337 v \u00a338, and \u00a311,043 v \u00a311,178 per affected pregnancy diagnosed (DNA \u00a3250, Combined test markers risk cut-off 1 in 150). Reflex screening results in similar numbers of affected pregnancies diagnosed, with 100-fold fewer false-positives and 20-fold fewer women with unaffected pregnancies having invasive diagnostic testing. Conclusions Reflex DNA screening is less expensive, more cost-effective, and safer than recall screening.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aftercare", "Biomarkers", "Cost-Benefit Analysis", "Down Syndrome", "Duty to Recontact", "False Positive Reactions", "Female", "Genetic Testing", "Humans", "Maternal Age", "Maternal Serum Screening Tests", "Pregnancy", "Pregnancy Trimester, First", "Prenatal Diagnosis", "Prevalence", "Refusal to Participate", "Trisomy 13 Syndrome", "Trisomy 18 Syndrome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85069821537", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"14027999700": {"Name": "Bestwick J.P.", "AuthorID": "14027999700", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Wolfson Institute of Preventive Medicine, Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London"}, "57203046820": {"Name": "Wald N.J.", "AuthorID": "57203046820", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Wolfson Institute of Preventive Medicine, Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London"}}}
