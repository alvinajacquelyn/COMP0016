The energy barriers to form this defect from interstitial H atoms range between 0.5 and 1.3 eV. This discovery of unexpected reactivity of atomic hydrogen may have significant implications for our understanding of processes in silica glass and nanoscaled silica, e.g., in porous low-permittivity insulators, and strained variants of a-SiO2.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Ab initio modeling", "Atomic hydrogen", "Hydroxyl groups", "Nano-scaled silica", "Si atoms", "Unpaired electrons"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84925852509", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"55662570700": {"Name": "El-Sayed A.M.", "AuthorID": "55662570700", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, London Centre for Nanotechnology, University College London"}, "7202553462": {"Name": "Watkins M.B.", "AuthorID": "7202553462", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, London Centre for Nanotechnology, University College London"}, "7007118546": {"Name": "Shluger A.L.", "AuthorID": "7007118546", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, London Centre for Nanotechnology, University College London"}, "56257117600": {"Name": "Grasser T.", "AuthorID": "56257117600", "AffiliationID": "60069060, 60018163", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Microelectronics, Technische Universit\u00e4t Wien"}, "7202887446": {"Name": "Afanas'Ev V.V.", "AuthorID": "7202887446", "AffiliationID": "60025063", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of Leuven"}}}
