Among its successes is the burgeoning field of applied positive psychology (APP), involving interventions to promote wellbeing. However, the remit of APP is currently unclear. As such, we offer a meta-theoretical conceptual map delineating the terrain that APP might conceivably cover, namely, the Layered Integrated Framework Example model. The model is based on Wilber\u2019s (J Conscious Stud 4(1):71\u201392, 1997) Integral Framework, which features the four main ontological \u2018dimensions\u2019 of the person. We then stratify these dimensions to produce a comprehensive conceptual map of the person, and of the potential areas of application for APP. For example, we deconstruct the collective dimensions of Wilber\u2019s framework using the levels of Bronfenbrenner\u2019s (Am Psychol 32(7):513\u2013531, 1977) experimental ecology. The result is a detailed multidimensional framework which facilitates a comprehensive approach to promoting wellbeing, and which charts a way forward for APP.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Applied psychology", "Intervention", "Positive psychology", "Practice", "Wellbeing"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84942987453", "SubjectAreas": [["Social Sciences (miscellaneous)", "SOCI", "3301"]], "AuthorData": {"6602469531": {"Name": "Lomas T.", "AuthorID": "6602469531", "AffiliationID": "60026116", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, University of East London"}, "36974601600": {"Name": "Hefferon K.", "AuthorID": "36974601600", "AffiliationID": "60026116", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, University of East London"}, "24437958700": {"Name": "Ivtzan I.", "AuthorID": "24437958700", "AffiliationID": "60026116", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, University of East London"}}}
