(ACM).Homeless people lack stable housing conditions and often feel marginalised from broader society. Some charity organisations seek to improve the confidence and self worth of homeless individuals by providing artistic activities, in which impressive artworks are produced. However, much of the artwork remain unseen, due to lack of the resources and technology available to these charity organisations. This is why we designed StreetHeart, a multichannel service. StreetHeart gives the underprivileged (homeless) the power to upload their artworks independently, by using a portable camera device. Approved artwork is then shared through LED screens placed around the city, reaching larger audiences. By pressing a heart button embedded in the display, passersby can instantaneously send their appreciation to the artists and further purchase artworks via an online store. StreetHeart has the potential to not only increase the self-worth of those affected by homelessness, but also bring them closer to the society.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Art therapy", "Citizen engagement", "Homeless", "Public display", "Service design", "Social inclusion"], "IndexKeywords": ["Art therapy", "Citizen engagements", "Homeless", "Public display", "Service design", "Social inclusion"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85019610852", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Human-Computer Interaction", "COMP", "1709"], ["Computer Graphics and Computer-Aided Design", "COMP", "1704"]], "AuthorData": {"57194281947": {"Name": "Vilaza G.", "AuthorID": "57194281947", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, UCL Interaction Centre"}, "57194277749": {"Name": "M\u00e4h\u00f6nen J.", "AuthorID": "57194277749", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, UCL Interaction Centre"}, "57194276535": {"Name": "Hamon C.", "AuthorID": "57194276535", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, UCL Interaction Centre"}, "57194278944": {"Name": "Danilina O.", "AuthorID": "57194278944", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Division of Psychiatry"}}}
