This paper reports the development of a framework and tools enabling scholarly asset relationships to be expressed in a standard and open way, illustrated with use-cases of discovering new knowledge across cohort studies. The framework uses Research Objects for aggregation, distributed databases for storage, and distributed ledgers for provenance. Our proposal avoids management by a single central platform or organization, instead leveraging the use of existing resources and platforms across natural partnerships. Our proposed infrastructure will support a wide range of users from system administrators to researchers.", "AuthorKeywords": ["cohort studies", "discovery networks", "distributed systems", "knowledge management", "publication archives", "Research informatics", "research objects"], "IndexKeywords": ["Computer Communication Networks", "Humans", "Information Dissemination", "Metadata", "Scholarly Communication"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": null, "EID": "2-s2.0-85018798215", "SubjectAreas": [["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"], ["Health Informatics", "MEDI", "2718"], ["Health Information Management", "HEAL", "3605"]], "AuthorData": {"57220520798": {"Name": "Munro C.", "AuthorID": "57220520798", "AffiliationID": "60172345", "AffiliationName": "Health EResearch Centre, Division of Informatics Imaging, and Data Sciences, Faculty of Biology Medicine and Health"}, "36676199500": {"Name": "Couch P.", "AuthorID": "36676199500", "AffiliationID": "60172345", "AffiliationName": "Health EResearch Centre, Division of Informatics Imaging, and Data Sciences, Faculty of Biology Medicine and Health"}, "15061094000": {"Name": "Ainsworth J.", "AuthorID": "15061094000", "AffiliationID": "60172345", "AffiliationName": "Health EResearch Centre, Division of Informatics Imaging, and Data Sciences, Faculty of Biology Medicine and Health"}, "35594260500": {"Name": "Buchan I.", "AuthorID": "35594260500", "AffiliationID": "60172345", "AffiliationName": "Health EResearch Centre, Division of Informatics Imaging, and Data Sciences, Faculty of Biology Medicine and Health"}, "57217773964": {"Name": "Johnson J.", "AuthorID": "57217773964", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Longitudinal Studies, UCL Institute of Education"}}}
