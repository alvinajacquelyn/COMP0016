We will use this in outpatient clinics and general practice to increase our capture rate of at-risk patients, making valuable use of otherwise wasted patient waiting times. Introduction: Outpatient clinics offer an opportunity to collect valuable health information from a captive population. We have previously developed a modified fracture risk assessment (FRAX\u00ae) tool, enabling patients to self-assess their osteoporotic fracture risk in a touch-screen computer format and demonstrated its acceptability with patients. We aim to validate the accuracy of our tool against the traditional questionnaire. Methods: Fifty patients over 50 years of age within the fracture clinic independently completed a paper equivalent of our touch-screen-modified FRAX\u00ae questionnaire. Responses were analysed against the traditional healthcare professional (HCP)-led questionnaire which was carried out afterwards. Correlation was assessed by sensitivity, specificity, Cohen\u2019s kappa statistic and Fisher\u2019s exact test for each potential FRAX\u00ae outcome of \u201ctreat\u201d, \u201cmeasure BMD\u201d and \u201clifestyle advice\u201d. Results: Age range was 51\u201398 years. The FRAX\u00ae tool was completed by 88 % of patients; six patients lacked confidence in estimating either their height or weight. Following question adjustment according to patient response and feedback, our tool achieved >95 % sensitivity and specificity for the \u201ctreat\u201d and \u201clifestyle advice\u201d groups, and 79 % sensitivity and 100 % specificity in the \u201cmeasure BMD\u201d group. Cohen\u2019s kappa value ranged from 0.823 to 0.995 across all groups, demonstrating \u201cvery good\u201d agreement for all. Fisher\u2019s exact test demonstrated significant concordance between doctor and patient decisions. Discussion: Our modified tool provides a simple, accurate and reliable method for patients to self-report their own FRAX\u00ae score outside the clinical contact period, thus releasing the HCP from the time required to complete the questionnaire and potentially increasing our capture rate of at-risk patients.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Ambulatory care", "Efficiency", "Osteoporosis", "Osteoporotic fractures", "Outpatients", "Self-assessment", "World Health Organisation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Body Height", "Body Weight", "Bone Density", "Decision Support Systems, Clinical", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Osteoporotic Fractures", "Outpatients", "Risk Assessment", "Risk Factors", "Self Report", "Sensitivity and Specificity"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84939228351", "SubjectAreas": [["Orthopedics and Sports Medicine", "MEDI", "2732"]], "AuthorData": {"56780926000": {"Name": "Parker S.", "AuthorID": "56780926000", "AffiliationID": "60005186", "AffiliationName": "Buckinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust"}, "56781199600": {"Name": "Ciaccio M.", "AuthorID": "56781199600", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "19640673800": {"Name": "Smitham P.", "AuthorID": "19640673800", "AffiliationID": "60024067", "AffiliationName": "Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital"}, "36092478800": {"Name": "Cook E.", "AuthorID": "36092478800", "AffiliationID": "60024067", "AffiliationName": "Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital"}, "57217791181": {"Name": "Davenport G.", "AuthorID": "57217791181", "AffiliationID": "60113753", "AffiliationName": "Royal College of General Practitioners"}, "7401832815": {"Name": "Cooper A.", "AuthorID": "7401832815", "AffiliationID": "60113375", "AffiliationName": "National Osteoporosis Society"}, "55056446300": {"Name": "Grange S.", "AuthorID": "55056446300", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "University of Southampton"}}}
