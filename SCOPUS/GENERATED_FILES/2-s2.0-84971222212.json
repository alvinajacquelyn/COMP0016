Until recently, the standard antiviral regimen for hepatitis C was a combination of an interferon derivative and ribavirin, but a plethora of new antiviral drugs is becoming available. While these new drugs have shown great efficacy in clinical trials, observational studies are needed to determine their effectiveness in clinical practice. Previous observational studies have shown that multiple factors, besides the drug regimen, affect patient outcomes in clinical practice. Here, we provide an analytical review of published outcomes studies of the management of hepatitis C virus infection. A conceptual framework defines the relationships between four categories of variables: health care system structure, patient characteristics, process-of-care, and patient outcomes. This framework can provide a starting point for outcomes studies addressing the use and effectiveness of new antiviral drug treatments.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Antiviral agents", "Chronic hepatitis C", "Combination drug therapy", "Humans", "Treatment outcome"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84971222212", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"26868220600": {"Name": "Sbarigia U.", "AuthorID": "26868220600", "AffiliationID": "60068574", "AffiliationName": "Janssen Pharmaceutica"}, "57194575214": {"Name": "Denee T.R.", "AuthorID": "57194575214", "AffiliationID": "60068574", "AffiliationName": "Janssen Pharmaceutica"}, "57189469046": {"Name": "Turner N.G.", "AuthorID": "57189469046", "AffiliationID": "60010584", "AffiliationName": "Johnson & Johnson Health Care Systems, Inc"}, "7101629175": {"Name": "Wan G.J.", "AuthorID": "7101629175", "AffiliationID": "60073780", "AffiliationName": "Mallinckrodt Pharmaceuticals"}, "7402258303": {"Name": "Morrison A.", "AuthorID": "7402258303", "AffiliationID": "100458988", "AffiliationName": "ScribCo"}, "56719145300": {"Name": "Kaufman A.S.", "AuthorID": "56719145300", "AffiliationID": "100458988", "AffiliationName": "ScribCo"}, "7202023138": {"Name": "Rice G.", "AuthorID": "7202023138", "AffiliationID": "112560959", "AffiliationName": "Diplomat Specialty Pharmacy"}, "7006885162": {"Name": "Dusheiko G.M.", "AuthorID": "7006885162", "AffiliationID": "60021923", "AffiliationName": "Kings College Hospital"}}}
