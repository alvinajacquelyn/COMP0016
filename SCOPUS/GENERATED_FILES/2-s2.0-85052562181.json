The majority of patients harbor one of three mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) point mutations, m.3460G>A, m.11778G>A, and m.14484T>C, which all affect complex I subunits of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. The loss of retinal ganglion cells in LHON is thought to arise from a combination of impaired mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation resulting in decreased adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production and increased levels of reactive oxygen species. Treatment options for LHON remain limited, but major advances in mitochondrial neuroprotection, gene therapy, and the prevention of transmission of pathogenic mtDNA mutations will hopefully translate into tangible benefits for patients affected by this condition and their families.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Gene therapy", "Idebenone", "Leber hereditary optic neuropathy", "LHON", "Mitochondrial donation", "Neuroprotection", "Retinal ganglion cells"], "IndexKeywords": ["DNA, Mitochondrial", "Humans", "Mitochondria", "Optic Atrophy, Hereditary, Leber", "Point Mutation", "Retinal Ganglion Cells"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85052562181", "SubjectAreas": [["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"]], "AuthorData": {"26635453800": {"Name": "Kim U.S.", "AuthorID": "26635453800", "AffiliationID": "60004392", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, Konyang University College of Medicine"}, "57194618220": {"Name": "Jurkute N.", "AuthorID": "57194618220", "AffiliationID": "60016691, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, Moorfields Eye Hospital, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "16481648300": {"Name": "Yu-Wai-Man P.", "AuthorID": "16481648300", "AffiliationID": "60120904, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Cambridge Centre for Brain Repair, Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Cambridge"}}}
