Previous economic modeling used Markov models; applying one alternative technique, discrete event simulation (DES) modeling, allows re-treatment and long-term adverse events (AEs) to be included in the analysis. Methods: A DES was adapted to model relapse-triggered re-treatment with alemtuzumab and the effect of including ongoing quality-adjusted life year (QALY) decrements for AEs that extend beyond previous 1-year Markov cycles. As the price to the NHS of fingolimod in the UK is unknown, due to a confidential patient access scheme (PAS), a variety of possible discounts were tested. The interaction of re-treatment assumptions for alemtuzumab with the possible discounts for fingolimod was tested to determine which DMT resulted in lower lifetime costs. The lifetime QALY results were derived from modeled treatment effect and short- and long-term AEs. Results: Most permutations of fingolimod PAS discount and alemtuzumab re-treatment rate resulted in fingolimod being less costly than alemtuzumab. As the percentage of patients who are re-treated with alemtuzumab due to experiencing a relapse approaches 100% of those who relapse whilst on treatment, the discount required for fingolimod to be less costly drops below 5%. Consideration of treatment effect alone found alemtuzumab generated 0.2 more QALYs/patient; the inclusion of AEs up to a duration of 1 year reduced this advantage to only 0.14 QALYs/patient. Modeling AEs with a lifetime QALY decrement found that both DMTs generated very similar QALYs with the difference only 0.04 QALYs/patient. Conclusions: When the model captured alemtuzumab re-treatment and long-term AE decrements, it was found that fingolimod is cost-effective compared to alemtuzumab, assuming application of only a modest level of confidential PAS discount.", "AuthorKeywords": ["alemtuzumab", "cost-effectiveness", "cost-utility", "fingolimod", "highly active relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis", "Multiple sclerosis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Alemtuzumab", "Cost-Benefit Analysis", "Female", "Fingolimod Hydrochloride", "Health Expenditures", "Humans", "Immunosuppressive Agents", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Models, Economic", "Multiple Sclerosis, Relapsing-Remitting", "Prescription Fees", "Quality-Adjusted Life Years", "State Medicine", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85023162112", "SubjectAreas": [["Health Policy", "MEDI", "2719"]], "AuthorData": {"56740112100": {"Name": "Montgomery S.M.", "AuthorID": "56740112100", "AffiliationID": "60116960", "AffiliationName": "Costello Medical Consulting Ltd"}, "56723730300": {"Name": "Kusel J.", "AuthorID": "56723730300", "AffiliationID": "60116960", "AffiliationName": "Costello Medical Consulting Ltd"}, "15768161200": {"Name": "Nicholas R.", "AuthorID": "15768161200", "AffiliationID": "60012558, 60111785", "AffiliationName": "Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, Charing Cross Hospital"}, "36485954200": {"Name": "Adlard N.", "AuthorID": "36485954200", "AffiliationID": "117739818", "AffiliationName": "Novartis Pharmaceuticals UK Ltd"}}}
