The robustness of this approach was systematically studied by means of experiments with our prototype. Numerical simulations were also performed in order to assess the dependence of the image quality on the data acquisition scheme. The results show that errors in the positioning of the masks within a 1\u00b0 range for all the angles, and within 1 mm range of translation, do not noticeably affect image quality. We also show that, if the misalignment does not exceed few tens of micrometers, three intensity projections are sufficient to effectively retrieve the three representations of the sample, allowing for optimization of dose or time efficiency even with a non-ideal system.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Nonideal system", "Orders of magnitude", "Time efficiencies", "X-ray phase-contrast imaging"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84942540679", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (miscellaneous)", "PHYS", "3101"]], "AuthorData": {"35067989100": {"Name": "Endrizzi M.", "AuthorID": "35067989100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "55362547500": {"Name": "Basta D.", "AuthorID": "55362547500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "7004072469": {"Name": "Olivo A.", "AuthorID": "7004072469", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}}}
