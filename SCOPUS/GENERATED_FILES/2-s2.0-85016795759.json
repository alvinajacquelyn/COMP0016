Published by John Wiley & Sons LtdRenal transplantation is the therapy of choice in children with ESKD. Radiological investigations are required in both pre- and post-transplant assessment, although there is paucity of both consensus-based statements and evidence-based imaging guidelines in pediatric renal transplantation. The phases of pediatric ESKD management that require imaging are pretransplantation recipient assessment and post-transplantation surveillance for detection of potential complications. We present suggestions for imaging algorithms for both pre- and post-transplant assessment in pediatric renal transplant recipients.", "AuthorKeywords": ["childhood", "color Doppler sonography", "donor", "imaging", "recipient", "renal transplantation", "surveillance"], "IndexKeywords": ["Algorithms", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Diagnostic Imaging", "Evidence-Based Medicine", "Graft Survival", "Humans", "Immunosuppressive Agents", "Kidney", "Kidney Failure, Chronic", "Kidney Transplantation", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Perfusion", "Postoperative Complications", "Postoperative Period", "Transplant Recipients", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85016795759", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Transplantation", "MEDI", "2747"]], "AuthorData": {"8547330400": {"Name": "Damasio M.B.", "AuthorID": "8547330400", "AffiliationID": "60016041", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Istituto Giannina Gaslini"}, "36053524300": {"Name": "Ording Muller L.S.", "AuthorID": "36053524300", "AffiliationID": "60068729", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology and Intervention Unit for Paediatric Radiology, Oslo University Hospital"}, "7005979367": {"Name": "Piaggio G.", "AuthorID": "7005979367", "AffiliationID": "60016041", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nephrology, Istituto Giannina Gaslini"}, "8889557300": {"Name": "Marks S.D.", "AuthorID": "8889557300", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Nephrology, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}, "56025693300": {"Name": "Riccabona M.", "AuthorID": "56025693300", "AffiliationID": "60004779", "AffiliationName": "Division of Pediatric Radiology, Department of Radiology, University Hospital Graz"}}}
