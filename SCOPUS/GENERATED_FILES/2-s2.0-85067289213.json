In relevant literature, however, these are not seen as a connected whole. Based on reviewing existing competency frameworks, both mathematical and digital, and by exploring an empirical example, this article addresses the question of how to think about and understand a combined \u201cmathematical digital competency\u201d (MDC). In doing so, the article relies on the two theoretical frameworks of the instrumental approach and conceptual fields to \u201cbridge\u201d the mathematical and digital competency descriptions.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Conceptual field", "Digital competencies", "Instrumental genesis", "Mathematical competencies", "Mathematical digital competencies", "Networking of theories"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85067289213", "SubjectAreas": [["Mathematics (all)", "MATH", "2600"], ["Education", "SOCI", "3304"]], "AuthorData": {"25651349800": {"Name": "Geraniou E.", "AuthorID": "25651349800", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Education, University College London"}, "16304249100": {"Name": "Jankvist U.", "AuthorID": "16304249100", "AffiliationID": "60005385, 60029616", "AffiliationName": "Danish School of Education, Aarhus University"}}}
