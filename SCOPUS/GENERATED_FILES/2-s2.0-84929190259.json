Methods: This study evaluated the health and developmental outcomes of all surviving children born to mothers who participated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of progesterone given for the prevention of preterm birth in twin pregnancies (STOPPIT, ISRCTN35782581). Follow-up was performed via record linkage and two parent-completed validated questionnaires, the Child Development Inventory and the Health Utilities Index. Results: Record linkage was successfully performed on at least one record in 759/781 (97%) children eligible for follow-up. There were no differences between progesterone-exposed and placebo-exposed twins with respect to incidence of death, congenital anomalies and hospitalisation, nor on routine national child health assessments. Questionnaire responses were received for 324/738 (44%) children. The mean age at questionnaire follow-up was 55.5 months. Delay in at least one developmental domain on the Child Development Inventory was observed in 107/324 (33%) children, with no evidence of difference between progesterone-exposed and placebo-exposed twins. There was no evidence of difference between the progesterone and placebo groups in global health status assessed using the Health Utilities Index: 89% of children were rated as having 'excellent' health and a further 8% as having 'very good' health. Conclusions: In this cohort of twin children there was no evidence of a detrimental or beneficial impact on health and developmental outcomes at three to six years of age due to in utero exposure to progesterone.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Double-Blind Method", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Humans", "Placebos", "Pregnancy", "Pregnancy Outcome", "Progesterone"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84929190259", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"57214704318": {"Name": "McNamara H.C.", "AuthorID": "57214704318", "AffiliationID": "60019578", "AffiliationName": "Monash University"}, "56433796600": {"Name": "Wood R.", "AuthorID": "56433796600", "AffiliationID": "60111372", "AffiliationName": "Information Services Division, NHS National Services Scotland"}, "57197138219": {"Name": "Chalmers J.", "AuthorID": "57197138219", "AffiliationID": "60111372", "AffiliationName": "Information Services Division, NHS National Services Scotland"}, "7006171979": {"Name": "Marlow N.", "AuthorID": "7006171979", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neonatal Medicine, Institute for Women's Health, University College London"}, "7003447956": {"Name": "Norrie J.", "AuthorID": "7003447956", "AffiliationID": "60022300, 60015875", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Healthcare Randomised Trials (CHaRT), Health Services Research Unit, University of Aberdeen"}, "7003304043": {"Name": "MacLennan G.", "AuthorID": "7003304043", "AffiliationID": "60022300, 60015875", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Healthcare Randomised Trials (CHaRT), Health Services Research Unit, University of Aberdeen"}, "12760628000": {"Name": "McPherson G.", "AuthorID": "12760628000", "AffiliationID": "60022300, 60015875", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Healthcare Randomised Trials (CHaRT), Health Services Research Unit, University of Aberdeen"}, "35361681700": {"Name": "Boachie C.", "AuthorID": "35361681700", "AffiliationID": "60001490", "AffiliationName": "Robertson Centre for Biostatistics, University of Glasgow"}, "7402489769": {"Name": "Norman J.E.", "AuthorID": "7402489769", "AffiliationID": "60028299, 60010973", "AffiliationName": "Tommy's Centre for Maternal and Fetal Health, University of Edinburgh MRC Centre for Reproductive Health, Queen's Medical Research Institute"}}}
