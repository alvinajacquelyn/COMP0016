The trapdoor is exploited by a (hypothetical) simulator to prove the scheme is zero knowledge, and the secret-dependent structure facilitates a linear-size CRS and linear-time prover computation. If known by a real party, however, the trapdoor can be used to subvert the security of the system. The structured CRS that makes zk-SNARKs practical also makes deploying zk-SNARKS problematic, as it is difficult to argue why the trapdoor would not be available to the entity responsible for generating the CRS. Moreover, for pre-processing zk-SNARKs a new trusted CRS needs to be computed every time the relation is changed. In this paper, we address both issues by proposing a model where a number of users can update a universal CRS. The updatable CRS model guarantees security if at least one of the users updating the CRS is honest. We provide both a negative result, by showing that zk-SNARKs with private secret-dependent polynomials in the CRS cannot be updatable, and a positive result by constructing a zk-SNARK based on a CRS consisting only of secret-dependent monomials. The CRS is of quadratic size, is updatable, and is universal in the sense that it can be specialized into one or more relation-dependent CRS of linear size with linear-time prover computation.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Common reference string", "Linear time", "Pre-processing", "Zero knowledge"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85052385229", "SubjectAreas": [["Theoretical Computer Science", "MATH", "2614"], ["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"]], "AuthorData": {"57204262109": {"Name": "Groth J.", "AuthorID": "57204262109", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "57192807974": {"Name": "Maller M.", "AuthorID": "57192807974", "AffiliationID": "60098463", "AffiliationName": "Microsoft Research Cambridge"}, "36717929200": {"Name": "Meiklejohn S.", "AuthorID": "36717929200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "17434840500": {"Name": "Kohlweiss M.", "AuthorID": "17434840500", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "University of Edinburgh"}, "55815678900": {"Name": "Miers I.", "AuthorID": "55815678900", "AffiliationID": "60104837", "AffiliationName": "Cornell Tech"}}}
