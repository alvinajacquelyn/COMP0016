Testing such systems on a vulnerable population such as newborns is complicated due to ethical and regulatory considerations that slow down the technical development. This paper presents and validates a method for quantifying the accuracy of neonatal EEG acquisition systems and electrode technologies via clinical data simulations that do not require neonatal participants. The proposed method uses an extensive neonatal EEG database to simulate analogue signals, which are subsequently passed through electrical models of the skin-electrode interface, which are developed using wet and dry EEG electrode designs. The signal losses in the system are quantified at each stage of the acquisition process for electrode and acquisition board losses. SNR, correlation and noise values were calculated. The results verify that low-cost EEG acquisition systems are capable of obtaining clinical grade EEG. Although dry electrodes result in a significant increase in the skin-electrode impedance, accurate EEG recordings are still achievable.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Electric Impedance", "Electrodes", "Electroencephalography", "Humans", "Infant, Newborn"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85056581755", "SubjectAreas": [["Signal Processing", "COMP", "1711"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"], ["Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition", "COMP", "1707"], ["Health Informatics", "MEDI", "2718"]], "AuthorData": {"57204656855": {"Name": "Orsullivan M.", "AuthorID": "57204656855", "AffiliationID": "60113732", "AffiliationName": "Irish Centre for Fetal and Neonatal Translational Research (INFANT), UCC"}, "7003824000": {"Name": "Popovici E.", "AuthorID": "7003824000", "AffiliationID": "60025160", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering, University College Cork"}, "12143283200": {"Name": "Temko A.", "AuthorID": "12143283200", "AffiliationID": "60113732", "AffiliationName": "Irish Centre for Fetal and Neonatal Translational Research (INFANT), UCC"}, "6602292136": {"Name": "Boylan G.", "AuthorID": "6602292136", "AffiliationID": "60113732", "AffiliationName": "Irish Centre for Fetal and Neonatal Translational Research (INFANT), UCC"}, "57190438027": {"Name": "Bocchino A.", "AuthorID": "57190438027", "AffiliationID": "121692518", "AffiliationName": "Tyndall National Institute, UCC"}, "57204660253": {"Name": "Ormahony C.", "AuthorID": "57204660253", "AffiliationID": "121692518", "AffiliationName": "Tyndall National Institute, UCC"}}}
