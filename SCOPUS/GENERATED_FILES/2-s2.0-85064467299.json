PDAC cell lines and PDAC-derived xenografts grow as a result of altered metabolic pathways, changes in stroma, and autophagy. Selective targeting and inhibition of one of these may open avenues for the development of new therapeutic strategies. In this study, we performed a genome-wide siRNA screen in a PDAC cell line using endogenous autophagy as a readout and identified several regulators of autophagy that were required for autophagy-dependent PDAC cell survival. Validation of two promising candidates, MPP7 (MAGUK p55 subfamily member 7, a scaffolding protein involved in cell\u2013cell contacts) and MDH1 (cytosolic Malate dehydrogenase 1), revealed their role in early stages of autophagy during autophagosome formation. MPP7 was involved in the activation of YAP1 (a transcriptional coactivator in the Hippo pathway), which in turn promoted autophagy, whereas MDH1 was required for maintenance of the levels of the essential autophagy initiator serine\u2013threonine kinase ULK1, and increased in the activity upon induction of autophagy. Our results provide a possible explanation for how autophagy is regulated by MPP7 and MDH1, which adds to our understanding of autophagy regulation in PDAC. Significance: This study identifies and characterizes MPP7 and MDH1 as novel regulators of autophagy, which is thought to be responsible for pancreatic cancer cell survival.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing", "Apoptosis", "Autophagy", "Autophagy-Related Protein-1 Homolog", "Carcinoma, Pancreatic Ductal", "Cell Proliferation", "Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic", "Humans", "Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins", "Malate Dehydrogenase", "Membrane Proteins", "Pancreatic Neoplasms", "RNA, Small Interfering", "Signal Transduction", "Transcription Factors", "Tumor Cells, Cultured"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85064467299", "SubjectAreas": [["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Cancer Research", "BIOC", "1306"]], "AuthorData": {"57192695715": {"Name": "New M.", "AuthorID": "57192695715", "AffiliationID": "60107285", "AffiliationName": "Molecular Cell Biology of Autophagy Laboratory, Francis Crick Institute"}, "57192695950": {"Name": "Van Acker T.", "AuthorID": "57192695950", "AffiliationID": "60107285", "AffiliationName": "Molecular Cell Biology of Autophagy Laboratory, Francis Crick Institute"}, "6603325876": {"Name": "Jefferies H.B.J.", "AuthorID": "6603325876", "AffiliationID": "60107285", "AffiliationName": "Molecular Cell Biology of Autophagy Laboratory, Francis Crick Institute"}, "7004652751": {"Name": "Tooze S.A.", "AuthorID": "7004652751", "AffiliationID": "60107285", "AffiliationName": "Molecular Cell Biology of Autophagy Laboratory, Francis Crick Institute"}, "25926132100": {"Name": "Sakamaki J.I.", "AuthorID": "25926132100", "AffiliationID": "60031990", "AffiliationName": "Tumour Cell Death Laboratory, Cancer Research UK Beatson Institute"}, "56508794400": {"Name": "Long J.", "AuthorID": "56508794400", "AffiliationID": "60031990", "AffiliationName": "Tumour Cell Death Laboratory, Cancer Research UK Beatson Institute"}, "7201820903": {"Name": "Ryan K.M.", "AuthorID": "7201820903", "AffiliationID": "60031990", "AffiliationName": "Tumour Cell Death Laboratory, Cancer Research UK Beatson Institute"}, "57217609538": {"Name": "Jiang M.", "AuthorID": "57217609538", "AffiliationID": "60107285", "AffiliationName": "High Throughput Screening, Francis Crick Institute"}, "8694786300": {"Name": "Saunders R.E.", "AuthorID": "8694786300", "AffiliationID": "60107285", "AffiliationName": "High Throughput Screening, Francis Crick Institute"}, "7102829788": {"Name": "Howell M.", "AuthorID": "7102829788", "AffiliationID": "60107285", "AffiliationName": "High Throughput Screening, Francis Crick Institute"}, "56697943800": {"Name": "Wang V.M.Y.", "AuthorID": "56697943800", "AffiliationID": "60107285", "AffiliationName": "Adult Stem Cell Laboratory, Francis Crick Institute"}, "35480950900": {"Name": "Behrens A.", "AuthorID": "35480950900", "AffiliationID": "60107285", "AffiliationName": "Adult Stem Cell Laboratory, Francis Crick Institute"}, "55936309600": {"Name": "Cerveira J.", "AuthorID": "55936309600", "AffiliationID": "60107285", "AffiliationName": "Flow Cytometry, Francis Crick Institute"}, "57203714257": {"Name": "Sudhakar P.", "AuthorID": "57203714257", "AffiliationID": "60121260, 60025063", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chronic Diseases, Metabolism and Ageing, KU Leuven"}, "8620943000": {"Name": "Korcsmaros T.", "AuthorID": "8620943000", "AffiliationID": "60018654", "AffiliationName": "Korcsmaros Group, Quadram Institute"}}}
