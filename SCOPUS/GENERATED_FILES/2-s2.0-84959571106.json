The QoS exponent is well understood in the literature; however, there is little known about the other function, i.e., the nonempty buffer probability, because this function has not been exactly derived. In this letter, we derive a new approximation formula for this function over Nakagami-m fading channels. Simulation results indicate that our formula can closely approximate this function and is more accurate than existing approximation formulae.", "AuthorKeywords": ["approximation", "Effective capacity model", "Nakagami-m fading channel", "nonempty buffer probability"], "IndexKeywords": ["approximation", "Close approximation", "Effective capacity", "Nakagami-m fading channels", "Tail probability", "Wireless communication system"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84959571106", "SubjectAreas": [["Modeling and Simulation", "MATH", "2611"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"9734845000": {"Name": "Chen Y.", "AuthorID": "9734845000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electronic and Electrical Engineering Department, University College London"}, "7003497031": {"Name": "Darwazeh I.", "AuthorID": "7003497031", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electronic and Electrical Engineering Department, University College London"}}}
