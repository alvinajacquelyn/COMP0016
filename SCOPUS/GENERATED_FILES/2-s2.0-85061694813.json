This culminates in systemic inflammation and endotoxaemia, inducing innate immune dysfunction which predisposes to infection, and development of complications such as bleeding, sepsis and hepatic encephalopathy. This feasibility study aims to assess the safety of administering faecal microbiota transplantion to patients with cirrhosis and explore the effect of the intervention on their prognosis by achieving restoration of a healthy gut microbiome. Methods and analysis: A PROspective, randomised placebo controlled feasibility trial of Faecal mIcrobiota Transplantation is a single-centre, randomised, single-blinded, placebo-controlled study evaluating faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) against placebo. Patients with advanced but stable cirrhosis with a Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score between 10 and 16 will be recruited. Twenty-four patients will be randomised to FMT plus standard of care (as per our institutional practice) and eight patients to placebo in a ratio of 3:1. Patients will be evaluated at baseline before the study intervention is administered and at 7, 30 and 90 days post-intervention to assess safety and adverse events. FMT/placebo will be administered into the jejunum within 7 days of baseline. The primary outcome measure will be safety and feasibility as assessed by recruitment rates, tolerability and safety of FMT treatment. Results will be disseminated via peer-reviewed journals and international conferences. The recruitment of the first patient occurred on 23 May 2018. Ethics and dissemination: Research Ethics approval was given by the London South East Research Ethics committee (ref 17/LO/2081).", "AuthorKeywords": ["cirrhosis", "faecal microbiota transplantation", "feasibility", "gut microbiota"], "IndexKeywords": ["Feasibility Studies", "Fecal Microbiota Transplantation", "Humans", "Liver Cirrhosis", "Prospective Studies", "Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic", "Single-Blind Method"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85061694813", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"57196353202": {"Name": "Woodhouse C.A.", "AuthorID": "57196353202", "AffiliationID": "60177635", "AffiliationName": "James Black Centre, School of Immunology and Microbial Sciences, Faculty of Life Sciences and Medicine, King's College London"}, "56683890900": {"Name": "Patel V.C.", "AuthorID": "56683890900", "AffiliationID": "60177635", "AffiliationName": "James Black Centre, School of Immunology and Microbial Sciences, Faculty of Life Sciences and Medicine, King's College London"}, "6601986543": {"Name": "Sanchez-Fueyo A.", "AuthorID": "6601986543", "AffiliationID": "60177635", "AffiliationName": "James Black Centre, School of Immunology and Microbial Sciences, Faculty of Life Sciences and Medicine, King's College London"}, "6603656382": {"Name": "Shawcross D.", "AuthorID": "6603656382", "AffiliationID": "60177635", "AffiliationName": "James Black Centre, School of Immunology and Microbial Sciences, Faculty of Life Sciences and Medicine, King's College London"}, "14119824600": {"Name": "Goldenberg S.", "AuthorID": "14119824600", "AffiliationID": "60005518", "AffiliationName": "Department of Microbiology, Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust"}, "56695161900": {"Name": "China L.", "AuthorID": "56695161900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Medicine, University College London"}, "8505711300": {"Name": "O'Brien A.", "AuthorID": "8505711300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Medicine, University College London"}, "35758469800": {"Name": "Flach C.", "AuthorID": "35758469800", "AffiliationID": "60177635", "AffiliationName": "School of Population Health and Environmental Sciences, Faculty of Life Sciences and Medicine, King's College London"}, "7801315826": {"Name": "Douiri A.", "AuthorID": "7801315826", "AffiliationID": "60177635", "AffiliationName": "School of Population Health and Environmental Sciences, Faculty of Life Sciences and Medicine, King's College London"}}}
