It seems that the most sufficient pH for the substitution of Co into the framework of CoAlPO-34 was pH around 7.5 when the as-synthesized bifunctional catalyst has the best redox property. The pH of the initial gel has strong effect on the particle size of CoAlPO-34. The substitution of cobalt and redox chemistry were determined by: EXAFS combined with XRD, XANES, IR. Stability of the nanoporous catalyst studied by in situ XRD were also reported.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Aluninophosphates", "Bifunctional catalyst", "CoAlPO-34", "Gel pH", "Nanoporous"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aluninophosphates", "Bi-functional catalysts", "CoAlPO-34", "Nano-porous", "Nano-porous catalysts", "Redox chemistry", "Redox property", "Synthetic conditions"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84991387993", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Mechanics of Materials", "ENGI", "2211"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"]], "AuthorData": {"54413012200": {"Name": "Nguyen H.K.D.", "AuthorID": "54413012200", "AffiliationID": "60071354", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemical Engineering, C4-306, Ha Noi University of Science and Technology"}, "7006847733": {"Name": "Sankar G.", "AuthorID": "7006847733", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "56488383400": {"Name": "Catlow R.A.", "AuthorID": "56488383400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Head of MAPS Faculty, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}}}
