This material gives a superior specific capacity and excellent long-term cycling performance even at a high current density. It can deliver a stable capacity of 1049 mA h g<sup>-1</sup> after 200 cycles at a current density of 1000 mA g<sup>-1</sup>, which is much higher than the theoretical capacity of 466 mA h g<sup>-1</sup>. After 2000 cycles at a high current density of 5000 mA g<sup>-1</sup>, a capacity of 510 mA h g<sup>-1</sup> can still be maintained. Their high rating performance at 5000 mA g<sup>-1</sup> is among the best-reported performances of anode materials. From the in situ or ex situ SEM observation, the porous MnCO<inf>3</inf> nanostructure can provide a stable template for reversible lithium insertion and extraction without significant morphology change and accommodate the volume change during the charge-discharge process. Also this structure increases the capacitive contribution to the total capacity compared with other MnCO<inf>3</inf> samples.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Anode material for lithium ion batteries", "Charge-discharge process", "Conversion reactions", "Cycling performance", "Ex situ SEM observations", "High current densities", "High lithium storages", "Theoretical capacity"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84930359547", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"]], "AuthorData": {"35435141000": {"Name": "Kang W.", "AuthorID": "35435141000", "AffiliationID": "60013983", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Materials Science, City University of Hong Kong"}, "12804903900": {"Name": "Yu D.", "AuthorID": "12804903900", "AffiliationID": "60013983", "AffiliationName": "School of Energy and Environment, City University of Hong Kong"}, "56193117100": {"Name": "Li W.", "AuthorID": "56193117100", "AffiliationID": "60102083, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "Functional Thin Films Research Center, Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "56150320000": {"Name": "Zhang Z.", "AuthorID": "56150320000", "AffiliationID": "60013983", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Materials Science, City University of Hong Kong"}, "57201122302": {"Name": "Yang X.", "AuthorID": "57201122302", "AffiliationID": "60013983", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Materials Science, City University of Hong Kong"}, "24822626900": {"Name": "Ng T.", "AuthorID": "24822626900", "AffiliationID": "60013983", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Materials Science, City University of Hong Kong"}, "24475575100": {"Name": "Zou R.", "AuthorID": "24475575100", "AffiliationID": "60013983", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Materials Science, City University of Hong Kong"}, "25823954600": {"Name": "Tang Y.", "AuthorID": "25823954600", "AffiliationID": "60102083, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "Functional Thin Films Research Center, Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "37070726100": {"Name": "Zhang W.", "AuthorID": "37070726100", "AffiliationID": "60013983", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Materials Science, City University of Hong Kong"}, "16464316100": {"Name": "Lee C.", "AuthorID": "16464316100", "AffiliationID": "60013983", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Materials Science, City University of Hong Kong"}}}
