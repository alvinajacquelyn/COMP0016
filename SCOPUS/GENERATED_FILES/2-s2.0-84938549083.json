Intracranial haemorrhage is the most common complication associated with implantation, carrying significantly associated morbidity. SEEG planning is done pre-operatively to identify avascular trajectories for the electrodes. In current practice, neurosurgeons have no assistance in the planning of electrode trajectories. There is great interest in developing computer-assisted planning systems that can optimise the safety profile of electrode trajectories, maximising the distance to critical structures. This paper presents a method that integrates the concepts of scale, neighbourhood structure and feature stability with the aim of improving robustness and accuracy of vessel extraction within a SEEG planning system. Methods: The developed method accounts for scale and vicinity of a voxel by formulating the problem within a multi-scale tensor voting framework. Feature stability is achieved through a similarity measure that evaluates the multi-modal consistency in vesselness responses. The proposed measurement allows the combination of multiple images modalities into a single image that is used within the planning system to visualise critical vessels. Results: Twelve paired data sets from two image modalities available within the planning system were used for evaluation. The mean Dice similarity coefficient was $$0.89\\pm 0.04$$0.89\u00b10.04, representing a statistically significantly improvement when compared to a semi-automated single human rater, single-modality segmentation protocol used in clinical practice ($$0.80 \\pm 0.03$$0.80\u00b10.03). Conclusions: Multi-modal vessel extraction is superior to semi-automated single-modality segmentation, indicating the possibility of safer SEEG planning, with reduced patient morbidity.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Computer-assisted planning system", "Depth electrode insertion", "Image-guided surgery", "Multi-modal segmentation", "Vessel extraction"], "IndexKeywords": ["Brain", "Electrodes", "Electroencephalography", "Humans"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84938549083", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"], ["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"], ["Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition", "COMP", "1707"], ["Health Informatics", "MEDI", "2718"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Computer Graphics and Computer-Aided Design", "COMP", "1704"]], "AuthorData": {"16551520500": {"Name": "Zuluaga M.A.", "AuthorID": "16551520500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Translational Imaging Group, CMIC, University College London"}, "36538645500": {"Name": "Zombori G.", "AuthorID": "36538645500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Translational Imaging Group, CMIC, University College London"}, "55767608300": {"Name": "Mendelson A.F.", "AuthorID": "55767608300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Translational Imaging Group, CMIC, University College London"}, "57204636980": {"Name": "Cardoso M.J.", "AuthorID": "57204636980", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Translational Imaging Group, CMIC, University College London"}, "6602233595": {"Name": "Ourselin S.", "AuthorID": "6602233595", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Translational Imaging Group, CMIC, University College London"}, "35307885500": {"Name": "Rodionov R.", "AuthorID": "35307885500", "AffiliationID": "60020736", "AffiliationName": "National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery (NHNN)"}, "34067763300": {"Name": "Nowell M.", "AuthorID": "34067763300", "AffiliationID": "60020736", "AffiliationName": "National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery (NHNN)"}, "55619580400": {"Name": "Achhala S.", "AuthorID": "55619580400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Experimental Epilepsy, UCL IoN"}, "57215499053": {"Name": "Miserocchi A.", "AuthorID": "57215499053", "AffiliationID": "60020736", "AffiliationName": "National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery (NHNN)"}, "57204026204": {"Name": "McEvoy A.W.", "AuthorID": "57204026204", "AffiliationID": "60020736", "AffiliationName": "National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery (NHNN)"}, "7401893026": {"Name": "Duncan J.S.", "AuthorID": "7401893026", "AffiliationID": "60020736", "AffiliationName": "National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery (NHNN)"}}}
