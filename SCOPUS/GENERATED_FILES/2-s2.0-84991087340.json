There is limited information about the relationship between apolipoprotein E (APOE) polymorphisms and physical limitations, and the findings have been inconsistent. Purpose: This study examined the longitudinal associations of obesity and APOE \u03b54 with difficulties in activities of daily living (ADLs) over a 6-year follow-up period controlling for multiple covariates. Methods: Data were analyzed from the Social Environment and Biomarkers of Aging Study (SEBAS) in Taiwan collected in 2000 and 2006, involving a cohort of 639 participants (mean age = 66). Body mass index (BMI) was used to define obesity at a baseline, and the APOE genotype was classified into an APOE \u03b54 carrier and non-carrier status. The combination of basic and instrumental activities of daily living (ADLs and IADLs) was used to define impaired ADLs. Results: APOE \u03b54 carriers had greater difficulties in combined ADLs (incident rate ratio; IRR = 1.87, 95 % CI = 1.40\u20132.51) than non-carriers. Obese but not overweight adults had greater difficulties in activities of daily living (IRR = 1.59, 95 % CI = 1.20\u20132.10) compared with the normal/underweight group. Obese older adults without APOE \u03b54 had greater subsequent difficulties in ADLs than non-obese non-carriers. Among APOE \u03b54 carriers, obesity was not a significant risk factor for the development of impaired ADLs in older adults, indicating an interaction between genotype and obesity. Conclusions: The interaction between genotype and obesity phenotype adds new information about the determinants of physical impairment.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Mobility", "Overweight", "Physical disability", "Physical function", "Weight status"], "IndexKeywords": ["Activities of Daily Living", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Aging", "Alleles", "Apolipoprotein E4", "Body Mass Index", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Genotype", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Obesity", "Overweight", "Polymorphism, Genetic"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84991087340", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychology (all)", "PSYC", "3200"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"53874614300": {"Name": "Chen L.J.", "AuthorID": "53874614300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "7102289942": {"Name": "Steptoe A.", "AuthorID": "7102289942", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "15077845800": {"Name": "Ku P.W.", "AuthorID": "15077845800", "AffiliationID": "60006834", "AffiliationName": "Graduate Institute of Sports and Health, National Changhua University of Education"}}}
