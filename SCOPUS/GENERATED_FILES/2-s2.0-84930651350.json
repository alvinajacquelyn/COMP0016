All rights reserved.Infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) results in disparate degrees of tissue injury: the virus can either replicate without pathological consequences or trigger immune-mediated necroinflammatory liver damage. We investigated the potential for myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) to suppress T cell-mediated immunopathology in this setting. Granulocytic MDSCs (gMDSCs) expanded transiently in acute resolving HBV, decreasing in frequency prior to peak hepatic injury. In persistent infection, arginase-expressing gMDSCs (and circulating arginase) increased most in disease phases characterized by HBV replication without immunopathology, whilst L-arginine decreased. gMDSCs expressed liver-homing chemokine receptors and accumulated in the liver, their expansion supported by hepatic stellate cells. We provide in vitro and ex vivo evidence that gMDSCs potently inhibited T cells in a partially arginase-dependent manner. L-arginine-deprived T cells upregulated system L amino acid transporters to increase uptake of essential nutrients and attempt metabolic reprogramming. These data demonstrate the capacity of expanded arginase-expressing gMDSCs to regulate liver immunopathology in HBV infection.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Antigen Presentation", "Antigens, CD11b", "Arginase", "CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes", "Female", "Hepatic Stellate Cells", "Hepatitis B", "Hepatitis B virus", "Humans", "Liver", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Myeloid Cells"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84930651350", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"55613142700": {"Name": "Pallett L.J.", "AuthorID": "55613142700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity, Institute of Immunity and Transplantation, University College London"}, "12771712800": {"Name": "Schurich A.", "AuthorID": "12771712800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity, Institute of Immunity and Transplantation, University College London"}, "55574201314": {"Name": "Singh K.P.", "AuthorID": "55574201314", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity, Institute of Immunity and Transplantation, University College London"}, "57190856911": {"Name": "Thomas N.", "AuthorID": "57190856911", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity, Institute of Immunity and Transplantation, University College London"}, "57214490485": {"Name": "Das A.", "AuthorID": "57214490485", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity, Institute of Immunity and Transplantation, University College London"}, "55386492600": {"Name": "Chen A.", "AuthorID": "55386492600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity, Institute of Immunity and Transplantation, University College London"}, "7003333032": {"Name": "Maini M.K.", "AuthorID": "7003333032", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity, Institute of Immunity and Transplantation, University College London"}, "55934460700": {"Name": "Gill U.S.", "AuthorID": "55934460700", "AffiliationID": "60021435", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Digestive Diseases, Blizard Institute, Bart's and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry"}, "57196075608": {"Name": "Kennedy P.T.", "AuthorID": "57196075608", "AffiliationID": "60021435", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Digestive Diseases, Blizard Institute, Bart's and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry"}, "55357692500": {"Name": "Quaglia A.", "AuthorID": "55357692500", "AffiliationID": "60021923", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Liver Studies, Kings College Hospital"}, "14039481800": {"Name": "Sinclair L.V.", "AuthorID": "14039481800", "AffiliationID": "60008877", "AffiliationName": "Division of Cell Signaling and Immunology, University of Dundee"}, "57204257925": {"Name": "Cantrell D.A.", "AuthorID": "57204257925", "AffiliationID": "60008877", "AffiliationName": "Division of Cell Signaling and Immunology, University of Dundee"}, "55014395300": {"Name": "Jover-Cobos M.", "AuthorID": "55014395300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Liver and Digestive Health, University College London"}, "25629557900": {"Name": "Fusai G.", "AuthorID": "25629557900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Liver and Digestive Health, University College London"}, "7202610468": {"Name": "Davies N.A.", "AuthorID": "7202610468", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Liver and Digestive Health, University College London"}, "7004014799": {"Name": "Bertoletti A.", "AuthorID": "7004014799", "AffiliationID": "60113364", "AffiliationName": "Singapore Institute for Clinical Sciences, Agency of Science and Technology"}, "8319124300": {"Name": "Haniffa M.", "AuthorID": "8319124300", "AffiliationID": "60026712, 60006222", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cellular Medicine, Newcastle University"}}}
