Pacing and Clinical Electrophysiology published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Background: Controversy exists regarding how atrial activation mode and heart rate affect optimal atrioventricular (AV) delay in cardiac resynchronization therapy. We studied these questions using high-reproducibility hemodynamic and echocardiographic measurements. Methods: Twenty patients were hemodynamically optimized using noninvasive beat-to-beat blood pressure at rest (62 \u00b1 11 beats/min), during exercise (80 \u00b1 6 beats/min), and at three atrially paced rates: 5, 25, and 45 beats/min above rest, denoted as A paced,r+5 , A paced,r+25 , and A paced,r+45 , respectively. Left atrial myocardial motion and transmitral flow were timed echocardiographically. Results: During atrial sensing, raising heart rate shortened optimal AV delay by 25 \u00b1 6 ms (P < 0.001). During atrial pacing, raising heart rate from A paced,r+5 to A paced,r+25 shortened it by 16 \u00b1 6 ms; A paced,r+45 shortened it 17 \u00b1 6 ms further (P < 0.001). In comparison to atrial-sensed activation, atrial pacing lengthened optimal AV delay by 76 \u00b1 6 ms (P < 0.0001) at rest, and at \u223c20 beats/min faster, by 85 \u00b1 7 ms (P < 0.0001), 9 \u00b1 4 ms more (P = 0.017). Mechanically, atrial pacing delayed left atrial contraction by 63 \u00b1 5 ms at rest and by 73 \u00b1 5 ms (i.e., by 10 \u00b1 5 ms more, P < 0.05) at \u223c20 beats/min faster. Raising atrial rate by exercise advanced left atrial contraction by 7 \u00b1 2 ms (P = 0.001). Raising it by atrial pacing did not (P = 0.2). Conclusions: Hemodynamic optimal AV delay shortens with elevation of heart rate. It lengthens on switching from atrial-sensed to atrial-paced at the same rate, and echocardiography shows this sensed-paced difference in optima results from a sensed-paced difference in atrial electromechanical delay. The reason for the widening of the sensed-paced difference in AV optimum may be physiological stimuli (e.g., adrenergic drive) advancing left atrial contraction during exercise but not with fast atrial pacing.", "AuthorKeywords": ["atrioventricular delay", "cardiac resynchronization therapy", "electrophysiology-clinical", "heart failure", "optimization"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85050990226", "SubjectAreas": [["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"35750212400": {"Name": "Kyriacou A.", "AuthorID": "35750212400", "AffiliationID": "60018477, 60024453", "AffiliationName": "The Northern General Hospital, Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57211661160": {"Name": "Rajkumar C.A.", "AuthorID": "57211661160", "AffiliationID": "60010719, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "International Centre for Circulatory Health, National Heart and Lung Institute, Imperial College London"}, "36633100700": {"Name": "Pabari P.A.", "AuthorID": "36633100700", "AffiliationID": "60010719, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "International Centre for Circulatory Health, National Heart and Lung Institute, Imperial College London"}, "6701752579": {"Name": "Sohaib S.M.A.", "AuthorID": "6701752579", "AffiliationID": "60010719, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "International Centre for Circulatory Health, National Heart and Lung Institute, Imperial College London"}, "7003284942": {"Name": "Willson K.", "AuthorID": "7003284942", "AffiliationID": "60010719, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "International Centre for Circulatory Health, National Heart and Lung Institute, Imperial College London"}, "7202298487": {"Name": "Peters N.S.", "AuthorID": "7202298487", "AffiliationID": "60010719, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "International Centre for Circulatory Health, National Heart and Lung Institute, Imperial College London"}, "57023106900": {"Name": "Lim P.B.", "AuthorID": "57023106900", "AffiliationID": "60010719, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "International Centre for Circulatory Health, National Heart and Lung Institute, Imperial College London"}, "6603807270": {"Name": "Kanagaratnam P.", "AuthorID": "6603807270", "AffiliationID": "60010719, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "International Centre for Circulatory Health, National Heart and Lung Institute, Imperial College London"}, "7401765648": {"Name": "Hughes A.D.", "AuthorID": "7401765648", "AffiliationID": "60010719, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "International Centre for Circulatory Health, National Heart and Lung Institute, Imperial College London"}, "7006017382": {"Name": "Mayet J.", "AuthorID": "7006017382", "AffiliationID": "60010719, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "International Centre for Circulatory Health, National Heart and Lung Institute, Imperial College London"}, "12774400600": {"Name": "Whinnett Z.I.", "AuthorID": "12774400600", "AffiliationID": "60010719, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "International Centre for Circulatory Health, National Heart and Lung Institute, Imperial College London"}, "7401512763": {"Name": "Francis D.P.", "AuthorID": "7401512763", "AffiliationID": "60010719, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "International Centre for Circulatory Health, National Heart and Lung Institute, Imperial College London"}}}
