However, in multicompartment mazes, these cells exhibit locally repeating representations, undermining the global cognitive map view of place cells. This phenomenon appears to be related to the repetitive layout of these mazes, but still no hypothesis adequately explains it. Here, we use a boundary vector cell (BVC) model of place cell firing to model the activity of place cells in numerous multicompartment environments. The activity of modeled place cells bears a striking resemblance to experimental data, replicating virtually every major experimental result. Our results support the BVC model and indicate that locally repeating place cell firing could result purely from local geometry.", "AuthorKeywords": ["border cell", "boundary vector cell", "computational model", "field repetition", "fragmentation", "multicompartment", "place cell"], "IndexKeywords": ["Computational model", "field repetition", "fragmentation", "multicompartment", "Place cell"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85042916201", "SubjectAreas": [["Modeling and Simulation", "MATH", "2611"], ["Experimental and Cognitive Psychology", "PSYC", "3205"], ["Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition", "COMP", "1707"], ["Earth-Surface Processes", "EART", "1904"], ["Computer Graphics and Computer-Aided Design", "COMP", "1704"]], "AuthorData": {"55344523200": {"Name": "Grieves R.", "AuthorID": "55344523200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Behavioural Neuroscience, Department of Experimental Psychology, University College London"}, "55164781600": {"Name": "Duvelle \u00c9.", "AuthorID": "55164781600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Behavioural Neuroscience, Department of Experimental Psychology, University College London"}, "6603954642": {"Name": "Dudchenko P.", "AuthorID": "6603954642", "AffiliationID": "60110825, 60027272", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cognitive and Neural Systems, Edinburgh Medical School: Biomedical Sciences, University of Edinburgh"}}}
