Methods: We surveyed clinicians from 46 countries about the availability of NIPT, their experiences with using NIPT, and their views on clinical, ethical, and legal issues affecting implementation in their countries. Results: Forty-nine respondents from 28 countries completed the survey. The majority reported that NIPT is available in their country (n=43) and that they offer NIPT in their current practice (n=38). Eighteen respondents from 14 countries reported that there are plans to introduce NIPT into routine prenatal care in their country. Test prices varied widely, ranging from $350 to $2900, and several respondents observed that high test prices limited or restricted widespread use of NIPT. Responses varied both across and within countries regarding who is offered NIPT and what the overall screening protocol should be. Conclusion: This study provides a snapshot of current use and experiences with NIPT globally. It also highlights differences in service provision that exists both across and within countries, emphasizing the need for developing national and international implementation guidelines for NIPT.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Female", "Humans", "Internationality", "Male", "Maternal Serum Screening Tests", "Pregnancy", "Prenatal Care", "Surveys and Questionnaires"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84943230080", "SubjectAreas": [["Obstetrics and Gynecology", "MEDI", "2729"], ["Genetics (clinical)", "MEDI", "2716"]], "AuthorData": {"56891334900": {"Name": "Minear M.A.", "AuthorID": "56891334900", "AffiliationID": "60008724", "AffiliationName": "Duke Science and Society, Duke University"}, "22135567300": {"Name": "Lewis C.", "AuthorID": "22135567300", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Genomic and Genetic Medicine, UCL Institute of Child Health and Great Ormond Street Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "56890460300": {"Name": "Pradhan S.", "AuthorID": "56890460300", "AffiliationID": "60008724", "AffiliationName": "Duke Global Health Institute, Duke University"}, "36054355500": {"Name": "Chandrasekharan S.", "AuthorID": "36054355500", "AffiliationID": "60008724", "AffiliationName": "Duke Global Health Institute, Duke University"}}}
