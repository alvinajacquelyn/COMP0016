Limited data exist on elite players competing in a world championship, and virtually no information exists on the evolution of time\u2013motion performance over the course of a long tournament. Purpose: To analyze time\u2013motion characteristics of elite male handball players of the last world championships, played in Qatar in 2015. Participants: 384 handball players from 24 national teams. Methods: The athletes were analyzed during 88 matches using a tracking camera system and bespoke software (Prozone Handball v. 1.2, Prozone, Leeds, UK). Results: The average time on court (N = 2505) during the world championships for all players was 36:48 \u00b1 20:27 min. Goalkeepers and left and right wings were on court most of the playing time (GK 43.00 \u00b1 25:59 min; LW 42:02 \u00b1 21:07 min; RW 43:44 \u00b1 21:37 min). The total distance covered during each game (2607.5 \u00b1 1438.4 m) consisted mostly of walking and jogging. The cumulative distance covered during the tournament was 16,313 \u00b1 9423.3 m. Players performed 857.2 \u00b1 445.7 activity changes with a recovery time of 124.3 \u00b1 143 s. The average running pace was 78.2 \u00b1 10.8 m/min. There was no significant difference between high-ranked and lower-ranked teams in terms of distance covered in different locomotion categories. Conclusions: Specific physical conditioning is necessary to maximize performance of handball players and minimize the occurrence of fatigue when performing in long tournaments.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Playing positions", "Running distance", "Team handball", "Time motion"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Athletes", "Athletic Performance", "Humans", "Male", "Qatar", "Running", "Sports", "Time and Motion Studies", "Video Recording", "Walking", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85032816150", "SubjectAreas": [["Orthopedics and Sports Medicine", "MEDI", "2732"], ["Physical Therapy, Sports Therapy and Rehabilitation", "HEAL", "3612"]], "AuthorData": {"7003493917": {"Name": "Cardinale M.", "AuthorID": "7003493917", "AffiliationID": "60106885", "AffiliationName": "Dept of Sports Science, Aspire Academy"}, "16044158000": {"Name": "Whiteley R.", "AuthorID": "16044158000", "AffiliationID": "60105844", "AffiliationName": "Aspetar Orthopedic and Sports Medicine Hospital"}, "7007023387": {"Name": "Popovic N.", "AuthorID": "7007023387", "AffiliationID": "60105844", "AffiliationName": "Aspetar Orthopedic and Sports Medicine Hospital"}, "57196375382": {"Name": "Hosny A.", "AuthorID": "57196375382", "AffiliationID": "101622249", "AffiliationName": "International Handball Federation"}}}
