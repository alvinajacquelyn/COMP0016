Open Access under CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/deed.en)Introduction Electronic healthcare records from the UK are accessible to researchers via several platforms, but these platforms typically include data from a limited subset of health and care services. The Kent Integrated Dataset (KID) provides insight into system-wide health and care utilisation for the whole population of Kent and Medway. Processes The KID uses pseudonymisation-at-source to link patient-level records from services including general practices, hospitals, community health services and social care. Data is refreshed monthly and processes to monitor data quality have been developed. Data contents For each episode of care, the KID includes date of the episode, the type of service accessed, the cost of the episode and clinical information such as the health condition being treated and results of diagnostic tests. The dataset also includes contextual information such as the neighbourhood deprivation. Conclusions The KID is a unique and rich dataset available to researchers who are investigating a broad range of public health questions. It provides system-level insight into patient journeys and care utilisation and supports commissioning based on patient needs.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85064849534", "SubjectAreas": [["Demography", "SOCI", "3317"], ["Information Systems and Management", "DECI", "1802"], ["Information Systems", "COMP", "1710"], ["Health Informatics", "MEDI", "2718"]], "AuthorData": {"56829511300": {"Name": "Lewer D.", "AuthorID": "56829511300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Health Informatics, University College London"}, "55702520978": {"Name": "George J.", "AuthorID": "55702520978", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Health Informatics, University College London"}, "57207582140": {"Name": "Bourne T.", "AuthorID": "57207582140", "AffiliationID": "60111016", "AffiliationName": "Public Health Department, Kent County Council, Sessions House"}, "57205232565": {"Name": "George A.", "AuthorID": "57205232565", "AffiliationID": "60111016", "AffiliationName": "Public Health Department, Kent County Council, Sessions House"}, "57199530563": {"Name": "Abi-Aad G.", "AuthorID": "57199530563", "AffiliationID": "60111016", "AffiliationName": "Public Health Department, Kent County Council, Sessions House"}, "57217271905": {"Name": "Taylor C.", "AuthorID": "57217271905", "AffiliationID": "60111016", "AffiliationName": "Public Health Department, Kent County Council, Sessions House"}}}
