All rights reserved.Steel structural members are likely to be exposed to corrosive environments and thus, corrosion is one of the dominant life-limiting factors of steel structures. Extensive studies on the effects of pitting and uniform corrosion on the strength performance of steel structural members under a wide variety of loading conditions have been undertaken to assess the relationship between pitting corrosion intensity and residual strength. The aim of this study is to investigate the ultimate compressive strength characteristics of steel web plate elements with pit and uniform corrosion wastage. A series of ABAQUS nonlinear elastic-plastic large deformation finite element analyses are carried out on Ishaped section steel girder models with varying pitting corrosion intensities. Artificial pitting of different intensities is considered on the web plates and a uniform loading is applied vertically on the upper ange section. The ultimate load-carrying capacity of the deteriorated models with different levels of uniform thickness loss is also studied. The results are applied to the assessment of the ultimate compressive strength of web plates with different pitting corrosion intensities and a uniform loss thickness by developing design formulae that represent the average loss thickness versus the ultimate load-carrying capacity.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Nonlinear finite element analyses", "Pitting corrosion", "Steel structures", "Ultimate loadcarrying capacity"], "IndexKeywords": ["Corrosion intensity", "Corrosive environment", "Large deformation finite elements", "Non-linear finite-element analysis", "Nonlinear elastic plastics", "Strength performance", "Ultimate compressive strength", "Ultimate load-carrying capacity"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85013641716", "SubjectAreas": [["Engineering (all)", "ENGI", "2200"]], "AuthorData": {"23986036000": {"Name": "Sharifi Y.", "AuthorID": "23986036000", "AffiliationID": "60008783", "AffiliationName": "Department of Naval Architecture and Ocean Engineering, Korea Ship and Offshore Research Institute, Pusan National University"}, "56424013800": {"Name": "Tohidi S.", "AuthorID": "56424013800", "AffiliationID": "60077835", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil Engineering, Vali-e-Asr University of Rafsanjan"}, "35821146600": {"Name": "Paik J.K.", "AuthorID": "35821146600", "AffiliationID": "60008783", "AffiliationName": "Department of Naval Architecture and Ocean Engineering, Korea Ship and Offshore Research Institute, Pusan National University"}}}
