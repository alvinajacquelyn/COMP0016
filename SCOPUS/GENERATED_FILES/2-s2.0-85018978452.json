Recently, a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) rating scale was developed for ARIA-E detection and classification. The aim of this study was to validate the use of this rating scale in a larger patient group with multiple raters. METHODS: MRI scans of 75 patients (29 with known ARIA-E and 46 control subjects) were analyzed by five neuroradiologists with different degrees of expertise, according to the ARIA-E rating scale. For each patient, we included a baseline and a follow-up fluid-attenuated inversion recovery image. Interrater agreement was calculated using intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). RESULTS: On average, 4.1% of the ARIA-E cases were missed. We observed a high interrater agreement for scores of sulcal hyperintensity (SH; ICC =.915; 95% CI 85\u201395) and for the combined scores of the 2 ARIA-E findings, parenchymal hyperintensity (PH) and SH (ICC =.878; 95% CI 79\u201393). A slightly lower agreement for PH (ICC =.678; 95% CI 51\u201381) was noted. CONCLUSION: The ARIA-E rating scale is a simple tool to evaluate the extent of ARIA-E in patients recruited into A\u03b2-lowering therapeutic trials. It shows high interrater agreement among raters with different degrees of expertise.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alzheimer's disease (AD)", "amyloid beta (A\u03b2)", "ARIA (amyloid-related imaging abnormalities)", "immunotherapy", "MRI (magnetic resonance imaging)"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Alzheimer Disease", "Amyloid beta-Peptides", "Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized", "Female", "Humans", "Immunologic Factors", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Plaque, Amyloid"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85018978452", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"55838293200": {"Name": "Bechten A.", "AuthorID": "55838293200", "AffiliationID": "60001997", "AffiliationName": "Image Analysis Centre, Department of Radiology and Nuclear Medicine, VU University Medical Center"}, "8302719300": {"Name": "Wattjes M.", "AuthorID": "8302719300", "AffiliationID": "60001997", "AffiliationName": "Image Analysis Centre, Department of Radiology and Nuclear Medicine, VU University Medical Center"}, "6503880308": {"Name": "Aliaga E.", "AuthorID": "6503880308", "AffiliationID": "60001997", "AffiliationName": "Image Analysis Centre, Department of Radiology and Nuclear Medicine, VU University Medical Center"}, "7102989379": {"Name": "Barkhof F.", "AuthorID": "7102989379", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institutes of Neurology and Healthcare Engineering, UCL"}, "57130251800": {"Name": "Purcell D.", "AuthorID": "57130251800", "AffiliationID": "60112297", "AffiliationName": "BioClinica"}, "16941642700": {"Name": "Daams M.", "AuthorID": "16941642700", "AffiliationID": "60001997", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology and Nuclear Medicine and Department of Anatomy and Neurosciences, Neuroscience Campus Amsterdam, VU University Medical Center"}, "55880140400": {"Name": "Brashear H.", "AuthorID": "55880140400", "AffiliationID": "115315190", "AffiliationName": "Janssen Alzheimer Immunotherapy Research and Development"}, "55879532700": {"Name": "Arrighi H.", "AuthorID": "55879532700", "AffiliationID": "115315190", "AffiliationName": "Janssen Alzheimer Immunotherapy Research and Development"}}}
