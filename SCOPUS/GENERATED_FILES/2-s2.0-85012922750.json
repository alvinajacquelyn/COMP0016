Computational models capable of generating fracture geometries according to geomechanical principles offer a means to create a numerical representation of a more realistic rock mass structure. In this work, the combined finite-discrete element method is applied to investigate fracture patterns in layered rocks. First, a three-layer model undergoing layer normal compression is simulated with the aim of examining the controls on fracture spacing in layered rocks. Second, a seven-layer model with low competence contrast is modelled under direct tension parallel to the layering and bending conditions with the focus on investigating through-going fracture formation across layer interfaces. The numerical results give an insight into the understanding of various mechanisms that contribute to fracture pattern development in layered rocks.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Combined finite-discrete element method", "Fracture model", "Fracture spacing", "Layered rocks", "Numerical study", "Through-going fracture"], "IndexKeywords": ["Computational model", "Fracture geometries", "Fracture model", "Fracture spacing", "Layered rocks", "Naturally fractured reservoirs", "Numerical representation", "Numerical study"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85012922750", "SubjectAreas": [["Modeling and Simulation", "MATH", "2611"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Mechanics of Materials", "ENGI", "2211"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"56999470200": {"Name": "Guo L.", "AuthorID": "56999470200", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Science and Engineering, Imperial College London, South Kensington Campus"}, "7103279783": {"Name": "Latham J.", "AuthorID": "7103279783", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Science and Engineering, Imperial College London, South Kensington Campus"}, "7201546954": {"Name": "Xiang J.", "AuthorID": "7201546954", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Science and Engineering, Imperial College London, South Kensington Campus"}}}
