Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.Purpose: We assessed the temporal pattern of 29 immune and inflammatory proteins in post-acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients, prior to the development of recurrent ACS. Methods: High-frequency blood sampling was performed in 844 patients admitted for ACS during one-year follow-up. We conducted a case-control study on the 45 patients who experienced reACS (cases) and two matched event-free patients (controls) per case. Olink Proteomics\u2019 immunoassay was used to obtain serum levels of the 29 proteins, expressed in an arbitrary unit on the log2-scale (Normalized Protein eXpression, NPX). Linear mixed-effects models were applied to examine the temporal pattern of the proteins, and to illustrate differences between cases and controls. Results: Mean age was 66 \u00b1 12 years and 80% were men. Cases and controls had similar baseline clinical characteristics. During the first 30 days, and after multiple testing correction, cases had significantly higher serum levels of CXCL1 (difference of 1.00 NPX, p = 0.002), CD84 (difference of 0.64 NPX, p = 0.002) and TNFRSF10A (difference of 0.41 NPX, p < 0.001) than controls. After 30 days, serum levels of all 29 proteins were similar in cases and controls. In particular, no increase was observed prior to reACS. Conclusions: Among 29 immune and inflammatory proteins, CXCL1, CD84 and TNFRSF10A were associated with early reACS after initial ACS-admission.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Acute coronary syndrome", "biomarkers", "immune and inflammatory system", "proteins", "proteomics", "temporal pattern"], "IndexKeywords": ["Acute Coronary Syndrome", "Aged", "Biomarkers", "Chemokine CXCL1", "Female", "Humans", "Immunity, Innate", "Inflammation", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Proteomics", "Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand", "Signaling Lymphocytic Activation Molecule Family"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85058129180", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Clinical Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1308"], ["Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis", "ENVI", "2307"]], "AuthorData": {"57200413457": {"Name": "Vroegindewey M.", "AuthorID": "57200413457", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "24172653000": {"Name": "Oemrawsingh R.", "AuthorID": "24172653000", "AffiliationID": "60070226", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Amphia Hospital"}, "6506281877": {"Name": "Kardys I.", "AuthorID": "6506281877", "AffiliationID": "60032114", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Erasmus University Medical Centre"}, "7102815542": {"Name": "Boersma E.", "AuthorID": "7102815542", "AffiliationID": "60032114", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Erasmus University Medical Centre"}, "6602755087": {"Name": "Akkerhuis K.", "AuthorID": "6602755087", "AffiliationID": "60032114", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Erasmus University Medical Centre"}, "57202567488": {"Name": "Asselbergs F.", "AuthorID": "57202567488", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Farr Institute of Health Informatics Research and Institute of Health Informatics, University College London"}, "6602378288": {"Name": "van der Harst P.", "AuthorID": "6602378288", "AffiliationID": "60006027", "AffiliationName": "University Medical Centre Groningen"}, "6507286036": {"Name": "Oude Ophuis A.", "AuthorID": "6507286036", "AffiliationID": "107898206", "AffiliationName": "Working Group on Cardiovascular Research the Netherlands (WCN)"}, "57204957308": {"Name": "Etienne Cramer G.", "AuthorID": "57204957308", "AffiliationID": "60002573", "AffiliationName": "Radboud University Medical Center"}, "7101924829": {"Name": "Maas A.", "AuthorID": "7101924829", "AffiliationID": "60085425", "AffiliationName": "Gelre Hospital"}, "57192719820": {"Name": "Hong Kie The S.", "AuthorID": "57192719820", "AffiliationID": "118075954", "AffiliationName": "Treant Zorggroep, Bethesda"}, "6602729434": {"Name": "Wardeh A.", "AuthorID": "6602729434", "AffiliationID": "121055838", "AffiliationName": "Haaglanden Medisch Centrum"}, "57200110896": {"Name": "Mouthaan H.", "AuthorID": "57200110896", "AffiliationID": "117777090", "AffiliationName": "Olink Proteomics"}}}
