Methods and results One hundred patients underwent CMR and T1 mapping pre- and post-contrast. Myocardial ECV was calculated at contrast equilibrium (ECVi) and 15 min post-bolus (ECVb). Fifty-four healthy volunteers served as controls. Patients were followed up for a median duration of 23 months and survival analyses were performed. Mean ECVi was raised in amyloid (0.44 \u00b1 0.12) as was ECVb (mean 0.44 \u00b1 0.12) compared with healthy volunteers (0.25 \u00b1 0.02), P < 0.001. Native pre-contrast T1 was raised in amyloid (mean 1080 \u00b1 87 ms vs. 954 \u00b1 34 ms, P < 0.001). All three correlated with pre-test probability of cardiac involvement, cardiac biomarkers, and systolic and diastolic dysfunction. During follow-up, 25 deaths occurred. An ECVi of >0.45 carried a hazard ratio (HR) for death of 3.84 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.53-9.61], P = 0.004 and pre-contrast T1 of >1044 ms = HR 5.39 (95% CI: 1.24-23.4), P = 0.02. Extracellular volume after primed infusion and ECVb performed similarly. Isolated post-contrast T1 was non-predictive. In Cox regression models, ECVi was independently predictive of mortality (HR = 4.41, 95% CI: 1.35-14.4) after adjusting for E:E\u2032, ejection fraction, diastolic dysfunction grade, and NT-proBNP. Conclusion Myocardial ECV (bolus or infusion technique) and pre-contrast T1 are biomarkers for cardiac AL amyloid and they predict mortality in systemic amyloidosis.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Amyloid", "Cardiomyopathy", "CMR", "ECV", "Heart failure", "T1 mapping"], "IndexKeywords": ["Amyloid", "Amyloidosis", "Biomarkers", "Cardiomyopathies", "Contrast Media", "Female", "Gadolinium", "Heart Failure", "Humans", "Immunoglobulin Light Chains", "Kaplan-Meier Estimate", "Magnetic Resonance Angiography", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Prognosis"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84923392787", "SubjectAreas": [["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"36569999100": {"Name": "Banypersad S.M.", "AuthorID": "36569999100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}, "16306839900": {"Name": "Fontana M.", "AuthorID": "16306839900", "AffiliationID": "60032819, 60029950", "AffiliationName": "National Amyloidosis Centre, UCL Medical School, Royal Free Hospital"}, "55355501300": {"Name": "Maestrini V.", "AuthorID": "55355501300", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Heart Hospital"}, "57203175810": {"Name": "Sado D.M.", "AuthorID": "57203175810", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Heart Hospital"}, "6506837383": {"Name": "Captur G.", "AuthorID": "6506837383", "AffiliationID": "60032819, 60029950", "AffiliationName": "National Amyloidosis Centre, UCL Medical School, Royal Free Hospital"}, "26534328000": {"Name": "Herrey A.S.", "AuthorID": "26534328000", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Heart Hospital"}, "7403231345": {"Name": "Moon J.C.", "AuthorID": "7403231345", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}, "36647033100": {"Name": "Whelan C.J.", "AuthorID": "36647033100", "AffiliationID": "60032819, 60029950", "AffiliationName": "National Amyloidosis Centre, UCL Medical School, Royal Free Hospital"}, "7003539031": {"Name": "Gillmore J.D.", "AuthorID": "7003539031", "AffiliationID": "60032819, 60029950", "AffiliationName": "National Amyloidosis Centre, UCL Medical School, Royal Free Hospital"}, "7004915734": {"Name": "Lachmann H.J.", "AuthorID": "7004915734", "AffiliationID": "60032819, 60029950", "AffiliationName": "National Amyloidosis Centre, UCL Medical School, Royal Free Hospital"}, "6506002568": {"Name": "Wechalekar A.D.", "AuthorID": "6506002568", "AffiliationID": "60032819, 60029950", "AffiliationName": "National Amyloidosis Centre, UCL Medical School, Royal Free Hospital"}, "35464959200": {"Name": "Hawkins P.N.", "AuthorID": "35464959200", "AffiliationID": "60032819, 60029950", "AffiliationName": "National Amyloidosis Centre, UCL Medical School, Royal Free Hospital"}, "35974110300": {"Name": "Petrie A.", "AuthorID": "35974110300", "AffiliationID": "60013985", "AffiliationName": "Biostatistics Unit, UCL Eastman Dental Institute"}, "7004664392": {"Name": "Piechnik S.K.", "AuthorID": "7004664392", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Oxford Centre for Clinical Magnetic Resonance Research, Radcliffe Department of Medicine, University of Oxford"}}}
