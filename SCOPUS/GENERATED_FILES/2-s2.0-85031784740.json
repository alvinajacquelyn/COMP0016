Photonic integrated circuit technology based on the InP material has long enabled the monolithic integration of tunable sources with modulators and opened the way toward large-scale wavelength-division multiplexed parallel transmitters. In this paper, we present the design and performance of a monolithic tunable 8 \u00d7 40 Gb/s parallel transmitter chip with more than 220 components and state-of-the-art capacity density metric. A generic photonic integration approach was followed, in which the transmitter is constituted from well-developed subcircuits and building blocks, facilitating its design and manufacturing. With the trend toward large-scale integration with increasing component densities and smaller chip sizes, proximity effects in form of crosstalk are limiting further miniaturization efforts. We analyze electrical, thermal, and optical crosstalk effects that are relevant to the transmitter design, discuss appropriate mitigation techniques, and indicate the limitations of the current technology.", "AuthorKeywords": ["optoelectronics", "Photonic integrated circuits", "tunable transmitter", "WDM transmitter"], "IndexKeywords": ["Mitigation techniques", "Monolithic integration", "Optical transport systems", "Photonic integrated circuits", "Photonic integrations", "Transmission capacities", "Tunable transmitters", "Wave length division multiplexed (WDM)"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85031784740", "SubjectAreas": [["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"56288041500": {"Name": "Yao W.", "AuthorID": "56288041500", "AffiliationID": "60032882", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical Engineering, Technische Universiteit Eindhoven"}, "7103274622": {"Name": "Smit M.K.", "AuthorID": "7103274622", "AffiliationID": "60032882", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical Engineering, Technische Universiteit Eindhoven"}, "7003950726": {"Name": "Wale M.J.", "AuthorID": "7003950726", "AffiliationID": "60032882", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical Engineering, Technische Universiteit Eindhoven"}}}
