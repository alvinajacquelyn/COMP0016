CPS often differs in its nature, practice, and learning outcomes from other kinds of peer learning approaches, including peer tutoring and cooperation; and it is important to establish what identifies collaboration in problem-solving situations. The identification of indicators of collaboration is a challenging task. However, students physical interactivity can hold clues of such indicators. In this paper, we investigate two non-verbal indexes of student physical interactivity to interpret collaboration in practice-based learning environments: equality and intra-individual variability. Our data was generated from twelve groups of three Engineering students working on open-ended tasks using a learning analytics system. The results show that high collaboration groups have member students who present high and equal amounts of physical interactivity and low and equal amounts of intra-individual variability.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Behaviour patterns", "Collaborative learning", "Indexes of physical interaction", "Problem-solving"], "IndexKeywords": ["Behaviour patterns", "Collaboration group", "Collaborative learning", "Collaborative problem solving", "Individual variability", "Physical interactions", "Practice-based learning", "Teaching and learning"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85029586991", "SubjectAreas": [["Theoretical Computer Science", "MATH", "2614"], ["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"]], "AuthorData": {"56904209900": {"Name": "Cukurova M.", "AuthorID": "56904209900", "AffiliationID": "60117699, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Knowledge Lab, University College London"}, "35608174500": {"Name": "Luckin R.", "AuthorID": "35608174500", "AffiliationID": "60117699, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Knowledge Lab, University College London"}, "25651815200": {"Name": "Mavrikis M.", "AuthorID": "25651815200", "AffiliationID": "60117699, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Knowledge Lab, University College London"}, "7004321485": {"Name": "Mill\u00e1n E.", "AuthorID": "7004321485", "AffiliationID": "60003662", "AffiliationName": "University of M\u00e1laga"}, "24345016200": {"Name": "Spikol D.", "AuthorID": "24345016200", "AffiliationID": "60007905", "AffiliationName": "University of Malmo"}}}
