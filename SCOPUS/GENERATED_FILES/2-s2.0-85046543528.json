Mutations in CFTR cause cystic fibrosis. CFTR belongs to the ATP-binding cassette transporter superfamily, and gating is controlled by phosphorylation and ATP binding and hydrolysis. Recently obtained ATP-free and ATP-bound structures of zebrafish CFTR revealed an unwound segment of transmembrane helix (TM) 8, which appears to be a unique feature of CFTR not present in other ATP-binding cassette transporter structures. Here, using \u03bcs-long molecular dynamics simulations, we investigate the interactions formed by this TM8 segment with nearby helices in both ATP-free and ATP-bound states. We highlight ATP-dependent interactions as well as the structural role of TM8 in maintaining the functional architecture of the pore via interactions common to both the ATP-bound and ATP-free state. The results of the molecular dynamics simulations are discussed in the context of the gating mechanism of CFTR.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adenosine Triphosphate", "Cell Membrane", "Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator", "Models, Molecular", "Protein Conformation, alpha-Helical"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85046543528", "SubjectAreas": [["Biophysics", "BIOC", "1304"]], "AuthorData": {"57045749500": {"Name": "Corradi V.", "AuthorID": "57045749500", "AffiliationID": "60002306", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Molecular Simulation and Department of Biological Sciences, University of Calgary"}, "28567652600": {"Name": "Gu R.", "AuthorID": "28567652600", "AffiliationID": "60002306", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Molecular Simulation and Department of Biological Sciences, University of Calgary"}, "7004074279": {"Name": "Tieleman D.", "AuthorID": "7004074279", "AffiliationID": "60002306", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Molecular Simulation and Department of Biological Sciences, University of Calgary"}, "56273272300": {"Name": "Vergani P.", "AuthorID": "56273272300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology, University College London"}}}
