This study evaluates the diagnostic accuracy of a handheld terahertz pulsed imaging (TPI) system to discriminate benign from malignant breast tissue ex vivo. Forty six freshly excised breast cancer samples were scanned with a TPI handheld probe system, and histology was obtained for comparison. The image pixels on TPI were classified using (1) parameters in combination with support vector machine (SVM) and (2) Gaussian wavelet deconvolution in combination with Bayesian classification. The results were an accuracy, sensitivity, specificity of 75%, 86%, 66% for method 1, and 69%, 87%, 54% for method 2 respectively. This demonstrates the probe can discriminate invasive breast cancer from benign breast tissue with an encouraging degree of accuracy, warranting further study.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Medical and biological imaging", "Terahertz imaging", "Tissue characterization"], "IndexKeywords": ["Bayesian classification", "Breast conserving surgery", "Degree of accuracy", "Diagnostic accuracy", "Medical and biological imaging", "Terahertz imaging", "Terahertz pulsed imaging", "Tissue characterization"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85020207669", "SubjectAreas": [["Biotechnology", "BIOC", "1305"], ["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"]], "AuthorData": {"55948434200": {"Name": "Grootendorst M.R.", "AuthorID": "55948434200", "AffiliationID": "60005518", "AffiliationName": "Department of Breast Surgery, Guy\u2019s and St Thomas\u2019 NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57219005278": {"Name": "De Koning S.G.B.", "AuthorID": "57219005278", "AffiliationID": "60005518", "AffiliationName": "Department of Breast Surgery, Guy\u2019s and St Thomas\u2019 NHS Foundation Trust"}, "56771338000": {"Name": "Santaolalla A.", "AuthorID": "56771338000", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "King\u2019s College London, Division of Cancer Studies"}, "25932351400": {"Name": "Van Hemelrijck M.", "AuthorID": "25932351400", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "King\u2019s College London, Division of Cancer Studies"}, "25622967100": {"Name": "Cariati M.", "AuthorID": "25622967100", "AffiliationID": "60005518", "AffiliationName": "Department of Breast Surgery, Guy\u2019s and St Thomas\u2019 NHS Foundation Trust"}, "26632662300": {"Name": "Purushotham A.", "AuthorID": "26632662300", "AffiliationID": "60005518", "AffiliationName": "Department of Breast Surgery, Guy\u2019s and St Thomas\u2019 NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57194454277": {"Name": "Young M.R.", "AuthorID": "57194454277", "AffiliationID": "60005518", "AffiliationName": "Department of Breast Surgery, Guy\u2019s and St Thomas\u2019 NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7102904013": {"Name": "Fitzgerald A.J.", "AuthorID": "7102904013", "AffiliationID": "60031806", "AffiliationName": "School of Physics, University of Western Australia"}, "7005737664": {"Name": "Wallace V.P.", "AuthorID": "7005737664", "AffiliationID": "60031806", "AffiliationName": "School of Physics, University of Western Australia"}, "34971916100": {"Name": "Portieri A.", "AuthorID": "34971916100", "AffiliationID": "60102133", "AffiliationName": "Teraview Ltd."}, "55490162700": {"Name": "Pepper M.", "AuthorID": "55490162700", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "London Centre for Nanotechnology, University College London"}, "57192977201": {"Name": "Owen J.", "AuthorID": "57192977201", "AffiliationID": "60109217, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "King\u2019s College London, Division of Cancer Studies, King\u2019s Health Partners Cancer Biobank and Breast Pathology Research Group"}, "7005904555": {"Name": "Pinder S.E.", "AuthorID": "7005904555", "AffiliationID": "60109217, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "King\u2019s College London, Division of Cancer Studies, King\u2019s Health Partners Cancer Biobank and Breast Pathology Research Group"}}}
