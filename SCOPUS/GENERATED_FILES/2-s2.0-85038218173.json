The objective of this study was to examine the association between infection burden during childhood- A critical period of development for the immune and nervous systems- A nd subsequent systemic inflammatory markers and general intelligence. In the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, a prospective birth cohort in England, we examined the association of exposure to infections during childhood, assessed at seven follow-ups between age 1\u00b75 and 7\u00b75 years, with subsequent: (1) serum interleukin 6 and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels at age 9; (2) intelligence quotient (IQ) at age 8. We also examined the relationship between inflammatory markers and IQ. Very high infection burden (90+ percentile) was associated with higher CRP levels, but this relationship was explained by body mass index (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 1\u00b719; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0\u00b795-1\u00b750), maternal occupation (adjusted OR 1\u00b723; 95% CI 0\u00b798-1\u00b755) and atopic disorders (adjusted OR 1\u00b724; 95% CI 0\u00b798-1\u00b755). Higher CRP levels were associated with lower IQ; adjusted \u03b2 =-0\u00b779 (95% CI-1\u00b731 to-0\u00b727); P = 0\u00b7003. There was no strong evidence for an association between infection and IQ. The findings indicate that childhood infections do not have an independent, lasting effect on circulating inflammatory marker levels subsequently in childhood; however, elevated inflammatory markers may be harmful for intellectual development/function.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Birth cohort study", "C-reactive protein", "infection", "inflammatory markers", "intelligence quotient", "interleukin 6"], "IndexKeywords": ["C-Reactive Protein", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Cohort Studies", "England", "Female", "Humans", "Infant", "Infection", "Inflammation", "Intelligence", "Intelligence Tests", "Interleukin-6", "Longitudinal Studies", "Male", "Odds Ratio", "Prospective Studies"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85038218173", "SubjectAreas": [["Epidemiology", "MEDI", "2713"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"57214617932": {"Name": "MacKinnon N.", "AuthorID": "57214617932", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Public Health and Primary Care, University of Cambridge"}, "26021246400": {"Name": "Jones P.B.", "AuthorID": "26021246400", "AffiliationID": "60005210", "AffiliationName": "Cambridgeshire and Peterborough NHS Foundation Trust"}, "24461777700": {"Name": "Khandaker G.M.", "AuthorID": "24461777700", "AffiliationID": "60005210", "AffiliationName": "Cambridgeshire and Peterborough NHS Foundation Trust"}, "6603745740": {"Name": "Zammit S.", "AuthorID": "6603745740", "AffiliationID": "60023998, 60170145", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychological Medicine and Clinical Neurosciences, MRC Centre for Neuropsychiatric Genetics and Genomics, Cardiff University"}, "7402636617": {"Name": "Lewis G.", "AuthorID": "7402636617", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, University College London"}}}
