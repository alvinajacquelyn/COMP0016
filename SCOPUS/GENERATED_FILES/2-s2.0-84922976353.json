Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.Objectives: To cross-culturally adapt and evaluate the psychometric properties of the oral impact on daily performance (OIDP) in Brazilians aged 50-74 years; to test the impact of oral health on 'work' and 'vigorous physical activity'. Background: Clinical oral health indicators do not assess the perceived impact of oral health on people's lives. Methods: The study was performed through small group interviews, pilot studies and a main study with 200 people aged 50 and over. Data were collected through interviews in health centres. Results: For content validity, 'eating' (1.00, p < 0.001) and 'speaking' (0.96, p < 0.001) obtained the highest level of agreement among experts. For criterion and construct validity, there was an inverse correlation between self-rated oral health, perceived oral treatment needs and satisfaction with oral health and OIDP score. Cronbach's alpha coefficient varied from 0.69 to 0.67 when 'work' and 'vigorous physical activities' were deleted. Test-retest reliability was 0.69 (ICC). Conclusion: The validation process showed that the Brazilian OIDP has the necessary basic psychometric properties to be used in the 50-74 years age group in Brazil. 'Work' and 'vigorous physical activities' had low impact on oral health. The activity 'vigorous physical activities' was not maintained in the instrument because of its low impact, while 'work' was maintained due of the increase in the 50-59 years age group in the Brazilian population.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Elderly", "Oral health", "Oral impacts on daily performance index", "Quality of life", "Validation studies"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Brazil", "Cross-Cultural Comparison", "Dental Health Surveys", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Oral Health", "Personal Satisfaction", "Pilot Projects", "Psychometrics", "Quality of Life", "Reproducibility of Results"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84922976353", "SubjectAreas": [["Dentistry (all)", "DENT", "3500"], ["Geriatrics and Gerontology", "MEDI", "2717"]], "AuthorData": {"6603192796": {"Name": "Abegg C.", "AuthorID": "6603192796", "AffiliationID": "60006726", "AffiliationName": "Programa de P\u00f3s-Graduac\u00b8\u00e3o em Odontologia, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul"}, "55626709200": {"Name": "Fontanive V.", "AuthorID": "55626709200", "AffiliationID": "101926298", "AffiliationName": "Servic\u00b8o de Sa\u00fade Comunit\u00e1ria, Grupo Hospitalar Conceic\u00b8\u00e3o"}, "57204336866": {"Name": "Tsakos G.", "AuthorID": "57204336866", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "25121120200": {"Name": "Davoglio R.", "AuthorID": "25121120200", "AffiliationID": "60018777", "AffiliationName": "Universidade Federal do Vale do S\u00e3o Francisco"}, "53881239500": {"Name": "De Oliveira M.", "AuthorID": "53881239500", "AffiliationID": "60101670", "AffiliationName": "Departamento de Educac\u00b8\u00e3o e Informac\u00b8\u00e3o em Sa\u00fade, Universidade Federal de Ci\u00eancias da Sa\u00fade de Porto Alegre"}}}
