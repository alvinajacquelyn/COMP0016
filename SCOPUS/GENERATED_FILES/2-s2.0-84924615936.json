This is approximately 2 orders of magnitude higher than is widely reported for ground state phosphorenes and is the result of the emergence of a new conduction band minimum that is decoupled from the in-plane acoustic phonons that dominate carrier scattering.", "AuthorKeywords": ["2D", "bilayer", "mobility", "Phosphorene", "strain"], "IndexKeywords": ["Acoustic phonons", "Bi-layer", "Carrier scattering", "Conduction band edge", "Conduction-band minimum", "Deformation potential approximation", "Orders of magnitude", "Phosphorene"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84924615936", "SubjectAreas": [["Bioengineering", "CENG", "1502"], ["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"]], "AuthorData": {"56328686900": {"Name": "Morgan Stewart H.", "AuthorID": "56328686900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "6507489017": {"Name": "Shevlin S.", "AuthorID": "6507489017", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "56488383400": {"Name": "Catlow C.", "AuthorID": "56488383400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "57198560184": {"Name": "Guo Z.", "AuthorID": "57198560184", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}}}
