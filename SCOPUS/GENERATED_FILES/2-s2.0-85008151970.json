FB uses external benchmarks to determine whether a measure's facets each occupy unique construct variance. In Study 1, three samples completed measures of dispositional mindfulness and an objectively derived set of construct-relevant criteria. A general factor extracted from these criteria was used to benchmark the measures\u2019 facets or subscales. Structural Equation Modelling, featuring a common latent (method) factor, was incorporated as an alternative statistical procedure, indicating that statistical or methodological artefacts were unlikely to account for the obtained results. Study 2 was conducted to cross-validate the results for a benchmark derived from a different set of criteria. The results support the method's robustness and efficacy.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Dispositional mindfulness", "Facet benchmarking", "Psychological measurement", "Psychometrics", "Scale construction and revision"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85008151970", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychology (all)", "PSYC", "3200"]], "AuthorData": {"54913642400": {"Name": "Siegling A.", "AuthorID": "54913642400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychology and Language Sciences, University College London"}, "36045985300": {"Name": "Furnham A.", "AuthorID": "36045985300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychology and Language Sciences, University College London"}, "6603597461": {"Name": "Petrides K.", "AuthorID": "6603597461", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychology and Language Sciences, University College London"}}}
