Additionally, they raised specific issues with the earlier published results using 3T MRI to perform in vivo diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) based segmentation of the STN (Lambert et al. 2012). Their comments reveal a common misconception related to the underlying methodologies used, which we clarify in this reply, in addition to highlighting how their current conclusions are synonymous with our original paper. The ongoing debate, instigated by the controversies surrounding STN parcellation, raises important implications for the assumptions and methodologies employed in mapping functional brain anatomy, both in vivo and ex vivo, and reveals a fundamental emergent problem with the current techniques. These issues are reviewed, and potential strategies that could be developed to manage them in the future are discussed further.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Basal ganglia", "Deep brain stimulation", "Parcellation", "Segmentation", "Subthalamic nucleus"], "IndexKeywords": ["Brain Mapping", "Deep Brain Stimulation", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Subthalamic Nucleus"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84922331949", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"]], "AuthorData": {"54903227600": {"Name": "Lambert C.", "AuthorID": "54903227600", "AffiliationID": "60029329", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Neuroscience, St George's University of London"}, "17136524800": {"Name": "Zrinzo L.", "AuthorID": "17136524800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Unit of Functional Neurosurgery, University College London Institute of Neurology"}, "7005641179": {"Name": "Hariz M.", "AuthorID": "7005641179", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Unit of Functional Neurosurgery, University College London Institute of Neurology"}, "8984550100": {"Name": "Foltynie T.", "AuthorID": "8984550100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Unit of Functional Neurosurgery, University College London Institute of Neurology"}, "57213639593": {"Name": "Nagy Z.", "AuthorID": "57213639593", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60084279, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, UCL Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "7004536701": {"Name": "Ashburner J.", "AuthorID": "7004536701", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60084279, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, UCL Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "12345539900": {"Name": "Lutti A.", "AuthorID": "12345539900", "AffiliationID": "60023561, 60000239", "AffiliationName": "LREN, D\u00e9partement des Neurosciences Cliniques, CHUV, Universit\u00e9 de Lausanne"}, "6602796230": {"Name": "Draganski B.", "AuthorID": "6602796230", "AffiliationID": "60023561, 60000239", "AffiliationName": "LREN, D\u00e9partement des Neurosciences Cliniques, CHUV, Universit\u00e9 de Lausanne"}, "35400736400": {"Name": "Frackowiak R.", "AuthorID": "35400736400", "AffiliationID": "60023561, 60000239", "AffiliationName": "LREN, D\u00e9partement des Neurosciences Cliniques, CHUV, Universit\u00e9 de Lausanne"}}}
