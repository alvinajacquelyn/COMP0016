They are the most versatile secretion systems, being able to deliver both proteins and nucleoprotein complexes into targeted cells. By mediating conjugation and/or competence, T4SSs play important roles in determining bacterial genome plasticity and diversity; they also play a pivotal role in the spread of antibiotic resistance within bacterial populations. T4SSs are also used by human pathogens such as Legionella pneumophila, Bordetella pertussis, Brucella sp., or Helicobacter pylori to sustain infection. Since they are essential virulence factors for these important pathogens, T4SSs might represent attractive targets for vaccines and therapeutics. The best-characterized conjugative T4SSs of Gram-negative bacteria are composed of twelve components that are conserved across many T4SSs. In this chapter, we will review our current structural knowledge on the T4SSs by describing the structures of the individual components and how they assemble into large macromolecular assemblies. With the combined efforts of X-ray crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and more recently electron microscopy, structural biology of the T4SS has made spectacular progress during the past fifteen years and has unraveled the properties of unique proteins and complexes that assemble dynamically in a highly sophisticated manner.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bacterial pilus", "Bacterial secretion system", "Electron microscopy", "Membrane transport", "Nanomachine", "Virulence factor", "X-ray crystallography"], "IndexKeywords": ["Bacterial Proteins", "Genome, Bacterial", "Gram-Negative Bacteria", "Gram-Positive Bacteria", "Humans", "Type IV Secretion Systems"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85044270776", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Microbiology", "IMMU", "2404"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"], ["Microbiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2726"]], "AuthorData": {"18435241500": {"Name": "Terradot L.", "AuthorID": "18435241500", "AffiliationID": "60023578, 60069761, 60108334", "AffiliationName": "UMR 5086 Molecular Microbiology and Structural Biochemistry, CNRS-Universit\u00e9 de Lyon 1, Institut de Biologie et Chimie des Prot\u00e9ines"}, "56879992300": {"Name": "Berg\u00e9 C.", "AuthorID": "56879992300", "AffiliationID": "60023578, 60069761, 60108334", "AffiliationName": "UMR 5086 Molecular Microbiology and Structural Biochemistry, CNRS-Universit\u00e9 de Lyon 1, Institut de Biologie et Chimie des Prot\u00e9ines"}, "7004804200": {"Name": "Waksman G.", "AuthorID": "7004804200", "AffiliationID": "60009016, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, Birkbeck College, University College London"}}}
