All rights reserved.Background:Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is common among people living with HIV. There are limited data available on the pathophysiology of NAFLD and the development of fibrosis in this population.Objectives:The aim of this study was to investigate the association of bacterial translocation, adipose tissue dysfunction, monocyte activation and gut dysbiosis in patients with HIV monoinfection and NAFLD.Methods:Cases with biopsy-proven NAFLD and HIV monoinfection were age and sex-matched to HIV-positive and HIV-negative controls. Markers of bacterial translocation [lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP), bacterial DNA and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)], adipose tissue dysfunction (leptin, adiponectin) and monocyte activation (sCD14 and sCD163) were measured by ELISA. Hepatic patterns of macrophage activation were explored with immunohistochemistry. 16 s rRNA sequencing was performed with stool.Results:Thirty-three cases were included (\u2265F2 fibrosis n = 16), matched to HIV-positive (n = 29) and HIV-negative (n = 17) controls. Cases with NAFLD were more obese (BMI 31.0 \u00b1 4.4 vs. 24.1 \u00b1 2.8 kg/m2, P < 0.001) and had significantly increased levels of sCD14, sCD163 and higher leptin to adiponectin ratio vs. HIV-positive controls. Cases with \u2265F2 verses < F2 fibrosis had increased sCD14 (1.4 \u00b1 0.4 vs. 1.1 \u00b1 0.3 \u03bcg/ml, P = 0.023) and sCD163 (1.0 \u00b1 0.3 vs. 0.8 \u00b1 0.3 \u03bcg/ml, P = 0.060), which correlated with waist circumference (sCD14 P = 0.022, sCD163 P = 0.011). Immunohistochemistry showed increased hepatic portal macrophage clusters in patients with fibrosis. No markers of bacterial translocation or changes to the microbiome were associated with NAFLD or fibrosis.Conclusion:NAFLD fibrosis stage in HIV monoinfected patients is associated with monocyte activation in the context of obesity, which may be independent of bacterial translocation and gut microbiome.", "AuthorKeywords": ["fibrosis", "HIV", "monocyte", "nonalcoholic fatty liver disease", "nonalcoholic steatohepatitis", "translocation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Bacterial Translocation", "Bacteroidaceae Infections", "Dysbiosis", "Feces", "Female", "Gastrointestinal Microbiome", "HIV Seropositivity", "Humans", "Immunohistochemistry", "Liver", "Liver Cirrhosis", "Macrophage Activation", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease", "Obesity, Abdominal", "Prevotella", "Prospective Studies", "RNA, Ribosomal, 16S", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85063272214", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"57191850567": {"Name": "Maurice J.B.", "AuthorID": "57191850567", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Hepatology Unit, Department of Surgery and Cancer, Imperial College London"}, "57207939617": {"Name": "Wiltshire M.", "AuthorID": "57207939617", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Hepatology Unit, Department of Surgery and Cancer, Imperial College London"}, "36917743400": {"Name": "McDonald J.", "AuthorID": "36917743400", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Hepatology Unit, Department of Surgery and Cancer, Imperial College London"}, "6603756922": {"Name": "Marchesi J.", "AuthorID": "6603756922", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Hepatology Unit, Department of Surgery and Cancer, Imperial College London"}, "57208158618": {"Name": "Thursz M.", "AuthorID": "57208158618", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Hepatology Unit, Department of Surgery and Cancer, Imperial College London"}, "23089148200": {"Name": "Lemoine M.", "AuthorID": "23089148200", "AffiliationID": "60022871", "AffiliationName": "Liver Unit, St Mary's Hospital"}, "22979316800": {"Name": "Garvey L.", "AuthorID": "22979316800", "AffiliationID": "60111785", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infectious Disease, Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"}, "16023392700": {"Name": "Tsochatzis E.A.", "AuthorID": "16023392700", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60032819", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute for Liver and Digestive Health, Royal Free Hospital, University College London"}, "57199371710": {"Name": "Cooke G.", "AuthorID": "57199371710", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infectious Disease, Department of Medicine, Imperial College London"}, "15925729500": {"Name": "Guppy N.", "AuthorID": "15925729500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London Advanced Diagnostics"}, "7403461374": {"Name": "Nelson M.", "AuthorID": "7403461374", "AffiliationID": "60002484", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infectious Disease, Chelsea and Westminster Hospital NHS Trust"}, "56624169700": {"Name": "Kelleher P.", "AuthorID": "56624169700", "AffiliationID": "123888396", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Immunology and Vaccinology"}, "35242224200": {"Name": "Goldin R.", "AuthorID": "35242224200", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Histopathology Unit, Department of Medicine, Imperial College London"}}}
