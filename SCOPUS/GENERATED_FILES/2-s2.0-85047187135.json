An essential part of the fight against mosquitoes is the use of mobile technology to support routine surveillance and risk assessment by community health workers (health agents). In addition, to improve early warning systems, the public health authorities need to forecast more accurately where an outbreak of the virus and its vector is likely to occur. The ZIK\u039b system aims to develop a novel comprehensive framework that combines e-learning to empower health agents, community-based participatory surveillance, and forecasting of occurrences and distribution of the Zika virus and its vectors in real time. This system is currently being implemented in Brazil, in the cities of Campina Grande, Recife, Jaboat\u00e3o dos Guararapes, and Olinda, the State of Pernambuco and Paraiba with the highest prevalence of the Zika virus disease. In this paper, we present the system which helps health agents to learn new techniques and good practices to improve the surveillance of the virus and offer a real time distribution forecast of the virus and the vector. The forecast model is recalibrated in real time with information coming from health agents, governmental institutions, and weather stations to predict the areas with higher risk of a Zika virus outbreak in an interactive map. This mapping and alert system will help governmental institutions to make fast decisions and use their resources more efficiently to stop the spread of the Zika virus.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Big data", "E-learning", "Forecasting", "Surveillance", "Zika virus"], "IndexKeywords": ["Community Health Workers", "Community-based", "Early Warning System", "Governmental institution", "Interactive maps", "Mobile Technology", "Real time distribution", "Weather stations"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85047187135", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Human-Computer Interaction", "COMP", "1709"], ["Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition", "COMP", "1707"], ["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"]], "AuthorData": {"57202116716": {"Name": "Beltr\u00e1n J.", "AuthorID": "57202116716", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Risk and Disaster, Reduction University College"}, "57202114021": {"Name": "Boscor A.", "AuthorID": "57202114021", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Risk and Disaster, Reduction University College"}, "6506790018": {"Name": "Kostkova P.", "AuthorID": "6506790018", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Risk and Disaster, Reduction University College"}, "57193746428": {"Name": "Dos Santos W.", "AuthorID": "57193746428", "AffiliationID": "60021980", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Federal University of Pernambuco"}, "8327557600": {"Name": "Massoni T.", "AuthorID": "8327557600", "AffiliationID": "60003709", "AffiliationName": "Department of Systems and Computing, Federal University of Campina Grande"}}}
