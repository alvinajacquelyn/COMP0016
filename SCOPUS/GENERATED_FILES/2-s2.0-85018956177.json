Previous scholars have interpreted EGG Ware as the product of indigenous potters who fired ceramics in kilns and learned how to make glazed vessels through direct instruction from Iberian ceramicists. We argue that the production of EGG Ware entailed a more complex process of technological incorporation and innovation. SEM microstructural analysis of 44 archaeological samples suggests that these ceramics were originally fired under highly variable conditions. Parallel analysis of five samples of lead-glazed ceramics produced in open firings by Peruvian artisans in the 1980's reveals consistent firing beyond their clays' maturation temperatures. Based on these results and analysis of whole EGG Ware vessels from museum collections, we suggest that at least some of our EGG Ware samples were produced in open firings. In turn, we argue that EGG Ware reflects the creativity of native potters who adapted indigenous firing technologies and experimented with different parameters in the process of forging a new decorative tradition.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Ceramic firing technology", "Cultural hybridity", "Lead glaze", "Peru", "Refiring", "Scanning electron microscopy (SEM)", "Spanish colonial period", "Technology transfer"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85018956177", "SubjectAreas": [["Archeology (arts and humanities)", "ARTS", "1204"], ["Archeology", "SOCI", "3302"]], "AuthorData": {"55909740200": {"Name": "VanValkenburgh P.", "AuthorID": "55909740200", "AffiliationID": "60011460", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anthropology, Brown University"}, "35728879500": {"Name": "Kelloway S.", "AuthorID": "35728879500", "AffiliationID": "60028333", "AffiliationName": "XRF Laboratory, Solid State and Elemental Analysis Unit, Mark Wainwright Analytical Centre, University of New South Wales"}, "55904094500": {"Name": "Privat K.", "AuthorID": "55904094500", "AffiliationID": "60028333", "AffiliationName": "Electron Microscope Unit, Mark Wainwright Analytical Centre, University of New South Wales"}, "6602642230": {"Name": "Sillar B.", "AuthorID": "6602642230", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Archaeology, University College London"}, "6602599769": {"Name": "Quilter J.", "AuthorID": "6602599769", "AffiliationID": "60009982, 60100203", "AffiliationName": "Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology, Harvard University"}}}
