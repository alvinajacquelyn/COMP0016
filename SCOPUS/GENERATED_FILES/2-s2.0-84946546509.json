We find the generalisation of the Hartle\u2013Thorne vacuum metric, the Hartle\u2013Thorne-(anti)-de Sitter metric, and find that it is always asymptotically (anti)-de Sitter. Next we consider Wahlquist\u2019s rotating perfect fluid interior solution in Hartle\u2019s formalism and discuss its matching to the Hartle\u2013Thorne-(anti)-de Sitter metric. It is known that the Wahlquist solution cannot be matched to an asymptotically flat region and therefore does not provide a model of an isolated rotating body in this context. However, in the presence of a cosmological term, we find that it can be matched to an asymptotic (anti)-de Sitter space and we are able to interpret the Wahlquist solution as a model of an isolated rotating body, to second order in the angular velocity.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cosmological constant", "Hartle\u2019s formalism", "Slow rotation"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84946546509", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (miscellaneous)", "PHYS", "3101"]], "AuthorData": {"56247935800": {"Name": "B\u00f6hmer C.G.", "AuthorID": "56247935800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University College London"}, "55015594800": {"Name": "Wright M.", "AuthorID": "55015594800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University College London"}}}
