All rights reserved.This paper reflects on recent social housing developments in Romania. It understands social housing as rental social housing and affordable housing, a differentiation that is not made at the national level and introduces a sub-type of affordable housing, which is little documented in current research and is here termed \u2018self-help affordable housing\u2019. The paper looks at the legacy of socialist housing and social housing before and after the crisis. It makes an important claim that needs further investigation: current social housing provision in Romania overlooks the poorest households. This has implications for the country\u2019s political leadership; the capacity for financial and institutional innovation; and wider strategies for policy integration.", "AuthorKeywords": ["East European Housing", "Romania", "Social housing"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85040042995", "SubjectAreas": [["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"], ["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"], ["Urban Studies", "SOCI", "3322"]], "AuthorData": {"55344078500": {"Name": "Turcu C.", "AuthorID": "55344078500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
