It is crucial in this context that any national and regional policy reform efforts in Europe\u2014designed to increase the efficiency of resource consumption and production\u2014recognise the global contexts that they interact with and within which they are embedded. Responding to a subset of this awareness challenge, we present here a coarse-grained survey of the multi-level global governance architecture relevant to the consumption and production of natural resources. We identify key structural features of global governance that function as barriers to resource efficiency, and emergent responses to these barriers that reform efforts in Europe should continue to build on and support.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85041116069", "SubjectAreas": [["Environmental Science (all)", "ENVI", "2300"], ["Economics and Econometrics", "ECON", "2002"]], "AuthorData": {"36025681000": {"Name": "Milligan B.", "AuthorID": "36025681000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Law and Environment, Faculty of Laws, University College London"}, "57200386872": {"Name": "O'Keeffe M.", "AuthorID": "57200386872", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute for Sustainable Resources, University College London"}}}
