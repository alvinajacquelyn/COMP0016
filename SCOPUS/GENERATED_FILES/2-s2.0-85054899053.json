The effect of the activation time on the water sorption behavior and the physicochemical properties were investigated. Longer activation times lead to a steeper slope of the water sorption isotherm and, due to a higher specific surface area and micropore volume, an increased water sorption capacity. It was found that, after physical activation for 3 h at 800 \u00b0C, the physically activated, nitrogen-doped carbon has a high surface area (>1000 m2/g) and a high water sorption capacity (50 wt%). In a miniaturized adsorption heat pump test stand, the best candidate material was assessed alongside commercial silica gel for reference. At a temperature swing from 90 \u00b0C \u2192 50 \u00b0C, the CO2-activated carbon exhibits a maximal specific cooling power which is a factor of 1.7 higher in comparison with the reference silica gel (429 W/kg versus 255 W/kg). At a more applicable temperature swing, 60 \u00b0C \u2192 30 \u00b0C, the CO2-activated carbon yields a specific cooling power 3.8 times higher than that of the silica gel reference (932 W/kg versus 240 W/kg).", "AuthorKeywords": ["Activation treatment", "Adsorption", "Heat pump", "Inverse gas chromatography", "Pyrolysis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Activation treatment", "Adsorption heat pumps", "Commercial silica gel", "Heat pumps", "Inverse gas chromatography", "Nitrogen-doped carbons", "Specific cooling power", "Water sorption isotherms"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85054899053", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Mechanics of Materials", "ENGI", "2211"]], "AuthorData": {"57057120000": {"Name": "Huber L.", "AuthorID": "57057120000", "AffiliationID": "60020086", "AffiliationName": "Empa, Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology, Laboratory for Building Energy Materials and Components"}, "57204199423": {"Name": "Hauser S.B.", "AuthorID": "57204199423", "AffiliationID": "60020086", "AffiliationName": "Empa, Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology, Laboratory for Building Energy Materials and Components"}, "57204196456": {"Name": "Ubert C.J.", "AuthorID": "57204196456", "AffiliationID": "60020086", "AffiliationName": "Empa, Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology, Laboratory for Building Energy Materials and Components"}, "10041631200": {"Name": "Koebel M.M.", "AuthorID": "10041631200", "AffiliationID": "60020086", "AffiliationName": "Empa, Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology, Laboratory for Building Energy Materials and Components"}, "6602369789": {"Name": "Brendl\u00e9 E.", "AuthorID": "6602369789", "AffiliationID": "106012526", "AffiliationName": "Adscientis"}, "54889214800": {"Name": "Ruch P.", "AuthorID": "54889214800", "AffiliationID": "60029158", "AffiliationName": "IBM Research GmbH"}, "57193333949": {"Name": "Ammann J.", "AuthorID": "57193333949", "AffiliationID": "60029158", "AffiliationName": "IBM Research GmbH"}, "7003795626": {"Name": "Hauert R.", "AuthorID": "7003795626", "AffiliationID": "60020086", "AffiliationName": "Empa, Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology, Laboratory for Joining Technologies & Corrosion"}, "57207953184": {"Name": "Widmer R.N.", "AuthorID": "57207953184", "AffiliationID": "60020086", "AffiliationName": "Empa, Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology, Materials for Energy Conversion Laboratory"}, "55909685500": {"Name": "Matam S.K.", "AuthorID": "55909685500", "AffiliationID": "60020086", "AffiliationName": "Empa, Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology, Materials for Energy Conversion Laboratory"}, "13906085900": {"Name": "Yoon S.", "AuthorID": "13906085900", "AffiliationID": "60020086", "AffiliationName": "Empa, Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology, Materials for Energy Conversion Laboratory"}, "56256681900": {"Name": "Zhang Y.", "AuthorID": "56256681900", "AffiliationID": "60020086", "AffiliationName": "Empa, Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology, Electron Microscopy Center"}}}
