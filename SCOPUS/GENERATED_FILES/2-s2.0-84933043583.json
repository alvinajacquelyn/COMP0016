This article realizes the huge potential of combining the two for high wireless information transfer (WIT) and WET. In particular, to maximize the synergy, the distributed version of massive MIMO (known as massive distributed antenna system, MDAS) is advocated to go with the joint wireless information and energy transfer (JWIET) system capable of both WIT and WET. We present the opportunities in MDAS-JWIET, and discuss research trends in MDAS with several architectures involving WET and WIT.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Distributed antenna system", "Information rates", "Information transfers", "MIMO antenna", "Mobile communications", "Mobile users", "Research trends", "Wireless energy transfers"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84933043583", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"56353255500": {"Name": "Yuan F.", "AuthorID": "56353255500", "AffiliationID": "60009400", "AffiliationName": "Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications"}, "7406720850": {"Name": "Zhang Q.", "AuthorID": "7406720850", "AffiliationID": "60009400", "AffiliationName": "Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications"}, "8882010600": {"Name": "Zhu H.", "AuthorID": "8882010600", "AffiliationID": "60009400", "AffiliationName": "Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications"}, "55243233900": {"Name": "Jin S.", "AuthorID": "55243233900", "AffiliationID": "60107501", "AffiliationName": "Southeast University"}, "56964559900": {"Name": "Huang Y.", "AuthorID": "56964559900", "AffiliationID": "60107501", "AffiliationName": "Southeast University"}, "7404759940": {"Name": "Wong K.", "AuthorID": "7404759940", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
