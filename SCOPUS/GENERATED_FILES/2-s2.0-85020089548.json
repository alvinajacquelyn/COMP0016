However, investigating this question using neuroimaging faces a major dilemma: either the problems do not require major cognitive restructuring, or if they do, the restructuring typically happens once, rendering repeated measurements of the critical mental process impossible. To circumvent these problems, young adult participants were challenged with a one-dimensional Subtraction (or Nim) problem [Bouton, C. L. Nim, a game with a complete mathematical theory. The Annals of Mathematics, 3, 35-39, 1901] that can be tackled using two possible strategies. One, often used initially, is effortful, slow, and error-prone, whereas the abstract solution, once achieved, is easier, quicker, and more accurate. Behaviorally, success was strongly correlated with sex. Using voxel-based morphometry analysis controlling for sex, we found that participants who found the more abstract strategy (i.e., Solvers) had more gray matter volume in the anterior medial, ventrolateral prefrontal, and parietal cortices compared with those who never switched from the initial effortful strategy (i.e., Explorers). Removing the sex covariate showed higher gray matter volume in Solvers (vs. Explorers) in the right ventrolateral prefrontal and left parietal cortex.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Cortical regions", "Gray matter volumes", "Mathematical theory", "Mental process", "Parietal cortices", "Prefrontal cortex", "Repeated measurements", "Voxel-based morphometry", "Female", "Games, Experimental", "Gray Matter", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Mathematical Concepts", "Neuropsychological Tests", "Organ Size", "Prefrontal Cortex", "Problem Solving", "Reaction Time", "Sex Characteristics", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85020089548", "SubjectAreas": [["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"]], "AuthorData": {"36662789400": {"Name": "Seyed-Allaei S.", "AuthorID": "36662789400", "AffiliationID": "60017853, 60001610", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Research in Fundamental Sciences (IPM)"}, "57194429471": {"Name": "Avanaki Z.", "AuthorID": "57194429471", "AffiliationID": "60018934", "AffiliationName": "Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences"}, "6602660978": {"Name": "Bahrami B.", "AuthorID": "6602660978", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "57204280404": {"Name": "Shallice T.", "AuthorID": "57204280404", "AffiliationID": "60012227", "AffiliationName": "International School for Advanced Studies (SISSA)"}}}
