The array of potential inositol-containing molecules is further expanded by the generation of diphospho inositol polyphosphates, commonly referred as inositol pyrophosphates. All eukaryotic cells possess inositol pyrophosphates containing one or more diphospho- moieties. The metabolism of this class of molecules is highly dynamic, and the enzymes responsible for their metabolism are evolutionary conserved. This new, exciting class of molecules are uniquely chracterized by a high energetic diphospho- bound that is able to participate in phosphotrasfer reactions thereby generating pyrophosphorylation of protein. However, allosteric mechanisms of action have been also proposed. In the past decade several disparate nuclear and cytoplasmic functions have been attributed to inositol pyrophosphates, ranging from intracellular trafficking to telomere length control and from regulating apoptotic process to stimulating insulin secretion. The extraordinary range of cellular function controlled by inositol pyrophosphate underline their great importance.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cell death", "Chemotaxis", "DDP1", "Development", "DNA recombination", "Insulin", "IP6", "IP6K", "IP7", "IP8", "Kcs1", "Kinase", "Phosphatase", "Phosphate homeostasis", "PP-IP5K", "Ribosome", "Stress responses", "Telomere", "Trafficking", "Vip1"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Apoptosis", "Biological Transport", "Chemotaxis", "Eukaryotic Cells", "Humans", "Inositol", "Inositol Phosphates", "Insulin", "Protein Biosynthesis", "Ribosomes", "Signal Transduction", "Stress, Physiological", "Telomere Homeostasis"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84865645625", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"], ["Cancer Research", "BIOC", "1306"]], "AuthorData": {"6701885812": {"Name": "Saiardi A.", "AuthorID": "6701885812", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC-LMCB, Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University College London"}}}
