Two suitable features related to the centroid of the micro-Doppler signature have been identified and used to perform classification, investigating also the added benefit of using information from a multistatic radar as opposed to a conventional monostatic system. Very good performance with accuracy above 90% has been demonstrated for the classification of hovering micro-drones.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Micro-Doppler", "Monostatic"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84946053069", "SubjectAreas": [["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"55574564400": {"Name": "Fioranelli F.", "AuthorID": "55574564400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, UCL"}, "36186273500": {"Name": "Ritchie M.", "AuthorID": "36186273500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, UCL"}, "7202821654": {"Name": "Griffiths H.", "AuthorID": "7202821654", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, UCL"}, "22233563100": {"Name": "Borrion H.", "AuthorID": "22233563100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Security and Crime Science, UCL"}}}
