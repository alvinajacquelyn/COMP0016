The modulation efficiency of the proposed modulator can be as large as 1.58 dB/\u03bcm, which is several times larger than that of previous reported modulators. By enhancing the gap plasmon mode and the edge plasmonic effect in a well-designed diagonal waveguide, a wedge-to-wedge SPP mode is strongly confined in both horizontal and vertical directions in terms of a small mode area (A A-0 < 1/1000), which significantly improves the light-graphene interaction. A large modulation efficiency of 4.05 dB/\u03bcm has been obtained after geometry optimization, which is the best values reported in our knowledge. The physical reason for the improvement is explored. We find the sharpness of the waveguide edges has strong impact on the field enhancement and modulation efficiency. Geometry optimization is made to further investigate the enhancement mechanisms and modulation capacities. Our results may promote the development of active nanophotonic devices incorporating two-dimensional materials.", "AuthorKeywords": ["diagonal plasmonic waveguide.", "edge plasmonic effect", "Graphene-based optical modulator"], "IndexKeywords": ["Enhancement mechanism", "Field enhancement", "Geometry optimization", "Modulation efficiency", "Nanophotonic devices", "Plasmonic effects", "Plasmonic waveguides", "Vertical direction"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85047826677", "SubjectAreas": [["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"57155921200": {"Name": "Hao R.", "AuthorID": "57155921200", "AffiliationID": "60117753, 60003970", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of Advanced Micro, Nano Electronic Devices and Smart Systems and Applications, College of Information Science and Electronic Engineering, Zhejiang University"}, "57194158884": {"Name": "Ye Z.", "AuthorID": "57194158884", "AffiliationID": "60117753, 60003970", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of Advanced Micro, Nano Electronic Devices and Smart Systems and Applications, College of Information Science and Electronic Engineering, Zhejiang University"}, "56189026200": {"Name": "Peng X.", "AuthorID": "56189026200", "AffiliationID": "60117753, 60003970", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of Advanced Micro, Nano Electronic Devices and Smart Systems and Applications, College of Information Science and Electronic Engineering, Zhejiang University"}, "57202306083": {"Name": "Gu Y.", "AuthorID": "57202306083", "AffiliationID": "60117753, 60003970", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of Advanced Micro, Nano Electronic Devices and Smart Systems and Applications, College of Information Science and Electronic Engineering, Zhejiang University"}, "57202311205": {"Name": "Jiao J.", "AuthorID": "57202311205", "AffiliationID": "60117753, 60003970", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of Advanced Micro, Nano Electronic Devices and Smart Systems and Applications, College of Information Science and Electronic Engineering, Zhejiang University"}, "57202301041": {"Name": "Zhu H.", "AuthorID": "57202301041", "AffiliationID": "60117753, 60003970", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of Advanced Micro, Nano Electronic Devices and Smart Systems and Applications, College of Information Science and Electronic Engineering, Zhejiang University"}, "56419475000": {"Name": "Sha W.", "AuthorID": "56419475000", "AffiliationID": "60117753, 60003970", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of Advanced Micro, Nano Electronic Devices and Smart Systems and Applications, College of Information Science and Electronic Engineering, Zhejiang University"}, "7201410151": {"Name": "Li E.", "AuthorID": "7201410151", "AffiliationID": "60117753, 60003970", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of Advanced Micro, Nano Electronic Devices and Smart Systems and Applications, College of Information Science and Electronic Engineering, Zhejiang University"}}}
