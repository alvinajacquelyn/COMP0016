In neurology the word is used to describe incoordination of muscular activity associated with dysfunction of the cerebellum and its connections. The causes of cerebellar dysfunction are numerous and impossible to cover in great depth here. This chapter adopts a structured approach to assessment and management of the ataxic patient, with descriptions of the main disorders affecting the cerebellum. The approach used here is clinical, describing how one can sort through the differential diagnosis of an ataxic syndrome in a way that is systematic, robust and efficient. Genetics has a significant role in the aetiology of ataxia: a detailed family history is required, even in the case of apparently sporadic ataxia. Assessment of other systems should include signs of dysmorphism, skeletal abnormalities especially pescavus and scoliosis, skin rashes and organomegaly.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cerebellar ataxias", "Cerebellar dysfunction", "Conditions", "Organomegaly", "Pescavus", "Scoliosis", "Skin rashes", "Sporadic ataxia"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85024873871", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"7202960784": {"Name": "Wood N.", "AuthorID": "7202960784", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Neurology"}}}
