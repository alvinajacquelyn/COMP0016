All rights reserved.Tsunamis have the potential to cause enormous loss of life and socio-economic impacts on coastal communities. Central to tsunami risk mitigation is the protection of critical infrastructure and evacuation-designated buildings, which are often necessarily located within tsunami inundation zones. As such, these must be designed to withstand and remain fully or partially operational after a tsunami. Guidance documents for tsunami design of buildings exist in the USA and Japan, including the recent release of the US ASCE 7 chapter 6 on tsunami loads and effects. This paper outlines the key engineering principles of tsunami design of buildings, summarises and compares how these principles are addressed by US and Japanese standards, and outlines considerations not yet covered.", "AuthorKeywords": ["buildings", "codes of practice & standards", "disaster engineering", "structures & design"], "IndexKeywords": ["Coastal communities", "Codes of practice", "Design of buildings", "Designated buildings", "Engineering principles", "Guidance document", "Socio-economic impacts", "Tsunami inundation zones"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85053913447", "SubjectAreas": [["Civil and Structural Engineering", "ENGI", "2205"]], "AuthorData": {"24758945000": {"Name": "Macabuag J.", "AuthorID": "24758945000", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60012808", "AffiliationName": "EPICentre, University College London"}, "7801656850": {"Name": "Rossetto T.", "AuthorID": "7801656850", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60012808", "AffiliationName": "EPICentre, University College London"}, "57193492325": {"Name": "Raby A.", "AuthorID": "57193492325", "AffiliationID": "60024779", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering, University of Plymouth"}, "6507380260": {"Name": "Pomonis A.", "AuthorID": "6507380260", "AffiliationID": "60112873", "AffiliationName": "Cambridge Architectural Research Limited"}, "12789050800": {"Name": "Nistor I.", "AuthorID": "12789050800", "AffiliationID": "60028897", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil Engineering, University of Ottawa"}, "57016169900": {"Name": "Wilkinson S.", "AuthorID": "57016169900", "AffiliationID": "60006222", "AffiliationName": "School of Civil Engineering and Geosciences, Newcastle University"}}}
