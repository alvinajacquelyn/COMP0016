Sarcomeric components, including titin, undergo an isoform transition to adjust ventricular filling. Many sarcomeric genes have been implicated in congenital cardiomyopathies, such that understanding developmental sarcomere transitions will inform the aetiology and treatment. We sought to determine whether Thymosin \u03b24 (T\u03b24), a peptide that regulates the availability of actin monomers for polymerization in non-muscle cells, plays a role in sarcomere assembly during cardiac morphogenesis and influences adult cardiac function. In T\u03b24 null mice, immunofluorescence-based sarcomere analyses revealed shortened thin filament, sarcomere and titin spring length in cardiomyocytes, associated with precocious up-regulation of the short titin isoforms during the postnatal splicing transition. By magnetic resonance imaging, this manifested as diminished stroke volume and limited contractile reserve in adult mice. Extrapolating to an in vitro cardiomyocyte model, the altered postnatal splicing was corrected with addition of synthetic T\u03b24, whereby normal sarcomere length was restored. Our data suggest that T\u03b24 is required for setting correct sarcomere length and for appropriate splicing of titin, not only in the heart but also in skeletal muscle. Distinguishing between thin filament extension and titin splicing as the primary defect is challenging, as these events are intimately linked. The regulation of titin splicing is a previously unrecognised role of T\u03b24 and gives preliminary insight into a mechanism by which titin isoforms may be manipulated to correct cardiac dysfunction.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Developmental splicing", "Dysregulated sarcomere length", "Thymosin \u03b24", "Titin isoforms"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Connectin", "Echocardiography", "Heart", "Hemodynamics", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Knockout", "Myocardial Contraction", "Myocardium", "Myocytes, Cardiac", "RNA Splicing", "Sarcomeres", "Thymosin"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85008871202", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"15754662200": {"Name": "Smart N.", "AuthorID": "15754662200", "AffiliationID": "60002634", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physiology, Anatomy and Genetics, University of Oxford"}, "57194786909": {"Name": "Riley P.R.", "AuthorID": "57194786909", "AffiliationID": "60002634", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physiology, Anatomy and Genetics, University of Oxford"}, "35782379800": {"Name": "Riegler J.", "AuthorID": "35782379800", "AffiliationID": "60026209", "AffiliationName": "Genentech Inc."}, "35335108200": {"Name": "Price A.N.", "AuthorID": "35335108200", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Perinatal Imaging & Health, King's College London"}, "7004107686": {"Name": "Lythgoe M.F.", "AuthorID": "7004107686", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Advanced Biomedical Imaging, Department of Medicine, University College London (UCL)"}, "57192910192": {"Name": "Turtle C.W.", "AuthorID": "57192910192", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, Radcliffe Department of Medicine, University of Oxford"}, "6603433828": {"Name": "Lygate C.A.", "AuthorID": "6603433828", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, Radcliffe Department of Medicine, University of Oxford"}, "56374079600": {"Name": "McAndrew D.J.", "AuthorID": "56374079600", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, Radcliffe Department of Medicine, University of Oxford"}, "6507034376": {"Name": "Gehmlich K.", "AuthorID": "6507034376", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, Radcliffe Department of Medicine, University of Oxford"}, "6701789888": {"Name": "Redwood C.", "AuthorID": "6701789888", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, Radcliffe Department of Medicine, University of Oxford"}, "54880196400": {"Name": "Dub\u00e9 K.N.", "AuthorID": "54880196400", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "UCL-Institute of Child Health"}, "7801671480": {"Name": "Muthurangu V.", "AuthorID": "7801671480", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cardiovascular Imaging, UCL Institute of Cardiovascular Science"}, "57195810900": {"Name": "Taylor A.M.", "AuthorID": "57195810900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cardiovascular Imaging, UCL Institute of Cardiovascular Science"}}}
