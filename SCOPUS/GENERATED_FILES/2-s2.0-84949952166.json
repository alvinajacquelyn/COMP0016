However, no data for uncharged grains, and thus for the total amount of dust, are available. In this paper we estimate this population of uncharged grains based on a model of stochastic charging in thermodynamic equilibrium and on the assumption of quasi-neutrality in the plasma-dust system. This estimation is improved upon by combining simulations of the dust component of the plume and simulations for the plasma environment into one self-consistent model. Calibration of this model with CAPS data provides a total dust production rate of about 12 kg s-1, including larger dust grains up to a few microns in size. We find that the fraction of charged grains dominates over that of the uncharged grains. Moreover, our model reproduces densities of both negatively and positively charged nanograins measured by Cassini CAPS. In Enceladus plume ion densities up to ~104 cm-3 are required by the self-consistent model, resulting in an electron depletion of about 50% in the plasma, because electrons are attached to the negatively charged nanograins. These ion densities correspond to effective ionization rates of about 10-7 s-1, which are about two orders of magnitude higher than expected.", "AuthorKeywords": ["CAPS", "Enceladus", "Nanograin charge", "Plume"], "IndexKeywords": ["CAPS", "Cassini plasma spectrometer", "Enceladus", "Nano grains", "Plasma-dust systems", "Plume", "Self consistent modeling", "Thermodynamic equilibria"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84949952166", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"57214448971": {"Name": "Meier P.", "AuthorID": "57214448971", "AffiliationID": "60007902", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Theoretical Physics"}, "6701598477": {"Name": "Motschmann U.", "AuthorID": "6701598477", "AffiliationID": "60007798", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Planetary Research"}, "35097499900": {"Name": "Kriegel H.", "AuthorID": "35097499900", "AffiliationID": "60007902", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Theoretical Physics"}, "57204098251": {"Name": "Schmidt J.", "AuthorID": "57204098251", "AffiliationID": "60012954", "AffiliationName": "Astronomy and Space Physics, University of Oulu"}, "6602831299": {"Name": "Spahn F.", "AuthorID": "6602831299", "AffiliationID": "60021763", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Physics, University of Potsdam"}, "57202700910": {"Name": "Hill T.W.", "AuthorID": "57202700910", "AffiliationID": "60005286", "AffiliationName": "Physics and Astronomy Department, Rice University"}, "56984847800": {"Name": "Dong Y.", "AuthorID": "56984847800", "AffiliationID": "60000221", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics, University of Colorado at Boulder"}, "55224172000": {"Name": "Jones G.H.", "AuthorID": "55224172000", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60162133", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Planetary Sciences at UCL/Birkbeck"}}}
