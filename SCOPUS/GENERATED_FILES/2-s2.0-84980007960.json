Introduction: T2DM is associated with impaired skeletal structure and a higher prevalence of bone fractures. Sclerostin, a negative regulator of bone formation, is elevated in serum of diabetic patients. We aimed to relate changes in bone architecture and cellular activities to sclerostin production in the Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rat. Methods: Bone density and architecture were measured by micro-CT and bone remodelling by histomorphometry in tibiae and femurs of 14-week-old male ZDF rats and lean Zucker controls (n = 6/group). Results: ZDF rats showed lower trabecular bone mineral density and bone mass compared to controls, due to decreases in bone volume and thickness, along with impaired bone connectivity and cortical bone geometry. Bone remodelling was impaired in diabetic rats, demonstrated by decreased bone formation rate and increased percentage of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase-positive osteoclastic surfaces. Serum sclerostin levels (ELISA) were higher in ZDF compared to lean rats at 9 weeks (+40 %, p < 0.01), but this difference disappeared as their glucose control deteriorated and by week 14, ZDF rats had lower sclerostin levels than control rats (\u221244 %, p < 0.0001). Bone sclerostin mRNA (qPCR) and protein (immunohistochemistry) were similar in ZDF, and lean rats at 14 weeks and genotype did not affect the number of empty osteocytic lacunae in cortical and trabecular bone. Conclusion: T2DM results in impaired skeletal architecture through altered remodelling pathways, but despite altered serum levels, it does not appear that sclerostin contributes to the deleterious effect of T2DM in rat bone.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bone", "Sclerostin", "Type 2 diabetes", "Zucker rats"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adipocytes", "Animals", "Blood Glucose", "Body Weight", "Bone Density", "Bone Morphogenetic Proteins", "Bone Remodeling", "Cancellous Bone", "Cells, Cultured", "Cortical Bone", "Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental", "Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2", "Genetic Markers", "Hardness", "Male", "Osteocytes", "Rats, Zucker", "RNA, Messenger", "X-Ray Microtomography"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84980007960", "SubjectAreas": [["Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism", "MEDI", "2712"]], "AuthorData": {"57197771733": {"Name": "Pereira M.", "AuthorID": "57197771733", "AffiliationID": "60026530", "AffiliationName": "Department of Comparative Biomedical sciences, Royal Veterinary College"}, "36459508600": {"Name": "Gohin S.", "AuthorID": "36459508600", "AffiliationID": "60026530", "AffiliationName": "Department of Comparative Biomedical sciences, Royal Veterinary College"}, "57190439861": {"Name": "Lund N.", "AuthorID": "57190439861", "AffiliationID": "60026530", "AffiliationName": "Department of Comparative Biomedical sciences, Royal Veterinary College"}, "57190444385": {"Name": "Hvid A.", "AuthorID": "57190444385", "AffiliationID": "60026530", "AffiliationName": "Department of Comparative Biomedical sciences, Royal Veterinary College"}, "6505770225": {"Name": "Cleasby M.E.", "AuthorID": "6505770225", "AffiliationID": "60026530", "AffiliationName": "Department of Comparative Biomedical sciences, Royal Veterinary College"}, "57203200421": {"Name": "Chenu C.", "AuthorID": "57203200421", "AffiliationID": "60026530", "AffiliationName": "Department of Comparative Biomedical sciences, Royal Veterinary College"}, "19640673800": {"Name": "Smitham P.J.", "AuthorID": "19640673800", "AffiliationID": "60009512", "AffiliationName": "The University of Adelaide"}, "57057403700": {"Name": "Oddy M.J.", "AuthorID": "57057403700", "AffiliationID": "60027403", "AffiliationName": "University College Hospital"}, "6602899374": {"Name": "Reichert I.", "AuthorID": "6602899374", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Kings College London"}, "23093374200": {"Name": "Farlay D.", "AuthorID": "23093374200", "AffiliationID": "60102126, 60000905", "AffiliationName": "INSERM UMR1033 and Universit\u00e9 de Lyon"}, "35451303200": {"Name": "Roux J.P.", "AuthorID": "35451303200", "AffiliationID": "60102126, 60000905", "AffiliationName": "INSERM UMR1033 and Universit\u00e9 de Lyon"}}}
