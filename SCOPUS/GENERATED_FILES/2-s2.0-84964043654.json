Given the current lack of empirical research exploring the realities of Making as a school activity, this paper presents an in-depth auto/ethnographic account of 3D printing\u2014currently, one of the most popular Maker technologies in schools. Investigating the case of an 8 week Year 9 design project, this paper seeks to broaden understandings of how 3D printing technologies and practices are shaping \u201cwhat counts\u201d as learning within contemporary school settings. In particular, this research focuses on the experiences of Making within a school context; what is learned through these experiences; and how the process of Making in school feels. This paper highlights three key issues that have been marginalised to date in discussions of Making in schools: (1) lack of pragmatic engagement, (2) affective labour of failing; and (3) mediated alienation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["3D printing", "Design", "Digital fabrication", "Learning", "Maker education", "School"], "IndexKeywords": ["3-D printing", "Design projects", "Digital fabrication", "Empirical research", "Learning", "Research focus", "School", "School context"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84964043654", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["Engineering (all)", "ENGI", "2200"]], "AuthorData": {"57188874072": {"Name": "Nemorin S.", "AuthorID": "57188874072", "AffiliationID": "60019578", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Education, Monash University"}}}
