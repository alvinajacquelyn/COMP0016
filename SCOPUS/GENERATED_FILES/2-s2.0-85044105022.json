We performed global transcriptional, methylation, and functional pathway analyses on serial biopsies of vincristine-treated CTVTs and found that regression occurs in sequential steps; activation of the innate immune system and host epithelial tissue remodeling followed by immune infiltration of the tumor, arrest in the cell cycle, and repair of tissue damage. We identified CCL5 as a possible driver of CTVT regression. Changes in gene expression are associated with methylation changes at specific intragenic sites. Our results underscore the critical role of host innate immunity in triggering cancer regression. By analyzing serial biopsies of vincristine-treated canine transmissible venereal tumors, Frampton et al. show that tumor regression occurs in sequential steps involving the activation of the innate immune system and immune infiltration of the tumor, and they identify CCL5 as a possible driver of regression.", "AuthorKeywords": ["cancer", "CCL5", "dog", "epithelial", "innate immunity", "melanoma", "methylation", "regression", "transmissible", "vincristine"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Cell Cycle Checkpoints", "Chemokine CCL5", "DNA Methylation", "Dog Diseases", "Dogs", "Female", "Gene Expression Profiling", "Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic", "Gene Regulatory Networks", "Immunity, Innate", "Male", "Sequence Analysis, RNA", "Venereal Tumors, Veterinary", "Vincristine"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85044105022", "SubjectAreas": [["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"], ["Cancer Research", "BIOC", "1306"]], "AuthorData": {"35078290500": {"Name": "Frampton D.", "AuthorID": "35078290500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infection, Division of Infection & Immunity, University College London (UCL)"}, "36810409500": {"Name": "Schwenzer H.", "AuthorID": "36810409500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infection, Division of Infection & Immunity, University College London (UCL)"}, "57203626240": {"Name": "Pollara G.", "AuthorID": "57203626240", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infection, Division of Infection & Immunity, University College London (UCL)"}, "55631987200": {"Name": "Venturini C.", "AuthorID": "55631987200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infection, Division of Infection & Immunity, University College London (UCL)"}, "57206517162": {"Name": "Austin R.", "AuthorID": "57206517162", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infection, Division of Infection & Immunity, University College London (UCL)"}, "35509213600": {"Name": "Chain B.", "AuthorID": "35509213600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infection, Division of Infection & Immunity, University College London (UCL)"}, "7403005698": {"Name": "Goldstein R.A.", "AuthorID": "7403005698", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infection, Division of Infection & Immunity, University College London (UCL)"}, "57203616316": {"Name": "Weiss R.A.", "AuthorID": "57203616316", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infection, Division of Infection & Immunity, University College London (UCL)"}, "6701807360": {"Name": "Fassati A.", "AuthorID": "6701807360", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infection, Division of Infection & Immunity, University College London (UCL)"}, "7202998443": {"Name": "Marino G.", "AuthorID": "7202998443", "AffiliationID": "60012753, 60011576", "AffiliationName": "Department of Veterinary Sciences, Polo Universitario dell'Annunziata, University of Messina"}, "8901700200": {"Name": "Butcher L.M.", "AuthorID": "8901700200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cancer Biology, Cancer Institute, UCL"}, "57193033325": {"Name": "Beck S.", "AuthorID": "57193033325", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cancer Biology, Cancer Institute, UCL"}, "27567808900": {"Name": "Kriston-Vizi J.", "AuthorID": "27567808900", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60010269", "AffiliationName": "MRC Laboratory for Molecular Cell Biology, UCL"}, "6603482374": {"Name": "Ketteler R.", "AuthorID": "6603482374", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60010269", "AffiliationName": "MRC Laboratory for Molecular Cell Biology, UCL"}, "55217532600": {"Name": "de Castro K.F.", "AuthorID": "55217532600", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Transmissible Cancer Group, Department of Veterinary Medicine, University of Cambridge"}}}
