This study aimed to examine the potential of human endometrial stem cells (EnSCs) to form urinary bladder epithelial cells (urothelium) on nanofibrous silk-collagen scaffolds, for construction of the urinary bladder wall. After passage 4, EnSCs were induced by keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) and seeded on electrospun collagen-V, silk and silk-collagen nanofibres. Later we tested urothelium-specific genes and proteins (uroplakin-Ia, uroplakin-Ib, uroplakin-II, uroplakin-III and cytokeratin 20) by immunocytochemistry, RT-PCR and western blot analyses. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and histology were used to detect cell-matrix interactions. DMEM/F12 supplemented by KGF and EGF induced EnSCs to express urothelial cell-specific genes and proteins. Either collagen, silk or silk-collagen scaffolds promoted cell proliferation. The nanofibrous silk-collagen scaffolds provided a three-dimensional (3D) structure to maximize cell-matrix penetration and increase differentiation of the EnSCs. Human EnSCs seeded on 3D nanofibrous silk-collagen scaffolds and differentiated to urothelial cells provide a suitable source for potential use in bladder wall reconstruction in women. \u00a9 2015 John Wiley", "AuthorKeywords": ["Biomarker", "Cytokeratin", "Differentiation", "Stem cell", "Uroplakin", "Urothelium"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Biocompatible Materials", "Cell Culture Techniques", "Cell Differentiation", "Cells, Cultured", "Collagen", "Endometrium", "Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay", "Epidermal Growth Factor", "Female", "Fibroblast Growth Factor 7", "Humans", "Immunohistochemistry", "Keratinocytes", "Microscopy, Electron, Scanning", "Nanofibers", "Phenotype", "Silk", "Stem Cells", "Tissue Engineering", "Tissue Scaffolds", "Urinary Bladder", "Urothelium"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84946496672", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (miscellaneous)", "MEDI", "2701"], ["Biomaterials", "MATE", "2502"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"]], "AuthorData": {"25646950000": {"Name": "Shoae-Hassani A.", "AuthorID": "25646950000", "AffiliationID": "60027708, 60171613", "AffiliationName": "Applied Cell Sciences Department, School of Advanced Technologies in Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences"}, "35103046300": {"Name": "Mortazavi-Tabatabaei S.A.", "AuthorID": "35103046300", "AffiliationID": "60112285, 60018934", "AffiliationName": "Proteomics Research Centre, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences"}, "36474145100": {"Name": "Sharif S.", "AuthorID": "36474145100", "AffiliationID": "60027708, 60171613", "AffiliationName": "Tissue Engineering Department, School of Advanced Technologies in Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences"}, "16314498700": {"Name": "Verdi J.", "AuthorID": "16314498700", "AffiliationID": "60027708, 60171613", "AffiliationName": "Tissue Engineering Department, School of Advanced Technologies in Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences"}, "6506900852": {"Name": "Samadikuchaksaraei A.", "AuthorID": "6506900852", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, Biological Systems Engineering Laboratory, Centre for Process Systems Engineering, Imperial College London"}, "7005344804": {"Name": "Seifalian A.M.", "AuthorID": "7005344804", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Centre for Nanotechnology and Regenerative Medicine, Division of Surgery and Interventional Science, University College London"}, "55377941900": {"Name": "Azimi A.", "AuthorID": "55377941900", "AffiliationID": "60019295", "AffiliationName": "Department of Oncology-Pathology, Karolinska University Hospital"}}}
