Under the condition that all the nominal isolated subsystems have uniform relative degree, the considered class of interconnected systems is transferred to a new interconnected system formed of single input systems, which facilitates the decentralised control design. A new term, weak mismatched uncertainty, is introduced for the first time to recognise a class of mismatched uncertainties in the isolated subsystems. The study shows that the effects of both matched and weak mismatched uncertainties in the isolated subsystems can be rejected completely by appropriate choice of control, and the effects of matched interconnections can be largely reduced if the control gain is sufficiently high.", "AuthorKeywords": ["decentralised control", "Nonlinear interconnected systems", "relative degree", "time delay"], "IndexKeywords": ["Control gains", "Decentralised control", "Mismatched uncertainty", "Nonlinear interconnected systems", "Nonlinear time delays", "Relative degrees", "Single-input systems", "System structures"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84995600656", "SubjectAreas": [["Control and Systems Engineering", "ENGI", "2207"]], "AuthorData": {"7403595938": {"Name": "Yan X.", "AuthorID": "7403595938", "AffiliationID": "60010818", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering & Digital Arts, University of Kent"}, "7005642573": {"Name": "Spurgeon S.", "AuthorID": "7005642573", "AffiliationID": "60105111", "AffiliationName": "College of Chemical Engineering, China University of Petroleum"}, "23112052400": {"Name": "Zhao D.", "AuthorID": "23112052400", "AffiliationID": "60105111", "AffiliationName": "College of Chemical Engineering, China University of Petroleum"}, "56510659300": {"Name": "Guo L.", "AuthorID": "56510659300", "AffiliationID": "60013789", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of Science and Technology on Aircraft Control for National Defence, Beihang University"}}}
