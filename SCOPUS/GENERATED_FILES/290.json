This work adopts a social network approach and seeks to explicate the nature of medicine-taking work that people with multiple long-term conditions (LTCs) and their social network members (SNMs) do in attempting to take their medications on a daily basis, the division of labour amongst thesemembers andwhen and why SNMs become involved in thatwork. Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 20 people who had multiple LTCs. Medication networks were constructed and the division of labour in relation to medication-work was explored. Results: Four types of medication-work emerged: medication articulation, surveillance, emotional and informational. Involvement of SNMs in medication-work was selective, performed primarily by family members, within the home. Involvement reflected network composition and/or an individuals conceptualisation/presentation of self. Discussion: Our findings support and extend the conceptualisation of routine medicine-taking as a type of work. Furthermore, we illustrate the involvement of SNMs in aspects of medicine-work. Health professionals should explore and support the role of SNMs in medicine-taking where possible. Future research should explore the implications of network types and compositions on medicine-taking and associated work.", "AuthorKeywords": ["adherence", "illness work", "long-term conditions", "Multimorbidity", "social network"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Chronic Disease", "Emotions", "Family", "Humans", "Interviews as Topic", "Medication Adherence", "Qualitative Research", "Residence Characteristics", "Self Care", "Self Concept", "Social Support", "Work"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84930424011", "SubjectAreas": [["Health Policy", "MEDI", "2719"]], "AuthorData": {"16244261600": {"Name": "Cheraghi-Sohi S.", "AuthorID": "16244261600", "AffiliationID": "60003771, 60170564", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Greater Manchester Primary Care Patient Safety Translational Research Centre, Institute of Population Health, University of Manchester"}, "56339864500": {"Name": "Jeffries M.", "AuthorID": "56339864500", "AffiliationID": "60003771, 60170564", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Greater Manchester Primary Care Patient Safety Translational Research Centre, Institute of Population Health, University of Manchester"}, "57208139121": {"Name": "Ashcroft D.M.", "AuthorID": "57208139121", "AffiliationID": "60003771, 60170564", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Greater Manchester Primary Care Patient Safety Translational Research Centre, Institute of Population Health, University of Manchester"}, "35974812800": {"Name": "Carr M.", "AuthorID": "35974812800", "AffiliationID": "60003771, 60170564", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Greater Manchester Primary Care Patient Safety Translational Research Centre, Institute of Population Health, University of Manchester"}, "37112905200": {"Name": "Oliver K.", "AuthorID": "37112905200", "AffiliationID": "60003771, 60170564", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Greater Manchester Primary Care Patient Safety Translational Research Centre, Institute of Population Health, University of Manchester"}, "7102932453": {"Name": "Stevenson F.", "AuthorID": "7102932453", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL"}, "55339123500": {"Name": "Rogers A.", "AuthorID": "55339123500", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "University of Southampton"}}}
