Study design: We reviewed 63 patients with esophageal atresia assessed for refractory upper gastrointestinal symptoms between January 2015 and September 2017 at 2 tertiary referral centers. All patients underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and pH-impedance monitoring. Based on esophageal histology, patients were classified as (1) esophageal atresia without evidence of esophagitis; (2) esophageal atresia with evidence of esophagitis (including esophageal eosinophilia not meeting the criteria for EoE); (3) esophageal atresia with concomitant EoE. Age and sex matched patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease were used as disease controls. Results: The presence of atopy and peripheral eosinophilia at baseline were significantly associated with EoE (P < .05). Although there was a tendency toward an increased number of strictures in patients with esophageal atresia-EoE, this did not reach statistical significance (P = .06). Higher esophageal acid exposure time and lower baseline impedance values were significantly associated with eosinophilic infiltration (P < .05 and P < .01, respectively). Using logistic regression analysis, the presence of mucosal eosinophilia was the most predictive factor for stricture formation (P < .05). Conclusions: A history of atopy and the presence of peripheral eosinophilia in patients with esophageal atresia are predictive factors for the development of EoE, which in turn is a predictive factor for stricture occurrence. Higher esophageal acid exposure time and lower baseline impedance are associated with esophageal eosinophilic infiltration, suggesting their value in selecting which patients with esophageal atresia should undergo endoscopic examination.", "AuthorKeywords": ["baseline impedance", "eosinophilic esophagitis", "esophageal atresia", "esophageal pH-impedance", "gastroesophageal reflux disease"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85064700800", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"]], "AuthorData": {"56658404100": {"Name": "Pesce M.", "AuthorID": "56658404100", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Division of Neurogastroenterology and Motility, Department of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "55774919200": {"Name": "Saliakellis E.", "AuthorID": "55774919200", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Division of Neurogastroenterology and Motility, Department of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "7003568688": {"Name": "Lindley K.J.", "AuthorID": "7003568688", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Division of Neurogastroenterology and Motility, Department of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "8337607800": {"Name": "Thapar N.", "AuthorID": "8337607800", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine, UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "6602467294": {"Name": "Borrelli O.", "AuthorID": "6602467294", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine, UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "57201575709": {"Name": "Krishnan U.", "AuthorID": "57201575709", "AffiliationID": "60015296", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Sydney Children's Hospital"}, "37034430400": {"Name": "Lopez R.", "AuthorID": "37034430400", "AffiliationID": "60015296", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Sydney Children's Hospital"}}}
