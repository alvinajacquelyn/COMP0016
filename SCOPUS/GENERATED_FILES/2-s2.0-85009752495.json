All rights reserved.It is now mandatory for health, social care professionals and teachers to report to the police all under-18s where female genital mutilation (FGM) has been disclosed by the child or where physical signs of FGM are seen. Such referrals are likely to result in a request for medical examination. New multiagency statutory guidance sets out instructions for physical examination but provides no details how services should be set-up. This review gives practical guidance learnt from the first year of the UK's only dedicated children's FGM service.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Ambulatory Care Facilities", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Circumcision, Female", "Female", "Humans", "Infant", "Infant, Newborn", "Mandatory Reporting", "Physical Examination", "Risk Assessment", "United Kingdom", "Women's Health"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85009752495", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"]], "AuthorData": {"7003317755": {"Name": "Hodes D.", "AuthorID": "7003317755", "AffiliationID": "114148247", "AffiliationName": "Camden Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG)"}, "7006425955": {"Name": "Creighton S.M.", "AuthorID": "7006425955", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Women's Health, University College London Hospital"}}}
