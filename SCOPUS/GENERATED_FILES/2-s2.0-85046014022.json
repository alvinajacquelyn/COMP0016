This change is particularly marked in attitudes towards homosexuality and racial diversity which, as public opinion surveys have regularly shown, have become more accepting over time. This change is often attributed to older, less tolerant generations being replaced by young cohorts who are more inclusive and open minded in their attitudes to cultural others. The paper explores this argument by examining trends in people\u2019s attitudes towards a variety of minorities, including the said groups, but also immigrants and foreign workers. It starts with a discussion of several perspectives predicting different trends with regards to these attitudes. A distinction is made between optimistic ones (i.e. those anticipating rising levels of tolerance) and pessimistic ones (i.e. those expecting stable or declining levels of tolerance). Subsequently, the paper presents trend analyses and an analysis of age, cohort and period effects to broadly assess the explanatory power of these perspectives. Using these approaches, we find that tolerance towards racial minorities and homosexuality has indeed risen across the board, and that young people are also more accepting of these groups than their parents or grandparents and previous generations of young people. These trends broadly support the optimistic perspectives. However, we also find that prejudice has not disappeared from youth attitudes altogether; for a sizeable minority of youth, it has merely shifted its focus to immigration. Not only have unwelcoming attitudes towards immigrants generally become stronger, young people are not always the most tolerant age group regarding this social group. These findings are thus more in line with the expectations of the pessimistic perspectives.", "AuthorKeywords": ["age groups", "immigrants", "Tolerance", "trends", "young people"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85046014022", "SubjectAreas": [["Cultural Studies", "SOCI", "3316"], ["Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)", "ARTS", "1201"]], "AuthorData": {"17434318000": {"Name": "Janmaat J.G.", "AuthorID": "17434318000", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Education"}, "27667606100": {"Name": "Keating A.", "AuthorID": "27667606100", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Education"}}}
