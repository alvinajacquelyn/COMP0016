Quantitative models used for assessing this challenge typically make a number of arguably optimistic assumptions regarding human behaviour and decision making. This often restricts the insights produced to futures approximating a so-called first-best policy landscape. However, empirical studies of socio-technical change have shown that technological diffusion is often influenced by actors and institutions interacting under less ideal, second-best conditions. This paper quantifies these factors in a formal energy model as landscape and actor inertia and employs them for the first time in BLUE, a dynamic stochastic socio-technical simulation of technology diffusion, energy and emissions inspired by the multi-level perspective. Using the UK energy system as an example, the results illustrate how socio-technical inertia may significantly blunt future efforts to achieve climate targets.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Climate policy", "Decarbonisation", "Energy systems", "Modelling", "Socio-technical change", "Transitions"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84996542234", "SubjectAreas": [["Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment", "ENER", "2105"], ["Environmental Science (miscellaneous)", "ENVI", "2301"], ["Social Sciences (miscellaneous)", "SOCI", "3301"]], "AuthorData": {"56381692300": {"Name": "Li F.G.N.", "AuthorID": "56381692300", "AffiliationID": "60084282", "AffiliationName": "UCL Energy Institute, Central House"}, "57204344067": {"Name": "Strachan N.", "AuthorID": "57204344067", "AffiliationID": "60084282", "AffiliationName": "UCL Energy Institute, Central House"}}}
