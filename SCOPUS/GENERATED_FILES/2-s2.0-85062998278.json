However, without tailored analytical tools to evaluate their manipulability, many capabilities of continuum robots such as safe and effective manipulation will remain largely inaccessible. This paper presents a quantifiable measure for analysing force/velocity manipulability of continuum robots. We expand classical measures of manipulability for rigid robots to introduce three types of manipulability indices to continuum robots, namely, velocity, compliance, and unified force-velocity manipulability. We provide a specific case study using the proposed method to analyse the force/velocity manipulability for a concentric-tube robot. We investigate the application of the manipulability measures to compare performance of continuum robots in terms of compliance and force-velocity manipulability. The proposed manipulability measures enable future research on design and optimal path planning for continuum robots.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Analytical tool", "Complex procedure", "Concentric tube", "Manipulability analysis", "Manipulability indices", "Manipulability measures", "Optimal path planning", "Quantifiable measures"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85062998278", "SubjectAreas": [["Control and Systems Engineering", "ENGI", "2207"], ["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition", "COMP", "1707"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"]], "AuthorData": {"56743015600": {"Name": "Khadem M.", "AuthorID": "56743015600", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "School of Biomedical Engineering and Imaging Sciences, King's College London"}, "26422797000": {"Name": "Bergeles C.", "AuthorID": "26422797000", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "School of Biomedical Engineering and Imaging Sciences, King's College London"}, "6701376895": {"Name": "Da Cruz L.", "AuthorID": "6701376895", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60016691, 60022148, 60020649", "AffiliationName": "UCL Wellcome, EPSRC Centre for Interventional and Surgical Engineering Sciences, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, Moorfields Eye Hospital"}}}
