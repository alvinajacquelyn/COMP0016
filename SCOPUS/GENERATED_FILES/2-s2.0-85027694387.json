Children make sacrifices for fairness (1) when they have less than others, (2) when others have been unfair and (3) when they have more than others. The latter two responses mark a critical departure from what is observed in other species because they enable fairness to be upheld even when doing so goes against self-interest. This new work can be fruitfully combined with insights from cognitive neuroscience to understand the mechanisms of developmental change.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85027694387", "SubjectAreas": [["Social Psychology", "PSYC", "3207"], ["Experimental and Cognitive Psychology", "PSYC", "3205"], ["Behavioral Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2802"]], "AuthorData": {"14040496500": {"Name": "McAuliffe K.", "AuthorID": "14040496500", "AffiliationID": "60031117", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Boston College"}, "57210070531": {"Name": "Blake P.R.", "AuthorID": "57210070531", "AffiliationID": "60019674", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences, Boston University"}, "14621701400": {"Name": "Steinbeis N.", "AuthorID": "14621701400", "AffiliationID": "60025323", "AffiliationName": "Department of Social Neuroscience, Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences"}, "12765261900": {"Name": "Warneken F.", "AuthorID": "12765261900", "AffiliationID": "60009982", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Harvard University"}}}
