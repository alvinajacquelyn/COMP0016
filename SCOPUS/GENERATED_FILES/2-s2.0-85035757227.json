Single-sideband Nyquist-pulse-shaped subcarrier modulation (SSB Nyquist-SCM) is a promising signal format to achieve high information spectral density (ISD) in such DD systems. In this paper, we present theoretical and experimental evaluations of a variety of direct-detection SSB Nyquist-SCM system designs, operating at 100 Gb/s per wavelength in wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) metro network scenarios. Through simulations, several receiver-based digital linearization techniques to overcome the effect of signal-signal beat interference were investigated, and their performance compared with alternative approaches, including optical beat-interference cancellation receivers (BICRx) and coherent receivers (both heterodyne and homodyne). Subsequently, experimental assessments of the digitally-linearized DD receivers were carried out. Spectrally efficient (net ISD exceeding 3 b/s/Hz) 4 \u00d7 112 Gb/s WDM DD single-sideband 16-QAM Nyquist-SCM transmission over distances of up to 240 km (multi-span links) and 160 km (single-span links without mid-span amplification) were shown to be possible using uncompensated standard single-mode fiber.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Digital linearization", "direct detection", "Kramers-Kronig receiver", "metro networks", "Nyquist-pulse shaped subcarrier modulation", "receiver-based electronic dispersion compensation", "signal-signal beat interference", "spectrally-efficient wavelength division multiplexing"], "IndexKeywords": ["Direct detection", "Electronic dispersion compensation", "Kramers-Kronig", "Metro networks", "Sub-carrier modulations"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85035757227", "SubjectAreas": [["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"]], "AuthorData": {"56703765300": {"Name": "Li Z.", "AuthorID": "56703765300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Optical Networks Group, Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "55876696500": {"Name": "Sezer Erkilin\u00e7 M.", "AuthorID": "55876696500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Optical Networks Group, Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "57110425500": {"Name": "Sillekens E.", "AuthorID": "57110425500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Optical Networks Group, Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "36192836100": {"Name": "Galdino L.", "AuthorID": "36192836100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Optical Networks Group, Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "7005053644": {"Name": "Bayvel P.", "AuthorID": "7005053644", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Optical Networks Group, Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "7003479201": {"Name": "Killey R.I.", "AuthorID": "7003479201", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Optical Networks Group, Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "36140432900": {"Name": "Shi K.", "AuthorID": "36140432900", "AffiliationID": "60098463", "AffiliationName": "Microsoft Research, Ltd."}, "7006614570": {"Name": "Thomsen B.C.", "AuthorID": "7006614570", "AffiliationID": "60098463", "AffiliationName": "Microsoft Research, Ltd."}, "7401627190": {"Name": "Xu T.", "AuthorID": "7401627190", "AffiliationID": "60022020", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering, University of Warwick"}}}
