Despite this, the potential complexities of the glomerular ECM in both health and disease are poorly understood. To explore whether genetic background and sex determine glomerular ECM composition, we investigated two mouse strains, FVB and B6, using RNA microarrays of isolated glomeruli combined with proteomic glomerular ECM analyses. These studies, undertaken in healthy young adult animals, revealed unique strain- and sexdependent glomerular ECM signatures, which correlated with variations in levels of albuminuria and known predisposition to progressive nephropathy. Among the variation, we observed changes in netrin 4, fibroblast growth factor 2, tenascin C, collagen 1, meprin 1-\u03b1, and meprin 1-\u03b2. Differences in protein abundance were validated by quantitative immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis, and the collective differences were not explained by mutations in known ECM or glomerular disease genes. Within the distinct signatures, we discovered a core set of structural ECM proteins that form multiple protein-protein interactions and are conserved from mouse to man. Furthermore, we found striking ultrastructural changes in glomerular basement membranes in FVB mice. Pathway analysis of merged transcriptomic and proteomic datasets identified potentialECMregulatory pathways involving inhibitionofmatrixmetalloproteases, liverXreceptor/retinoidX receptor, nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2, notch, and cyclin-dependent kinase 5. These pathways may therefore alter ECM and confer susceptibility to disease.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Albuminuria", "Animals", "Collagen Type I", "Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 5", "Extracellular Matrix", "Female", "Fibroblast Growth Factor 2", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Glomerular Basement Membrane", "Kidney Diseases", "Kidney Glomerulus", "Liver X Receptors", "Male", "Matrix Metalloproteinases", "Metalloendopeptidases", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred Strains", "Nerve Growth Factors", "NF-E2-Related Factor 2", "Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis", "Orphan Nuclear Receptors", "RNA", "Sex Factors", "Signal Transduction", "Tenascin"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84957626743", "SubjectAreas": [["Nephrology", "MEDI", "2727"]], "AuthorData": {"56338541100": {"Name": "Randles M.", "AuthorID": "56338541100", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Human Development, Faculty of Medical and Human Sciences, University of Manchester"}, "7101680540": {"Name": "Humphries J.", "AuthorID": "7101680540", "AffiliationID": "60105831, 60003771", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Trust Centre for Cell-Matrix Research, Faculty of Life Sciences, University of Manchester"}, "57119349500": {"Name": "Collinson S.", "AuthorID": "57119349500", "AffiliationID": "60105831, 60003771", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Trust Centre for Cell-Matrix Research, Faculty of Life Sciences, University of Manchester"}, "57119283400": {"Name": "Denny T.", "AuthorID": "57119283400", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Human Development, Faculty of Medical and Human Sciences, University of Manchester"}, "7402349917": {"Name": "Knight D.", "AuthorID": "7402349917", "AffiliationID": "60105831, 60003771", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Trust Centre for Cell-Matrix Research, Faculty of Life Sciences, University of Manchester"}, "57210455073": {"Name": "Mironov A.", "AuthorID": "57210455073", "AffiliationID": "60105831, 60003771", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Trust Centre for Cell-Matrix Research, Faculty of Life Sciences, University of Manchester"}, "6504349393": {"Name": "Starborg T.", "AuthorID": "6504349393", "AffiliationID": "60105831, 60003771", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Trust Centre for Cell-Matrix Research, Faculty of Life Sciences, University of Manchester"}, "7101607625": {"Name": "Humphries M.", "AuthorID": "7101607625", "AffiliationID": "60105831, 60003771", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Trust Centre for Cell-Matrix Research, Faculty of Life Sciences, University of Manchester"}, "9734493600": {"Name": "Lennon R.", "AuthorID": "9734493600", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Human Development, Faculty of Medical and Human Sciences, University of Manchester"}, "7102882143": {"Name": "Woolf A.", "AuthorID": "7102882143", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Human Development, Faculty of Medical and Human Sciences, University of Manchester"}, "55990890700": {"Name": "Huang J.", "AuthorID": "55990890700", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Developmental Biology and Cancer Program, Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "8878035400": {"Name": "Price K.", "AuthorID": "8878035400", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Developmental Biology and Cancer Program, Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "7801544561": {"Name": "Kolatsi-Joannou M.", "AuthorID": "7801544561", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Developmental Biology and Cancer Program, Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "26643015300": {"Name": "Long D.", "AuthorID": "26643015300", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Developmental Biology and Cancer Program, Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "11839425900": {"Name": "Byron A.", "AuthorID": "11839425900", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "Edinburgh Cancer Research United Kingdom Centre, Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine, University of Edinburgh"}, "6701485324": {"Name": "Korstanje R.", "AuthorID": "6701485324", "AffiliationID": "60010887", "AffiliationName": "Jackson Laboratory"}}}
