We review the evidence for alterations in brain structure and neurocognitive processing in individuals who have experienced childhood maltreatment, focusing specifically on changes related to reward processing, executive functioning and affect processing. Changes in these neurocognitive systems have been documented in adults presenting with SUDs, who are typically characterized by heightened subcortico-striatal responses to salient stimuli and impairments in fronto-cingulate regulation. Maltreatment-specific effects in these processing domains may account for the particularly severe clinical presentation of SUDs in adults with histories of maltreatment in childhood. The findings are considered in relation to the theory of latent vulnerability, which contends that alterations in these neurocognitive systems may reflect calibration to early risk environments that in turn increases the risk of developing of SUDs later in life.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Addiction", "Amygdala", "Childhood maltreatment", "Latent vulnerability", "Prefrontal cortex", "Reward processing", "Substance use disorders (SUDs)"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85014318223", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"], ["Clinical Psychology", "PSYC", "3203"]], "AuthorData": {"56177889700": {"Name": "Puetz V.B.", "AuthorID": "56177889700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychology and Language Sciences, University College London"}, "6602910723": {"Name": "McCrory E.", "AuthorID": "6602910723", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychology and Language Sciences, University College London"}}}
