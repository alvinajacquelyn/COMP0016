CRTs were mapped and team managers completed an online survey. Results: Ninety-five per cent of mapped CRTs (n = 233) completed the survey. Few CRTs adhered fully to national policy guidelines. CRT implementation and local acute care system contexts varied substantially. Access to CRTs for working-age adults appears to have improved, compared with a similar survey in 2012, despite no evidence of higher staffing levels. Specialist CRTs for children and for older adults with dementia have been implemented in some areas but are uncommon. Clinical implications: A national mandate and policy guidelines have been insufficient to implement CRTs fully as planned. Programmes to support adherence to the CRT model and CRT service improvement are required. Clearer policy guidance is needed on requirements for crisis care for young people and older adults.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85050975555", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"35311223300": {"Name": "Lloyd-Evans B.", "AuthorID": "35311223300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "57192197210": {"Name": "Lamb D.", "AuthorID": "57192197210", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "56764022200": {"Name": "Barnby J.", "AuthorID": "56764022200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "57203220768": {"Name": "Eskinazi M.", "AuthorID": "57203220768", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "57203222454": {"Name": "Turner A.", "AuthorID": "57203222454", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "7406331085": {"Name": "Johnson S.", "AuthorID": "7406331085", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
