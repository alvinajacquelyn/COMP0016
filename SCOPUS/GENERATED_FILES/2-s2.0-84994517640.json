This previous work has focused on one region within the network \u2013 the Anterior Temporal Lobe (ATL). The ATL responds negatively to concept typicality (i.e., the more atypical the item, the greater the activation in the ATL). To better understand the role of typicality in the entire network, we ran an fMRI study using a category verification task in which concept typicality was manipulated parametrically. We argue that typicality is relevant to both amodal feature integration centers as well as category-specific regions. Both the Inferior Frontal Gyrus (IFG) and ATL demonstrated a negative correlation with typicality, whereas inferior parietal regions showed positive effects. We interpret this in light of functional theories of these regions. Interactions between category and typicality were not observed in regions classically recognized as category-specific, thus, providing an argument against category specific regions, at least with fMRI.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Concepts", "fMRI", "Semantic memory", "Typicality"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Brain", "Brain Mapping", "Concept Formation", "Female", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Memory", "Neural Pathways", "Neuropsychological Tests", "Reaction Time", "Semantics", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84994517640", "SubjectAreas": [["Experimental and Cognitive Psychology", "PSYC", "3205"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"], ["Behavioral Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2802"]], "AuthorData": {"7006481504": {"Name": "Santi A.", "AuthorID": "7006481504", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Department of Linguistics"}, "20434651700": {"Name": "Raposo A.", "AuthorID": "20434651700", "AffiliationID": "60106051", "AffiliationName": "Universidade de Lisboa, Faculdade de Psicologia"}, "54982256900": {"Name": "Frade S.", "AuthorID": "54982256900", "AffiliationID": "60106051", "AffiliationName": "Universidade de Lisboa, Faculdade de Psicologia"}, "6508299903": {"Name": "Marques J.", "AuthorID": "6508299903", "AffiliationID": "60106051", "AffiliationName": "Universidade de Lisboa, Faculdade de Psicologia"}}}
