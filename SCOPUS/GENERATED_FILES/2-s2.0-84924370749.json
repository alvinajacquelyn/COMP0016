In an experimental test of the theory, we systematically change the shape of revealed utility, weighting, and discounting functions by manipulating the distribution of monies, probabilities, and delays in the choices used to elicit them. The data demonstrate that there is no stable mapping between attribute values and their subjective equivalents. Expected and discounted utility theories, and also their descendants such as prospect theory and hyperbolic discounting theory, simply assert stable mappings to describe choice data and offer no account of the instability we find. We explain where the shape of the mapping comes from and, in describing the mechanism by which people choose, explain why the shape depends on the distribution of gains, losses, risks, and delays in the environment.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Decision by sampling", "Decision under delay", "Decision under risk", "Delay discounting", "Intertemporal choice", "Probability weighting", "Range frequency theory", "Risky choice", "Stable preferences", "Subjective probability", "Temporal discounting", "Utility"], "IndexKeywords": ["Decision under delay", "Delay discounting", "Frequency theory", "Inter-temporal choices", "Probability weighting", "Risky choice", "Stable preferences", "Subjective probability", "Temporal discounting", "Utility"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84924370749", "SubjectAreas": [["Strategy and Management", "BUSI", "1408"], ["Management Science and Operations Research", "DECI", "1803"]], "AuthorData": {"7102195176": {"Name": "Stewart N.", "AuthorID": "7102195176", "AffiliationID": "60022020", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, University of Warwick"}, "8716105700": {"Name": "Reimers S.", "AuthorID": "8716105700", "AffiliationID": "60025704", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, City University London"}, "25649406700": {"Name": "Harris A.", "AuthorID": "25649406700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cognitive, Perceptual and Brain Sciences, University College London"}}}
