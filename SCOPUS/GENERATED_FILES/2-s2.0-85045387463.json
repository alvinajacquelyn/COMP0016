In this study, we report the growth of MoS2 nanosheets on the surface of uniform hollow carbon spheres (HCS) to form a hydrangea-like nanocomposite. The HCS were formed through carbonization of a phenol formaldehyde template, and the MoS2 nanosheets were grown on the HCS surfaces through a hydrothermal method. The nanocomposites have the advantages of significantly improved electrical conductivity, ease of varying the MoS2 loading, and minimizing stacking of MoS2 nanosheets, which are manifested by their remarkably improved HER performance. The well-tuned carbon-MoS2 composite shows a Tafel slope of 48.9 mV dec-1, an onset potential of -0.079 V (vs reversible hydrogen electrode), and an overpotential of 126 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm-2 after 1000 potential cycles.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85045387463", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"]], "AuthorData": {"56193117100": {"Name": "Li W.", "AuthorID": "56193117100", "AffiliationID": "60020420", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, American University"}, "7201837038": {"Name": "Zou S.", "AuthorID": "7201837038", "AffiliationID": "60020420", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, American University"}, "56150320000": {"Name": "Zhang Z.", "AuthorID": "56150320000", "AffiliationID": "60013983", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Materials Science, Center of Super-Diamond and Advanced Films (COSDAF), City University of Hong Kong"}, "37070726100": {"Name": "Zhang W.", "AuthorID": "37070726100", "AffiliationID": "60013983", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Materials Science, Center of Super-Diamond and Advanced Films (COSDAF), City University of Hong Kong"}}}
