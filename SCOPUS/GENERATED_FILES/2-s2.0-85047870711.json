A simple Cox's proportional hazards regression model was used to assess the association of several potential prognostic factors with survival. Postoperative HR-QoL was assessed with the EORTC (European Organisation for the Research and Treatment of Cancer) QLQ-C30 questionnaire version 3.0. Final pathological tumour stages in PC specimen were: pT0: 18.5%, non-MIBC: 3.7%, MIBC: 74.1%, pCIS: 14.8%. Estimated 5-year overall- and progression-free survival rates were 53.7% and 62.1%. Five (18.5%) patients experienced local recurrence with MIBC. Overall, the salvage cystectomy rate was 18.5%. The 90-day mortality rate was 0%. Significant risk factors for progression-free survival were vascular invasion (HR 5.33) and tumour multilocularity (HR 4.5) in the PC specimen, and a ureteric reimplantation during PC (HR 4.53). The rates of intraoperative complications, 30- and 90-day major complications were 7.4%, respectively and 14.8% for overall long-term complications. Postoperatively, median (IQR) global health status and QoL in our PC cohort was 79.2 (52.1-97.9). Open PC can provide adequate cancer control of MIBC with good HR-QoL in highly selected cases. Open PC can lead to long-term bladder preservation and shows an acceptable rate of severe perioperative complications, even in highly comorbid patients.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Cystectomy", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Muscles", "Neoplasm Invasiveness", "Palliative Care", "Postoperative Complications", "Quality of Life", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "Survival Analysis", "Treatment Outcome", "Urinary Bladder Neoplasms"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85047870711", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"25653800300": {"Name": "Ebbing J.", "AuthorID": "25653800300", "AffiliationID": "60019295", "AffiliationName": "Karolinska University Hospital, Department of Urology, Solna"}, "57202320399": {"Name": "Heckmann R.C.", "AuthorID": "57202320399", "AffiliationID": "60026245", "AffiliationName": "Charit\u00e9 - University Hospital, Department of Urology"}, "35473506500": {"Name": "Seifert H.H.", "AuthorID": "35473506500", "AffiliationID": "60028287", "AffiliationName": "University Hospital Basel, Urological University Clinic Basel-Liestal"}, "6603337867": {"Name": "Ardelt P.", "AuthorID": "6603337867", "AffiliationID": "60028287", "AffiliationName": "University Hospital Basel, Urological University Clinic Basel-Liestal"}, "56060748700": {"Name": "Wetterauer C.", "AuthorID": "56060748700", "AffiliationID": "60028287", "AffiliationName": "University Hospital Basel, Urological University Clinic Basel-Liestal"}, "7404256454": {"Name": "Miller K.", "AuthorID": "7404256454", "AffiliationID": "60026245", "AffiliationName": "Charit\u00e9 - University Hospital, Department of Urology"}, "25645970900": {"Name": "Friedersdorff F.", "AuthorID": "25645970900", "AffiliationID": "60026245", "AffiliationName": "Charit\u00e9 - University Hospital, Department of Urology"}, "35821688100": {"Name": "Fuller T.F.", "AuthorID": "35821688100", "AffiliationID": "60026245", "AffiliationName": "Charit\u00e9 - University Hospital, Department of Urology"}, "35091013900": {"Name": "Busch J.", "AuthorID": "35091013900", "AffiliationID": "60026245", "AffiliationName": "Charit\u00e9 - University Hospital, Department of Urology"}, "14067297900": {"Name": "Kempkensteffen C.", "AuthorID": "14067297900", "AffiliationID": "106945171", "AffiliationName": "Franziskus Hospital Berlin, Department of Urology"}, "7404950765": {"Name": "Collins J.W.", "AuthorID": "7404950765", "AffiliationID": "60019295, 60012311", "AffiliationName": "Karolinska Institutet, Department of Molecular Medicine and Surgery (MMK), Karolinska University Hospital, Solna"}, "55050239600": {"Name": "Erber B.", "AuthorID": "55050239600", "AffiliationID": "60075677", "AffiliationName": "Vivantes Hospital Am Urban, Department of Urology"}, "7004469810": {"Name": "Hosseini A.", "AuthorID": "7004469810", "AffiliationID": "60019295", "AffiliationName": "Karolinska University Hospital, Department of Urology, Solna"}, "34874870300": {"Name": "Jentzmik F.", "AuthorID": "34874870300", "AffiliationID": "108234093", "AffiliationName": "Oberschwaben Clinic, Hospital St. Elisabeth, Department of Urology"}}}
