However, efforts to establish this insight into the connection between dysfunctional beliefs and the consequences of having them (i.e., B\u2013C connection) are often met with resistance. To address this issue in practice, therapists can draw upon certain existential principles underpinning CBT theory. More specifically, practitioners can use the concepts of existential freedom and responsibility, contained in the rational-humanistic view of rational-emotive behavior therapy, to complement current disputation strategies in the object to establish the B\u2013C connection and, importantly, to facilitate cognitive change. Employing in practice what is postulated in theory in such cases is apt to provide individuals with a larger context of human agency in which to consider cognitive mediation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["B\u2013C connection", "Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)", "Cognitive change", "Existentialism", "Humanism", "Rational-emotive behavior therapy (REBT)", "Strategies"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85056453259", "SubjectAreas": [["Experimental and Cognitive Psychology", "PSYC", "3205"], ["Clinical Psychology", "PSYC", "3203"]], "AuthorData": {"57204634037": {"Name": "Crum J.", "AuthorID": "57204634037", "AffiliationID": "60109771, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, University College London"}}}
