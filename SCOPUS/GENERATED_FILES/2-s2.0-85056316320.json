Methods We included 36 \u03b2-amyloid-positive (by CSF or PET) APOEe2 carriers (all e2/e3) with mild cognitive impairment or dementia due to Alzheimer disease who were matched for age and diagnosis (ratio 1:2) to APOEe3 homozygotes and APOEe4 carriers (70% e3/e4 and 30% e4/e4). We assessed neuropsychological performance across 4 cognitive domains (memory, attention, executive, and language functions), performed voxelwise and region of interest analyses of gray matter atrophy on T1-weighted MRI, used fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images to automatically quantify white matter hyperintensity volumes, and assessed T2-weighted images to identify microbleeds. Differences in cognitive domain scores, atrophy, and white matter hyperintensities between e2 carriers, e3 homozygotes, and e4 carriers were assessed using analysis of variance analyses, and Pearson \u03c72 tests were used to examine differences in prevalence of microbleeds. Results We found that e2 carriers performed worse on nonmemory domains compared to both e3 homozygotes and e4 carriers but better on memory compared to e4 carriers. Voxelwise T1-weighted MRI analyses showed asymmetric (left > right) temporoparietal-predominant atrophy with subtly less involvement of medial-temporal structures in e2 carriers compared to e4 carriers. Finally, e2 carriers had larger total white matter hyperintensity volumes compared to e4 carriers (mean 10.4 vs 7.3 mL) and a higher prevalence of microbleeds compared to e3 homozygotes (37.5% vs 18.3%). Conclusion APOEe2 carriers who develop Alzheimer disease despite carrying the protective allele display a nonamnestic clinical phenotype with more severe small vessel disease.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Alzheimer Disease", "Apolipoprotein E2", "Atrophy", "Brain", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Female", "Genotype", "Heterozygote", "Humans", "Male", "Microvessels", "Middle Aged", "Phenotype"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85056316320", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"57204678974": {"Name": "Groot C.", "AuthorID": "57204678974", "AffiliationID": "120988103", "AffiliationName": "Radiology and Nuclear Medicine"}, "57204745168": {"Name": "Scheltens P.", "AuthorID": "57204745168", "AffiliationID": "122832820", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Neurology and Alzheimer Center"}, "57204743974": {"Name": "Van Der Flier W.M.", "AuthorID": "57204743974", "AffiliationID": "60001997", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Chemistry, VU University Medical Center, Neuroscience Campus Amsterdam, Epidemiology and Biostatistics"}, "40462134000": {"Name": "Ossenkoppele R.", "AuthorID": "40462134000", "AffiliationID": "60029170", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Memory Research Unit, Lund University"}, "7102989379": {"Name": "Barkhof F.", "AuthorID": "7102989379", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institutes of Neurology and Healthcare Engineering, University College London"}, "57208893449": {"Name": "Van Berckel B.N.M.", "AuthorID": "57208893449", "AffiliationID": "120988103", "AffiliationName": "Radiology and Nuclear Medicine"}, "57210241893": {"Name": "Teunissen C.E.", "AuthorID": "57210241893", "AffiliationID": "121144832", "AffiliationName": "Neurochemistry Lab and Biobank"}, "56198868700": {"Name": "Sudre C.H.", "AuthorID": "56198868700", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, Centre for Medical Image Computing, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "16305669100": {"Name": "Seo S.W.", "AuthorID": "16305669100", "AffiliationID": "60007511", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical ResearchDesign and Evaluation, Sungkyunkwan University, SAIHST"}, "57204636980": {"Name": "Cardoso M.J.", "AuthorID": "57204636980", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, Centre for Medical Image Computing, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "6602233595": {"Name": "Ourselin S.", "AuthorID": "6602233595", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, Centre for Medical Image Computing, UCL Institute of Neurology"}}}
