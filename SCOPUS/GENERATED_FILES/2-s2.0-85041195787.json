The effect of polystyrene graft length, on DBCE, on the binding behavior of Gd3+ and UO22+ is investigated for the first time. Our simulation results demonstrate that the binding of Gd3+ and UO22+ onto the oxygens of crown ethers is favorable for polystyrene grafted crown ether in the organic solvents OCT and NB. The metal ion binding free energy (\u0394GBinding) in different solvent environments is calculated using the thermodynamic integration (TI) method. \u0394GBinding becomes more favorable in both solvents, NB and OCT, with an increase in the polystyrene monomer length. The metal ion transferability from an aqueous phase to an organic phase is estimated by calculating transfer free-energy calculations (\u0394GTransfer). \u0394GTransfer is significantly favorable for both Gd3+ and UO22+ for the transfer from the aqueous phase to the organic phase (i.e., NB and OCT) via ion-complexation to DBCE with an increase in polystyrene length. The partition coefficient (log P) values for Gd3+ and UO22+ show a 5-fold increase in separation capacity with polystyrene grafted DBCE. We corroborate the observed behavior by further analyzing the structural and dynamical properties of the ions in different phases.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Atomistic molecular dynamics", "Dibenzo crown ethers", "Different solvents", "Dynamical properties", "Free-energy calculations", "Partition coefficient", "Separation capacity", "Thermodynamic integration methods"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85041195787", "SubjectAreas": [["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"], ["Surfaces, Coatings and Films", "MATE", "2508"], ["Materials Chemistry", "MATE", "2505"]], "AuthorData": {"55794102700": {"Name": "Sappidi P.", "AuthorID": "55794102700", "AffiliationID": "60021988", "AffiliationName": "Computational Nano Science Laboratory, Department of Chemical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kanpur"}, "56394620800": {"Name": "Namsani S.", "AuthorID": "56394620800", "AffiliationID": "60021988", "AffiliationName": "Computational Nano Science Laboratory, Department of Chemical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kanpur"}, "14421812300": {"Name": "Singh J.", "AuthorID": "14421812300", "AffiliationID": "60021988", "AffiliationName": "Computational Nano Science Laboratory, Department of Chemical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kanpur"}, "55447108100": {"Name": "Ali S.", "AuthorID": "55447108100", "AffiliationID": "60033473", "AffiliationName": "Chemical Engineering Division, Bhabha Atomic Research Center"}}}
