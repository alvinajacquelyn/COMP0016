Areas covered: Studies conducted between January 2003 and December 2015 that reported on LPS and open surgery (OPS) were reviewed. The primary outcomes were the rate of post-operative complications and the length of hospital stay (LoS) after laparoscopic and open surgical resection. The rate of recurrence was the secondary outcome. Eleven studies were included with a total of 907 pancreatic resections for PNENs, of whom, 298 (32.8%) underwent LPS and 609 (67.2%) underwent open surgery. LPS resulted in a significantly shorter LoS (p < 0.0001) and lower blood loss (p < 0.0001). The meta-analysis did not show any significant difference in the pancreatic fistula rate, recurrence rate or post-operative mortality between the two groups. Expert commentary: LPS is a safe approach even for PNENs and it is associated with a shorter LoS.", "AuthorKeywords": ["laparoscopic pancreatic resection", "laparoscopy", "minimally invasive surgery", "neuroendocrine neoplasms", "Pancreatic surgery"], "IndexKeywords": ["Blood Loss, Surgical", "Chi-Square Distribution", "Humans", "Laparoscopy", "Length of Stay", "Neoplasm Recurrence, Local", "Neuroendocrine Tumors", "Odds Ratio", "Pancreatectomy", "Pancreatic Fistula", "Pancreatic Neoplasms", "Risk Factors", "Time Factors", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85004072353", "SubjectAreas": [["Hepatology", "MEDI", "2721"], ["Gastroenterology", "MEDI", "2715"]], "AuthorData": {"37032225200": {"Name": "Tamburrino D.", "AuthorID": "37032225200", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "HPB and Liver Transplant Surgery, Royal Free Hospital, NHS Foundation Trust"}, "25629557900": {"Name": "Fusai G.K.", "AuthorID": "25629557900", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "HPB and Liver Transplant Surgery, Royal Free Hospital, NHS Foundation Trust"}, "16687107300": {"Name": "Partelli S.", "AuthorID": "16687107300", "AffiliationID": "60009622, 60082964", "AffiliationName": "Pancreatic surgery Unit, Pancreas Translational & Clinical Research Center\u2013IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, \u2018Vita e Salute\u2019 University"}, "13609634500": {"Name": "Crippa S.", "AuthorID": "13609634500", "AffiliationID": "60009622, 60082964", "AffiliationName": "Pancreatic surgery Unit, Pancreas Translational & Clinical Research Center\u2013IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, \u2018Vita e Salute\u2019 University"}, "55981895500": {"Name": "Muffatti F.", "AuthorID": "55981895500", "AffiliationID": "60009622, 60082964", "AffiliationName": "Pancreatic surgery Unit, Pancreas Translational & Clinical Research Center\u2013IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, \u2018Vita e Salute\u2019 University"}, "57192311228": {"Name": "Perali C.", "AuthorID": "57192311228", "AffiliationID": "60009622, 60082964", "AffiliationName": "Pancreatic surgery Unit, Pancreas Translational & Clinical Research Center\u2013IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, \u2018Vita e Salute\u2019 University"}, "7006841625": {"Name": "Falconi M.", "AuthorID": "7006841625", "AffiliationID": "60009622, 60082964", "AffiliationName": "Pancreatic surgery Unit, Pancreas Translational & Clinical Research Center\u2013IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, \u2018Vita e Salute\u2019 University"}, "55532127600": {"Name": "Renzi C.", "AuthorID": "55532127600", "AffiliationID": "60003003", "AffiliationName": "Department of General and Oncologic Surgery, University of Perugia, St. Mary\u2019s Hospital"}, "7004106437": {"Name": "Cirocchi R.", "AuthorID": "7004106437", "AffiliationID": "60003003", "AffiliationName": "Department of General and Oncologic Surgery, University of Perugia, St. Mary\u2019s Hospital"}, "55260708600": {"Name": "Parisi A.", "AuthorID": "55260708600", "AffiliationID": "60003003", "AffiliationName": "Department of Digestive Surgery, University of Perugia, St. Mary\u2019s Hospital"}, "14060743300": {"Name": "Randolph J.", "AuthorID": "14060743300", "AffiliationID": "60013143", "AffiliationName": "Tift College of Education, Mercer University"}}}
