Herein, we present a reproducible and potentially scalable microwave-based method to make stable citric acid coated multi-core iron oxide nanoparticles, with exceptional magnetic heating parameters, viz. intrinsic loss parameters (ILPs) of up to 4.1 nH m2 kg-1, 35% better than the best commercial equivalents. We also probe the core-to-core magnetic interactions in the particles via remanence-derived Henkel and \u0394M plots. These reveal a monotonic dependence of the ILP on the magnetic interaction field Hint, and show that the interactions are demagnetising in nature, and act to hinder the magnetic heating mechanism.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Core interactions", "Iron oxide nanoparticle", "Magnetic heating", "Magnetic hyperthermia", "Magnetic interactions", "Microwave synthesis", "Monotonic dependence", "Variable performance", "Citric Acid", "Ferrosoferric Oxide", "Hyperthermia, Induced", "Magnetic Fields", "Magnetite Nanoparticles", "Microwaves", "Temperature"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84921757013", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"]], "AuthorData": {"35758304700": {"Name": "Blanco-Andujar C.", "AuthorID": "35758304700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "7005152034": {"Name": "Thanh N.", "AuthorID": "7005152034", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Healthcare Biomagnetics Laboratory"}, "26432363000": {"Name": "Southern P.", "AuthorID": "26432363000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "7006435054": {"Name": "Pankhurst Q.", "AuthorID": "7006435054", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "16310916900": {"Name": "Ortega D.", "AuthorID": "16310916900", "AffiliationID": "60106540, 60006754, 60018678", "AffiliationName": "Centro Nacional de Biotecnolog\u00eda (CNB-CSIC), IMDEA Nanociencia Associated Unit Unidad de Nanobiotecnolog\u00eda"}}}
