As a result, it is becoming increasingly feasible to build sensor-based computational models that are much more robust to real-world noise and complexity than previously possible. It is paramount that these innovations reach mobile and embedded devices that often rely on understanding and reacting to sensor data. However, deep models conventionally demand a level of system resources (e.g., memory and computation) that makes them problematic to run directly on constrained devices. In this work, we present the DeepX toolkit (DXTK); an open-source collection of software components for simplifying the execution of deep models on resource-sensitive platforms. DXTK contains a number of pre-trained low-resource deep models that users can quickly adopt and integrate for their particular application needs. It also offers a range of runtime options for executing deep models on range of devices including both Android and Linux variants. But the heart of DXTK is a series of optimization techniques (viz. weight/sparse factorization, convolution separation, precision scaling, and parameter cleaning). Each technique offers a complementary approach to shaping system resource requirements, and is compatible with deep and convolutional neural networks. We hope that DXTK proves to be a valuable resource for the community, and accelerates the adoption and study of resource-constrained deep learning.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Deep Learning", "Mobile Sensing", "Toolkit", "Wearables"], "IndexKeywords": ["Computational model", "Constrained devices", "Convolutional neural network", "Mobile sensing", "Optimization techniques", "Software component", "Toolkit", "Wearables"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85026243260", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"]], "AuthorData": {"23135333200": {"Name": "Lane N.", "AuthorID": "23135333200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College"}, "57183450500": {"Name": "Bhattacharya S.", "AuthorID": "57183450500", "AffiliationID": "60021378", "AffiliationName": "Nokia Bell Labs"}, "25923502200": {"Name": "Mathur A.", "AuthorID": "25923502200", "AffiliationID": "60021378", "AffiliationName": "Nokia Bell Labs"}, "55235011500": {"Name": "Forlivesi C.", "AuthorID": "55235011500", "AffiliationID": "60021378", "AffiliationName": "Nokia Bell Labs"}, "8927207400": {"Name": "Kawsar F.", "AuthorID": "8927207400", "AffiliationID": "60021378", "AffiliationName": "Nokia Bell Labs"}}}
