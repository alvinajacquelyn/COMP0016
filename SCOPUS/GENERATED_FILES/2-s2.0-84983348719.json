We show that the typical suppression in the spectra associated to nodal planes is distorted, and that this distortion can be employed to map the electron's angle of return to its parent ion. This investigation is performed semianalytically at the single-molecule response and single-active orbital level, using the strong-field approximation and the steepest descent method. We show that the velocity form of the dipole operator is superior to the length form in providing information about this distortion. However, both forms introduce artifacts that are absent in the actual momentum-space wave function. Furthermore, elliptically polarized fields lead to larger distortions in comparison to two-color orthogonally polarized fields. These features are investigated in detail for O2, whose highest occupied molecular orbital provides two orthogonal nodal planes.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Diatomic molecules", "Elliptically polarized field", "High order harmonics", "Highest occupied molecular orbital", "Intense laser field", "Momentum-space wave function", "Orthogonal polarizations", "Strong-field approximations"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84983348719", "SubjectAreas": [["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"]], "AuthorData": {"13009262500": {"Name": "Das T.", "AuthorID": "13009262500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "8557426100": {"Name": "Figueira De Morisson Faria C.", "AuthorID": "8557426100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}}}
