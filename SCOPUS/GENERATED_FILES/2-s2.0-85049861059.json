Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.The need for analysis and action across the interrelated domains of human behaviors and lifestyles, environmental sustainability, health and inequality is increasingly apparent. Currently, these areas are often not considered in conjunction when developing policies or interventions, introducing the potential for suboptimal or conflicting outcomes. The INHERIT model has been developed within the EU-funded project INHERIT as a tool to guide thinking and intersectoral action towards changing the behaviors and lifestyles that play such an important role in today\u2019s multidisciplinary challenges. The model integrates ecological public health and behavioral change models, emphasizing inequalities and those parts of the causal process that are influenced by human behaviors and lifestyles. The model was developed through web-based and live discussions with experts and policy stakeholders. To test the model\u2019s usability, the model was applied to aspects of food consumption. This paper shows that the INHERIT model can serve as a tool to identify opportunities for change in important \u2212food-related behaviors and lifestyles and to examine how they impact on health, health inequalities, and the environment in Europe and beyond. The INHERIT model helps clarify these interrelated domains, creating new opportunities to improve environmental health and health inequality, while taking our planetary boundaries into consideration.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Behavior", "Behavioral change", "Environmental health", "Equality", "Food", "Integrated models", "Sustainability"], "IndexKeywords": ["Conservation of Natural Resources", "Delivery of Health Care", "Europe", "Health Behavior", "Health Equity", "Health Promotion", "Health Status Disparities", "Humans", "Life Style", "Public Health"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85049861059", "SubjectAreas": [["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"], ["Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis", "ENVI", "2307"]], "AuthorData": {"57202926320": {"Name": "van der Vliet N.", "AuthorID": "57202926320", "AffiliationID": "60115927, 60017145", "AffiliationName": "Tilburg School of Social and Behavioral Sciences, University of Tilburg"}, "6506127952": {"Name": "Staatsen B.", "AuthorID": "6506127952", "AffiliationID": "60026125", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM), Centre for Sustainability, Environment and Health"}, "6602295776": {"Name": "Kruize H.", "AuthorID": "6602295776", "AffiliationID": "60026125", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM), Centre for Sustainability, Environment and Health"}, "6701536150": {"Name": "Schuit J.", "AuthorID": "6701536150", "AffiliationID": "60115927, 60017145", "AffiliationName": "Tilburg School of Social and Behavioral Sciences, University of Tilburg"}, "7401776062": {"Name": "Morris G.", "AuthorID": "7401776062", "AffiliationID": "60111707", "AffiliationName": "European Centre for Environment and Human Health, University of Exeter Medical School"}, "7402298809": {"Name": "Taylor T.", "AuthorID": "7402298809", "AffiliationID": "60111707", "AffiliationName": "European Centre for Environment and Human Health, University of Exeter Medical School"}, "6506236652": {"Name": "Costongs C.", "AuthorID": "6506236652", "AffiliationID": "107019105", "AffiliationName": "EuroHealthNet"}, "36835043500": {"Name": "Bell R.", "AuthorID": "36835043500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Health Equity, UCL"}, "9037247600": {"Name": "Marques S.", "AuthorID": "9037247600", "AffiliationID": "60028300", "AffiliationName": "Instituto Universit\u00e1rio de Lisboa (ISCTE-IUL), CIS-IUL"}, "24333297700": {"Name": "Quiroga S.", "AuthorID": "24333297700", "AffiliationID": "60027800", "AffiliationName": "Department of Economics, Universidad de Alcal\u00e1"}, "56741410600": {"Name": "Juarez P.", "AuthorID": "56741410600", "AffiliationID": "60027800", "AffiliationName": "Department of Economics, Universidad de Alcal\u00e1"}, "36696761900": {"Name": "M\u00e1ca V.", "AuthorID": "36696761900", "AffiliationID": "60016605", "AffiliationName": "Charles University, Environment Centre (CUNI)"}, "57208759576": {"Name": "\u0160\u010dasn\u00fd M.", "AuthorID": "57208759576", "AffiliationID": "60016605", "AffiliationName": "Charles University, Environment Centre (CUNI)"}, "55345747500": {"Name": "Zv\u011b\u0159inov\u00e1 I.", "AuthorID": "55345747500", "AffiliationID": "60016605", "AffiliationName": "Charles University, Environment Centre (CUNI)"}, "6506353206": {"Name": "Tozija F.", "AuthorID": "6506353206", "AffiliationID": "111525028", "AffiliationName": "The Institute of Public Health of the Republic of Macedonia (IJZRM)"}, "29067765400": {"Name": "Gjorgjev D.", "AuthorID": "29067765400", "AffiliationID": "111525028", "AffiliationName": "The Institute of Public Health of the Republic of Macedonia (IJZRM)"}, "6602141035": {"Name": "Espnes G.", "AuthorID": "6602141035", "AffiliationID": "60013141", "AffiliationName": "NTNU Center for Health Promotion Research, Norwegian University of Science and Technology"}}}
