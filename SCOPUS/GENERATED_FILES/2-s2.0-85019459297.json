We analyzed its role in the progression of Glycogen Storage Disease type-Ia (GSD-Ia) and breast cancer. Genotype data on rs2229611 revealed that the risk of GSD-Ia was higher (P = 0.0195) with CC compared to TT/TC genotypes, whereas no such correlation was observed with breast cancer cases. We observed a strong linkage disequilibrium (LD) among rs2229611 and other disease causing G6PC1 variants (| D\u2032| = 1, r2 = 1). Functional validation performed in HepG2 cells using luciferase constructs showed significant (P < 0.05) decrease in expression than wild-type 3\u2032-UTR due to curtailed mRNA stability. Furthermore, AU-rich elements (AREs) mediated regulation of G6PC1 expression characterized using 3\u2032-UTR deletion constructs showed a prominent decrease in mRNA stability. We then examined whether miRNAs are involved in controlling G6PC1 expression using pmirGLO-UTR constructs, with evidence of more distinct inhibition in the reporter function with rs2229611. These data suggests that rs2229611 is a crucial regulatory SNP which in homozygous state leads to a more aggressive disease phenotype in GSD-Ia patients. The implication of this result is significant in predicting disease onset, progression and response to disease modifying treatments in patients with GSD-Ia.", "AuthorKeywords": ["3\u2019UTR", "Breast cancer", "GSD-Ia", "Linkage disequilibrium", "Polymorphism", "rs2229611"], "IndexKeywords": ["3' Untranslated Regions", "Female", "Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic", "Glucose-6-Phosphatase", "Glycogen Storage Disease Type I", "HeLa Cells", "Hep G2 Cells", "Humans", "Male", "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide", "RNA Stability", "RNA, Messenger", "Suppression, Genetic"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85019459297", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Clinical Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1308"], ["Biochemistry (medical)", "MEDI", "2704"]], "AuthorData": {"56624372000": {"Name": "Karthi S.", "AuthorID": "56624372000", "AffiliationID": "60021927", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genetic Engineering, School of Biotechnology, Madurai Kamaraj University"}, "57194240324": {"Name": "Rajeshwari M.", "AuthorID": "57194240324", "AffiliationID": "60021927", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genetic Engineering, School of Biotechnology, Madurai Kamaraj University"}, "6506098682": {"Name": "Ashokkumar B.", "AuthorID": "6506098682", "AffiliationID": "60021927", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genetic Engineering, School of Biotechnology, Madurai Kamaraj University"}, "7103049180": {"Name": "Francis A.", "AuthorID": "7103049180", "AffiliationID": "60026730", "AffiliationName": "CSIR-Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology"}, "6603011487": {"Name": "Thangaraj K.", "AuthorID": "6603011487", "AffiliationID": "60026730", "AffiliationName": "CSIR-Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology"}, "6701773785": {"Name": "Saravanan M.", "AuthorID": "6701773785", "AffiliationID": "60021988", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biological Sciences & Bioengineering (BSBE), Indian Institute of Technology"}, "54080517000": {"Name": "Varalakshmi P.", "AuthorID": "54080517000", "AffiliationID": "60021927", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Microbiology, School of Biotechnology, Madurai Kamaraj University"}, "7003363686": {"Name": "Houlden H.", "AuthorID": "7003363686", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience and Neurogenetics Laboratory, UCL Institute of Neurology"}}}
