However, there are no large population studies measuring LA structure. The relationship of demographics and cardiovascular risk factors to LA size is largely unknown. This study aimed to determine associations of LA size with demographic factors, cardiac structure and function, and cardiovascular risk factors. Methods and Results - LA volume indexed to body surface area was measured by cardiovascular magnetic resonance steady-state free precession and fast gradient echo cine long- and short-axis images in 2576 asymptomatic participants of MESA ([Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis] 68.7 years, 53.0% women, white 42.2%, Chinese American 12.0%, black 24.5%, and Hispanic 21.2%) using biplane and short-axis images. The mean LA volume index was 36.5\u00b111.4 mL/m 2 in the entire cohort and 35.5\u00b110.1 mL/m 2 in subjects free of cardiovascular risk factors (n=283). Multivariable analysis included adjustment for demographics, ethnicity, cardiovascular risk factors, serological studies, socioeconomic status, left ventricular structure, and medications. In the adjusted analysis, age (\u03b2=0.2 mL/m 2 per year, P<0.0001), male sex (\u03b2=-4.2 mL/m 2, P<0.0001), obesity (\u03b2=1.3 mL/m 2, P<0.01), end-diastolic volume index (\u03b2=0.4 mL/m 2, P<0.0001), Chinese American (\u03b2=-2.6 mL/m 2, P<0.0001), and Hispanic (\u03b2=1.1 mL/m 2, P<0.05) ethnicities were associated with LA volume index. Diabetes mellitus and smoking were not associated with LA volume index. LA volumes measured by steady-state free precession were 3% larger than by fast gradient echo cine cardiovascular magnetic resonance (P<0.001). Conclusions - Age, sex, ethnicity and left ventricular structural parameters were associated with LA size. Importantly, the study provides reference values of normal LA volume index.", "AuthorKeywords": ["body surface area", "magnetic resonance imaging"], "IndexKeywords": ["African Americans", "Age Factors", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Asian Americans", "Atherosclerosis", "Atrial Function, Left", "Body Surface Area", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "European Continental Ancestry Group", "Female", "Heart Diseases", "Hispanic Americans", "Humans", "Hypertrophy, Left Ventricular", "Linear Models", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Cine", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Multivariate Analysis", "Obesity", "Predictive Value of Tests", "Reference Values", "Reproducibility of Results", "Risk Factors", "Sex Factors", "United States", "Ventricular Function, Left"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85013482400", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"], ["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"53865866400": {"Name": "Zemrak F.", "AuthorID": "53865866400", "AffiliationID": "60022109, 60004093", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Advanced Cardiovascular Imaging, Queen Mary University of London, Barts Heart Centre"}, "6701721053": {"Name": "Mohiddin S.A.", "AuthorID": "6701721053", "AffiliationID": "60022109, 60004093", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Advanced Cardiovascular Imaging, Queen Mary University of London, Barts Heart Centre"}, "35430477200": {"Name": "Petersen S.E.", "AuthorID": "35430477200", "AffiliationID": "60022109, 60004093", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Advanced Cardiovascular Imaging, Queen Mary University of London, Barts Heart Centre"}, "36605465800": {"Name": "Ambale-Venkatesh B.", "AuthorID": "36605465800", "AffiliationID": "60001555", "AffiliationName": "Cardiology Division, Department of Medicine, Johns Hopkins Hospital"}, "55853575700": {"Name": "Chrispin J.", "AuthorID": "55853575700", "AffiliationID": "60001555", "AffiliationName": "Cardiology Division, Department of Medicine, Johns Hopkins Hospital"}, "15051546800": {"Name": "Chamera E.", "AuthorID": "15051546800", "AffiliationID": "60001555", "AffiliationName": "Cardiology Division, Department of Medicine, Johns Hopkins Hospital"}, "55326089700": {"Name": "Habibi M.", "AuthorID": "55326089700", "AffiliationID": "60001555", "AffiliationName": "Cardiology Division, Department of Medicine, Johns Hopkins Hospital"}, "57203062145": {"Name": "Nazarian S.", "AuthorID": "57203062145", "AffiliationID": "60001555", "AffiliationName": "Cardiology Division, Department of Medicine, Johns Hopkins Hospital"}, "7202778154": {"Name": "Lima J.A.C.", "AuthorID": "7202778154", "AffiliationID": "60001555", "AffiliationName": "Cardiology Division, Department of Medicine, Johns Hopkins Hospital"}, "6506837383": {"Name": "Captur G.", "AuthorID": "6506837383", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}, "7403231345": {"Name": "Moon J.C.", "AuthorID": "7403231345", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}, "7006047770": {"Name": "Bluemke D.A.", "AuthorID": "7006047770", "AffiliationID": "60006577", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology and Imaging Sciences, Clinical Center, National Institutes of Health, National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Engineering"}}}
