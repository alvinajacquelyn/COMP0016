Under AM1.5 conditions, the combination of {Ni4 O4} clusters with SiNWs gave a current density of \u221216 mA/cm2, which corresponds to an increase in current density of 60% when compared to bare SiNWs. The composite electrode was fully characterised and shown to be an efficient and stable photocathode for water splitting.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Nanowires", "Nickel oxide", "Photocathode", "Water splitting"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85012975528", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"]], "AuthorData": {"36550534400": {"Name": "Mange Y.", "AuthorID": "36550534400", "AffiliationID": "60031846", "AffiliationName": "Future Industries Institute, University of South Australia"}, "56210930100": {"Name": "Chandrasekaran S.", "AuthorID": "56210930100", "AffiliationID": "60031846", "AffiliationName": "Future Industries Institute, University of South Australia"}, "6602826971": {"Name": "Voelcke N.", "AuthorID": "6602826971", "AffiliationID": "60031846", "AffiliationName": "Future Industries Institute, University of South Australia"}, "57193328139": {"Name": "Hollingswort N.", "AuthorID": "57193328139", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "56217400400": {"Name": "Parkin I.", "AuthorID": "56217400400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "56210619300": {"Name": "Macdonald T.", "AuthorID": "56210619300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "55925608200": {"Name": "Nann T.", "AuthorID": "55925608200", "AffiliationID": "60002316, 60093471", "AffiliationName": "MacDiarmid Institute for Advanced Materials and Nanotechnology, School of Chemical and Physical Sciences, Victoria University of Wellington"}}}
