Methods: Structural magnetic resonance imaging was used to perform voxel-based morphometry (VBM) of gray and white matter in 30 neurologically healthy subjects. Contact heat stimulation was performed on the dorsum of the right hand at the base of the thumb. Evoked potentials were acquired from a vertex-recording electrode referenced to linked ears. Results: Controlling for age, total intracranial volume, and skull/scalp thickness, CHEP amplitude and pain rating were not significantly correlated between subjects. A VBM region of interest approach demonstrated a significant interaction between pain rating and N2 amplitude in the right insular cortex (p < 0.05, family-wise error corrected, FWE). In white matter, a significant interaction was localized in the right inferior frontal occipital fasciculus (IFOF, p < 0.05 FWE). Conclusions: Accounting for gray matter volume in the right insular cortex, resulted in a significant relationship between CHEP amplitude and pain rating. Significance: This finding suggests that the discrepancy between pain ratings and the amplitude of evoked potentials is not solely related to measurement artifact, but rather attributable, in part, to anatomical differences between subjects.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Contact heat evoked potentials", "Gray matter", "Inferior frontal occipital fasciculus", "Insular", "Laser evoked potentials", "White matter"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Brain Mapping", "Female", "Gray Matter", "Hot Temperature", "Humans", "Male", "Organ Size", "Pain", "Pain Measurement", "Pain Perception", "White Matter", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84925339166", "SubjectAreas": [["Sensory Systems", "NEUR", "2809"], ["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Physiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2737"]], "AuthorData": {"24722578700": {"Name": "Kramer J.L.K.", "AuthorID": "24722578700", "AffiliationID": "60010365, 60193424", "AffiliationName": "ICORD/School of Kinesiology, University of British Columbia"}, "55321911000": {"Name": "Jutzeler C.R.", "AuthorID": "55321911000", "AffiliationID": "60000869, 60012614", "AffiliationName": "Spinal Cord Injury Center, University Hospital Balgrist, University of Zurich"}, "36461090300": {"Name": "Haefeli J.", "AuthorID": "36461090300", "AffiliationID": "60023691", "AffiliationName": "Brain and Spinal Injury Center, Department of Neurological Surgery, University of California"}, "7006759480": {"Name": "Curt A.", "AuthorID": "7006759480", "AffiliationID": "60000869, 60012614", "AffiliationName": "Spinal Cord Injury Center, University Hospital Balgrist, University of Zurich"}, "14037413900": {"Name": "Freund P.", "AuthorID": "14037413900", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Brain Repair and Rehabilitation, UCL Institute of Neurology, University College London"}}}
