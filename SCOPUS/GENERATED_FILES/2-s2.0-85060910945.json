All rights reserved.Both isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT) and antiretroviral therapy (ART) reduce tuberculosis risk in individuals living with HIV. We sought to estimate the broader, population-wide impact of providing a pragmatically implemented 12-month IPT regimen to ART recipients in a high-burden community.Design:Dynamic transmission model of a tuberculosis (TB)-HIV epidemic, calibrated to site-specific, historical epidemiologic and clinical trial data from Khayelitsha, South Africa.Methods:We projected the 5-year impact of delivering a 12-month IPT regimen community-wide to 85% of new ART initiators and 15%/year of those already on ART, accounting for IPT-attributable reductions in TB infection, progression, and transmission. We also evaluated scenarios of continuously-delivered IPT, ongoing ART scale-up, and lower tuberculosis incidence.Results:Under historical (early 2010) ART coverage, this ART-linked IPT intervention prevented one tuberculosis case per 18 [95% credible interval (CrI) 11-29] people treated. It lowered TB incidence by a projected 23% (95% CrI 14-30%) among people receiving ART, and by 5.2% (95% CrI 2.9-8.7%) in the total population. Continuous IPT reduced the number needed to treat to prevent one case of TB to 10 (95% CrI 7-16), though it required 74% more person-years of therapy (95% CrI 64-94%) to prevent one TB case, relative to 12-month therapy. Under expanding ART coverage, the tuberculosis incidence reduction achieved by 12-month IPT grew to 7.6% (95% CrI 4.3-12.6%). Effect sizes were similar in a simulated setting of lower TB incidence.Conclusions:IPT in conjunction with ART reduces tuberculosis incidence among those who receive therapy and has additional impact on tuberculosis transmission in the population.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Africa", "antiretroviral therapy", "latent tuberculosis", "mathematical models", "transmission", "tuberculosis", "tuberculosis prevention and control"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Anti-Retroviral Agents", "Antitubercular Agents", "Chemoprevention", "Disease Transmission, Infectious", "HIV Infections", "Humans", "Incidence", "Isoniazid", "Models, Statistical", "South Africa", "Treatment Outcome", "Tuberculosis", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85060910945", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"35078801300": {"Name": "Kendall E.A.", "AuthorID": "35078801300", "AffiliationID": "60005248", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infectious Diseases, Johns Hopkins, University School of Medicine"}, "55515206400": {"Name": "Azman A.S.", "AuthorID": "55515206400", "AffiliationID": "60006183", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, Department of Epidemiology, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"}, "6603069678": {"Name": "Dowdy D.W.", "AuthorID": "6603069678", "AffiliationID": "60006183", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, Department of Epidemiology, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"}, "16157672200": {"Name": "Maartens G.", "AuthorID": "16157672200", "AffiliationID": "60000356", "AffiliationName": "Division of Clinical Pharmacology, Department of Medicine, University of Cape Town"}, "6602727118": {"Name": "Boulle A.", "AuthorID": "6602727118", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Global Health, University College London"}, "7402272158": {"Name": "Wilkinson R.J.", "AuthorID": "7402272158", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Imperial College"}, "14830408400": {"Name": "Rangaka M.X.", "AuthorID": "14830408400", "AffiliationID": "60107285", "AffiliationName": "Francis Crick Institute"}}}
