It is a long-standing nontrivial prediction of quantum electrodynamics that its vacuum is unstable in the background of a static, spatially uniform electric field and, in principle, sparks with spontaneous emission of electron-positron pairs. However, an experimental verification of this prediction seems out of reach because a sizeable rate for spontaneous pair production requires an extraordinarily strong electric field strength |E| of order the Schwinger critical field, Ec=me2/e\u22431.3\u00d71018 V/m, where me is the electron mass and e is its charge. Here, we show that the measurement of the rate of pair production due to the decays of high-energy bremsstrahlung photons in a high-intensity laser field allows for the experimental determination of the Schwinger critical field and, thus, the boiling point of the vacuum of quantum electrodynamics.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85062629683", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (miscellaneous)", "PHYS", "3101"]], "AuthorData": {"24775835800": {"Name": "Hartin A.", "AuthorID": "24775835800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "7003885738": {"Name": "Ringwald A.", "AuthorID": "7003885738", "AffiliationID": "60030635", "AffiliationName": "DESY"}, "57196005074": {"Name": "Tapia N.", "AuthorID": "57196005074", "AffiliationID": "60023383", "AffiliationName": "Departamento de Fisica, Universidad de Santiago de Chile"}}}
