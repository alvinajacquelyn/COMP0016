Most of the previous work on superconductor-graphene-superconductor (SGS) junctions and superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) were based on mechanically exfoliated graphene, which is not compatible with large scale production. Here, we show that SGS junctions and dc SQUIDs can be easily fabricated from chemical vapor deposition (CVD) graphene and exhibit good electronic properties. The SGS junctions can work without any hysteresis in their electrical characteristics from 1.5 K down to a base temperature of 320 mK, and the critical current can be effectively tuned by the gate voltage by up to an order of magnitude. As a result, dc SQUIDs made up of these junctions can have their critical current tuned by both the magnetic field and the gate voltage.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Josephson junctions", "nanomaterials", "SQUIDs", "superconducting devices"], "IndexKeywords": ["Base temperature", "Chemical vapor depositions (CVD)", "CVD graphene", "Electrical characteristic", "Exfoliated graphene", "Gate voltages", "Josephson", "Large scale productions"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85063504473", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"55767739200": {"Name": "Li T.", "AuthorID": "55767739200", "AffiliationID": "60103653", "AffiliationName": "Aalto University"}, "6701351606": {"Name": "Romans E.", "AuthorID": "6701351606", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "16218796100": {"Name": "Gallop J.", "AuthorID": "16218796100", "AffiliationID": "60010785", "AffiliationName": "National Physical Laboratory"}, "34769536200": {"Name": "Hao L.", "AuthorID": "34769536200", "AffiliationID": "60010785", "AffiliationName": "National Physical Laboratory"}}}
