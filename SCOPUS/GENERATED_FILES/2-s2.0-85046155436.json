This study aimed to develop and validate a modifiable lifestyle-based mortality predication index for older adults. Data from 51,688 participants (56% women) aged \u226550 years in 2002 Health and Retirement Study, 2002 English Longitudinal Study of Ageing and 2004 Survey of Health Ageing and Retirement in Europe were used to estimate coefficients of the index with cohort-stratified Cox regression. Models were validated across studies and compared to the Lee index (having comorbid and morbidity predictors). Over an average of 11-year follow-up, 10,240 participants died. The lifestyle index includes smoking, drinking, exercising, sleep quality, BMI, sex and age; showing adequate model performance in internal validation (C-statistic 0.79; D-statistic 1.94; calibration slope 1.13) and in all combinations of internal-external cross-validation. It outperformed Lee index (e.g. differences in C-statistic = 0.01, D-statistic = 0.17, P < 0.001) consistently across health status. The lifestyle index stratified participants into varying mortality risk groups, with those in the top quintile having 13.5% excess absolute mortality risk over 10 years than those in the bottom 50th centile. Our lifestyle index with easy-assessable behavioural factors and improved generalizability may maximize its usability for personalized risk management.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Aging", "Epidemiologic Methods", "Europe", "Humans", "Life Style", "Longitudinal Studies", "Mortality", "Prognosis", "Survival Analysis", "United Kingdom", "United States"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85046155436", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"55991650500": {"Name": "Liao J.", "AuthorID": "55991650500", "AffiliationID": "60021182", "AffiliationName": "Sun Yat-sen Global Health Institute, Institute of State Governance, Sun Yat-sen University"}, "57202554333": {"Name": "Hao Y.", "AuthorID": "57202554333", "AffiliationID": "60021182", "AffiliationName": "Sun Yat-sen Global Health Institute, Institute of State Governance, Sun Yat-sen University"}, "35209624500": {"Name": "Chen Y.M.", "AuthorID": "35209624500", "AffiliationID": "60021182", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Statistics and Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Sun Yat-sen University"}, "35206359500": {"Name": "Muniz-Terrera G.", "AuthorID": "35206359500", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "Biostatistics and Epidemiology, Centre for Dementia Prevention, University of Edinburgh"}, "35363010600": {"Name": "Scholes S.", "AuthorID": "35363010600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Research Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, Faculty of Population Health Sciences, University College London"}}}
