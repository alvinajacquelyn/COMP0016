We determined the efficacy of delayed IPost in a rat model of myocardial infarction (MI) and investigated potential underlying mechanisms of this phenomenon. Rats were subjected to 20, 30 or 45 min of coronary artery occlusion followed by 120 min of reperfusion (I/R). Immediate and early IPost included six cycles of I/R (10/10 s) applied 10 s or 10 min after reperfusion onset. In the second series of experiments, the rats were subjected to 30 min of coronary occlusion followed by IPost applied 10 s, 10, 30, 45 or 60 min after the onset of reperfusion. Immediate and early IPost (applied 10 s or 10 min of reperfusion) established cardioprotection only when applied after a period of myocardial ischaemia lasting 30 min. Delayed IPost applied after 30 or 45 min of reperfusion reduced infarct sizes by 36 and 41 %, respectively (both P < 0.01). IPost applied 60 min after reperfusion onset was ineffective. Inhibition of RISK pathway (administration of ERK1/2 inhibitor PD-98059 or PI3K inhibitor LY-294002) abolished cardioprotection established by immediate IPost but had no effect on cardioprotection conferred by early IPost. Blockade of SAFE pathway using JAK/STAT inhibitor AG490 had no effect on the immediate or early IPost cardioprotection. Blockade of mitochondrial KATP (mitoKATP) channels (with 5-Hydroxydecanoate) abolished cardioprotection achieved by immediate and early IPost, but had no effect on cardioprotection when IPost was applied 30 or 45 min into the reperfusion period. Immediate IPost increased phosphorylation of PI3K-AKT and ERK1/2. Early or delayed IPost had no effect on phosphorylation of PI3K-AKT, ERK1/2 or STAT3. These data show that in the rat model, delayed IPost confers significant cardioprotection even if applied 45 min after onset of reperfusion. Cardioprotection induced by immediate and early postconditioning involves recruitment of RISK pathway and/or mitoKATP channels, while delayed postconditioning appears to rely on a different mechanism.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Ischaemia and reperfusion injury", "MitoKATP channels", "Myocardial infarction", "Postconditioning", "Preconditioning", "RISK and SAFE pathways"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Ischemic Postconditioning", "Male", "Myocardial Infarction", "Myocardial Reperfusion Injury", "Potassium Channels", "Protein Kinases", "Rats", "Rats, Wistar", "Signal Transduction"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84938092946", "SubjectAreas": [["Physiology", "BIOC", "1314"], ["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"], ["Physiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2737"]], "AuthorData": {"55233650500": {"Name": "Barsukevich V.", "AuthorID": "55233650500", "AffiliationID": "112852598", "AffiliationName": "Research Centre Cardiology"}, "55233650800": {"Name": "Basalay M.", "AuthorID": "55233650800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology, University College London"}, "6603928240": {"Name": "Mrochek A.", "AuthorID": "6603928240", "AffiliationID": "112852598", "AffiliationName": "Research Centre Cardiology"}, "57204343249": {"Name": "Gourine A.", "AuthorID": "57204343249", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology, University College London"}, "56673320900": {"Name": "Sanchez J.", "AuthorID": "56673320900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, University College London"}, "47761759900": {"Name": "Whittle J.", "AuthorID": "47761759900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, University College London"}, "8768192800": {"Name": "Ackland G.", "AuthorID": "8768192800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, University College London"}, "7004410902": {"Name": "Gourine A.", "AuthorID": "7004410902", "AffiliationID": "60019295", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Karolinska University Hospital"}}}
