Innovative methods are required to effectively transition the growing number of compounds into novel combination regimens. However, progression of compounds into patients occurs despite the lack of clear understanding of the pharmacokinetic\u2013pharmacodynamic (PKPD) relationships. The PreDiCT-TB consortium was established in response to the existing gaps in TB drug development. The aim of the consortium is to develop new preclinical tools in concert with an in silico model-based approach, grounded in PKPD principles. Here, we highlight the potential impact of such an integrated framework on the various stages of TB drug development and on the dose rationale for drug combinations.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Antitubercular Agents", "Drug Approval", "Drug Discovery", "Humans", "Models, Theoretical", "Tuberculosis"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85005767694", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"], ["Drug Discovery", "PHAR", "3002"]], "AuthorData": {"57192367692": {"Name": "Muliaditan M.", "AuthorID": "57192367692", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Life and Medical Sciences"}, "8536932300": {"Name": "Della Pasqua O.", "AuthorID": "8536932300", "AffiliationID": "60020649", "AffiliationName": "GlaxoSmithKline"}, "7402854613": {"Name": "Davies G.R.", "AuthorID": "7402854613", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular and Clinical Pharmacology, University of Liverpool"}, "12142947300": {"Name": "Simonsson U.S.H.", "AuthorID": "12142947300", "AffiliationID": "60003858", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmaceutical Biosciences, Uppsala University"}, "7101706332": {"Name": "Gillespie S.H.", "AuthorID": "7101706332", "AffiliationID": "60009979, 60022132", "AffiliationName": "School of Medicine, University of St Andrews"}}}
