Contrary to previous studies, no marked increase in Ma with declining precipitation was observed, but savanna tree foliar [N] tended to be higher at the drier sites (mass basis). Generally, Ma was slightly higher and [N] slightly lower for forest vs savanna trees with most of this difference attributable to differences in soil chemistry. No systematic variations in [P], [Mg] and [Ca] with precipitation or between trees of forest vs savanna stands were observed. We did, however, find a marked increase in foliar [K] of savanna trees as precipitation declined, with savanna trees also having a significantly lower [K] than those of nearby forest. These differences were not related to differences in soil nutrient status and were accompanied by systematic changes in [C] of opposite sign. We suggest an important but as yet unidentified role for K in the adaption of savanna species to periods of limited water availability; with foliar [K] being also an important factor differentiating tree species adapted to forest vs savanna soils within the 'zone of transition' of Western Africa.", "AuthorKeywords": ["foliar cations", "leaf mass per unit area", "leaf physiology", "nitrogen", "phenology", "phosphorus", "plant functional traits", "potassium", "tropical", "West Africa", "zone of transition."], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84916898132", "SubjectAreas": [["Agronomy and Crop Science", "AGRI", "1102"], ["Plant Science", "AGRI", "1110"]], "AuthorData": {"20735876100": {"Name": "Schrodt F.", "AuthorID": "20735876100", "AffiliationID": "60077281", "AffiliationName": "German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research, Halle-Jena-Leipzig"}, "55323559100": {"Name": "Feldpausch T.R.", "AuthorID": "55323559100", "AffiliationID": "60026479", "AffiliationName": "College of Life and Environmental Sciences, University of Exeter"}, "57203104307": {"Name": "Grace J.", "AuthorID": "57203104307", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography, University College London"}, "6507886390": {"Name": "Domingues T.F.", "AuthorID": "6507886390", "AffiliationID": "60008088", "AffiliationName": "Universidade de S\u00e3o Paulo, Faculdade de Filosofia Ciencias e Letras de Ribeir\u00e3o Preto"}, "7102578362": {"Name": "Bird M.I.", "AuthorID": "7102578362", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "School of Geosciences, University of Edinburgh"}, "13410827900": {"Name": "Saiz G.", "AuthorID": "13410827900", "AffiliationID": "60027314, 60102538", "AffiliationName": "Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Institute of Meteorology and Climate Research"}, "7003929943": {"Name": "Quesada C.A.", "AuthorID": "7003929943", "AffiliationID": "60029159", "AffiliationName": "Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas da Amazonia, Manaus"}, "7007019891": {"Name": "Ishida F.Y.", "AuthorID": "7007019891", "AffiliationID": "60019870", "AffiliationName": "School of Tropical and Marine Sciences, Centre for Terrestrial Environmental and Sustainability Sciences, James Cook University"}, "55696880400": {"Name": "Schwarz M.", "AuthorID": "55696880400", "AffiliationID": "108368021", "AffiliationName": "Fieldwork Assistance"}, "14068568100": {"Name": "Compaore H.", "AuthorID": "14068568100", "AffiliationID": "100916144", "AffiliationName": "Institut de L'Environnement et de Recherches Agricoles"}, "6604003297": {"Name": "Veenendaal E.M.", "AuthorID": "6604003297", "AffiliationID": "100916144", "AffiliationName": "Institut de L'Environnement et de Recherches Agricoles"}, "7402365467": {"Name": "Lloyd J.", "AuthorID": "7402365467", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Life Sciences, Imperial College London, Silwood Park Campus"}, "56346922500": {"Name": "Diallo A.", "AuthorID": "56346922500", "AffiliationID": "109088957", "AffiliationName": "Centre National des Semences Forestieres"}, "24068340700": {"Name": "Djagbletey G.", "AuthorID": "24068340700", "AffiliationID": "60071881", "AffiliationName": "Ecosystem and Climate Change Division, Forestry Research Institute of Ghana"}, "6507504406": {"Name": "Hien F.", "AuthorID": "6507504406", "AffiliationID": "60025468, 60104363", "AffiliationName": "G\u00e9osciences Environnement Toulouse, Observatoire Midi-Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es"}, "6602680004": {"Name": "Sonk\u00e9 B.", "AuthorID": "6602680004", "AffiliationID": "60070928", "AffiliationName": "Plant Systematic and Ecology Laboratory, Department of Biology, University of Yaounde"}, "56444425600": {"Name": "Toedoumg H.", "AuthorID": "56444425600", "AffiliationID": "60070928", "AffiliationName": "Plant Systematic and Ecology Laboratory, Department of Biology, University of Yaounde"}, "17341775500": {"Name": "Zapfack L.", "AuthorID": "17341775500", "AffiliationID": "60070928", "AffiliationName": "Plant Systematic and Ecology Laboratory, Department of Biology, University of Yaounde"}, "7003516381": {"Name": "Hiernaux P.", "AuthorID": "7003516381", "AffiliationID": "60019870", "AffiliationName": "School of Earth and Environmental Sciences, Centre for Terrestrial Environmental and Sustainability Sciences, James Cook University"}, "7003798418": {"Name": "Mougin E.", "AuthorID": "7003798418", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography, University College London"}, "56105640400": {"Name": "Lewis S.L.", "AuthorID": "56105640400", "AffiliationID": "60004156", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Ecosystem Studies, University of Wageningen"}}}
