These were designed with the aim of being sutured into the resection site after tumor removal, to aid recovery and prevent cancer recurrence. The shell was made up of a mixture of gelatin and sodium bicarbonate (added to provide pH-sensitivity), and was loaded with the anti-inflammatory drug ciprofloxacin; the core comprised poly(lactide-co-\u03b5-caprolactone) with the chemotherapeutic doxorubicin hydrochloride. Scanning electron microscopy revealed most fibers were smooth and homogeneous. Transmission electron microscopy demonstrated the presence of a clear core/shell structure. The fiber scaffolds were further characterized using infrared spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction, which proved that both drugs were present in the fibers in the amorphous form. The gelatin shells were cross-linked with glutaraldehyde to enhance their stability, and water contact angle measurements used to confirm they remained hydrophilic after this process, with angles between 10 and 35\u00b0. This is important for onward applications, since a hydrophilic surface is known to encourage cell proliferation. During in vitro drug release studies, a rapid and acid-responsive release of ciprofloxacin was seen, accompanied by sustained and long-term doxorubicin release. Both the release profiles and the mechanical strength of the fibers can effectively be tuned through the sodium bicarbonate content of the fibers: for instance, the break stress varies from 2.00 MPa to 2.57 MPa with an increase in sodium bicarbonate content. The pH values of aqueous media exposed to the scaffolds decrease only slightly, by less than 0.5 pH units, over the two-month timescale, suggesting that only minimal fiber degradation occurs during this time. The fiber scaffolds also have good biocompatibility, as revealed by in vitro cytotoxicity experiments. Overall, our results demonstrate that the novel scaffolds reported here are promising pH-sensitive drug delivery systems, and may be candidates for use after tumor resection surgery.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Anti-cancer", "coaxial electrospinning", "dual-drug-loaded", "pH-responsive", "polymer fiber"], "IndexKeywords": ["Anti-cancer", "Coaxial electrospinning", "dual-drug-loaded", "PH-responsive", "Polymer fiber", "Animals", "Anti-Bacterial Agents", "Antibiotics, Antineoplastic", "Cell Line", "Cell Line, Tumor", "Ciprofloxacin", "Delayed-Action Preparations", "Doxorubicin", "Drug Liberation", "Gelatin", "Humans", "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration", "Mice", "Nanofibers", "Neoplasms", "Polyesters", "Tissue Scaffolds"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85042085292", "SubjectAreas": [["Biomaterials", "MATE", "2502"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"]], "AuthorData": {"57193390160": {"Name": "Sang Q.", "AuthorID": "57193390160", "AffiliationID": "60010953", "AffiliationName": "College of Chemistry, Chemical Engineering and Biotechnology, Donghua University"}, "56184012500": {"Name": "Li H.", "AuthorID": "56184012500", "AffiliationID": "60010953", "AffiliationName": "College of Chemistry, Chemical Engineering and Biotechnology, Donghua University"}, "56714038100": {"Name": "Wu H.", "AuthorID": "56714038100", "AffiliationID": "60010953", "AffiliationName": "College of Chemistry, Chemical Engineering and Biotechnology, Donghua University"}, "55710395600": {"Name": "Zhu L.", "AuthorID": "55710395600", "AffiliationID": "60010953, 60001604", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of Science & Technology of Eco-Textiles, Ministry of Education, Donghua University"}, "7406083266": {"Name": "Williams G.", "AuthorID": "7406083266", "AffiliationID": "60016379, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy, University College London"}}}
