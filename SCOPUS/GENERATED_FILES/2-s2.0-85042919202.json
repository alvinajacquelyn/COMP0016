Data were taken from two British cohorts (born in 1958 and 1970) in pre-adolescence (age 11 and 10, respectively) and adulthood (age 33 and 34). SEP constructs in pre-adolescence and adulthood were derived through Confirmatory Factor Analysis. Conceptualised paths from pre-adolescent SEP to HRB cluster membership via adult SEP in our path models were tested for statistical significance separately by gender and cohort. Adult SEP mediated the path between pre-adolescent SEP and adult HRB clusters. More disadvantaged SEP in pre-adolescence predicted more disadvantaged SEP in adulthood which was associated with membership of the \u201cRisky\u201d and \u201cModerate Smokers\u201d clusters compared to the \u201cMainstream\u201d cluster. For example, large positive indirect effects between pre-adolescent SEP and adult HRB via adult SEP were present (coefficient 1958 Women = 0.39; 1970 Women = 0.36, 1958 Men = 0.51; 1970 Men = 0.39; p < 0.01) when comparing \u201cRisky\u201d and \u201cMainstream\u201d cluster membership. Amongst men we found a small significant direct association (p < 0.001) between pre-adolescent SEP and HRB cluster membership. Our findings suggest that associations between adult SEP and HRBs are not likely to be pre-determined by earlier social circumstances, providing optimism for interventions relevant to reducing social gradients in HRBs. Observing consistent findings across the cohorts implies the social patterning of adult lifestyles may persist across time.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cluster analysis", "Cohort studies", "Factor analysis, statistical", "Health behaviour", "Health policy", "Life style", "Longitudinal studies", "Models, statistical", "Public policy", "Socioeconomic factors"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Child", "Cohort Studies", "England", "Female", "Health Behavior", "Humans", "Life Style", "Longitudinal Studies", "Male", "Models, Statistical", "Smokers", "Socioeconomic Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85042919202", "SubjectAreas": [["Epidemiology", "MEDI", "2713"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"57188758557": {"Name": "Mawditt C.", "AuthorID": "57188758557", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "International Centre for Lifecourse Studies in Society and Health, Research Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "6603689750": {"Name": "Sacker A.", "AuthorID": "6603689750", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "International Centre for Lifecourse Studies in Society and Health, Research Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "6602886147": {"Name": "Kelly Y.", "AuthorID": "6602886147", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "International Centre for Lifecourse Studies in Society and Health, Research Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "22633502300": {"Name": "Cable N.", "AuthorID": "22633502300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "International Centre for Lifecourse Studies in Society and Health, Research Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "20133865900": {"Name": "Britton A.", "AuthorID": "20133865900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}}}
