Published with license by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.This article is built from the authors\u2019 shared experience of using participatory methodology when working together on the construction of an archive of mental health recovery stories. In particular, it examines the nature of the relational dynamic between the authors which moved from a collaborative partnership towards friendship in the course of constructing the archive (practice) and critically reflecting on its development (research). The article has been constructed by interweaving the personal reflections of the two authors on the shared process, using self-reflexivity as a method for exploring the benefits and challenges of taking an emotionally engaged and personal approach to participatory research. In particular, it seeks to explore the role that our friendship played in enabling us to build affinity whilst simultaneously acknowledging and working with our differences; confronting asymmetries in our positions and privileges. The article concludes with Anna\u2019s reflections on the benefits and residual complexities inherent in basing a participatory approach around friendship, including its fit with shifting epistemological approaches being adopted in the recordkeeping field. This is followed by a final response from Dolly, reinforcing from her perspective why embedding friendship into participatory methodology was vital in enabling a richer experience of joint research and practice.", "AuthorKeywords": ["affect", "archives", "friendship", "mental health", "Participatory action research"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85020521644", "SubjectAreas": [["Conservation", "ARTS", "1206"], ["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"], ["Cultural Studies", "SOCI", "3316"], ["History", "ARTS", "1202"], ["Tourism, Leisure and Hospitality Management", "BUSI", "1409"], ["Museology", "ARTS", "1209"]], "AuthorData": {"10243545900": {"Name": "Sexton A.", "AuthorID": "10243545900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Information Studies, University College London"}, "57194521893": {"Name": "Sen D.", "AuthorID": "57194521893", "AffiliationID": "118255818", "AffiliationName": "Artist, Writer and Independent Mental Health Consultant"}}}
