All rights reserved.The actin cytoskeleton is a critical regulator of cytoplasmic architecture and mechanics, essential in a myriad of physiological processes. Here we demonstrate a liquid phase of actin filaments in the presence of the physiological cross-linker, filamin. Filamin condenses short actin filaments into spindle-shaped droplets, or tactoids, with shape dynamics consistent with a continuum model of anisotropic liquids. We find that cross-linker density controls the droplet shape and deformation timescales, consistent with a variable interfacial tension and viscosity. Near the liquid-solid transition, cross-linked actin bundles show behaviors reminiscent of fluid threads, including capillary instabilities and contraction. These data reveal a liquid droplet phase of actin, demixed from the surrounding solution and dominated by interfacial tension. These results suggest a mechanism to control organization, morphology, and dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Actin", "Cytoskeleton", "Liquid crystal", "Phase separation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Actin Cytoskeleton", "Actins", "Cross-Linking Reagents", "Elasticity", "Filamins", "Kinetics", "Models, Biological", "Solutions", "Thermodynamics", "Viscosity"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85014303368", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"26644564500": {"Name": "Weirich K.", "AuthorID": "26644564500", "AffiliationID": "60117872, 60029278", "AffiliationName": "James Franck Institute, University of Chicago"}, "53363223100": {"Name": "Banerjee S.", "AuthorID": "53363223100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for the Physics of Living Systems, University College London"}, "56521674400": {"Name": "Dasbiswas K.", "AuthorID": "56521674400", "AffiliationID": "60117872, 60029278", "AffiliationName": "James Franck Institute, University of Chicago"}, "7005441544": {"Name": "Witten T.", "AuthorID": "7005441544", "AffiliationID": "60029278", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of Chicago"}, "24282172600": {"Name": "Vaikuntanathan S.", "AuthorID": "24282172600", "AffiliationID": "60029278", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Chicago"}, "57207515432": {"Name": "Gardel M.", "AuthorID": "57207515432", "AffiliationID": "60117829, 60029278", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Biophysical Dynamics, University of Chicago"}}}
