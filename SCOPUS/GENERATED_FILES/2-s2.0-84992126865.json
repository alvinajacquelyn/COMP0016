No review has been available to guide clinicians through the pitfalls and the initial diagnostic approach to pediatric TDR. Methods: A Medline thorough search on TDR was conducted using different queries. English language citations were identified during the period of January 2000 through December 2014 limiting the search to pediatric age (0\u201318 years). Abstracts were reviewed to determine eligibility and texts were obtained for further review. Differences were resolved by consensus and only reliable data were included. Results: Most frequently reported presenting symptoms of TDR are respiratory and abdominal. While respiratory symptoms are among the most frequently described at the onset in pediatric and adult series, abdominal symptoms result to be more frequent in adult than pediatric patients. Chest X-ray (CXR) is the first-line imaging exam which is reported to show pathognomonic or suspect findings in 85 %. CT was the second main radiological technique used, in particular to confirm the suspicion of TDR. Conclusions: A high clinical index of suspicion is needed to diagnose and effectively manage diaphragmatic rupture. TDR should be kept in mind while dealing with patients assessed for abdominal or respiratory symptoms whenever there is history of trauma or blunt injury especially in children as the increasing of non-operative management of blunt abdominal trauma could result in missing important injuries as TDR.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Diaphragam rupture", "Pediatric emergency surgery", "Pediatric trauma", "Pediatrics"], "IndexKeywords": ["Abdominal Injuries", "Child", "Diagnosis, Differential", "Diaphragm", "Hernia, Diaphragmatic, Traumatic", "Humans", "Rupture", "Wounds, Nonpenetrating"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84992126865", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Emergency Medicine", "MEDI", "2711"], ["Orthopedics and Sports Medicine", "MEDI", "2732"], ["Critical Care and Intensive Care Medicine", "MEDI", "2706"]], "AuthorData": {"57191623561": {"Name": "Marzona F.", "AuthorID": "57191623561", "AffiliationID": "60015397, 60025965", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatrics, S.
