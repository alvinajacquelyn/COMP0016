The aim of this review was to gather a body of evidence for the concept of a window of therapeutic opportunity, defined as a time interval following initial-onset disease during which adequate treatment will substantially modify the disease outcome and possibly even lead to cure, similar to what has been described for rheumatoid arthritis. Methods: We reviewed the literature and consulted leading experts in VKH disease to determine the consensus for the notion of a therapeutic window of opportunity in VKH disease. Results: We found a substantial body of evidence in the literature that a therapeutic window of opportunity exists for initial-onset acute uveitis associated with VKH disease. The disease outcome can be substantially improved if dual systemic steroidal and non-steroidal immunosuppressants are given within 2\u20133 weeks of the onset of initial VKH disease, avoiding evolution to chronic disease and development of \u201csunset glow fundus.\u201d Several studies additionally report series in which the disease could be cured, using such an approach. Conclusions: There is substantial evidence for a therapeutic window of opportunity in initial-onset acute VKH disease. Timely and adequate treatment led to substantial improvement of disease outcome and prevented chronic evolution and \u201csunset glow fundus,\u201d and very early treatment led to the cure after discontinuation of therapy in several series, likely due to the fact that the choroid is the sole origin of inflammation in VKH disease.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Autoimmune disease", "Immunosuppressive therapy", "Indocyanine green angiography", "Sunset glow fundus", "Therapeutic window of opportunity stromal choroiditis", "Vogt\u2013Koyanagi\u2013Harada disease"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adrenal Cortex Hormones", "Humans", "Immunosuppressive Agents", "Time-to-Treatment", "Uveitis", "Uveomeningoencephalitic Syndrome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85048370494", "SubjectAreas": [["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"]], "AuthorData": {"7005261600": {"Name": "Herbort C.P.", "AuthorID": "7005261600", "AffiliationID": "60000239", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, University of Lausanne"}, "7005292725": {"Name": "Abu El Asrar A.M.", "AuthorID": "7005292725", "AffiliationID": "60029533, 60013183", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology and Dr. Nasser Al-Rashid Research Chair in Ophthalmology, College of Medicine, King Saud University"}, "57191963612": {"Name": "Takeuchi M.", "AuthorID": "57191963612", "AffiliationID": "60019916", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, National Defence Medical College"}, "7003495942": {"Name": "Pav\u00e9sio C.E.", "AuthorID": "7003495942", "AffiliationID": "60016691, 60022148, 60172638, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health Research, Biomedical Research Centre at Moorfields Eye Hospital, NHS Foundation Trust and UCL, Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "7006149753": {"Name": "Couto C.", "AuthorID": "7006149753", "AffiliationID": "60001563", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, University of Buenos Aires"}, "37161509900": {"Name": "Hedayatfar A.", "AuthorID": "37161509900", "AffiliationID": "60159736, 60024852", "AffiliationName": "Noor Eye Hospital and Rassoul Akram Hospital, Iran University of Medical Sciences"}, "7402479419": {"Name": "Maruyama K.", "AuthorID": "7402479419", "AffiliationID": "60024322, 60175967", "AffiliationName": "Department of Innovative Visual Science, Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka University"}, "57202440973": {"Name": "Rao X.", "AuthorID": "57202440973", "AffiliationID": "60012464", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, General Police Hospital, University of Chile"}, "55332766100": {"Name": "Silpa-archa S.", "AuthorID": "55332766100", "AffiliationID": "60023366, 60005255", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, Faculty of Medicine, Rajavithi Hospital, College of Medicine, Rangsit University"}, "55257645700": {"Name": "Somkijrungroj T.", "AuthorID": "55257645700", "AffiliationID": "60028190", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University"}}}
