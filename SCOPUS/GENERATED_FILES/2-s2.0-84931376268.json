Current clinical factors confer little power for predicting response and, in current practice, an unsatisfactory 'trial and error' approach governs therapeutic decisions. Candidate gene and unbiased genome-wide investigations have sought to identify genetic biomarkers that predict who will respond to anti-TNF drugs before the drug is administered. To date, few studies have yielded robust associations; herein, we discuss currently identified associations and the issues that need to be addressed in future investigations including insufficient power and an inadequate measure of disease activity. The potential for alternative predictors of anti-TNF therapy response from transcriptomic and epigenetic data will also be explored.", "AuthorKeywords": ["anti-TNF", "biologics", "biomarker", "GWAS", "prediction", "rheumatoid arthritis", "treatment response"], "IndexKeywords": ["Arthritis, Rheumatoid", "Epigenomics", "Gene Expression Profiling", "Genetic Markers", "Humans", "Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84931376268", "SubjectAreas": [["Drug Discovery", "PHAR", "3002"], ["Clinical Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1308"], ["Biochemistry (medical)", "MEDI", "2704"]], "AuthorData": {"56689109700": {"Name": "Oliver J.", "AuthorID": "56689109700", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "Arthritis Research UK Centre for Genetics and Genomics, Institute of Inflammation and Repair, University Of Manchester"}, "56689271800": {"Name": "Webster A.P.", "AuthorID": "56689271800", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "Arthritis Research UK Centre for Genetics and Genomics, Institute of Inflammation and Repair, University Of Manchester"}, "35352277600": {"Name": "Barton A.", "AuthorID": "35352277600", "AffiliationID": "113496107", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Manchester Musculoskeletal Biomedical Research Unit, Manchester Academy of Health Sciences"}, "12761963000": {"Name": "Plant D.", "AuthorID": "12761963000", "AffiliationID": "113496107", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Manchester Musculoskeletal Biomedical Research Unit, Manchester Academy of Health Sciences"}}}
