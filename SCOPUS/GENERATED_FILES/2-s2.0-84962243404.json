Habit Reversal Training (HRT) is effective but has not, until now, been empirically evaluated in groups.This randomised controlled trial evaluated feasibility and preliminary efficacy of eight HRT group sessions compared to eight Education group sessions. Thirty-three children aged 9-13 years with TS or Chronic Tic Disorder took part. Outcomes evaluated were tic severity and quality of life (QoL).Tic severity improvements were found in both groups. Motor tic severity (Yale Global Tic Severity Scale) showed greatest improvements in the HRT group. Both groups showed a strong tendency toward improvements in patient reported QoL.In conclusion, group-based treatments for TS are feasible and exposure to other children with tics did not increase tic expression. HRT led to greater reductions in tic severity than Education. Implications, such as cost-effectiveness of treatment delivery, are discussed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Children", "Education", "Group", "Habit reversal training", "Randomised controlled trial", "Tourette syndrome"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Behavior Therapy", "Child", "Female", "Habits", "Humans", "Male", "Patient Education as Topic", "Psychiatric Status Rating Scales", "Psychotherapy, Group", "Quality of Life", "Severity of Illness Index", "Single-Blind Method", "Tourette Syndrome", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84962243404", "SubjectAreas": [["Experimental and Cognitive Psychology", "PSYC", "3205"], ["Clinical Psychology", "PSYC", "3203"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"57198322826": {"Name": "Yates R.", "AuthorID": "57198322826", "AffiliationID": "60020595", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Royal Holloway, University of London"}, "8717521100": {"Name": "Luzon O.", "AuthorID": "8717521100", "AffiliationID": "60020595", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Royal Holloway, University of London"}, "16318592600": {"Name": "Evangeli M.", "AuthorID": "16318592600", "AffiliationID": "60020595", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Royal Holloway, University of London"}, "57188688632": {"Name": "Edwards K.", "AuthorID": "57188688632", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London"}, "7404245327": {"Name": "King J.", "AuthorID": "7404245327", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London"}, "56579806000": {"Name": "Stark D.", "AuthorID": "56579806000", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Tourette Syndrome Clinic, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}, "56183902800": {"Name": "McFarlane F.", "AuthorID": "56183902800", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "7003916653": {"Name": "Heyman I.", "AuthorID": "7003916653", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "7401632130": {"Name": "Murphy T.", "AuthorID": "7401632130", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "57206523909": {"Name": "Ince B.", "AuthorID": "57206523909", "AffiliationID": "60086160", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Istanbul Arel University"}, "16637246500": {"Name": "Kodric J.", "AuthorID": "16637246500", "AffiliationID": "60021479", "AffiliationName": "Division of Paediatrics, University Medical Centre Ljubljana"}}}
