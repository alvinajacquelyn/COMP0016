{"Title": "When Habits Are Dangerous: Alcohol Expectancies and Habitual Decision Making Predict Relapse in Alcohol Dependence", "Year": 2017, "Source": "Biol. Psychiatry", "Volume": "82", "Issue": 11, "Art.No": null, "PageStart": 847, "PageEnd": 856, "CitedBy": 57, "DOI": "10.1016/j.biopsych.2017.04.019", "Link": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85021410187&origin=inward", "Abstract": "\u00a9 2017 Society of Biological PsychiatryBackground: Addiction is supposedly characterized by a shift from goal-directed to habitual decision making, thus facilitating automatic drug intake. The two-step task allows distinguishing between these mechanisms by computationally modeling goal-directed and habitual behavior as model-based and model-free control. In addicted patients, decision making may also strongly depend upon drug-associated expectations. Therefore, we investigated model-based versus model-free decision making and its neural correlates as well as alcohol expectancies in alcohol-dependent patients and healthy controls and assessed treatment outcome in patients. Methods: Ninety detoxified, medication-free, alcohol-dependent patients and 96 age- and gender-matched control subjects underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging during the two-step task. Alcohol expectancies were measured with the Alcohol Expectancy Questionnaire. Over a follow-up period of 48 weeks, 37 patients remained abstinent and 53 patients relapsed as indicated by the Alcohol Timeline Followback method. Results: Patients who relapsed displayed reduced medial prefrontal cortex activation during model-based decision making. Furthermore, high alcohol expectancies were associated with low model-based control in relapsers, while the opposite was observed in abstainers and healthy control subjects. However, reduced model-based control per se was not associated with subsequent relapse. Conclusions: These findings suggest that poor treatment outcome in alcohol dependence does not simply result from a shift from model-based to model-free control but is instead dependent on the interaction between high drug expectancies and low model-based decision making. Reduced model-based medial prefrontal cortex signatures in those who relapse point to a neural correlate of relapse risk. These observations suggest that therapeutic interventions should target subjective alcohol expectancies.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alcohol dependence", "Alcohol expectancy", "Goal-directed control", "Medial prefrontal cortex", "Reinforcement learning", "Treatment outcome"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Alcoholism", "Decision Making", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Habits", "Humans", "Image Processing, Computer-Assisted", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Neuropsychological Tests", "Oxygen", "Prefrontal Cortex", "Recurrence", "Reward", "Surveys and Questionnaires"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85021410187", "SubjectAreas": [["Biological Psychiatry", "NEUR", "2803"]], "AuthorData": {"55883714500": {"Name": "Sebold M.", "AuthorID": "55883714500", "AffiliationID": "60021763", "AffiliationName": "Social and Preventive Medicine, Area of Excellence Cognitive Sciences, University of Potsdam"}, "55885191500": {"Name": "Garbusow M.", "AuthorID": "55885191500", "AffiliationID": "60026245", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Charit\u00e9\u2013Universit\u00e4tsmedizin Berlin, Campus Charit\u00e9 Mitte"}, "55234239900": {"Name": "Guggenmos M.", "AuthorID": "55234239900", "AffiliationID": "60026245", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Charit\u00e9\u2013Universit\u00e4tsmedizin Berlin, Campus Charit\u00e9 Mitte"}, "35301843000": {"Name": "Beck A.", "AuthorID": "35301843000", "AffiliationID": "60026245", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Charit\u00e9\u2013Universit\u00e4tsmedizin Berlin, Campus Charit\u00e9 Mitte"}, "57194655719": {"Name": "Frank R.", "AuthorID": "57194655719", "AffiliationID": "60026245", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Charit\u00e9\u2013Universit\u00e4tsmedizin Berlin, Campus Charit\u00e9 Mitte"}, "11140368800": {"Name": "Schlagenhauf F.", "AuthorID": "11140368800", "AffiliationID": "60025323", "AffiliationName": "Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences"}, "57201513357": {"Name": "Heinz A.", "AuthorID": "57201513357", "AffiliationID": "60026245", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Charit\u00e9\u2013Universit\u00e4tsmedizin Berlin, Campus Charit\u00e9 Mitte"}, "24773657200": {"Name": "Schad D.J.", "AuthorID": "24773657200", "AffiliationID": "60021763", "AffiliationName": "Social and Preventive Medicine, Area of Excellence Cognitive Sciences, University of Potsdam"}, "56577545000": {"Name": "Rapp M.A.", "AuthorID": "56577545000", "AffiliationID": "60021763", "AffiliationName": "Social and Preventive Medicine, Area of Excellence Cognitive Sciences, University of Potsdam"}, "56578674400": {"Name": "Nebe S.", "AuthorID": "56578674400", "AffiliationID": "60018353", "AffiliationName": "Neuroimaging Center, Technische Universit\u00e4t Dresden"}, "56417251500": {"Name": "Sommer C.", "AuthorID": "56417251500", "AffiliationID": "60018353", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Technische Universit\u00e4t Dresden"}, "35313260200": {"Name": "Zimmermann U.S.", "AuthorID": "35313260200", "AffiliationID": "60018353", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Technische Universit\u00e4t Dresden"}, "7003876844": {"Name": "Smolka M.N.", "AuthorID": "7003876844", "AffiliationID": "60018353", "AffiliationName": "Neuroimaging Center, Technische Universit\u00e4t Dresden"}, "36560275600": {"Name": "Kuitunen-Paul S.", "AuthorID": "36560275600", "AffiliationID": "60018353", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Clinical Psychology and Psychotherapy, Technische Universit\u00e4t Dresden"}, "6603939315": {"Name": "Neu P.", "AuthorID": "6603939315", "AffiliationID": "60017504", "AffiliationName": "J\u00fcdisches Krankenhaus Berlin"}, "14056255700": {"Name": "Huys Q.J.M.", "AuthorID": "14056255700", "AffiliationID": "60012614", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Addictive Disorders, Department of Psychiatry, Psychotherapy and Psychosomatics, Hospital of Psychiatry, University of Z\u00fcrich"}}}
