However, there is limited information on GM-CSFR expression in human central nervous system (CNS), peripheral nerves, or dorsal root ganglia (DRG), particularly in chronic pain conditions. Objectives: Immunohistochemistry was used to quantify GM-CSFR expression levels in human tissues, and functional sensory effects of GM-CSF were studied in cultured DRG neurons. Results: Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor was markedly increased in microglia at lesional sites of multiple sclerosis spinal cords (P = 0.01), which co-localised with macrophage marker CD68 (P = 0.009). In human DRG, GM-CSFR was expressed in a subset of small/medium diameter cells (30%) and few large cells (10%), with no significant change in avulsion-injured DRG. In peripheral nerves, there was a marked decrease in axonal GM-CSFR after chronic painful nerve injury (P = 0.004) and in painful neuromas (P = 0.0043); CD-68-positive macrophages were increased (P = 0.017) but did not appear to express GM-CSFR. Although control synovium showed absent GM-CSFR immunostaining, this was markedly increased in macrophages of painful osteoarthritis knee synovium. Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor was expressed in 17 \u00b1 1.7% of small-/medium-sized cultured adult rat DRG neurons, and in 27 \u00b1 3.3% of TRPV1-positive neurons. Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor treatment sensitized capsaicin responses in vitro, which were diminished by p38 MAPK or TrkA inhibitors. Conclusion: Our findings support GM-CSFR as a therapeutic target for pain and hypersensitivity in clinical CNS and peripheral inflammatory conditions. Although GM-CSFR was decreased in chronic painful injured peripheral nerves, it could mediate CNS neuroinflammatory effects, which deserves study. \u00a9", "AuthorKeywords": ["DRG neurons", "GM-CSFR", "Human spinal cord", "Hypersensitivity", "Injured nerves", "Macrophages", "Microglia", "Multiple sclerosis"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85060809096", "SubjectAreas": [["Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine", "MEDI", "2703"]], "AuthorData": {"57208973531": {"Name": "Donatien P.", "AuthorID": "57208973531", "AffiliationID": "122075034", "AffiliationName": "Peripheral Neuropathy Unit, Centre for Clinical Translation, Department of Medicine"}, "6701372019": {"Name": "Anand U.", "AuthorID": "6701372019", "AffiliationID": "60020416", "AffiliationName": "Nanomedicine Research Laboratory, Department of Medicine, Hammersmith Hospital"}, "7003464380": {"Name": "Yiangou Y.", "AuthorID": "7003464380", "AffiliationID": "122075034", "AffiliationName": "Peripheral Neuropathy Unit, Centre for Clinical Translation, Department of Medicine"}, "16647168000": {"Name": "Sinisi M.", "AuthorID": "16647168000", "AffiliationID": "60024067", "AffiliationName": "Peripheral Nerve Injury Unit, Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital"}, "24775715300": {"Name": "Fox M.", "AuthorID": "24775715300", "AffiliationID": "60024067", "AffiliationName": "Peripheral Nerve Injury Unit, Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital"}, "6701402766": {"Name": "MacQuillan A.", "AuthorID": "6701402766", "AffiliationID": "60024067", "AffiliationName": "Peripheral Nerve Injury Unit, Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital"}, "56636855000": {"Name": "Quick T.", "AuthorID": "56636855000", "AffiliationID": "60024067", "AffiliationName": "Peripheral Nerve Injury Unit, Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital"}, "35472567900": {"Name": "Anand P.", "AuthorID": "35472567900", "AffiliationID": "122075034", "AffiliationName": "Peripheral Neuropathy Unit, Centre for Clinical Translation, Department of Medicine"}, "7003553167": {"Name": "Korchev Y.E.", "AuthorID": "7003553167", "AffiliationID": "60020416", "AffiliationName": "Nanomedicine Research Laboratory, Department of Medicine, Hammersmith Hospital"}}}
