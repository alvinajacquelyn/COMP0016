However, these measures are affected by UV light exposure. Circulating 25(OH)D2, however, solely represents dietary intake of vitamin D2, but its association with complications of diabetes is currently unknown. We investigated the associations between 25(OH)D2 and 25(OH)D3 and the prevalence of albuminuria, retinopathy and cardiovascular disease (CVD) in individuals with type 1 diabetes. Methods: We measured circulating 25(OH)D2 and 25(OH)D3 in 532 individuals (40 \u00b1 10 years old, 51 % men) with type 1 diabetes who participated in the EURODIAB Prospective Complications Study. Cross-sectional associations of 25(OH)D2 and 25(OH)D3 with albuminuria, retinopathy and CVD were assessed with multiple logistic regression analyses adjusted for age, sex, season, BMI, smoking, HbA1c, total-HDL-cholesterol-ratio, systolic blood pressure, antihypertensive medication, eGFR, physical activity, alcohol intake, albuminuria, retinopathy and CVD, as appropriate. Results: Fully adjusted models revealed that 1 nmol/L higher 25(OH)D2 and 10 nmol/L higher 25(OH)D3 were associated with lower prevalence of macroalbuminuria with ORs (95 % CI) of 0.56 (0.43;0.74) and 0.82 (0.72;0.94), respectively. These vitamin D species were not independently associated with microalbuminuria, non-proliferative and proliferative retinopathy or CVD. Conclusions: In individuals with type 1 diabetes, both higher 25(OH)D2 and 25(OH)D3 are associated with a lower prevalence of macroalbuminuria, but not of retinopathy and CVD. Prospective studies are needed to further examine the associations between 25(OH)D2 and 25(OH)D3 and the development of microvascular complications and CVD in type 1 diabetes.", "AuthorKeywords": ["25-hydroxyvitamin D2", "25-hydroxyvitamin D3", "Albuminuria", "Cardiovascular disease", "Microvascular complications", "Retinopathy", "Type 1 diabetes", "Vitamin D"], "IndexKeywords": ["25-Hydroxyvitamin D 2", "Adult", "Albuminuria", "Calcifediol", "Cardiovascular Diseases", "Cohort Studies", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1", "Diabetic Angiopathies", "Diabetic Retinopathy", "Female", "Humans", "Logistic Models", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Prospective Studies", "Risk Factors", "Vitamin D Deficiency"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84930636813", "SubjectAreas": [["Internal Medicine", "MEDI", "2724"], ["Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism", "MEDI", "2712"], ["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"35069141200": {"Name": "Engelen L.", "AuthorID": "35069141200", "AffiliationID": "60084278", "AffiliationName": "Top Institute Food and Nutrition"}, "7006504041": {"Name": "Schalkwijk C.G.", "AuthorID": "7006504041", "AffiliationID": "60084278", "AffiliationName": "Top Institute Food and Nutrition"}, "24512592100": {"Name": "Scheijen J.L.", "AuthorID": "24512592100", "AffiliationID": "60070744, 60018869", "AffiliationName": "Maastricht University Medical Centre, CARIM School for Cardiovascular Diseases"}, "36051195700": {"Name": "Stehouwer C.D.", "AuthorID": "36051195700", "AffiliationID": "60084278", "AffiliationName": "Top Institute Food and Nutrition"}, "8883699500": {"Name": "Eussen S.J.", "AuthorID": "8883699500", "AffiliationID": "60029622", "AffiliationName": "University of Bergen, Department of Global Public Health and Primary Care"}, "57209976040": {"Name": "Soedamah-Muthu S.S.", "AuthorID": "57209976040", "AffiliationID": "60004156", "AffiliationName": "Wageningen University, Division of Human Nutrition"}, "7005513520": {"Name": "Chaturvedi N.", "AuthorID": "7005513520", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "International Centre for Circulatory Health, National Heart and Lung Institute, Imperial College London"}, "7202037574": {"Name": "Fuller J.H.", "AuthorID": "7202037574", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College, Department of Epidemiology and Public Health"}}}
