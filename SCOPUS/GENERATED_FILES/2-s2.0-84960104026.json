The G Raman emission can be described by a superposition of two incoherent orthogonal point dipoles oriented in the graphene plane. Due to double resonant Raman scattering, the 2D emission can be represented by the sum of either three incoherent dipoles oriented 120\u00b0with respect to each other, or two orthogonal incoherent ones with a 3:1 weight ratio. Parameter-free calculations of the G and 2D intensities are in excellent agreement with the experimental radiation patterns. We show that the 2D polarization ratio and the 2D/G intensity ratio depend on the numerical aperture of the microscope objective. This is due to the depolarization of the emission and excitation light when graphene is on a dielectric substrate, as well as to tight focusing. The polarization contrast decreases substantially for increasing collection angle, due to polarization mixing caused by the air-dielectric interface. This also influences the intensity ratio I(2D)/I(G), a crucial quantity for estimating the doping in graphene. Our results are thus important for the quantitative analysis of the Raman intensities in confocal microscopy. In addition, they are relevant for understanding the influence of signal enhancing plasmonic antenna structures, which typically modify the sample's radiation pattern.", "AuthorKeywords": ["graphene", "radiation patterns", "Raman scattering"], "IndexKeywords": ["Air-dielectric interface", "Antenna structures", "Dielectric substrates", "Microscope objective", "Numerical aperture", "Polarization contrast", "Polarization mixing", "Resonant Raman scattering"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84960104026", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Engineering (all)", "ENGI", "2200"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"55762770100": {"Name": "Budde H.", "AuthorID": "55762770100", "AffiliationID": "60028717", "AffiliationName": "Department Chemie and CeNS, LMU Munich"}, "57160361300": {"Name": "Coca-L\u00f3pez N.", "AuthorID": "57160361300", "AffiliationID": "60028717", "AffiliationName": "Department Chemie and CeNS, LMU Munich"}, "55857206100": {"Name": "Shi X.", "AuthorID": "55857206100", "AffiliationID": "60028717", "AffiliationName": "Department Chemie and CeNS, LMU Munich"}, "55946435500": {"Name": "Ciesielski R.", "AuthorID": "55946435500", "AffiliationID": "60028717", "AffiliationName": "Department Chemie and CeNS, LMU Munich"}, "55308896200": {"Name": "Hartschuh A.", "AuthorID": "55308896200", "AffiliationID": "60028717", "AffiliationName": "Department Chemie and CeNS, LMU Munich"}, "25632490300": {"Name": "Lombardo A.", "AuthorID": "25632490300", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Cambridge Graphene Centre, University of Cambridge"}, "26321261800": {"Name": "Yoon D.", "AuthorID": "26321261800", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Cambridge Graphene Centre, University of Cambridge"}, "56070579300": {"Name": "Ferrari A.", "AuthorID": "56070579300", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Cambridge Graphene Centre, University of Cambridge"}}}
