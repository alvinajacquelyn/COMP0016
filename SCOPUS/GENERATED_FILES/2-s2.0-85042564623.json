Maximum standardised uptake (SUVmax) values were similar in lymphoma and mycobacterial and fungal infections and were lower but similar in those with human herpesvirus (HHV) 8-associated disease and HIV-associated reactive lymphadenopathy. Nodal 18FDG avidity, with SUVmax \u226510, excluded diagnoses of HHV 8-associated disease and miscellaneous conditions, and HIV-associated reactive lymphadenopathy was additionally excluded in those who had undetectable plasma HIV viral loads. This audit suggests 18FDG PET-CT imaging did not permit discrimination between specific diagnoses but has utility in identifying lymph nodes with increased avidity that could be targeted for biopsy and in ruling out significant pathology.", "AuthorKeywords": ["18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography-computed tomography imaging", "Castleman disease", "Fever", "HIV infection", "infection", "Kaposi sarcoma", "lymph node biopsy", "lymphoma", "pyrexia of undetermined origin"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Clinical Audit", "Female", "Fever of Unknown Origin", "Fluorodeoxyglucose F18", "HIV Infections", "Humans", "Lymph Nodes", "Lymphadenopathy", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Positron Emission Tomography Computed Tomography", "Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy", "Splenomegaly"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85042564623", "SubjectAreas": [["Dermatology", "MEDI", "2708"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"57191420006": {"Name": "Jain L.", "AuthorID": "57191420006", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57200880558": {"Name": "Mackenzie S.", "AuthorID": "57200880558", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "56601072600": {"Name": "Edwards S.G.", "AuthorID": "56601072600", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "55547118657": {"Name": "Miller R.F.", "AuthorID": "55547118657", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Research Department, Faculty of Infectious and Tropical Diseases, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "57195363908": {"Name": "Noursadeghi M.", "AuthorID": "57195363908", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London"}, "7005791371": {"Name": "Bomanji J.B.", "AuthorID": "7005791371", "AffiliationID": "60024544, 60090043", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Nuclear Medicine, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "56004642300": {"Name": "Shortman R.", "AuthorID": "56004642300", "AffiliationID": "60024544, 60090043", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Nuclear Medicine, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
