How NF-\u03ba B is regulated by multiple activating receptors that are engaged during natural killer (NK)-target cell contact remains undefined. Here we show that sole engagement of NKG2D, 2B4 or DNAM-1 is insufficient for NF-\u03ba B activation. Rather, cooperation between these receptors is required at the level of Vav1 for synergistic NF-\u03ba B activation. Vav1-dependent synergistic signalling requires a separate PI3K-Akt signal, primarily mediated by NKG2D or DNAM-1, for optimal p65 phosphorylation and NF-\u03ba B activation. Vav1 controls downstream p65 phosphorylation and NF-\u03ba B activation. Synergistic signalling is defective in X-linked lymphoproliferative disease (XLP1) NK cells entailing 2B4 dysfunction and required for p65 phosphorylation by PI3K-Akt signal, suggesting stepwise signalling checkpoint for NF-\u03ba B activation. Thus, our study provides a framework explaining how signals from different activating receptors are coordinated to determine specificity and magnitude of NF-\u03ba B activation and NK cell responses.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte", "Humans", "Killer Cells, Natural", "Lymphoproliferative Disorders", "NF-kappa B", "NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily K", "Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-vav", "Signaling Lymphocytic Activation Molecule Family"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84971325230", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"55887051200": {"Name": "Kwon H.J.", "AuthorID": "55887051200", "AffiliationID": "60006240", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of Ulsan College of Medicine"}, "36006155700": {"Name": "Choi G.E.", "AuthorID": "36006155700", "AffiliationID": "60016209", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Convergence Bio-Health, Dong-A University"}, "56673343400": {"Name": "Kwon S.J.", "AuthorID": "56673343400", "AffiliationID": "60006240", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of Ulsan College of Medicine"}, "57013623200": {"Name": "Kim H.S.", "AuthorID": "57013623200", "AffiliationID": "60006240", "AffiliationName": "Cellular Dysfunction Research Center, University of Ulsan College of Medicine"}, "7402110940": {"Name": "Ryu S.", "AuthorID": "7402110940", "AffiliationID": "60120231, 60013682", "AffiliationName": "Department of Food and Animal Biotechnology, Department of Agricultural Biotechnology, Seoul National University"}, "8242246500": {"Name": "Kim S.C.", "AuthorID": "8242246500", "AffiliationID": "60032144", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biological Sciences, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology"}, "7203045714": {"Name": "Booth C.", "AuthorID": "7203045714", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Molecular Immunology Unit, Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "35516174000": {"Name": "Nichols K.E.", "AuthorID": "35516174000", "AffiliationID": "101333069", "AffiliationName": "Department of Oncology, Division of Cancer Predisposition, Jude Children's Research Hospital"}}}
