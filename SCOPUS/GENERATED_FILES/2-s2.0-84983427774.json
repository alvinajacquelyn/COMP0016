A power conversion efficiency of up to 6.5% was realized in the single NW solar cell (horizontally lying on substrate) without any surface passivation. Electron beam induced current (EBIC) and photocurrent mapping were performed to investigate the electrical properties of the NW solar cells and their influence on device performance, which are essential for an in-depth understanding of the design requirements for NW solar cells. A further conformal SiNx layer was deposited on the single NW solar cell devices by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD). Overall efficiency improvement has been obtained in the SiNx-coated devices with a remarkable up to 62% increase to a peak efficiency of 10.5%, which to our knowledge is the highest efficiency reported for horizontal single NW solar cells. This has been attributed to an enhanced optical antenna effect and effective surface passivation due to SiNx coating, as respectively confirmed by numerical simulation and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) measurements. Our work demonstrates that dielectric coating is a promising simple approach to achieve high performance III\u2013V NW solar cells.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Axial junction", "Dielectric coating", "EBIC", "III\u2013V semiconductors", "Nanowire solar cells", "Selective-area MOVPE"], "IndexKeywords": ["Axial junction", "Dielectric coatings", "EBIC", "Electron-beam-induced current", "Metal-organic vapor phase epitaxy", "Plasma enhanced chemical vapor depositions (PE CVD)", "Selective areas", "Time-resolved photoluminescence"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84983427774", "SubjectAreas": [["Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment", "ENER", "2105"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"8304932300": {"Name": "Zhong Z.", "AuthorID": "8304932300", "AffiliationID": "60005465", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Fundamental and Frontier Science, State Key Laboratory of Electronic Thin Films and Integrated Devices, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China"}, "55787220500": {"Name": "Li Z.", "AuthorID": "55787220500", "AffiliationID": "60008950", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic Materials Engineering, Research School of Physics and Engineering, The Australian National University"}, "55635555000": {"Name": "Gao Q.", "AuthorID": "55635555000", "AffiliationID": "60008950", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic Materials Engineering, Research School of Physics and Engineering, The Australian National University"}, "55635972800": {"Name": "Peng K.", "AuthorID": "55635972800", "AffiliationID": "60008950", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic Materials Engineering, Research School of Physics and Engineering, The Australian National University"}, "8601798900": {"Name": "Mokkapati S.", "AuthorID": "8601798900", "AffiliationID": "60008950", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic Materials Engineering, Research School of Physics and Engineering, The Australian National University"}, "7401812898": {"Name": "Fu L.", "AuthorID": "7401812898", "AffiliationID": "60008950", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic Materials Engineering, Research School of Physics and Engineering, The Australian National University"}, "7403011080": {"Name": "Tan H.H.", "AuthorID": "7403011080", "AffiliationID": "60008950", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic Materials Engineering, Research School of Physics and Engineering, The Australian National University"}, "36014192000": {"Name": "Jagadish C.", "AuthorID": "36014192000", "AffiliationID": "60008950", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic Materials Engineering, Research School of Physics and Engineering, The Australian National University"}, "10141185300": {"Name": "Wu J.", "AuthorID": "10141185300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "56521888600": {"Name": "Zhang G.", "AuthorID": "56521888600", "AffiliationID": "60005465", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Fundamental and Frontier Science, State Key Laboratory of Electronic Thin Films and Integrated Devices, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China"}, "54780880800": {"Name": "Wang Z.", "AuthorID": "54780880800", "AffiliationID": "60005465", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Fundamental and Frontier Science, State Key Laboratory of Electronic Thin Films and Integrated Devices, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China"}, "56549151900": {"Name": "Li Z.", "AuthorID": "56549151900", "AffiliationID": "60008950", "AffiliationName": "Department of Applied Mathematics, Research School of Physics and Engineering, The Australian National University"}, "56435415200": {"Name": "Li L.", "AuthorID": "56435415200", "AffiliationID": "60008950", "AffiliationName": "Australian National Fabrication Facility, Department of Electronic Materials Engineering, Research School of Physics and Engineering, The Australian National University"}, "7004421042": {"Name": "Vora K.", "AuthorID": "7004421042", "AffiliationID": "60008950", "AffiliationName": "Australian National Fabrication Facility, Department of Electronic Materials Engineering, Research School of Physics and Engineering, The Australian National University"}}}
