A clear description of local RSV molecular epidemiology, evolution, and transmission requires detailed sequence data and can inform new strategies for virus control and vaccine development. We have generated 27 complete or nearly complete genomes of RSV from hospitalized children attending a rural coastal district hospital in Kilifi, Kenya, over a 10-year period using a novel full-genome deep-sequencing process. Phylogenetic analysis of the new genomes demonstrated the existence and cocirculation of multiple genotypes in both RSV A and B groups in Kilifi. Comparison of local versus global strains demonstrated that most RSV A variants observed locally in Kilifi were also seen in other parts of the world, while the Kilifi RSV B genomes encoded a high degree of variation that was not observed in other parts of the world. The nucleotide substitution rates for the individual open reading frames (ORFs) were highest in the regions encoding the attachment (G) glycoprotein and the NS2 protein. The analysis of RSV full genomes, compared to subgenomic regions, provided more precise estimates of the RSV sequence changes and revealed important patterns of RSV genomic variation and global movement. The novel sequencing method and the new RSV genomic sequences reported here expand our knowledge base for large-scale RSV epidemiological and transmission studies.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Child, Preschool", "Cluster Analysis", "Evolution, Molecular", "Genome, Viral", "Genotype", "High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing", "Hospitals, Rural", "Humans", "Infant", "Infant, Newborn", "Kenya", "Molecular Sequence Data", "Phylogeography", "Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infections", "Respiratory Syncytial Virus, Human", "Sequence Analysis, DNA", "Sequence Homology"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84924767320", "SubjectAreas": [["Microbiology", "IMMU", "2404"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"], ["Insect Science", "AGRI", "1109"], ["Virology", "IMMU", "2406"]], "AuthorData": {"36489084300": {"Name": "Agoti C.N.", "AuthorID": "36489084300", "AffiliationID": "60066705", "AffiliationName": "KEMRI-Wellcome Trust Research Programme"}, "57210894285": {"Name": "Otieno J.R.", "AuthorID": "57210894285", "AffiliationID": "60066705", "AffiliationName": "KEMRI-Wellcome Trust Research Programme"}, "26533067900": {"Name": "Munywoki P.K.", "AuthorID": "26533067900", "AffiliationID": "60066705", "AffiliationName": "KEMRI-Wellcome Trust Research Programme"}, "55420690600": {"Name": "Mwihuri A.G.", "AuthorID": "55420690600", "AffiliationID": "60066705", "AffiliationName": "KEMRI-Wellcome Trust Research Programme"}, "7006232828": {"Name": "James Nokes D.", "AuthorID": "7006232828", "AffiliationID": "60022020", "AffiliationName": "University of Warwick, School of Life Sciences and WIDER"}, "7004646930": {"Name": "Cane P.A.", "AuthorID": "7004646930", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "Public Health England"}, "56839023100": {"Name": "Kellam P.", "AuthorID": "56839023100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection Immunity, University College London"}, "7005126445": {"Name": "Cotten M.", "AuthorID": "7005126445", "AffiliationID": "60005517", "AffiliationName": "The Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute"}}}
