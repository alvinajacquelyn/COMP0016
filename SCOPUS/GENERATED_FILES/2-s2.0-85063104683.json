The oxytocinergic system has been proposed as a pathophysiological candidate for AN. Oxytocin is a neuropeptide involved in bodily processes (eg, breast feeding) and in the onset of social behaviours (eg, bonding). Studies investigating the effect of intranasal oxytocin (IN-OT) in AN showed that it can improve attentional bias for high-calorie food and fat bodies stimuli, and related stress. However, less is known about the effect of IN-OT on bodily awareness and body image distortions, key features of the disorder linked to its development, prognosis and maintenance. Here, we aim to investigate the effect of IN-OT on the perception of affective, C-tactile-optimal touch, known to be impaired in AN and on multisensory integration processes underlying a body ownership illusion (ie, rubber hand illusion). For exploratory purposes, we will also investigate the effect of IN-OT on another interoceptive modality, namely cardiac awareness and its relationship with affective touch. Design, methods and analysis: Forty women with AN and forty matched healthy controls will be recruited and tested in two separate sessions; self-administering IN-OT (40 IU) or placebo, intranasally, in a pseudo-randomised manner. The data from this double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study will be analysed using linear mixed models that allow the use of both fixed (treatment levels) and random (subjects) effects in the same analysis. To address our main hypotheses, separate analyses will be run for the affective touch task, where the primary outcome dependent variable will be the pleasantness of the touch, and for the rubber hand illusion, where we will investigate multisensory integration quantified as subjective embodiment towards the rubber hand. In the latter, we will manipulate the synchronicity of touch and the size of the hand. Ethics and dissemination: Ethics approval has been obtained by National Research Ethics Service NRES Committee London (Queen's Square Committee, ref number 14/LO/1593). The results will be disseminated through conference presentations and publication in peer-reviewed journals.", "AuthorKeywords": ["affective touch", "Anorexia Nervosa", "interoception", "intranasal oxytocin", "multisensory integration"], "IndexKeywords": ["Administration, Intranasal", "Adolescent", "Adult", "Anorexia Nervosa", "Body Dysmorphic Disorders", "Body Image", "Cross-Over Studies", "Double-Blind Method", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Oxytocics", "Oxytocin", "Physical Stimulation", "Sensation", "Touch"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85063104683", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"55879967300": {"Name": "Crucianelli L.", "AuthorID": "55879967300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London"}, "55747914900": {"Name": "Serpell L.", "AuthorID": "55747914900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London"}, "26767738700": {"Name": "Fotopoulou A.", "AuthorID": "26767738700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London"}, "22941283900": {"Name": "Paloyelis Y.", "AuthorID": "22941283900", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroimaging Science, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London"}, "36167347400": {"Name": "Ricciardi L.", "AuthorID": "36167347400", "AffiliationID": "60010426", "AffiliationName": "Cardiovascular Sciences Research Centre, St George's Hospital"}, "57026349600": {"Name": "Robinson P.", "AuthorID": "57026349600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Medical Sciences, University College London"}, "6701922411": {"Name": "Jenkinson P.", "AuthorID": "6701922411", "AffiliationID": "60032760", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology and Sport Sciences, University of Hertfordshire"}}}
