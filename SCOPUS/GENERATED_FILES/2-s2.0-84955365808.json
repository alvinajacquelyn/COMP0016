The present study was conducted under the scope of EpiReumaPt a population-based study. Active CLBP was self-reported and considered if present on the day of the interview and for \u226590 days. Prevalence estimates were calculated. Association of active CLBP with quality of life, functional ability and healthcare consumption were evaluated. Factors associated with active CLBP were identified through logistic regression. Among 10.661 EpiReumaPt subjects, 1487 self-reported active CLBP. The prevalence of active CLBP was 10.4 % (95 % CI 9.6; 11.9 %). After adjustment, active CLBP subjects had a higher likelihood for anxiety symptoms (OR 2.77), early retirement due to disease (OR 1.88) and more physician visits (\u03b2 = 2.65). Factors significantly and independently associated with the presence of active CLBP were: female gender (OR 1.34), overweight/obesity (OR 1.27), presence of self-reported rheumatic musculoskeletal disease (RMD) (OR 2.93), anxiety symptoms (OR 2.67), age (OR 1.02) and higher number of self-reported comorbidities (OR 1.12). Active CLBP is highly prevalent in the Portuguese population and is associated with disability and with a high consumption of healthcare resources. Female gender, older age, anxiety symptoms, overweight/obesity, the presence of other RMD and the number of comorbidities were independently associated with the presence of active CLBP. These factors should be taken into account when new cohort prospective studies will be developed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Burden of disease", "Burden of low back pain", "Chronic low back pain", "Cross-sectional study", "Population-based study"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Age Factors", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Anxiety", "Case-Control Studies", "Chronic Pain", "Comorbidity", "Cost of Illness", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Disability Evaluation", "Female", "Health Resources", "Health Status", "Health Surveys", "Humans", "Linear Models", "Logistic Models", "Low Back Pain", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Multivariate Analysis", "Obesity", "Odds Ratio", "Office Visits", "Pain Measurement", "Portugal", "Prevalence", "Quality of Life", "Retirement", "Self Report", "Sex Factors", "Socioeconomic Factors", "Time Factors", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84955365808", "SubjectAreas": [["Rheumatology", "MEDI", "2745"], ["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"]], "AuthorData": {"55266661900": {"Name": "Gouveia N.", "AuthorID": "55266661900", "AffiliationID": "60031875", "AffiliationName": "EpiDoc Unit \u2013 Epidemiology of Chronic Diseases Unit (CEDOC, NMS/UNL)"}, "57189499663": {"Name": "Rodrigues A.", "AuthorID": "57189499663", "AffiliationID": "60106051", "AffiliationName": "Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Lisboa"}, "36551491700": {"Name": "Ramiro S.", "AuthorID": "36551491700", "AffiliationID": "60015618", "AffiliationName": "Leiden University Medical Center"}, "35243075300": {"Name": "Machado P.", "AuthorID": "35243075300", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Rheumatology Research & MRC Centre for Neuromuscular Diseases, University College London"}, "6602393492": {"Name": "Canh\u00e3o H.", "AuthorID": "6602393492", "AffiliationID": "60021007", "AffiliationName": "Rheumatology Unit of Hospital de Santa Maria \u2013 Centro Hospitalar Lisboa Norte (CHLN-E.P.E)"}, "8417815400": {"Name": "Branco J.", "AuthorID": "8417815400", "AffiliationID": "116110136", "AffiliationName": "Programa Nacional Contra as Doen\u00e7as Reum\u00e1ticas (2004\u20132014), Direc\u00e7\u00e3o Geral da Sa\u00fade"}, "57002991300": {"Name": "Eus\u00e9bio M.", "AuthorID": "57002991300", "AffiliationID": "113147004", "AffiliationName": "Portuguese Society of Rheumatology"}}}
