The first step in the diagnose of these diseases is the analysis of the electrocardiographic (ECG) signal. In turn, the ECG analysis begins with the detection of the QRS complex, which is the one with the most energy in the cardiac cycle. Numerous methods have been proposed in the bibliography for QRS complex detection, but few authors have analyzed the possibility of taking advantage of the information redundancy present in multiple ECG leads (simultaneously acquired) to produce accurate QRS detection. In our previous work we presented such an approach, proposing various data fusion techniques to combine the detections made by an algorithm on multiple ECG leads. In this paper we present further studies that show the advantages of this multi-lead detection approach, analyzing how many leads are necessary in order to observe an improvement in the detection performance. A well known QRS detection algorithm was used to test the fusion techniques on the St. Petersburg Institute of Cardiological Technics database. Results show improvement in the detection performance with as little as three leads, but the reliability of these results becomes interesting only after using seven or more leads. Results were evaluated using the detection error rate (DER). The multi-lead detection approach allows an improvement from DER = 3:04% to DER = 1:88%. Further works are to be made in order to improve the detection performance by implementing further fusion steps.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Digital Filtering", "ECG Signal Processing", "Optimal Data Fusion", "QRS Complex Detection"], "IndexKeywords": ["Detection performance", "Digital filtering", "ECG signal processing", "Electrocardiogram recordings", "Information redundancies", "Optimal data", "QRS complex detection", "QRS detection algorithms"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84958206480", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"56519965800": {"Name": "Ledezma C.", "AuthorID": "56519965800", "AffiliationID": "60026438", "AffiliationName": "Grupo de Bioingeniera y Biofsica Aplicada, Universidad Simon Bolivar"}, "56520426100": {"Name": "Perpina\u00f1 G.", "AuthorID": "56520426100", "AffiliationID": "60026438", "AffiliationName": "Grupo de Bioingeniera y Biofsica Aplicada, Universidad Simon Bolivar"}, "55369552500": {"Name": "Severeyn E.", "AuthorID": "55369552500", "AffiliationID": "60026438", "AffiliationName": "Grupo de Bioingeniera y Biofsica Aplicada, Universidad Simon Bolivar"}, "16174488900": {"Name": "Altuve M.", "AuthorID": "16174488900", "AffiliationID": "60046690", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Electronic Engineering, Pontifical Bolivarian University"}}}
