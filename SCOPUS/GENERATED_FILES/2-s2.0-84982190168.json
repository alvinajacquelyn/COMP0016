For this purpose, navigated beta-probe systems combined with 18F-based radiotracer, relying on activity distribution surface estimation, have been proposed to generate reconstructed images. The clinical relevancy has been outlined by early studies where intraoperative functional information is leveraged although inducing low spatial resolution in reconstruction. To improve reconstruction quality, multiple acquisition models have been proposed. They involve the definition of attenuation matrix for designing radiation detection physics. Yet, they require high computational power for efficient intraoperative use. To address the problem, we propose a new acquisition model called Partition Model (PM) considering an existing model where coefficients of the matrix are taken from a look-up table (LUT). Our model is based upon the division of the LUT into averaged homogeneous values for assigning attenuation coefficients. We validated our model using in vitro datasets, where tumors and peri-tumoral tissues have been simulated. We compared our acquisition model with the o-the-shelf LUT and the raw method. Acquisition models outperformed the raw method in term of tumor contrast (7.97:1 mean T:B) but with a difficulty of real-time use. Both acquisition models reached the same detection performance with references (0.8 mean AUC and 0.77 mean NCC), where PM slightly improves the mean tumor contrast up to 10.1:1 vs 9.9:1 with the LUT model and more importantly, it reduces the mean computation time by 7.5%. Our model gives a faster solution for an intraoperative use of navigated beta-probe surface imaging system, with improved image quality.", "AuthorKeywords": ["acquisition model", "beta probe", "computation time", "image-guided surgery", "intraoperative imaging", "navigation", "nuclear medicine", "reconstruction"], "IndexKeywords": ["Acquisition models", "Activity distribution", "Attenuation coefficient", "Computation time", "Functional information", "Image guided surgery", "Intra-operative imaging", "Reconstruction quality"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84982190168", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Biomaterials", "MATE", "2502"], ["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"], ["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"57194269662": {"Name": "Monge F.", "AuthorID": "57194269662", "AffiliationID": "60105589, 60030553", "AffiliationName": "LTSI, Campus de Villejean, Universite de Rennes 1"}, "57203216789": {"Name": "Jannin P.", "AuthorID": "57203216789", "AffiliationID": "60105589, 60030553", "AffiliationName": "LTSI, Campus de Villejean, Universite de Rennes 1"}, "38562092100": {"Name": "Shakir D.", "AuthorID": "38562092100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Translational Imaging Group, CMIC, University College London"}, "7003458998": {"Name": "Navab N.", "AuthorID": "7003458998", "AffiliationID": "60019722", "AffiliationName": "Computer Aided Medical Procedures (CAMP), Technische Universitat Munchen"}}}
