Published by Oxford University Press.We integrate two established modeling methods from disparate fields: mechanisms from the philosophy of science literature and intrusion kill chain modeling from the computer security literature. The result demonstrates that model accuracy can be improved by incorporating methods from philosophy of science. Modeling security accurately is a key function in the science of security. Mechanistic modeling of computer security incidents clarifies the existing model and points toward areas for substantive improvement for computer security professionals. Additional models of computer security incidents are translated mechanistically to compare results and to demonstrate such modeling can be applied in multiple situations. This integration of philosophy of science and computer security is sensible only by integrating new adaptations to mechanistic modeling, specifically conceived to enable better modeling of engineered systems such as computers. The results indicate continued integration of the fields of philosophy of science and information security will be fruitful.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Adversary modeling", "Incident response", "Investigative strategy", "Mechanisms", "Modeling", "Systems modeling"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adversary modeling", "Engineered systems", "Incident response", "Investigative strategy", "Mechanistic modeling", "Philosophy of science", "Security professionals", "Systems modeling"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85044166379", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Science (miscellaneous)", "COMP", "1701"], ["Social Psychology", "PSYC", "3207"], ["Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality", "ENGI", "2213"], ["Political Science and International Relations", "SOCI", "3320"], ["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"], ["Law", "SOCI", "3308"]], "AuthorData": {"56165471900": {"Name": "Spring J.M.", "AuthorID": "56165471900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Computer Science, University College London"}, "56989818100": {"Name": "Hatleback E.", "AuthorID": "56989818100", "AffiliationID": "60015543", "AffiliationName": "School of Computing and Information, University of Pittsburgh"}}}
