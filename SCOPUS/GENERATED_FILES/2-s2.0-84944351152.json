All rights reserved.Objective: To assess behavioral outcomes and social competence at 2 years of age in infants born late and moderately preterm (LMPT; 32-36 wk gestation). Method: One thousand one hundred and thirty LMPT infants and 1255 term-born (\u226537 wk) controls were recruited at birth to a prospective geographical population-based study. Parents completed the Brief Infant and Toddler Social Emotional Assessment (BITSEA) at 2 years corrected age to assess infants' behavior problems and social competence. Cognitive development was assessed using the Parent Report of Children's Abilities-Revised. Parent questionnaires at 2 years were completed for 638 (57%) LMPT and 765 (62%) term-born infants. Group differences in the prevalence of behavior problems and delayed social competence between LMPT infants and term-born controls were adjusted for age, sex, small-for-gestational-age, socioeconomic status and cognitive impairment. Results: Late and moderately preterm infants were at significantly increased risk of delayed social competence compared with term-born controls (26.4% vs 18.4%; adjusted-relative risk [RR] 1.28; 95% CI, 1.03-1.58), but there was no significant group difference in the prevalence of behavior problems (21.0% vs 17.6%; adjusted-RR 1.13, 0.89-1.42). Non-white ethnicity (RR 1.68, 1.26-2.24), medium (RR 1.60, 1.14-2.24) and high (RR 1.98, 1.41-2.75) socioeconomic risk and recreational drug use during pregnancy (RR 1.70, 1.03-2.82) were significant independent predictors of delayed social competence in LMPT infants. Conclusion: Birth at 32 to 36 weeks of gestation confers a specific risk for delayed social competence at 2 years of age. This may be indicative of an increased risk for psychiatric disorders later in childhood.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Behavior problems", "Infant", "Outcomes", "Preterm", "Social competence"], "IndexKeywords": ["Child Development", "Child, Preschool", "Female", "Gestational Age", "Humans", "Infant", "Infant, Premature", "Male", "Premature Birth", "Prospective Studies", "Risk Factors", "Social Skills"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84944351152", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"7406331158": {"Name": "Johnson S.", "AuthorID": "7406331158", "AffiliationID": "60033125", "AffiliationName": "Department of Health Sciences, University of Leicester"}, "57191367407": {"Name": "Matthews R.", "AuthorID": "57191367407", "AffiliationID": "60033125", "AffiliationName": "Department of Health Sciences, University of Leicester"}, "20733798900": {"Name": "Draper E.", "AuthorID": "20733798900", "AffiliationID": "60033125", "AffiliationName": "Department of Health Sciences, University of Leicester"}, "7202713033": {"Name": "Field D.", "AuthorID": "7202713033", "AffiliationID": "60033125", "AffiliationName": "Department of Health Sciences, University of Leicester"}, "57202150980": {"Name": "Manktelow B.", "AuthorID": "57202150980", "AffiliationID": "60033125", "AffiliationName": "Department of Health Sciences, University of Leicester"}, "8624238200": {"Name": "Smith L.", "AuthorID": "8624238200", "AffiliationID": "60033125", "AffiliationName": "Department of Health Sciences, University of Leicester"}, "7103365711": {"Name": "Boyle E.", "AuthorID": "7103365711", "AffiliationID": "60033125", "AffiliationName": "Department of Health Sciences, University of Leicester"}, "7006171979": {"Name": "Marlow N.", "AuthorID": "7006171979", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Academic Neonatology, Institute for Women's Health, University College London"}}}
