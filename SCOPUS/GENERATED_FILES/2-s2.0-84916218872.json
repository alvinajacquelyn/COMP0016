Published by Taylor & Francis.This article examines three New World democratic capital cities \u2013 Washington, Ottawa and Canberra \u2013 where the growing number of public memorials has spurred the development of official plans and policies to regulate the siting and design of future memorial proposals. The historical evolution of these strategies is examined in relation to the designs of individual memorials. The analysis identifies a range of planning strategies that significantly influence the design of individual memorials, including large-scale memorial precinct plans, the social meanings of surrounding sites and structures and existing memorials, and the uses of memorial sites for activities other than grieving. The article examines controversies surrounding the siting, design, meaning and public use of a number of specific memorial examples. The research draws upon existing planning and briefing documents, wider public and professional discourse, and site analysis.", "AuthorKeywords": ["capital cities", "democracy", "landscape", "masterplanning", "memorials", "monuments", "national identity", "politics", "urban design"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84916218872", "SubjectAreas": [["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"]], "AuthorData": {"15765957800": {"Name": "Stevens Q.", "AuthorID": "15765957800", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Bartlett School of Planning, University College London"}}}
