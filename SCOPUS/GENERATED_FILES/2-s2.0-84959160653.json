Selumetinib (AZD6244, ARRY-142886) potently and selectively inhibits MEK1/2, an intracellular kinase and has shown activity in ABC. The objective of the ABC-04 trial was to establish the recommended dose of selumetinib in combination with CisGem in patients with ABC. Methods: Eligible patients were \u2265 18 years, had histologically or cytologically-confirmed unresectable recurrent or metastatic biliary tract, gallbladder or ampullary carcinoma, WHO performance status 0-2, and adequate major organ function. Patients may have had prior surgery, radiotherapy or adjuvant chemotherapy, but no prior CisGem and no prior chemotherapy for locally advanced or metastatic disease. Patients received cisplatin 25 mg/m2 plus gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 intravenously on days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle. Selumetinib capsules were taken daily. Patients received up to 8 cycles of CisGem and could receive selumetinib until disease progression. A dose de-escalation scheme was used to determine the recommended dose of selumetinib. The first dose level was 75 mg bd. Patients were recruited in cohorts of 3 and assessed for dose limiting toxicity (DLT) during the first cycle of treatment. Results: Thirteen patients were recruited, of whom 12 were evaluable for DLT (1 did not start treatment). All evaluable patients received the starting dose of selumetinib 75 mg bd and one patient experienced a DLT (cardiac chest pain). The median number of days selumetinib was taken (adjusted for the number of days of dose interruptions) was 171.5 (IQR: 75.5 to 344). Two patients remained on treatment at 14 and 19 months post registration. There were 3 temporary and 1 permanent interruptions of selumetinib in cycle 1. Eight patients were evaluable for objective response (RECIST v1.1): 3 had a partial response and 5 stable disease. The median PFS was 6.4 months (IQR 5.2 to 13.7). Toxicities related to selumetinib were mostly related to oedema and rash, grade 1-2 and manageable. Pharmacokinetic analysis showed that the AUC(0-t), AUC(0-\u221e) and Cmax of selumetinib increased by 12, 11 and 30 % respectively when it was administered with CisGem, while Cmax for the N-desmethyl metabolite of selumetinib decreased by 40 %. There was no evidence that the time of Cmax for selumetinib or N-desmethyl metabolite of selumetinib were different when selumetinib was administered alone or with CisGem. Conclusion: The recommended dose of selumetinib when combined with CisGem was 75 mg bd. Translational studies are underway to identify biomarkers that may predict outcome (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01242605 July 6th 2010).", "AuthorKeywords": ["Biliary tract cancer", "Cisplatin", "Gemcitabine", "Phase 1b", "Selumetinib"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols", "Benzimidazoles", "Biliary Tract Neoplasms", "Cause of Death", "Cisplatin", "Combined Modality Therapy", "Deoxycytidine", "Female", "Humans", "Kaplan-Meier Estimate", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Neoplasm Grading", "Neoplasm Metastasis", "Neoplasm Staging", "Retreatment", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84959160653", "SubjectAreas": [["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Cancer Research", "BIOC", "1306"]], "AuthorData": {"7003634798": {"Name": "Bridgewater J.", "AuthorID": "7003634798", "AffiliationID": "60109234", "AffiliationName": "UCL Cancer Institute"}, "57140837700": {"Name": "Ricamara M.", "AuthorID": "57140837700", "AffiliationID": "60109234", "AffiliationName": "UCL Cancer Institute"}, "56719092100": {"Name": "Lopes A.", "AuthorID": "56719092100", "AffiliationID": "60012754, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Research UK and UCL Clinical Trials Centre"}, "6603703560": {"Name": "Beare S.", "AuthorID": "6603703560", "AffiliationID": "60012754, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Research UK and UCL Clinical Trials Centre"}, "56719243000": {"Name": "Duggan M.", "AuthorID": "56719243000", "AffiliationID": "60012754, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Research UK and UCL Clinical Trials Centre"}, "57138816700": {"Name": "Lee D.", "AuthorID": "57138816700", "AffiliationID": "60012754, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Research UK and UCL Clinical Trials Centre"}, "57140570600": {"Name": "McEntee D.", "AuthorID": "57140570600", "AffiliationID": "60028784", "AffiliationName": "The Christie NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7101953217": {"Name": "Valle J.W.", "AuthorID": "7101953217", "AffiliationID": "60028784", "AffiliationName": "The Christie NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57140368800": {"Name": "Sukumaran A.", "AuthorID": "57140368800", "AffiliationID": "60111785", "AffiliationName": "Imperial College Healthcare"}, "6701461568": {"Name": "Wasan H.", "AuthorID": "6701461568", "AffiliationID": "60111785", "AffiliationName": "Imperial College Healthcare"}}}
