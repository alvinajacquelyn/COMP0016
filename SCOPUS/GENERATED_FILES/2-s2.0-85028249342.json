The problem is relevant to the flow patterns and forces excited when slow oceanic flows cross bottom topography, and suggests a mechanism for slow fluctuations observed in laboratory experiments.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Rotating flows", "stratified flows", "topographic effects"], "IndexKeywords": ["Bottom topography", "In-laboratory experiments", "Oceanic flow", "Rossby wave", "Rotating flow", "Rotating stratified fluid", "Stratified flows", "Topographic effects"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85028249342", "SubjectAreas": [["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Mechanics of Materials", "ENGI", "2211"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"]], "AuthorData": {"57189658000": {"Name": "Johnson E.R.", "AuthorID": "57189658000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University College London"}, "6701819255": {"Name": "Llewellyn Smith S.G.", "AuthorID": "6701819255", "AffiliationID": "60121663, 60030612", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, Jacobs School of Engineering, UCSD"}}}
