Methods: District level alcohol sales, and mid-year population data for the whole study period (1998-2013) were consistently available from the Department of Excise and the Department of Census and Statistics for 18 of 25 districts. These data were used to estimate the recorded per capita consumption for the areas that were not directly exposed to the armed conflict. An interrupted time series design was employed to estimate the impact of the end of the armed conflict on recorded adult per capita alcohol consumption of population lived in the 18 districts. Results: Adult per capita recorded alcohol consumption among Sri Lankans living in the 18 districts was 1.59 l of pure alcohol in 1998. This increased up to 2.07 l in 2009 and 2.55 l in 2013. Prior to the end of the conflict in 2009 adult per capita recorded consumption increased by 0.051 l of pure alcohol per year (95% CI: 0.029-0.074, P < 0.001); after 2009 this was 0.166 l per year (95% CI: 0.095-0.236, P < 0.001). Beer consumption showed the highest per capita growth compared with other beverages. Conclusions: Adult per capita recorded alcohol consumption among Sri Lankans living in areas that were not directly exposed to the conflict increased markedly after the end of the conflict. Rapid socio-economic development, alcohol industry penetration and lack of alcohol control strategies during the post-conflict period may have driven this increase. Short summary: Adult per capita recorded alcohol consumption among Sri Lankans living in 18 districts that were not directly exposed to the armed conflict increased markedly after the end of the conflict in 2009, with a dramatic acceleration in the trend of per capita beer consumption.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Alcohol Drinking", "Alcoholic Beverages", "Armed Conflicts", "Commerce", "Humans", "Sri Lanka"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85042704910", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (miscellaneous)", "MEDI", "2701"], ["Toxicology", "PHAR", "3005"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"56685673700": {"Name": "Nugawela M.D.", "AuthorID": "56685673700", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "School of Social and Community Medicine, University of Bristol"}, "7404040737": {"Name": "Lewis S.", "AuthorID": "7404040737", "AffiliationID": "60015138, 60115380, 60019535", "AffiliationName": "UK Centre for Tobacco and Alcohol Studies, Division of Epidemiology and Public Health, University of Nottingham, Clinical Sciences Building, Nottingham City Hospital"}, "35238712200": {"Name": "Szatkowski L.", "AuthorID": "35238712200", "AffiliationID": "60015138, 60115380, 60019535", "AffiliationName": "UK Centre for Tobacco and Alcohol Studies, Division of Epidemiology and Public Health, University of Nottingham, Clinical Sciences Building, Nottingham City Hospital"}, "36118053600": {"Name": "Langley T.", "AuthorID": "36118053600", "AffiliationID": "60015138, 60115380, 60019535", "AffiliationName": "UK Centre for Tobacco and Alcohol Studies, Division of Epidemiology and Public Health, University of Nottingham, Clinical Sciences Building, Nottingham City Hospital"}}}
