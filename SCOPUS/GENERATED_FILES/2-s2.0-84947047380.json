Even among pedophiles who never commit any offense, the condition requires lifelong suppression and control. Previous comparison using voxel-based morphometry (VBM) of MR images from a large sample of pedophiles and controls revealed group differences in white matter. The present study therefore sought to verify and characterize white matter involvement using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), which better captures the microstructure of white matter than does VBM. Pedophilic sex offenders (n = 24) were compared with healthy, age-matched controls with no criminal record and no indication of pedophilia (n = 32). White matter microstructure was analyzed with Tract-Based Spatial Statistics, and the trajectories of implicated fiber bundles were identified by probabilistic tractography. Groups showed significant, highly focused differences in DTI parameters which related to participants\u2019 genital responses to sexual depictions of children, but not to measures of psychopathy or to childhood histories of physical abuse, sexual abuse, or neglect. Some previously reported gray matter differences were suggested under highly liberal statistical conditions (puncorrected < .005), but did not survive ordinary statistical correction (whole brain per voxel false discovery rate of 5 %). These results confirm that pedophilia is characterized by neuroanatomical differences in white matter microstructure, over and above any neural characteristics attributable to psychopathy and childhood adversity, which show neuroanatomic footprints of their own. Although some gray matter structures were implicated previously, only few have emerged reliably.", "AuthorKeywords": ["DSM-5", "Fractional anisotropy", "Hebephilia", "Paraphilia", "Pedophilia", "Probabilistic tractography"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Brain Mapping", "Case-Control Studies", "Child", "Diffusion Tensor Imaging", "Emotions", "Female", "Humans", "Image Processing, Computer-Assisted", "Male", "Pedophilia", "Sex Offenses", "White Matter"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84947047380", "SubjectAreas": [["Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)", "ARTS", "1201"], ["Psychology (all)", "PSYC", "3200"]], "AuthorData": {"7005338442": {"Name": "Cantor J.M.", "AuthorID": "7005338442", "AffiliationID": "60015765", "AffiliationName": "Complex Mental Illness Program, Centre for Addiction and Mental Health"}, "7801634055": {"Name": "Lafaille S.", "AuthorID": "7801634055", "AffiliationID": "60015765", "AffiliationName": "Complex Mental Illness Program, Centre for Addiction and Mental Health"}, "56421732300": {"Name": "Soh D.W.", "AuthorID": "56421732300", "AffiliationID": "60033420", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, York University"}, "34973306400": {"Name": "Moayedi M.", "AuthorID": "34973306400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology, University College London"}, "7005294442": {"Name": "Mikulis D.J.", "AuthorID": "7005294442", "AffiliationID": "60016849", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Imaging, University of Toronto"}, "7007128562": {"Name": "Girard T.A.", "AuthorID": "7007128562", "AffiliationID": "60030838", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Ryerson University"}}}
