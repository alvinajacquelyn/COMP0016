Our aim was to assess the overall fitness and utility of tNGS as a routine clinical test in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Methods All NSCLC cases submitted to a single laboratory for tNGS analysis over a 3-year period were included. Rejection/failure rates and turnaround times were calculated. For reportable cases, data relating to observed genetic changes likely to be driving tumour growth and/or contributing to therapeutic resistance were extracted. The impact of varied referral site practices (tissue processing and sample format submitted) on analytical outcomes was also considered. Results A total of 2796 cases were submitted, of which 217 (7.8%) were rejected and 131 (5.1%) failed. The median turnaround time was seven working days. Of 2448 reported cases, KRAS, EGFR or other recognised driver mutations were observed in 35%, 17% and 5.4%, respectively. Of the remaining cases, 3.5% demonstrated significant incidental evidence of gene amplification. In 15% of EGFR-driven cases, evidence of an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistance mechanism was observed. Potential concerns around the provision of slides or precut \u00e2 'rolls' only (cf, formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue blocks) as standard practice by certain referral sites were identified. Conclusions A tNGS panel approach is practically achievable, with acceptable success rates and turnaround times, in the context of a routine clinical service. Furthermore, it provides additional clinically and analytically relevant information, which is not available from single gene testing alone.", "AuthorKeywords": ["cancer genetics", "diagnostics", "lung cancer", "molecular pathology"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Biomarkers, Tumor", "Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung", "DNA Mutational Analysis", "Female", "Gene Expression Profiling", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing", "Humans", "Lung Neoplasms", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Molecular Diagnostic Techniques", "Mutation", "Phenotype", "Predictive Value of Tests", "Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras)", "Receptor, Epidermal Growth Factor", "Reproducibility of Results", "Time Factors", "Transcriptome", "Workflow", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85052336236", "SubjectAreas": [["Pathology and Forensic Medicine", "MEDI", "2734"]], "AuthorData": {"57208119255": {"Name": "Moore D.", "AuthorID": "57208119255", "AffiliationID": "60109234", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, UCL Cancer Institute"}, "23033522300": {"Name": "Balbi K.", "AuthorID": "23033522300", "AffiliationID": "121236696", "AffiliationName": "Sarah Cannon Molecular Diagnostics"}, "57203567727": {"Name": "Ingham A.", "AuthorID": "57203567727", "AffiliationID": "121236696", "AffiliationName": "Sarah Cannon Molecular Diagnostics"}, "57203575558": {"Name": "Bennett P.", "AuthorID": "57203575558", "AffiliationID": "121236696", "AffiliationName": "Sarah Cannon Molecular Diagnostics"}, "6603300234": {"Name": "Arkenau H.", "AuthorID": "6603300234", "AffiliationID": "112801215", "AffiliationName": "Sarah Cannon Research Institute UK"}}}
