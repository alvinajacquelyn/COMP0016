In particular, migration between the regions of the UK is common amongst domestic students and graduates, and has been shown to have consequences for both the region of origin and the destination. Despite the recognition that migration is not a one-off event, but an ongoing process, empirical studies rarely operationalize it in ways reflecting this continuity. This study contributes to filling the above-described gap by investigating how the patterns of graduates\u2019 migration across their life-course relate to their intra-generational social mobility. Longitudinal data, extracted from the 1970 British Cohort Study, and sequence analysis are used to derive the typologies of these patterns. A set of logistic regressions is used to investigate the relationship between these two, simultaneous aspects of graduates\u2019 life-courses over the long term. The findings indicate that graduates\u2019 migration across their life-course is significantly related to their intra-generational social mobility. In particular, temporary migration safeguards the advantaged position of the most privileged, in line with the notion of a \u2018glass floor\u2019. At the same time, it can create a \u2018glass ceiling\u2019 for those on less privileged trajectories. In the light of these findings, both academics and policy-makers are encouraged to incorporate migration, both theoretically and practically, into their research approaches.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Graduates", "Intra-generational social mobility", "Migration", "Sequence analysis"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85063498641", "SubjectAreas": [["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"], ["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"], ["Economics and Econometrics", "ECON", "2002"]], "AuthorData": {"57207991399": {"Name": "Wielgoszewska B.", "AuthorID": "57207991399", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "School of Geosciences, The University of Edinburgh"}}}
