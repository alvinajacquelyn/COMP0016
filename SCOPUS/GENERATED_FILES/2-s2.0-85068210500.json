There, potatoes propagate vegetatively via tubers under short days, constant throughout the year. After their introduction to Europe in the sixteenth century, potatoes adapted to a shorter growing season and to tuber formation under long days. Here, we traced the demographic and adaptive history of potato introduction to Europe. To this end, we sequenced 88 individuals that comprise landraces, modern cultivars and historical herbarium samples, including specimens collected by Darwin during the voyage of the Beagle. Our findings show that European potatoes collected during the period 1650\u20131750 were closely related to Andean landraces. After their introduction to Europe, potatoes admixed with Chilean genotypes. We identified candidate genes putatively involved in long-day pre-adaptation, and showed that the 1650\u20131750 European individuals were not long-day adapted through previously described allelic variants of the CYCLING DOF FACTOR1 gene. Such allelic variants were detected in Europe during the nineteenth century. Our study highlights the power of combining contemporary and historical genomes to understand the complex evolutionary history of crop adaptation to new environments.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Acclimatization", "Animals", "Dogs", "Europe", "Genotype", "Plant Tubers", "Solanum tuberosum"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85068210500", "SubjectAreas": [["Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics", "AGRI", "1105"], ["Ecology", "ENVI", "2303"]], "AuthorData": {"56441701500": {"Name": "Gutaker R.", "AuthorID": "56441701500", "AffiliationID": "60020329", "AffiliationName": "Research Group for Ancient Genomics and Evolution, Department of Molecular Biology, Max Planck Institute for Developmental Biology"}, "57004300100": {"Name": "Wei\u00df C.", "AuthorID": "57004300100", "AffiliationID": "60020329", "AffiliationName": "Research Group for Ancient Genomics and Evolution, Department of Molecular Biology, Max Planck Institute for Developmental Biology"}, "14420828500": {"Name": "Burbano H.", "AuthorID": "14420828500", "AffiliationID": "60020329", "AffiliationName": "Research Group for Ancient Genomics and Evolution, Department of Molecular Biology, Max Planck Institute for Developmental Biology"}, "7402567185": {"Name": "Ellis D.", "AuthorID": "7402567185", "AffiliationID": "60071238", "AffiliationName": "International Potato Center"}, "57195472597": {"Name": "Anglin N.", "AuthorID": "57195472597", "AffiliationID": "60071238", "AffiliationName": "International Potato Center"}, "7202675581": {"Name": "Knapp S.", "AuthorID": "7202675581", "AffiliationID": "60025352", "AffiliationName": "Department of Life Sciences, Natural History Museum"}, "7004573736": {"Name": "Luis Fern\u00e1ndez-Alonso J.", "AuthorID": "7004573736", "AffiliationID": "60003374, 60006754", "AffiliationName": "Departamento de Biodiversidad y Conservaci\u00f3n, Real Jardin Bot\u00e1nico RJB-CSIC"}, "7003423407": {"Name": "Prat S.", "AuthorID": "7003423407", "AffiliationID": "60018678, 60026796", "AffiliationName": "Departamento de Gen\u00e9tica Molecular de Plantas, Centro Nacional de Biotecnolog\u00eda-CSIC"}}}
