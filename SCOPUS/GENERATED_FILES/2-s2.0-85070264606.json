Nutrient pool and factorial design experiments were carried out in order to identify the amino acids involved in increased biomass and induction of plasmid amplification. Leucine, glycine, and histidine were responsible for increased biomass and leucine starvation in the presence of histidine was implicated in plasmid amplification. Supercoiling of the plasmid was optimized using a dual feeding strategy. As a result of this, a fed-batch fermentation strategy for the production of a 6.9 kb plasmid, pSV\u00df, in Escherichia coli DH5\u03b1 was developed. In batch fermentation, a maximum plasmid yield of 39.4 mg/L equivalent to 11.3 mg/g dry cell weight (DCW) was achieved with casein hydrolysate limitation. About 90% of plasmid was in the supercoiled (SC) form after 31 hr of fermentation but only remained so for a short period, leading to a very brief window for harvesting cells at scale. Subsequently, a fed-batch fermentation using a dual feeding strategy was employed. A mean maximum plasmid yield of 44 mg/L equivalent to 9.1 mg plasmid/g DCW was achieved. After 25 hr, 90% of plasmid was in the SC form and remained at this level for the remaining 10 hr of the fermentation, allowing adequate time for the harvesting of cells without the loss of supercoiling of product. This study emphasized that optimizing fermentation strategy and identifying the essential nutrients are beneficial for bioprocessing of plasmid DNA for therapeutic applications.", "AuthorKeywords": ["amino acid starvation", "Escherichia coli", "fed-batch", "plasmid amplification", "semi-defined medium", "supercoiling"], "IndexKeywords": ["Amino acid starvations", "Defined mediums", "Essential nutrients", "Fed batches", "Fed-batch fermentation", "Feeding strategies", "Supercoiling", "Therapeutic Application", "Amino Acids", "Biomass", "DNA, Bacterial", "Escherichia coli", "Fermentation", "Genetic Vectors", "Humans", "Plasmids"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85070264606", "SubjectAreas": [["Biotechnology", "BIOC", "1305"]], "AuthorData": {"57210323258": {"Name": "Dorward A.", "AuthorID": "57210323258", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "The Advanced Centre for Biochemical Engineering, University College London"}, "7006333002": {"Name": "O'Kennedy R.D.", "AuthorID": "7006333002", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "The Advanced Centre for Biochemical Engineering, University College London"}, "57210107056": {"Name": "Folarin O.", "AuthorID": "57210107056", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemical Engineering, University College London"}, "55547113393": {"Name": "Ward J.M.", "AuthorID": "55547113393", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemical Engineering, University College London"}, "6701613219": {"Name": "Keshavarz-Moore E.", "AuthorID": "6701613219", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemical Engineering, University College London"}}}
