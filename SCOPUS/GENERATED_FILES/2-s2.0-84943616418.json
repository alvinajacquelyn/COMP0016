Other things equal, financial literacy, and numeracy in particular, are important factors governing individuals' choices over whether to shop around for an annuity as opposed to taking the 'path of least resistance' option and purchasing from their original pension fund provider. This has important policy and welfare implications given that buying an annuity on the open market has significant financial benefits for most people. In the context of the increasing reliance on private provision for retirement, the importance of individuals having the financial literacy to successfully navigate complex financial decisions late in life should not be underestimated.", "AuthorKeywords": ["annuities", "financial literacy", "pensions", "Retirement saving"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84943616418", "SubjectAreas": [["Finance", "ECON", "2003"], ["Economics and Econometrics", "ECON", "2002"], ["Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management", "BUSI", "1407"]], "AuthorData": {"7202965937": {"Name": "Banks J.", "AuthorID": "7202965937", "AffiliationID": "60003771, 60012327", "AffiliationName": "University of Manchester, Institute for Fiscal Studies"}, "55765035700": {"Name": "Crawford R.", "AuthorID": "55765035700", "AffiliationID": "60012327", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Fiscal Studies"}, "35168116800": {"Name": "Tetlow G.", "AuthorID": "35168116800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
