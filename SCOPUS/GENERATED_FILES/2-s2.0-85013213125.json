In other words, to know something you must have evidence that makes rational a high credence in it. We relate such a threshold view to Dorr et al.\u2019s (Philosophical Studies 170(2):277\u2013287, 2014) argument against the principle they call fair coins: \u201cIf you know a coin won\u2019t land tails, then you know it won\u2019t be flipped.\u201d They argue for rejecting fair coins because it leads to a pervasive skepticism about knowledge of the future. We argue that the threshold view of evidence and knowledge gives independent grounds to reject fair coins.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Epistemological skepticism about the future", "Evidence", "Inference", "Knowledge", "Probability", "Rational-belief", "Thresholds", "Tolerance principle"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85013213125", "SubjectAreas": [["Philosophy", "ARTS", "1211"]], "AuthorData": {"26429930800": {"Name": "Rothschild D.", "AuthorID": "26429930800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "24077712100": {"Name": "Spectre L.", "AuthorID": "24077712100", "AffiliationID": "60022591", "AffiliationName": "The Open University of Israel"}}}
