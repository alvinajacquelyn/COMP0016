Pyroelectrochemical processing utilizes direct, selective, electrochemical reduction of uranium dioxide, followed by selective electroplating of a uranium metal. Thermodynamic prediction of the electrochemical reduction of UO2 to U in LiCl-KCl eutectic has shown to be a function of the oxide ion activity. The pO2\u2212 of the salt may be affected by the microstructure of the UO2 electrode. A uranium dioxide filled \u201cmicro-bucket\u201d electrode has been partially electroreduced to uranium metal in molten lithium chloride-potassium chloride eutectic. This partial electroreduction resulted in two distinct microstructures: a dense UO2 and a porous U metal structure were characterised by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. Focused ion beam tomography was performed on five regions of this electrode which revealed an overall porosity ranging from 17.36% at the outer edge to 3.91% towards the centre, commensurate with the expected extent of reaction in each location. The pore connectivity was also seen to reduce from 88.32% to 17.86% in the same regions and the tortuosity through the sample was modelled along the axis of propagation of the electroreduction, which was seen to increase from a value of 4.42 to a value of infinity (disconnected pores). These microstructural characteristics could impede the transport of O2\u2212 ions resulting in a change in the local pO2\u2212 which could result in the inability to perform the electroreduction.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Electrochemical reductions", "Energy dispersive X ray spectroscopy", "Focused ion beam tomographies", "Liquid-liquid extraction", "Micro-structural characteristics", "Potassium chloride", "Spent nuclear fuels", "Thermodynamic predictions"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84985918605", "SubjectAreas": [["Nuclear and High Energy Physics", "PHYS", "3106"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Nuclear Energy and Engineering", "ENER", "2104"]], "AuthorData": {"57199236850": {"Name": "Brown L.", "AuthorID": "57199236850", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electrochemical Innovation Lab, Dept.
