Five English-speaking samples (N = 307-685) of mostly undergraduate students each completed a different measure of the Big Five personality traits and either the full form or short form of the Trait Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire (TEIQue). Across samples, models predicting global TEIQue scores from the Big Five were invariant between genders, with Neuroticism and Extraversion being the strongest trait EI correlates, followed by Conscientiousness, Agreeableness, and Openness. However, there was some evidence indicating that the gender-specific contributions of the Big Five to trait EI vary depending on the personality measure used, being more consistent for women. Discussion focuses on the validity of the TEIQue as a measure of trait EI and its psychometric properties, more generally.", "AuthorKeywords": ["gender", "invariance", "personality", "TEIQue", "trait emotional intelligence"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84920971282", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["Clinical Psychology", "PSYC", "3203"], ["Psychology (all)", "PSYC", "3200"]], "AuthorData": {"54913642400": {"Name": "Siegling A.", "AuthorID": "54913642400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "36045985300": {"Name": "Furnham A.", "AuthorID": "36045985300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "6603597461": {"Name": "Petrides K.", "AuthorID": "6603597461", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
