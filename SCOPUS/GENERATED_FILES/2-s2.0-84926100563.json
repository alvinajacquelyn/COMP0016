These afferents primarily release glutamate, although 5-HT has also been shown to play a role in their actions. Using fast-cyclic voltammetry, an increase in 5-HT concentrations (range 12-50 nm) could be detected in the NTS in anaesthetized rats in response to electrical stimulation of the vagus and activation of cardiopulmonary, chemo- and baroreceptor reflexes. This 5-HT signal was not potentiated by the serotonin transporter (SERT) or the noradrenaline transporter (NET) inhibitors citalopram and desipramine (1 mg kg-1). However, decynium-22 (600 \u03bcg kg-1), an organic cation 3 transporter (OCT3)/plasma membrane monoamine transporter (PMAT) inhibitor, increased the 5-HT signal by 111 \u00b1 21% from 29 \u00b1 10 nm. The effectiveness of these inhibitors was tested against the removal time of 5-HT and noradrenaline applied by microinjection to the NTS. Citalopram and decynium-22 attenuated the removal of 5-HT but not noradrenaline, whereas desipramine had the reverse action. The OCT3 inhibitor corticosterone (10 mg kg-1) had no effect. Blockade of glutamate receptors with topical kynurenate (10-50 nm) reduced the vagally evoked 5-HT signal by 50%, indicating that this release was from at least two sources. It is concluded that vagally evoked 5-HT release is under the regulation of the high-capacity, low-affinity transporter PMAT, not the low-capacity, high-affinity transporter SERT. This is the first demonstration that PMAT may be playing a physiological role in the regulation of 5-HT transmission and this could indicate that 5-HT is acting, in part, as a volume transmitter within the NTS.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Blood Pressure", "Citalopram", "Desipramine", "Electric Stimulation", "Equilibrative Nucleoside Transport Proteins", "Heart Rate", "Kynurenic Acid", "Male", "Norepinephrine", "Quinolines", "Rats, Sprague-Dawley", "Serotonin", "Serotonin Plasma Membrane Transport Proteins", "Serotonin Uptake Inhibitors", "Solitary Nucleus", "Vagus Nerve"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84926100563", "SubjectAreas": [["Physiology", "BIOC", "1314"]], "AuthorData": {"56118823200": {"Name": "Hosford P.", "AuthorID": "56118823200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology, University College London"}, "7005352395": {"Name": "Ramage A.", "AuthorID": "7005352395", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology, University College London"}, "56524910700": {"Name": "Millar J.", "AuthorID": "56524910700", "AffiliationID": "60021435", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Education, Queen Mary's School of Medicine and Dentistry"}}}
