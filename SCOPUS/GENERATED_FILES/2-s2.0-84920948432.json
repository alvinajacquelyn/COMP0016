Although autografts still remain the gold standard, the inconvenience of harvesting and/or insufficient availability in patients with atherosclerotic disease has given impetus to look into alternative sources for vascular grafts.Areas covered: There are four main techniques to produce tissue-engineered vascular grafts (TEVGs): i) biodegradable synthetic scaffolds; ii) gel-based scaffolds; iii) decellularised scaffolds and iv) self-assembled cell-sheet-based techniques. The first three techniques can be grouped together as scaffold-guided approach as it involves the use of a construct to function as a supportive framework for the vascular graft. The most significant advantages of TEVGs are that it possesses the ability to grow, remodel and respond to environmental factors. Cell sources for TEVGs include mature somatic cells, stem cells, adult progenitor cells and pluripotent stem cells.Expert opinion: TEVG holds great promise with advances in nanotechnology, coupled with important refinements in tissue engineering and decellularisation techniques. This will undoubtedly be an important milestone for cardiovascular medicine when it is eventually translated to clinical use.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Arterial grafts", "Tissue-engineered blood vessels", "Tissue-engineered vascular grafts", "Vascular replacement", "Vascular tissue engineering"], "IndexKeywords": ["Absorbable Implants", "Animals", "Bioprosthesis", "Blood Vessel Prosthesis", "Cardiovascular Diseases", "Guided Tissue Regeneration", "Humans", "Polymers", "Stem Cells", "Tissue Engineering", "Tissue Scaffolds", "Transplantation, Autologous"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84920948432", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"], ["Drug Discovery", "PHAR", "3002"], ["Clinical Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1308"]], "AuthorData": {"55921966800": {"Name": "Natasha G.", "AuthorID": "55921966800", "AffiliationID": "60029950, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Medical School, University College London (UCL)"}, "36931163300": {"Name": "Tan A.", "AuthorID": "36931163300", "AffiliationID": "60032838, 60012708", "AffiliationName": "Stanford University, Stanford School of Medicine, Biomaterials and Advanced Drug Delivery Laboratory"}, "56097243000": {"Name": "Gundogan B.", "AuthorID": "56097243000", "AffiliationID": "60029950, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Medical School, University College London (UCL)"}, "55577521900": {"Name": "Farhatnia Y.", "AuthorID": "55577521900", "AffiliationID": "60176023, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London (UCL), Centre for Nanotechnology and Regenerative Medicine, UCL Division of Surgery and Interventional Science"}, "55210860300": {"Name": "Nayyer L.", "AuthorID": "55210860300", "AffiliationID": "60176023, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London (UCL), Centre for Nanotechnology and Regenerative Medicine, UCL Division of Surgery and Interventional Science"}, "56481709300": {"Name": "Mahdibeiraghdar S.", "AuthorID": "56481709300", "AffiliationID": "60176023, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London (UCL), Centre for Nanotechnology and Regenerative Medicine, UCL Division of Surgery and Interventional Science"}, "7005344804": {"Name": "Seifalian A.M.", "AuthorID": "7005344804", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust Hospital"}, "23971332600": {"Name": "Rajadas J.", "AuthorID": "23971332600", "AffiliationID": "60032838, 60012708", "AffiliationName": "Stanford University, Stanford School of Medicine, Biomaterials and Advanced Drug Delivery Laboratory"}, "24801882300": {"Name": "De Coppi P.", "AuthorID": "24801882300", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children, NHS Foundation Trust, Department of Paediatric Surgery"}, "55469000400": {"Name": "Davies A.H.", "AuthorID": "55469000400", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Imperial College London, Academic Section of Vascular Surgery"}}}
