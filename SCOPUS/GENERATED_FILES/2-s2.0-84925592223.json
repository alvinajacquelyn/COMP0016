All rights reserved.Astrocytes seem to rely on relatively sluggish and spatially blurred Ca2+ waves to communicate with fast and point-precise neural circuits. This apparent discrepancy could, however, reflect our current inability to understand the microscopic mechanisms involved. Difficulties in detecting and interpreting astrocyte Ca2+ signals may have led to some prominent controversies in the field. Here, we argue that a deeper understanding of astrocyte physiology requires a qualitative leap in our experimental and analytical strategies.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Astrocytes", "Brain", "Calcium Signaling", "Humans"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84925592223", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"]], "AuthorData": {"7005393308": {"Name": "Rusakov D.", "AuthorID": "7005393308", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Neurology, University College London"}}}
