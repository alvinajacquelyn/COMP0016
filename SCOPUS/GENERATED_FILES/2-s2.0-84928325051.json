Research suggests that factors related to the victim, crime event and wider community are all implicated in the decision to report victimization. Few studies have investigated the correlates of victim reporting in developing countries, mainly owing to a lack of relevant data. It is therefore unclear whether the determinants of victim reporting in Western industrialized countries are generalizable to low-income developing settings. This paper explores the factors associated with victims reporting assault to the police in the African context of Malawi, using data from a nationally representative household survey. Results of a multilevel logistic regression indicate some similarities with the Western criminological literature, such as age of the victim and crime seriousness positively correlating with crime reporting. Other results seem to reflect the distinctive characteristics of Malawi, with victims more likely to report being assaulted if they are male, have access to a working phone or live in urban areas. The results illustrate the importance of studying criminological phenomena across a diverse range of settings. Implications of the findings for future research and crime prevention are discussed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["assault", "Malawi", "police", "sub-Saharan Africa", "victim reporting"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84928325051", "SubjectAreas": [["Pathology and Forensic Medicine", "MEDI", "2734"], ["Social Psychology", "PSYC", "3207"], ["Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)", "ARTS", "1201"], ["Law", "SOCI", "3308"]], "AuthorData": {"23028792600": {"Name": "Sidebottom A.", "AuthorID": "23028792600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Security and Crime Science, University College London"}}}
