The proposed transmission schemes exploit noncausal information about the interference at the secondary base station to redesign the CR precoding optimization problem. This is done with the objective to improve the quality of service (QoS) of secondary users by taking advantage of constructive interference in the secondary link. The precoders are designed to minimize the worst secondary user's symbol error probability (SEP) under constraints on the instantaneous total transmit power, and the power of the instantaneous interference in the primary link. The problem is formulated as a bivariate probabilistic constrained programming (BPCP) problem. We show that the BPCP problem can be transformed for practical SEPs into a convex optimization problem that can be solved, for example, by the barrier method. A computationally efficient tight approximate approach is also developed to compute the near-optimal solutions. Simulation results and analysis show that the average computational complexity per downlink frame of the proposed approximate problem is comparable to that of the conventional CR downlink beamforming problem. In addition, both the proposed methods offer significant performance improvements as compared to the conventional CR downlink beamforming, while guaranteeing the QoS of primary users on an instantaneous basis, in contrast to the average QoS guarantees of conventional beamformers.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bivariate probabilistic constrained programming", "Cognitive radio", "Constructive interference", "Convex optimization", "Downlink beamforming"], "IndexKeywords": ["Computationally efficient", "Constrained programming", "Constructive interference", "Convex optimization problems", "Downlink beam-forming", "Near-optimal solutions", "Symbol error probabilities (SEP)", "Underlay cognitive radios"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85021748686", "SubjectAreas": [["Signal Processing", "COMP", "1711"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"35076119000": {"Name": "Law K.L.", "AuthorID": "35076119000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "23009493900": {"Name": "Masouros C.", "AuthorID": "23009493900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "35555043400": {"Name": "Pesavento M.", "AuthorID": "35555043400", "AffiliationID": "60011226", "AffiliationName": "Communication Systems Group, Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt"}}}
