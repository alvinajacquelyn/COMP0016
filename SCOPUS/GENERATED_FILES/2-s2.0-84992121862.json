All rights reserved.Generalized solitary waves propagating at the surface of a fluid of finite depth are considered. The fluid is assumed to be inviscid and incompressible and the flow to be irrotational. Both the effects of gravity and surface tension are included. It is shown that in addition to the classical symmetric waves, there are new asymmetric solutions. These new branches of solutions bifurcate from the branches of symmetric waves. The detailed bifurcation diagrams as well as typical wave profiles are presented.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Asymmetric waves", "Generalized solitary waves", "Gravity-capillary waves"], "IndexKeywords": ["Asymmetric waves", "Bifurcation diagram", "Finite depth", "Gravity capillary waves", "Irrotational", "New branches", "Wave profiles"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84992121862", "SubjectAreas": [["Mathematics (all)", "MATH", "2600"], ["Engineering (all)", "ENGI", "2200"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"56640563600": {"Name": "Gao T.", "AuthorID": "56640563600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University College London"}, "7005594518": {"Name": "Vanden-Broeck J.", "AuthorID": "7005594518", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University College London"}, "36705190000": {"Name": "Wang Z.", "AuthorID": "36705190000", "AffiliationID": "60027363", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering Science, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing"}}}
