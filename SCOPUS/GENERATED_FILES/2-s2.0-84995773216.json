We present its use in patients undergoing breast conservation following neoadjuvant therapy (NACT). Method: In this retrospective study involving 116 patients after NACT we compared outcomes of 61 patients who received a tumour bed boost with IORT during lumpectomy versus 55 patients treated in the previous 13 months with external (EBRT) boost. All patients received whole breast radiotherapy. Local recurrence-free survival (LRFS), disease-free survival (DFS), distant disease-free survival (DDFS), breast cancer mortality (BCM), non-breast cancer mortality (NBCM) and overall mortality (OS) were compared. Results: Median follow up was 49 months. The differences in LRFS, DFS and BCM were not statistically significant. The 5-year Kaplan\u2013Meier estimate of OS was significantly better by 15% with IORT: IORT 2 events (96.7%, 95%CI 87.5\u201399.2), EBRT 9 events (81.7%, 95%CI 67.6\u201390.1), hazard ratio (HR) 0.19 (0.04\u20130.87), log rank p = 0.016, mainly due to a reduction of 10.1% in NBCM: IORT 100%, EBRT 89.9% (77.3\u201395.7), HR (not calculable), log rank p = 0.015. The DDFS was as follows: IORT 3 events (95.1%, 85.5\u201398.4), EBRT 12 events (69.0%, 49.1\u201382.4), HR 0.23 (0.06\u20130.80), log rank p = 0.012. Conclusion: IORT during lumpectomy after neoadjuvant chemotherapy as a tumour bed boost appears to give results that are not worse than external beam radiotherapy boost. These data give further support to the inclusion of such patients in the TARGIT-B (boost) randomised trial that is testing whether IORT boost is superior to EBRT boost.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Breast cancer", "External boost", "Intraoperative radiotherapy", "Neoadjuvant therapy", "Tumor bed boost"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Breast Neoplasms", "Chemoradiotherapy, Adjuvant", "Disease-Free Survival", "Dose Hypofractionation", "Female", "Germany", "Humans", "Longitudinal Studies", "Mastectomy, Segmental", "Middle Aged", "Neoadjuvant Therapy", "Neoplasm Recurrence, Local", "Prevalence", "Retrospective Studies", "Risk Factors", "Survival Rate", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84995773216", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"], ["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"]], "AuthorData": {"6603834538": {"Name": "Kolberg H.", "AuthorID": "6603834538", "AffiliationID": "60013662", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, Marienhospital Bottrop gGmbH"}, "57191756626": {"Name": "Akpolat-Basci L.", "AuthorID": "57191756626", "AffiliationID": "60013662", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, Marienhospital Bottrop gGmbH"}, "57191756186": {"Name": "Stephanou M.", "AuthorID": "57191756186", "AffiliationID": "60013662", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, Marienhospital Bottrop gGmbH"}, "57191991572": {"Name": "Loevey G.", "AuthorID": "57191991572", "AffiliationID": "117886716", "AffiliationName": "BORAD"}, "7003320928": {"Name": "Fasching P.", "AuthorID": "7003320928", "AffiliationID": "60000765", "AffiliationName": "University of Erlangen"}, "55625731100": {"Name": "Untch M.", "AuthorID": "55625731100", "AffiliationID": "60011532", "AffiliationName": "Helios Klinikum Berlin-Buch"}, "56238423500": {"Name": "Liedtke C.", "AuthorID": "56238423500", "AffiliationID": "60015196", "AffiliationName": "University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein/Campus L\u00fcbeck"}, "7003936097": {"Name": "Bulsara M.", "AuthorID": "7003936097", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College"}, "7006928746": {"Name": "Vaidya J.", "AuthorID": "7006928746", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College"}}}
