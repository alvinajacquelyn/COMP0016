Methods: A systematic search resulted in 16 eligible studies evaluating the diagnostic accuracy of ACE-R and ACE-III in ten different languages. Most studies were assessed as of medium to low quality using Standards for Reporting of Diagnostic Accuracy (STARD) guidance. Results: The findings of excellent diagnostic accuracy are compromised by the methodological limitations of studies. While studies generally reported excellent diagnostic accuracy across and within different languages, optimal cut-offs even within particular language versions, varied. Conclusion: There is a need for future research to address these limitations through adherence to STARD guidelines. The ACE-III is particularly under-evaluated and should be a focus of future research. The variance in obtained optimal cut-offs within language versions is an issue compromising clinical utility and could be addressed in future work through use of a-priori defined thresholds.", "AuthorKeywords": ["cognitive assessment", "Dementia", "memory", "screening"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Cognition", "Dementia", "Female", "Humans", "Language", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Neuropsychological Tests", "ROC Curve", "Sensitivity and Specificity", "Translating"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85052544823", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychiatric Mental Health", "NURS", "2921"], ["Gerontology", "NURS", "2909"], ["Geriatrics and Gerontology", "MEDI", "2717"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"57208343872": {"Name": "Habib N.", "AuthorID": "57208343872", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London"}, "36441678800": {"Name": "Stott J.", "AuthorID": "36441678800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London"}}}
