Conventional image reconstruction approaches for EIXPCT require multiple images to be acquired at each tomographic view angle. This contributes to prolonged data-acquisition times and elevated radiation doses, which can hinder in vivo applications. In this work, a new \"single-shot\" method is proposed for joint reconstruction (JR) of the real and imaginary-valued components of the refractive index distribution from a tomographic data set that contains only a single image acquired at each view angle. The proposed method is predicated on a nonlinear formulation of the inverse problem that is solved by using a gradient-based optimization method. The method is validated and investigated using computer-simulated and experimental EIXPCT data sets.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Acquisition time", "Gradient-based optimization method", "Joint image reconstruction", "Nonlinear formulation", "Real and imaginary", "Refractive-index distribution", "Tomographic data", "X-ray phase-contrast tomography", "Image Processing, Computer-Assisted", "Optical Phenomena", "Tomography", "X-Rays"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85011672121", "SubjectAreas": [["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"]], "AuthorData": {"57190290022": {"Name": "Chen Y.", "AuthorID": "57190290022", "AffiliationID": "60010261", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Washington University in St. Louis"}, "56184326400": {"Name": "Guan H.", "AuthorID": "56184326400", "AffiliationID": "60010261", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Washington University in St. Louis"}, "7006769220": {"Name": "Anastasio M.", "AuthorID": "7006769220", "AffiliationID": "60010261", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Washington University in St. Louis"}, "55508570900": {"Name": "Hagen C.", "AuthorID": "55508570900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "7004072469": {"Name": "Olivo A.", "AuthorID": "7004072469", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}}}
