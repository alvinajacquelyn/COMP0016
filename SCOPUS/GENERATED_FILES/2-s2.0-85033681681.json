We did an evidence synthesis of health and social interventions for inclusion health target populations, including people with experiences of homelessness, drug use, imprisonment, and sex work. These populations often have multiple overlapping risk factors and extreme levels of morbidity and mortality. We identified numerous interventions to improve physical and mental health, and substance use; however, evidence is scarce for structural interventions, including housing, employment, and legal support that can prevent exclusion and promote recovery. Dedicated resources and better collaboration with the affected populations are needed to realise the benefits of existing interventions. Research must inform the benefits of early intervention and implementation of policies to address the upstream causes of exclusion, such as adverse childhood experiences and poverty.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Delivery of Health Care", "Health Services Accessibility", "Health Status Disparities", "Homeless Persons", "Housing", "Humans", "Preventive Health Services", "Social Determinants of Health", "Social Marginalization", "Women's Health"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85033681681", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"25825267700": {"Name": "Luchenski S.", "AuthorID": "25825267700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "The Farr Institute of Health Informatics Research, University College London"}, "57209842885": {"Name": "Aldridge R.W.", "AuthorID": "57209842885", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "The Farr Institute of Health Informatics Research, University College London"}, "35944648500": {"Name": "Hayward A.", "AuthorID": "35944648500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Epidemiology and Health Care, University College London"}, "11239898000": {"Name": "Maguire N.", "AuthorID": "11239898000", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, University of Southampton"}, "14623146100": {"Name": "Story A.", "AuthorID": "14623146100", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Find and Treat Service, University College London Hospitals"}, "57196729537": {"Name": "Perri P.", "AuthorID": "57196729537", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Street Medicine Institute"}, "35338609600": {"Name": "Withers J.", "AuthorID": "35338609600", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Street Medicine Institute"}, "57196705698": {"Name": "Clint S.", "AuthorID": "57196705698", "AffiliationID": "119761073", "AffiliationName": "Groundswell UK"}, "7102207126": {"Name": "Fitzpatrick S.", "AuthorID": "7102207126", "AffiliationID": "60019656", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Social Policy, Housing and Equalities Research, Heriot-Watt University"}, "6602370029": {"Name": "Hewett N.", "AuthorID": "6602370029", "AffiliationID": "109941323", "AffiliationName": "Pathway Charity"}}}
