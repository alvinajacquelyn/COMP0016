All rights reserved.Nearly five decades following its conception, the Gleason grading system remains a cornerstone in the prognostication and management of patients with prostate cancer. In the past few years, a debate has been growing whether Gleason score 3 + 3 = 6 prostate cancer is a clinically significant disease. Clinical, molecular and genetic research is addressing the question whether well characterized Gleason score 3 + 3 = 6 disease has the ability to affect the morbidity and quality of life of an individual in whom it is diagnosed. The consequences of treatment of Gleason score 3 + 3 = 6 disease are considerable; few men get through their treatments without sustaining some harm. Further modification of the classification of prostate cancer and dropping the label cancer for Gleason score 3 + 3 = 6 disease might be warranted.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Humans", "Male", "Neoplasm Grading", "Prostatic Neoplasms"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84983048124", "SubjectAreas": [["Urology", "MEDI", "2748"]], "AuthorData": {"35203878900": {"Name": "Miah S.", "AuthorID": "35203878900", "AffiliationID": "60029950", "AffiliationName": "Division of Surgery and Interventional Science, University College London Medical School Building"}, "8147855500": {"Name": "Ahmed H.U.", "AuthorID": "8147855500", "AffiliationID": "60029950", "AffiliationName": "Division of Surgery and Interventional Science, University College London Medical School Building"}, "7004667094": {"Name": "Emberton M.", "AuthorID": "7004667094", "AffiliationID": "60029950", "AffiliationName": "Division of Surgery and Interventional Science, University College London Medical School Building"}, "8972541300": {"Name": "Freeman A.", "AuthorID": "8972541300", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, University College London Hospital"}}}
