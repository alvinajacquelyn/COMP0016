This study examines how therapists working within a specialist cultural service in London, UK were able to question a family's core cultural belief system whilst building and maintaining a strong therapeutic alliance. Video-assisted semi-structured interviews were carried out with two family members and their two therapists, and analysed using thematic analysis. The findings suggest that core beliefs can be effectively challenged within the context of a strong therapeutic alliance if topics are approached in a sensitive and respectful manner, by trusted therapists who have a degree of knowledge and awareness of their own cultural positioning, as well as an understanding of their clients\u2019 culture. We propose that engaging with culture in this way can strengthen alliance and facilitate positive change. Practitioner points: Core cultural belief systems can be effectively challenged by therapists within the context of a positive therapeutic alliance Topics need to be approached sensitively with a degree of authenticity, curiosity and respect Respectfully challenging core beliefs while being aware of one's own cultural construction and positioning, can strengthen the therapeutic alliance and promote positive change.", "AuthorKeywords": ["black and minority-ethnic client groups", "culture", "family belief", "qualitative research", "therapeutic alliance"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85013951919", "SubjectAreas": [["Social Psychology", "PSYC", "3207"], ["Clinical Psychology", "PSYC", "3203"], ["Social Sciences (miscellaneous)", "SOCI", "3301"]], "AuthorData": {"57163169600": {"Name": "Yon K.", "AuthorID": "57163169600", "AffiliationID": "60020150", "AffiliationName": "Tavistock and Portman NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57193429879": {"Name": "Malik R.", "AuthorID": "57193429879", "AffiliationID": "60020150", "AffiliationName": "Tavistock and Portman NHS Foundation Trust"}, "17435051400": {"Name": "Mandin P.", "AuthorID": "17435051400", "AffiliationID": "119688349", "AffiliationName": "Westminster Children's Services"}, "57216973595": {"Name": "Midgley N.", "AuthorID": "57216973595", "AffiliationID": "60170329", "AffiliationName": "The Anna Freud Centre"}}}
