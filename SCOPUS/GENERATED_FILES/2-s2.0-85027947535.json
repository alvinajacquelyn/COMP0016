The objective was to prompt selectivity and sensitivity enhancements that were otherwise unattained with the unmodified material when detecting a range of hydrocarbon vapours with similar molecular structures and kinetic diameters. Molecules with different functional groups were also explored. Overlayers were designed by screen-printing 1 or 3 zeolite depositions on top of the control sensor. Admixtures were prepared by screen-printing composites of the control material with 10% (w/w) and 30% (w/w) of zeolite. Tests were performed against ethane, propane, butane, ethanol, isopropanol, acetone, toluene and carbon monoxide at concentrations in the 2.5\u2013125 ppm range and sensors were heated to temperatures in the 250\u2013500 \u00b0C range. Sensors were also exposed to humid air and to a mixture of ethane and humid air to assess the selective capabilities of the sensing materials in mixed-gas environments. Both fabrication methods provided sensor responses that, combined, favoured vapour discrimination in a way unachievable with the control sensor and the presence of zeolite was seen to assist in sensitivity and selectivity enhancements towards vapours, whilst providing stable and repeatable responses over time.", "AuthorKeywords": ["MOS gas sensor arrays", "Zeolite modification"], "IndexKeywords": ["Control materials", "Fabrication method", "Hydrocarbon detection", "MOS gas sensors", "Selectivity and sensitivity", "Selectivity enhancement", "Sensing material", "Zeolite modification"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85027947535", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Instrumentation", "PHYS", "3105"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Surfaces, Coatings and Films", "MATE", "2508"], ["Metals and Alloys", "MATE", "2506"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"], ["Materials Chemistry", "MATE", "2505"]], "AuthorData": {"57203488414": {"Name": "Tarttelin Hern\u00e1ndez P.", "AuthorID": "57203488414", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dept. of Security and Crime Science, University College London"}, "6602657397": {"Name": "Hailes S.", "AuthorID": "6602657397", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dept. of Computer Science, University College London"}, "56217400400": {"Name": "Parkin I.", "AuthorID": "56217400400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dept. of Chemistry, University College London"}}}
