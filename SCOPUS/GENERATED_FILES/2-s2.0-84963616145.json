Published by the American Physical Society.The existence of low-frequency waveguide modes of electrostatic ion acoustic waves is demonstrated in magnetized plasmas for cases where the electron temperature is striated along magnetic field lines. For low frequencies, the temperature striation acts as waveguide that supports a trapped mode. For conditions where the ion cyclotron frequency is below the ion plasma frequency we find a dispersion relation having also a radiative frequency band, where waves can escape from the striation. Arguments for the formation and propagation of an equivalent of electrostatic shocks are presented and demonstrated numerically for these conditions. The shock represents here a balance between an external energy input maintained by ion injection and a dissipation mechanism in the form of energy leakage of the harmonics generated by nonlinear wave steepening. This is a reversible form for energy loss that can replace the time-irreversible losses in a standard Burgers equation.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Dispersion relations", "Dissipation mechanism", "Electrostatic shocks", "Ion plasma frequency", "Ion-cyclotron frequency", "Irreversible loss", "Magnetic field line", "Magnetized plasmas"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84963616145", "SubjectAreas": [["Statistical and Nonlinear Physics", "PHYS", "3109"], ["Statistics and Probability", "MATH", "2613"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"]], "AuthorData": {"6602350743": {"Name": "Guio P.", "AuthorID": "6602350743", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "7004453583": {"Name": "P\u00e9cseli H.", "AuthorID": "7004453583", "AffiliationID": "60010348", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of Oslo"}}}
