However, little is known of the detailed contributions of these two orthosteric sites to neonicotinoid actions. We therefore applied voltage-clamp electrophysiology to the D\u03b11/chicken \u03b22 hybrid nAChR expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes to explore the agonist actions of imidacloprid and thiacloprid on wild type receptors and following binding site mutations. First, we studied the S221E mutation in loop C of the ACh binding site of the D\u03b11 subunit. Secondly, we explored the impact of combining this mutation in loop C with others in the loop D-E-G triangle (R57S; E78K; K140T; S221E). The S221E loop C mutation alone reduced the affinity of the neonicotinoids tested, while hardly affecting the concentration-response curve for acetylcholine. Addition of the three R57S; E78K; K140T mutations in the loop D-E-G triangle led to a further reduction in neonicotinoid sensitivity, suggesting that all four binding site loops (C, D, E, G) in the D\u03b11 subunit, which are located upstream of loop B in the N-terminal, extracellular domain, contribute to the selective actions of neonicotinoid insecticides.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Imidacloprid", "Neonicotinoid", "Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor", "Orthosteric binding site", "Thiacloprid", "\u03b1 subunit"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Binding Sites", "Chickens", "Drosophila", "Electrophysiology", "Female", "Mutation", "Neonicotinoids", "Nitro Compounds", "Oocytes", "Receptors, Nicotinic", "Thiazines", "Xenopus laevis"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85044989260", "SubjectAreas": [["Agronomy and Crop Science", "AGRI", "1102"], ["Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis", "ENVI", "2307"]], "AuthorData": {"57195421825": {"Name": "Hikida M.", "AuthorID": "57195421825", "AffiliationID": "60092005", "AffiliationName": "Department of Applied Biological Chemistry, Faculty of Agriculture, Kindai University"}, "57201471351": {"Name": "Shimada S.", "AuthorID": "57201471351", "AffiliationID": "60092005", "AffiliationName": "Department of Applied Biological Chemistry, Faculty of Agriculture, Kindai University"}, "57201474398": {"Name": "Kurata R.", "AuthorID": "57201474398", "AffiliationID": "60092005", "AffiliationName": "Department of Applied Biological Chemistry, Faculty of Agriculture, Kindai University"}, "57201469408": {"Name": "Shigetou S.", "AuthorID": "57201469408", "AffiliationID": "60092005", "AffiliationName": "Department of Applied Biological Chemistry, Faculty of Agriculture, Kindai University"}, "57214803236": {"Name": "Ihara M.", "AuthorID": "57214803236", "AffiliationID": "60092005", "AffiliationName": "Department of Applied Biological Chemistry, Faculty of Agriculture, Kindai University"}, "7401938397": {"Name": "Matsuda K.", "AuthorID": "7401938397", "AffiliationID": "60092005", "AffiliationName": "Department of Applied Biological Chemistry, Faculty of Agriculture, Kindai University"}, "7006226532": {"Name": "Sattelle D.", "AuthorID": "7006226532", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Respiratory Biology, UCL Respiratory, University College London"}}}
