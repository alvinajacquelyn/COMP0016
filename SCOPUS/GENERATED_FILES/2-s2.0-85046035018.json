The article attempts two things. First, it details and describes some discomforts, oppositions and resistances that are evident in these schools in relation to some of the educational reforms and policy imperatives that are in play. Second, the article connects these empirical instances to an understanding of resistance that embraces subtlety, contingency and contradiction, as well as the elision of accommodations and resistances that can occur, in order to trouble what is sometimes taken as \u2018a high level of compliance amongst teachers\u2019 in neoliberal times.", "AuthorKeywords": ["education policy", "policy enactment", "Resistance"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85046035018", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"]], "AuthorData": {"7201807975": {"Name": "Maguire M.", "AuthorID": "7201807975", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Public Policy Research, School of Education, Communication and Society, King\u2019s College London"}, "23134795600": {"Name": "Braun A.", "AuthorID": "23134795600", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Education, University College London"}, "7202536805": {"Name": "Ball S.", "AuthorID": "7202536805", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Education, University College London"}}}
