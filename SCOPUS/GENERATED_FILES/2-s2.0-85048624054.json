However, quantifying the exact amount of symmetry present is often difficult. We propose a novel symmetry metric that can score the amount of rotational, translational, and reflective symmetry present in a graph or line diagram.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Diagram evaluation", "Line diagrams", "Symmetry detection"], "IndexKeywords": ["Desirable features", "Diagram evaluation", "Line diagrams", "Reflective symmetry", "Symmetry detection"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85048624054", "SubjectAreas": [["Theoretical Computer Science", "MATH", "2614"], ["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"]], "AuthorData": {"41261990100": {"Name": "Klapaukh R.", "AuthorID": "41261990100", "AffiliationID": "60002316", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering and Computer Science, Victoria University of Wellington"}, "57220820396": {"Name": "Marshall S.", "AuthorID": "57220820396", "AffiliationID": "60002316", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering and Computer Science, Victoria University of Wellington"}, "35303341300": {"Name": "Pearce D.", "AuthorID": "35303341300", "AffiliationID": "60002316", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering and Computer Science, Victoria University of Wellington"}}}
