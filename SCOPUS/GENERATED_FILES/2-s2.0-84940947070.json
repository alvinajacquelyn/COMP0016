Chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) redirect T cell specificity toward antibody-recognized antigens expressed on the surface of cancer cells, while T cell receptors (TCRs) extend the range of targets to include intracellular tumor antigens. CAR redirected T cells specific for the B cell differentiation antigen CD19 have shown dramatic efficacy in the treatment of B cell malignancies, while TCR-redirected T cells have shown benefits in patients suffering from solid cancer. In this review we will present strategies to optimize CAR and TCR function, and discuss the importance of target antigen selection to enhance tumor specificity, while reducing on-target and off-target toxicity.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Antigens, Neoplasm", "Genetic Therapy", "Humans", "Neoplasms", "Receptors, Antigen", "Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84940947070", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"], ["Drug Discovery", "PHAR", "3002"]], "AuthorData": {"57202567329": {"Name": "Stauss H.", "AuthorID": "57202567329", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Immunity and Transplantation, Royal Free Campus, University College London"}, "8747891100": {"Name": "Morris E.", "AuthorID": "8747891100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Immunity and Transplantation, Royal Free Campus, University College London"}, "7005094602": {"Name": "Abken H.", "AuthorID": "7005094602", "AffiliationID": "60008658", "AffiliationName": "Clinic i for Internal Medicine, University Hospital Cologne"}}}
