We make PDF sets available in steps of \u0394mc=0.05GeV and \u0394mb=0.25GeV, and present the variation in the PDFs and in the predictions. We examine the comparison to the HERA data on charm and beauty structure functions and note that in each case the heavy-quark data, and the inclusive data, have a slight preference for lower masses than our default values. We provide PDF sets with three and four active quark flavours, as well as the standard value of five flavours. We use the pole mass definition of the quark masses, as in the default MMHT2014 analysis, but briefly comment on the MS\u00af definition.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84953395795", "SubjectAreas": [["Engineering (miscellaneous)", "ENGI", "2201"], ["Physics and Astronomy (miscellaneous)", "PHYS", "3101"]], "AuthorData": {"35589760900": {"Name": "Harland-Lang L.A.", "AuthorID": "35589760900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "15035882900": {"Name": "Motylinski P.", "AuthorID": "15035882900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "7101652961": {"Name": "Thorne R.S.", "AuthorID": "7101652961", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "7404932388": {"Name": "Martin A.D.", "AuthorID": "7404932388", "AffiliationID": "60022175, 60176038", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Particle Physics Phenomenology, Durham University"}}}
