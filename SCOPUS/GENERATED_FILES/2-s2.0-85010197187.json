All rights reserved.The catabolic cellular processes collectively described as autophagy have been heavily implicated in the pathogenesis of Parkinsons disease by both genetic and cellular evidence. Drawing on the major advances in our understanding of Mendelian Parkinsons, as well as the identification of more common risk variants by genome-wide association studies, there are now a number of genes that form a link between autophagy and Parkinsons. Coupled with cellular results demonstrating that autophagy is a key player in the events that result in protein aggregation and mitochondrial dysfunction, both central to the pathogenic processes operating in the Parkinsons brain, autophagy, the lysosomal system, and intracellular vesicle trafficking are emerging as one of the most exciting areas of research into Parkinsons.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alpha synuclein", "ATP13a2", "Autophagy", "GBA", "LRRK2", "Lysosomes", "Parkinsons disease", "Vesicle trafficking", "VPS35"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85010197187", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"]], "AuthorData": {"14045338700": {"Name": "Lewis P.", "AuthorID": "14045338700", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "54789176800": {"Name": "Perez-Carrion M.", "AuthorID": "54789176800", "AffiliationID": "60015986", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Integrative Biology (CIBIO), Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Trento"}, "57201345765": {"Name": "Piccoli G.", "AuthorID": "57201345765", "AffiliationID": "60085192", "AffiliationName": "Dulbecco Telethon Institute"}}}
