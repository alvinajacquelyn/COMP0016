Extant neuroscientific studies have typically investigated spatial navigation on a horizontal 2D plane, leaving much unknown about how 3D spatial information is represented in the brain. Specifically, horizontal and vertical information may be encoded in the same or different neural structures with equal or unequal sensitivity. Here, we investigated these possibilities using fMRI while participants were passively moved within a 3D lattice structure as if riding a rollercoaster. Multivoxel pattern analysis was used to test for the existence of information relating to where and in which direction participants were heading in this virtual environment. Behaviorally, participants had similarly accurate memory for vertical and horizontal locations and the right anterior hippocampus (HC) expressed place information that was sensitive to changes along both horizontal and vertical axes. This is suggestive of isotropic 3D place encoding. In contrast, participants indicated their heading direction faster and more accurately when they were heading in a tilted-up or tilted-down direction. This direction information was expressed in the right retrosplenial cortex and posterior HC and was only sensitive to vertical pitch, which could reflect the importance of the vertical (gravity) axis as a reference frame. Overall, our findings extend previous knowledge of how we represent the spatial world and navigate within it by taking into account the important third dimension.", "AuthorKeywords": ["3D", "Hippocampus", "Isotropic", "Navigation", "Retrosplenial", "Virtual reality"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Female", "Hippocampus", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Space Perception", "Spatial Behavior"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85021308721", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"]], "AuthorData": {"57194630032": {"Name": "Kim M.", "AuthorID": "57194630032", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60084279, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "7005945840": {"Name": "Maguire E.A.", "AuthorID": "7005945840", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60084279, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "26643352100": {"Name": "Jeffery K.J.", "AuthorID": "26643352100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Behavioural Neuroscience, Division of Psychology and Language Sciences, University College London"}}}
