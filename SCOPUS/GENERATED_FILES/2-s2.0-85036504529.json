Research to overcome this hurdle is gaining momentum through international research collaboration and a series of genetic and molecular discoveries in the last few years, which have advanced our knowledge of this rare synucleinopathy. In MSA, the discovery of \u03b1-synuclein pathology and glial cytoplasmic inclusions remain the most significant findings. Families with certain types of \u03b1-synuclein mutations develop diseases that mimic MSA, and the spectrum of clinical and pathological features in these families suggests a spectrum of severity, from late-onset Parkinson's disease to MSA. Nonetheless, controversies persist, such as the role of common \u03b1-synuclein variants in MSA and whether this disorder shares a common mechanism of spreading pathology with other protein misfolding neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we review these issues, specifically focusing on \u03b1-synuclein mutations.", "AuthorKeywords": ["MSA", "Multiple system atrophy", "Neurodegenerative disorders", "\u03b1-synuclein"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85036504529", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Immunology and Microbiology (all)", "IMMU", "2400"], ["Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics (all)", "PHAR", "3000"]], "AuthorData": {"7003363686": {"Name": "Houlden H.", "AuthorID": "7003363686", "AffiliationID": "60020736", "AffiliationName": "Neurogenetics Laboratory, The National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "57198451494": {"Name": "Whittaker H.T.", "AuthorID": "57198451494", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "8581587200": {"Name": "Bettencourt C.", "AuthorID": "8581587200", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Experimental Epilepsy, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "57198428380": {"Name": "Qui Y.", "AuthorID": "57198428380", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Experimental Epilepsy, UCL Institute of Neurology"}}}
