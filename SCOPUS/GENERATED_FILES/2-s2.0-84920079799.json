Published by Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.The synthesis of metal-organic frameworks with large three-dimensional channels that are permanently porous and chemically stable offers new opportunities in areas such as catalysis and separation. Two linkers (L1 = 4,4\u2032,4\u2033,4\u2304-([1,1\u2032-biphenyl]-3,3\u2032,5,5\u2032-tetrayltetrakis(ethyne-2,1-diyl)) tetrabenzoic acid, L2 = 4,4\u2032,4\u2033,4\u2304-(pyrene-1,3,6,8-tetrayltetrakis(e-thyne-2,1-diyl))tetrabenzoic acid) were used that have equivalent connectivity and dimensions but quite distinct torsional flexibility. With these, a solid solution material, [Zr6O4(OH)4(L1)2.6(L2)0.4]\u00b7(solvent)x, was formed that has three-dimensional crystalline permanent porosity with a surface area of over 4000 m2 g-1 that persists after immersion in water. These properties are not accessible for the isostructural phases made from the separate single linkers.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Mesoporous materials", "Metal-organic frameworks", "Water stability", "Zirconium"], "IndexKeywords": ["Immersion in waters", "Isostructural", "Metal organic framework", "Structural stabilities", "Surface area", "Three-dimensional channels", "Three-dimensional pores", "Water stability"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84920079799", "SubjectAreas": [["Catalysis", "CENG", "1503"], ["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"]], "AuthorData": {"24466544500": {"Name": "Kalidindi S.B.", "AuthorID": "24466544500", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Liverpool Crown Street"}, "25650222800": {"Name": "Nayak S.", "AuthorID": "25650222800", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Liverpool Crown Street"}, "56349600800": {"Name": "Briggs M.E.", "AuthorID": "56349600800", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Liverpool Crown Street"}, "6602848758": {"Name": "Jansat S.", "AuthorID": "6602848758", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Liverpool Crown Street"}, "6507556349": {"Name": "Katsoulidis A.P.", "AuthorID": "6507556349", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Liverpool Crown Street"}, "24528851000": {"Name": "Miller G.J.", "AuthorID": "24528851000", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Liverpool Crown Street"}, "7402212392": {"Name": "Warren J.E.", "AuthorID": "7402212392", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Liverpool Crown Street"}, "57205048748": {"Name": "Antypov D.", "AuthorID": "57205048748", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Liverpool Crown Street"}, "26434297200": {"Name": "Prestly M.R.", "AuthorID": "26434297200", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Liverpool Crown Street"}, "8845695800": {"Name": "Mart-Gastaldo C.", "AuthorID": "8845695800", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Liverpool Crown Street"}, "7005114078": {"Name": "Rosseinsky M.J.", "AuthorID": "7005114078", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Liverpool Crown Street"}, "55944154200": {"Name": "Cor\u00e0 F.", "AuthorID": "55944154200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "54785285800": {"Name": "Slater B.", "AuthorID": "54785285800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}}}
