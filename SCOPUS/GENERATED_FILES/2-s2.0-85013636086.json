Tree-based regression models are popular in literature due to their flexibility to model higher order non-linearity and great interpretability. Conventionally, regression tree models are trained in a two-stage procedure, i.e. recursive binary partitioning is employed to produce a tree structure, followed by a pruning process of removing insignificant leaves, with the possibility of assigning multivariate functions to terminal leaves to improve generalisation. This work introduces a novel methodology of node partitioning which, in a single optimisation model, simultaneously performs the two tasks of identifying the break-point of a binary split and assignment of multivariate functions to either leaf, thus leading to an efficient regression tree model. Using six real world benchmark problems, we demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms a number of state-of-the-art regression tree models and methods based on other techniques, with an average improvement of 7\u201360% on the mean absolute errors (MAE) of the predictions.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Mathematical programming", "Optimisation", "Regression analysis", "Regression tree", "Surrogate model"], "IndexKeywords": ["Automatic estimation", "Machine learning approaches", "Multivariate function", "Optimisations", "Regression tree models", "Regression trees", "Surrogate model", "Tree-based regression"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85013636086", "SubjectAreas": [["Engineering (all)", "ENGI", "2200"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Artificial Intelligence", "COMP", "1702"]], "AuthorData": {"54384562100": {"Name": "Yang L.", "AuthorID": "54384562100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Process Systems Engineerig, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "25628253900": {"Name": "Liu S.", "AuthorID": "25628253900", "AffiliationID": "60170469", "AffiliationName": "School of Management, Swansea University"}, "7003608896": {"Name": "Papageorgiou L.G.", "AuthorID": "7003608896", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Process Systems Engineerig, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "6603414724": {"Name": "Tsoka S.", "AuthorID": "6603414724", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Informatics, King's College London"}}}
