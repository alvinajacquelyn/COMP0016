Here, we report protein abundance data of 19 transporters in the kidney cortex across five species (human, monkey, dog, rat, and mouse). In general, the abundance of all of the 19 membrane transporters was higher in preclinical species compared with human except for multidrug resistance protein 1 (MDR1), organic cation transporter (OCT) 3, and OCTN1. In nonhuman primate, the total abundance of 12 transporters for which absolute data were available was 2.1-fold higher (P = 0.025) relative to human but the percentage of distribution of these transporters was identical in both species. Multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP) 4, OCTN2, organic anion transporter (OAT) 2, sodium/potassium-transporting ATPase, MRP3, SGLT2, OAT1, MRP1, MDR1, and OCT2 were expressed differently with cross-species variabilities of 8.2-, 7.4-, 6.1-, 5.9-, 5.4-, 5.2-, 4.1-, 3.3-, and 2.8-fold, respectively. Sex differences were only significant in rodents and dog. High protein-protein correlation was observed in OAT1 versus MRP2/MRP4 as well as OCT2 versus MATE1 in human and monkey. The cross-species and sexdependent protein abundance data are important for animal to human scaling of drug clearance as well as for mechanistic understanding of kidney physiology and derisking of kidney toxicity for new therapeutic candidates in drug development.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Dogs", "Drug Evaluation, Preclinical", "Female", "Humans", "Kidney Cortex", "Macaca fascicularis", "Male", "Membrane Transport Proteins", "Mice", "Proteomics", "Rats", "Renal Elimination", "Species Specificity"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85062659508", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"], ["Pharmaceutical Science", "PHAR", "3003"]], "AuthorData": {"56496281900": {"Name": "Prasad B.", "AuthorID": "56496281900", "AffiliationID": "60015481", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmaceutics, University of Washington"}}}
