Alternative possibilities include loss of muscle quality as people become unwell (reverse causality) or unmeasured confounding. Methods and Results-We conducted a cohort study using the UK Biobank (n=452 931). Baseline body mass index (BMI) was used to quantify adiposity and handgrip strength (HGS) used for muscle quality. Outcomes were fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular disease, and mortality. As a secondary analysis we used waist-hip-ratio or fat mass percentage instead of BMI, and skeletal muscle mass index instead of HGS. In a subsample, we used gene scores for BMI, waist-hip-ratio and HGS in a Mendelian randomization (MR). BMI defined obesity was associated with an increased risk of all outcomes (hazard ratio [HR] range 1.10-1.82). Low HGS was associated with increased risks of cardiovascular and all-cause mortality (HR range 1.39-1.72). HRs for the association between low HGS and cardiovascular disease events were smaller (HR range 1.05-1.09). There was no suggestion of an interaction between HGS and BMI to support the healthy obese hypothesis. Results using other adiposity metrics were similar. There was no evidence of an association between skeletal muscle mass index and any outcome. Factorial Mendelian randomization confirmed no evidence for an interaction. Low genetically predicted HGS was associated with an increased risk of mortality (HR range 1.08-1.19). Conclusions-Our analyses do not support the healthy obese concept, with no evidence that the adverse effect of obesity on outcomes was reduced by improved muscle quality. Lower HGS was associated with increased risks of mortality in both observational and MR analyses, suggesting reverse causality may not be the sole explanation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cardiovascular outcomes", "Epidemiology", "Grip strength", "Mendelian randomization", "Obesity"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adipose Tissue", "Aged", "Body Composition", "Body Mass Index", "Cardiovascular Diseases", "Cohort Studies", "Female", "Hand Strength", "Humans", "Male", "Mendelian Randomization Analysis", "Middle Aged", "Mortality", "Muscle, Skeletal", "Obesity", "Proportional Hazards Models", "Sarcopenia", "United Kingdom", "Waist-Hip Ratio"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85068496151", "SubjectAreas": [["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"8523363200": {"Name": "Farmer R.E.", "AuthorID": "8523363200", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Non Communicable Disease Epidemiology, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"}, "55497026300": {"Name": "Mathur R.", "AuthorID": "55497026300", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Non Communicable Disease Epidemiology, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"}, "23007687300": {"Name": "Bhaskaran K.", "AuthorID": "23007687300", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Non Communicable Disease Epidemiology, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"}, "7003651182": {"Name": "Smeeth L.", "AuthorID": "7003651182", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Non Communicable Disease Epidemiology, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"}, "55622055900": {"Name": "Schmidt A.F.", "AuthorID": "55622055900", "AffiliationID": "60032724", "AffiliationName": "Division Heart and Lungs, Department of Cardiology, University Medical Center Utrecht"}, "57205524308": {"Name": "Eastwood S.V.", "AuthorID": "57205524308", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}, "7005513520": {"Name": "Chaturvedi N.", "AuthorID": "7005513520", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}, "8849329800": {"Name": "Finan C.", "AuthorID": "8849329800", "AffiliationID": "114434400", "AffiliationName": "The Farr Institute of Health Informatics"}, "36484367300": {"Name": "Fatemifar G.", "AuthorID": "36484367300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "The Institute of Health Informatics, University College London"}, "54902667300": {"Name": "Denaxas S.", "AuthorID": "54902667300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "The Institute of Health Informatics, University College London"}}}
