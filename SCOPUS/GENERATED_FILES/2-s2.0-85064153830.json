KGaA, WeinheimThe influence of micro/nanostructure on thermal conductivity is a topic of great scientific interest, particularly to thermoelectrics. The current understanding is that structural defects decrease thermal conductivity through phonon scattering where the phonon dispersion and speed of sound are assumed to remain constant. Experimental work on a PbTe model system is presented, which shows that the speed of sound linearly decreases with increased internal strain. This softening of the materials lattice completely accounts for the reduction in lattice thermal conductivity, without the introduction of additional phonon scattering mechanisms. Additionally, it is shown that a major contribution to the improvement in the thermoelectric figure of merit (zT > 2) of high-efficiency Na-doped PbTe can be attributed to lattice softening. While inhomogeneous internal strain fields are known to introduce phonon scattering centers, this study demonstrates that internal strain can modify phonon propagation speed as well. This presents new avenues to control lattice thermal conductivity, beyond phonon scattering. In practice, many engineering materials will exhibit both softening and scattering effects, as is shown in silicon. This work shines new light on studies of thermal conductivity in fields of energy materials, microelectronics, and nanoscale heat transfer.", "AuthorKeywords": ["lattice dynamics", "thermal conductivity", "thermoelectrics"], "IndexKeywords": ["Engineering materials", "Lattice thermal conductivity", "Micro/nanostructures", "Nanoscale heat transfers", "Phonon-scattering mechanisms", "Thermoelectric efficiency", "Thermoelectric figure of merit", "Thermoelectrics"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85064153830", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Mechanics of Materials", "ENGI", "2211"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"]], "AuthorData": {"56727982900": {"Name": "Hanus R.", "AuthorID": "56727982900", "AffiliationID": "60007363", "AffiliationName": "Materials Science and Engineering, Northwestern University"}, "57070252300": {"Name": "Agne M.T.", "AuthorID": "57070252300", "AffiliationID": "60007363", "AffiliationName": "Materials Science and Engineering, Northwestern University"}, "7006405920": {"Name": "Voorhees P.W.", "AuthorID": "7006405920", "AffiliationID": "60007363", "AffiliationName": "Materials Science and Engineering, Northwestern University"}, "35547214000": {"Name": "Snyder G.J.", "AuthorID": "35547214000", "AffiliationID": "60007363", "AffiliationName": "Materials Science and Engineering, Northwestern University"}, "55201215900": {"Name": "Rettie A.J.E.", "AuthorID": "55201215900", "AffiliationID": "60028609", "AffiliationName": "Materials Science Division, Argonne National Laboratory"}, "7401719279": {"Name": "Chung D.Y.", "AuthorID": "7401719279", "AffiliationID": "60028609", "AffiliationName": "Materials Science Division, Argonne National Laboratory"}, "35392448100": {"Name": "Kanatzidis M.G.", "AuthorID": "35392448100", "AffiliationID": "60007363", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Northwestern University"}, "56997732800": {"Name": "Chen Z.", "AuthorID": "56997732800", "AffiliationID": "60073652", "AffiliationName": "Materials Science and Engineering, Tongji University"}, "57205479530": {"Name": "Pei Y.", "AuthorID": "57205479530", "AffiliationID": "60073652", "AffiliationName": "Materials Science and Engineering, Tongji University"}, "30767872900": {"Name": "Tan G.", "AuthorID": "30767872900", "AffiliationID": "60022414, 60129467", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Advanced Technology for Materials Synthesis and Processing, Wuhan University of Technology"}}}
