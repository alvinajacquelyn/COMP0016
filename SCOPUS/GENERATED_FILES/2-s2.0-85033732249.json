The genealogy relating individuals in a sample from the population is embedded in a spatial version of the ancestral selection graph and through applying a diffusive scaling to this object we show that whereas in dimensions at least three, selection is barely impeded by the spatial structure, in the most relevant dimension, d = 2, selection must be stronger (by a factor of log(1/\u03bc) where \u03bc is the neutral mutation rate) if we are to have a chance of detecting it. The case d = 1 was handled in Etheridge, Freeman and Straulino (The Brownian net and selection in the spatial Lambda-Fleming-Viot. Preprint). The mathematical interest is that although the system of branching and coalescing lineages that forms the ancestral selection graph converges to a branching Brownian motion, this reflects a delicate balance of a branching rate that grows to infinity and the instant annullation of almost all branches through coalescence caused by the strong local competition in the population.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Branching", "Branching Brownian motion", "Coalescing", "Natural selection", "Population genetics", "Spatial Lambda-Fleming-Viot process"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85033732249", "SubjectAreas": [["Statistics and Probability", "MATH", "2613"], ["Statistics, Probability and Uncertainty", "DECI", "1804"]], "AuthorData": {"6701561916": {"Name": "Etheridge A.", "AuthorID": "6701561916", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Statistics, University of Oxford"}, "57193203249": {"Name": "Penington S.", "AuthorID": "57193203249", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Statistics, University of Oxford"}, "57194211198": {"Name": "Straulino D.", "AuthorID": "57194211198", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Statistics, University of Oxford"}, "56517734100": {"Name": "Freeman N.", "AuthorID": "56517734100", "AffiliationID": "60001881", "AffiliationName": "School of Mathematics and Statistics, University of Sheffield"}}}
