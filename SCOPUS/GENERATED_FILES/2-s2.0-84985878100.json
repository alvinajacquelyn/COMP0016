However, improvements in performance may not be the same for users of all CI devices; in particular for those with Cochlear devices using n-of-m strategies (ACE or SPEAK). The goal of this research was to determine for users of Cochlear devices (CP810 or CP900 series processors) if speech perception could be improved when indiscriminable electrodes were de-activated and this was also compared to when the same number of discriminable electrodes were de-activated. A cross-over study was conducted with 13 adult CI users who received experimental maps with de-activated channels for a minimum of 2 months and these were compared to optimised clinical maps. The findings showed that there were no significant benefits of electrode deactivation on speech perception and that there was a significant deterioration in spectro-temporal ripple perception when electrodes were switched off. There were no significant differences between de-activation of discriminable or indiscriminable electrodes. These findings suggest that electrode de-activation with n-of-m strategies may not be beneficial.", "AuthorKeywords": ["ACE strategy", "Cochlear implant", "Electrode deactivation", "Electrode discrimination", "Electrode-neurone interface", "Fitting", "Mapping", "N-of-m", "Pitch ranking", "Speech perception"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Cochlear Implants", "Cross-Over Studies", "Electrodes", "Humans", "Single-Blind Method", "Speech Perception"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84985878100", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"7006164240": {"Name": "Vickers D.", "AuthorID": "7006164240", "AffiliationID": "60011326", "AffiliationName": "UCL Ear Institute"}, "57188857524": {"Name": "Degun A.", "AuthorID": "57188857524", "AffiliationID": "60011326", "AffiliationName": "UCL Ear Institute"}, "57191030958": {"Name": "Canas A.", "AuthorID": "57191030958", "AffiliationID": "60011326", "AffiliationName": "UCL Ear Institute"}, "6506830610": {"Name": "Stainsby T.", "AuthorID": "6506830610", "AffiliationID": "60093776", "AffiliationName": "Cochlear Technology Centre"}, "6603596663": {"Name": "Vanpoucke F.", "AuthorID": "6603596663", "AffiliationID": "60093776", "AffiliationName": "Cochlear Technology Centre"}}}
