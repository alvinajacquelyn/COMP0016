This important result can be confirmed by performing systematically polarimetry observations in the X-ray band for other strongly magnetized neutron stars, such as transient or persistent magnetars. We computed the phase averaged polarization fraction (PF) and polarization angle (PA) expected in the thermal emission from transient magnetars in the soft X-ray energy band. We found that the detection of a PF higher than 60% is a strong evidence for vacuum birefringence. We also found that a steady change in the PA measured from transient magnetars during their outburst decay (up to 23 degrees for a magnetospheric untwisting of 0.5 rad) is a strong signature of vacuum birefringence. This latter detection would also provide an independent check of the magnetospheric untwisting model for these sources. Simulations show that these measurements are achievable by future polarimetric missions such as XIPE and IXPE with 20-380 ks of observational time, and with eXTP with 3-60 ks.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Independent checks", "Isolated neutron stars", "Magnetized neutron stars", "Optical polarimetry", "Polarization angle", "Polarization fractions", "Strong magnetic fields", "X-ray polarimetry"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85039456088", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"57193545541": {"Name": "Gonz\u00e1lez-Caniulef D.", "AuthorID": "57193545541", "AffiliationID": "60084281, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Mullard Space Science Laboratory, University College London"}, "7003322389": {"Name": "Zane S.", "AuthorID": "7003322389", "AffiliationID": "60084281, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Mullard Space Science Laboratory, University College London"}, "57200089878": {"Name": "Song X.", "AuthorID": "57200089878", "AffiliationID": "60084281, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Mullard Space Science Laboratory, University College London"}, "57201393478": {"Name": "Wu K.", "AuthorID": "57201393478", "AffiliationID": "60084281, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Mullard Space Science Laboratory, University College London"}, "56023851500": {"Name": "Taverna R.", "AuthorID": "56023851500", "AffiliationID": "60000481", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of Padova"}, "56273373700": {"Name": "Turolla R.", "AuthorID": "56273373700", "AffiliationID": "60000481", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of Padova"}}}
