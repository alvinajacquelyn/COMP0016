Traditionally, preoperative pathways have focused on the underlying disease process and \u2018fitness for surgery\u2019 with physical pre-assessment and risk counselling late in the pathway when little time is available to intervene. With an increasingly elderly and co-morbid surgical population, early physiological assessment and multidisciplinary collaborative decision-making is increasingly important. Multimodal prehabilitation programmes may improve surgical outcome, facilitating rapid recovery from surgery and limiting post-operative functional dependence. Patient education and engagement is important if compliance with behavioural change is to be achieved and maintained. To date, there has been evidence supporting preoperative exercise training, smoking cessation, reduction in alcohol intake, anaemia management and psychosocial support. Further research is needed to identify the most effective elements of these complex preoperative interventions, as well as their optimum timing and duration.", "AuthorKeywords": ["cardiopulmonary exercise testing", "functional capacity", "prehabilitation", "surgical outcome"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Humans", "Outcome Assessment (Health Care)", "Postoperative Complications", "Preoperative Care", "Risk"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84973875563", "SubjectAreas": [["Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine", "MEDI", "2703"]], "AuthorData": {"16052616700": {"Name": "Levett D.Z.H.", "AuthorID": "16052616700", "AffiliationID": "60025287", "AffiliationName": "Integrative Physiology and Critical Illness Group, Clinical and Experimental Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton"}, "57210600252": {"Name": "Edwards M.", "AuthorID": "57210600252", "AffiliationID": "100624667", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anaesthesia"}, "55348894800": {"Name": "Grocott M.", "AuthorID": "55348894800", "AffiliationID": "101441990", "AffiliationName": "GICU"}, "35458587700": {"Name": "Mythen M.", "AuthorID": "35458587700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
