The collisions between two moving bodies can be grouped into three types associated with the direction of the collision, namely head-on (or bow) collisions, overtaking collisions, and crossing collisions. This chapter describes the methods for assessing collision risk, where nonlinear structural mechanics and limit state methodologies should inevitably be applied (as described in Chap. 11). As an illustrative example, a collision between two ships is highlighted. Similar procedures can be applied to other types of collisions. Nonlinear finite element method modeling techniques for the consequence analysis associated with structural crashworthiness in collisions are referred to in Chap. 11. The methods in this chapter are described in association with the shipping industry, but can be applied to other types of structural systems in collisions.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85070671639", "SubjectAreas": [["Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality", "ENGI", "2213"]], "AuthorData": {"35821146600": {"Name": "Paik J.K.", "AuthorID": "35821146600", "AffiliationID": "60008783", "AffiliationName": "The Korea Ship and Offshore Research Institute (Lloyd\u2019s Register Foundation Research Centre of Excellence), Pusan National University"}}}
