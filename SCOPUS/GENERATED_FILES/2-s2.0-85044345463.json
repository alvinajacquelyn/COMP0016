Here, we focused on a natural piscine model, the three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus), and asked how seasonal immune allocation is driven by physical variables (time, light, and heat). Using functionally-relevant gene expression metrics as a reporter of seasonal immune allocation, we synchronously sampled fish monthly from the wild (two habitats), and from semi-natural outdoors mesocosms (stocked from one of the wild habitats). This was repeated across two annual cycles, with continuous within-habitat monitoring of environmental temperature and implementing a manipulation of temperature in the mesocosms. We also conducted a long-term laboratory experiment, subjecting acclimated wild fish to natural and accelerated (\u00d72) photoperiodic change at 7 and 15\u00b0C. The laboratory experiment demonstrated that immune allocation was independent of photoperiod and only a very modest effect, at most, was controlled by a tentative endogenous circannual rhythm. On the other hand, experimentally-determined thermal effects were able to quantitatively predict much of the summer-winter fluctuation observed in the field and mesocosms. Importantly, however, temperature was insufficient to fully predict, and occasionally was a poor predictor of, natural patterns. Thermal effects can thus be overridden by other (unidentified) natural environmental variation and do not take the form of an unavoidable constraint due to cold-blooded physiology. This is consistent with a context-dependent strategic control of immunity in response to temperature variation, and points to the existence of temperature-sensitive regulatory circuits that might be conserved in other vertebrates.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Gasterosteus aculeatus", "Immunity", "Immunoregulation", "Photoperiod", "Seasonality", "Temperature"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85044345463", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"]], "AuthorData": {"57201918464": {"Name": "Stewart A.", "AuthorID": "57201918464", "AffiliationID": "60021097, 60172389", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Surrey"}, "7005219307": {"Name": "Cable J.", "AuthorID": "7005219307", "AffiliationID": "60170432, 60023998", "AffiliationName": "School of Biosciences, Cardiff University"}, "55583982100": {"Name": "Habl\u00fctzel P.I.", "AuthorID": "55583982100", "AffiliationID": "60025063", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Biodiversity and Evolutionary Genomics, Biology Department, University of Leuven"}, "57195528816": {"Name": "Watson H.V.", "AuthorID": "57195528816", "AffiliationID": "60030469", "AffiliationName": "School of Environmental Sciences, University of Hull"}, "57189330399": {"Name": "Brown M.", "AuthorID": "57189330399", "AffiliationID": "60105121, 60030514", "AffiliationName": "IBERS, Aberystwyth University"}, "26221584300": {"Name": "Friberg I.M.", "AuthorID": "26221584300", "AffiliationID": "60008250", "AffiliationName": "School of Environment and Life Sciences, University of Salford"}, "7404117014": {"Name": "Jackson J.A.", "AuthorID": "7404117014", "AffiliationID": "60008250", "AffiliationName": "School of Environment and Life Sciences, University of Salford"}}}
