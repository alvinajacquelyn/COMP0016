Over three decades, Alessi developed three different strategies to combine normative elements of the two logics, using each strategy to envision and pursue different market opportunities. By combining the logics of industrial manufacturing and cultural production, Alessi was able to envision new possibilities for value creation and to enact them through innovation in product design. The three strategies triggered a common set of mechanisms through which the purposeful combining of logics enabled the pursuit of opportunity, while each strategy structured the process differently. We develop a theoretical model linking the development of recombinant strategies to the dynamic restructuring of organizational agency and the related capacity to create and pursue new market opportunities. Our findings and theoretical insights advance understanding of the processes through which organizations challenge taken-for-granted beliefs and practices to create new market opportunities, use logics as resources to enable embedded agency, and design hybrid organizational arrangements.", "AuthorKeywords": ["cultural production", "design innovation", "hybrid organizations", "institutional complexity", "multiple institutional logics", "opportunity creation"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84979231369", "SubjectAreas": [["Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)", "ARTS", "1201"], ["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"], ["Public Administration", "SOCI", "3321"]], "AuthorData": {"37057151900": {"Name": "Dalpiaz E.", "AuthorID": "37057151900", "AffiliationID": "60116484", "AffiliationName": "Imperial College Business School"}, "6602650556": {"Name": "Rindova V.", "AuthorID": "6602650556", "AffiliationID": "60116471, 60013372", "AffiliationName": "McCombs School of Business, University of Texas at Austin"}, "56006342100": {"Name": "Ravasi D.", "AuthorID": "56006342100", "AffiliationID": "60020134, 60025704", "AffiliationName": "Cass Business School, City University London"}}}
