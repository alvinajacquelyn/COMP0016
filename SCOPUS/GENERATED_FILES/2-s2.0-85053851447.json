However, inter-site variability in image properties can challenge the translation of these tools to data from \u2018unseen\u2019 sites not included in the training data. This study quantifies the impact of inter-site variability on the accuracy of deep-learning-based segmentations of the prostate from magnetic resonance (MR) images, and evaluates two strategies for mitigating the reduced accuracy for data from unseen sites: training on multi-site data and training with limited additional data from the unseen site. Using 376 T2-weighted prostate MR images from six sites, we compare the segmentation accuracy (Dice score and boundary distance) of three deep-learning-based networks trained on data from a single site and on various configurations of data from multiple sites. We found that the segmentation accuracy of a single-site network was substantially worse on data from unseen sites than on data from the training site. Training on multi-site data yielded marginally improved accuracy and robustness. However, including as few as 8 subjects from the unseen site, e.g. during commissioning of a new clinical system, yielded substantial improvement (regaining 75% of the difference in Dice score).", "AuthorKeywords": ["Deep learning", "Inter-site variability", "Prostate", "Segmentation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Clinical systems", "Image properties", "Imaging applications", "Inter-site variability", "Learning-based segmentation", "Prostate", "Prostate segmentation", "Segmentation accuracy"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85053851447", "SubjectAreas": [["Theoretical Computer Science", "MATH", "2614"], ["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"]], "AuthorData": {"36026807300": {"Name": "Gibson E.", "AuthorID": "36026807300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "24512208500": {"Name": "Hu Y.", "AuthorID": "24512208500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "57202380935": {"Name": "Ghavami N.", "AuthorID": "57202380935", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "7402982572": {"Name": "Moore C.", "AuthorID": "7402982572", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "7004667094": {"Name": "Emberton M.", "AuthorID": "7004667094", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "7005201740": {"Name": "Barratt D.", "AuthorID": "7005201740", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "8147855500": {"Name": "Ahmed H.", "AuthorID": "8147855500", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Imperial College"}, "35509884100": {"Name": "Huisman H.", "AuthorID": "35509884100", "AffiliationID": "60002573", "AffiliationName": "Radboud University Medical Center"}}}
