However, individuals with different educational, cultural, economic, or ethnic backgrounds differ in their levels of social investment and endorsement of egalitarian values. We present four experiments showing that subtle cues to social status (i.e., prestige and reputation in the eyes of others) modulate prosocial orientation. The experiments found that individuals who experienced low status showed more communal and prosocial behavior, and endorsed more egalitarian life goals and values compared with those who experienced high status. Behavioral differences across high- and low-status positions appeared early in human ontogeny (4-5 y of age).", "AuthorKeywords": ["Altruism", "Prosocial behavior", "Social hierarchies", "Social status"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Child, Preschool", "Humans", "Social Behavior", "Social Class"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84922454991", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"17345779900": {"Name": "Guinote A.", "AuthorID": "17345779900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Experimental Psychology, University College London"}, "56509470700": {"Name": "Cotzia I.", "AuthorID": "56509470700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Experimental Psychology, University College London"}, "56509090800": {"Name": "Sandhu S.", "AuthorID": "56509090800", "AffiliationID": "60010818", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, Keynes College, University of Kent"}, "56509537200": {"Name": "Siwa P.", "AuthorID": "56509537200", "AffiliationID": "60010818", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, Keynes College, University of Kent"}}}
