Individuals with JME, however, often require lifelong therapy to remain seizure-free, and a few have refractory epilepsy. We ascertained a population with JME and characterized a subgroup with refractory epilepsy. Material and methods: We audited and reviewed clinical records of individuals diagnosed with JME identified via a sample of 6600 individuals in a clinical database from a specialized epilepsy clinic at a tertiary referral center. Results: We identified 240 people with a diagnosis of JME (146 females), with a mean age at seizure onset of 14.2 years (SD: 4.5), and a mean age at diagnosis of 15.6 years (SD: 4.9). Clinical phenotypes seen were classic JME phenotype (88%), childhood absence epilepsy evolving into JME (6%), JME with adolescent absences (4%), and JME with astatic seizures (2%). More than a quarter (28%) had a family history of epilepsy. The most commonly used antiepileptic drug (AED) was sodium valproate in 78% of individuals, followed by levetiracetam (64%) and lamotrigine (55%). In the previous year, 47.5% were seizure-free. Using the International League against Epilepsy (ILAE) definitions and considering National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)-recommended AEDs for this syndrome, 121 individuals (50.4%) were identified as having refractory epilepsy. Discussion: Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy is often regarded as a benign epileptic syndrome, but in this setting, half of the individuals with JME have refractory epilepsy with only about a quarter of those seizure-free in the previous year. Despite some advances in the understanding of this syndrome, there is still much to do before we can offer all the best outcomes.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Antiepileptic drugs", "Clinical phenotypes", "Genetic epilepsies"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Anticonvulsants", "Child", "Drug Resistant Epilepsy", "Electroencephalography", "Female", "Humans", "Lamotrigine", "Levetiracetam", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Myoclonic Epilepsy, Juvenile", "Retrospective Studies", "Tertiary Care Centers", "Treatment Outcome", "Valproic Acid"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85044602352", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Behavioral Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2802"]], "AuthorData": {"56653515400": {"Name": "Ca\u00e7\u00e3o G.", "AuthorID": "56653515400", "AffiliationID": "106604683", "AffiliationName": "Neurology Department, Centro Hospitalar do Porto"}, "57189601679": {"Name": "Parra J.", "AuthorID": "57189601679", "AffiliationID": "60020985, 60019112", "AffiliationName": "Neurology Department, Centro Hospitalar Universit\u00e1rio de Coimbra"}, "57193653657": {"Name": "Mannan S.", "AuthorID": "57193653657", "AffiliationID": "60024544, 60019953", "AffiliationName": "NIHR University College London Hospitals Biomedical Research Centre, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "7005111176": {"Name": "Sisodiya S.M.", "AuthorID": "7005111176", "AffiliationID": "120464925", "AffiliationName": "Chalfont Centre for Epilepsy"}, "57188659835": {"Name": "Sander J.W.", "AuthorID": "57188659835", "AffiliationID": "60027759", "AffiliationName": "Stichting Epilepsie Instellingen Nederland (SEIN)"}}}
