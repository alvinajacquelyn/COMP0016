This seminal study laid the foundation for the discovery of \u2018remote ischemic conditioning\u2019 (RIC), a phenomenon in which the heart is protected from the detrimental effects of acute ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI), by applying cycles of brief ischemia and reperfusion to an organ or tissue remote from the heart. The concept of RIC quickly evolved to extend beyond the heart, encompassing inter-organ protection against acute IRI. The crucial discovery that the protective RIC stimulus could be applied non-invasively, by simply inflating and deflating a blood pressure cuff placed on the upper arm to induce cycles of brief ischemia and reperfusion, has facilitated the translation of RIC into the clinical setting. Despite intensive investigation over the last 20 years, the underlying mechanisms continue to elude researchers. In the 8th Biennial Hatter Cardiovascular Institute Workshop, recent developments in the field of RIC were discussed with a focus on new insights into the underlying mechanisms, the diversity of non-cardiac protection, new clinical applications, and large outcome studies. The scientific advances made in this field of research highlight the journey that RIC has made from being an intriguing experimental observation to a clinical application with patient benefit.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Ischemia", "Organ protection", "Remote ischemic conditioning", "Reperfusion"], "IndexKeywords": ["Acute Kidney Injury", "Aldehyde Dehydrogenase", "Humans", "Ischemic Preconditioning, Myocardial", "Myocardial Reperfusion Injury", "Reperfusion Injury", "Signal Transduction", "Ventricular Function, Left"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84928234539", "SubjectAreas": [["Physiology", "BIOC", "1314"], ["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"], ["Physiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2737"]], "AuthorData": {"56530244300": {"Name": "Pickard J.M.J.", "AuthorID": "56530244300", "AffiliationID": "60029950", "AffiliationName": "The Hatter Cardiovascular Institute, University College London Hospital and Medical School"}, "10139785100": {"Name": "Davidson S.M.", "AuthorID": "10139785100", "AffiliationID": "60029950", "AffiliationName": "The Hatter Cardiovascular Institute, University College London Hospital and Medical School"}, "7103223278": {"Name": "Yellon D.M.", "AuthorID": "7103223278", "AffiliationID": "60029950", "AffiliationName": "The Hatter Cardiovascular Institute, University College London Hospital and Medical School"}, "6602976997": {"Name": "Hausenloy D.J.", "AuthorID": "6602976997", "AffiliationID": "60029950", "AffiliationName": "The Hatter Cardiovascular Institute, University College London Hospital and Medical School"}, "56962746200": {"Name": "B\u00f8tker H.E.", "AuthorID": "56962746200", "AffiliationID": "60023882", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Aarhus University Hospital"}, "23008126100": {"Name": "Crimi G.", "AuthorID": "23008126100", "AffiliationID": "60026556", "AffiliationName": "Cardiology Department, Fondazione I.R.C.C.S.
