In addition, they are also essential to the formation and regulation of synaptic circuits. Due to the extraordinary complex, nanoscopic morphology of astrocytes, the underlying cellular mechanisms have been poorly understood. In particular, fine astrocytic processes that can be found in the vicinity of synapses have been difficult to study using traditional imaging techniques. Here, we describe a 3D three-colour super-resolution microscopy approach to unravel the nanostructure of tripartite synapses. The method is based on the SMLM technique direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (dSTORM) which uses conventional fluorophore-labelled antibodies. This approach enables reconstructing the nanoscale localisation of individual astrocytic glutamate transporter (GLT-1) molecules surrounding presynaptic (bassoon) and postsynaptic (Homer1) protein localisations in fixed mouse brain sections. However, the technique is readily adaptable to other types of targets and tissues.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Astrocytes", "dSTORM", "Immunohistochemistry", "SMLM", "Super-resolution microscopy", "Tripartite synapses"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85068581109", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"26653485700": {"Name": "Heller J.P.", "AuthorID": "26653485700", "AffiliationID": "60000050", "AffiliationName": "FutureNeuro Research Centre, Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland"}, "57209735933": {"Name": "Odii T.", "AuthorID": "57209735933", "AffiliationID": "60105022", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physiology, Faculty of Basic Medical Sciences, Alex Ekwueme Federal University Ndufu-Alike Ikwo"}, "25937590000": {"Name": "Zheng K.", "AuthorID": "25937590000", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "7005393308": {"Name": "Rusakov D.A.", "AuthorID": "7005393308", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology, University College London"}}}
