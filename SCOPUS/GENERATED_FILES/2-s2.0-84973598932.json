In addition, we demonstrate the importance of the UTC impedance evaluation, by using it in the prediction of the absolute power radiated by an antenna integrated UTC, over a broad frequency range and confirming the predictions by experimental measurements up to 185 GHz. This is done by means of 3D full-wave modelling and is only possible since the source (UTC) to antenna impedance match is properly taken into account. We also show that, when the UTC-to-antenna coupling efficiency is modelled using the classical junction-capacitance/series-resistance concept, calculated and measured levels of absolute radiated power are in substantial disagreement, and the maximum radiated power is overestimated by a factor of almost 7 dB. The ability to calculate the absolute emitted power correctly enables the radiated power to be maximised through optimisation of the UTC-to-antenna impedance match.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Antenna coupling", "Antenna impedance", "Broad frequency range", "Junction capacitances", "Output impedance", "Photodiode structures", "Radiated power", "Uni-travelling carriers"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84973598932", "SubjectAreas": [["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"]], "AuthorData": {"55312030000": {"Name": "Natrella M.", "AuthorID": "55312030000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Electronic and Electrical Engineering"}, "14019722700": {"Name": "Liu C.", "AuthorID": "14019722700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Electronic and Electrical Engineering"}, "53866442400": {"Name": "Graham C.", "AuthorID": "53866442400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Electronic and Electrical Engineering"}, "15765485000": {"Name": "Liu H.", "AuthorID": "15765485000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Electronic and Electrical Engineering"}, "7006454070": {"Name": "Renaud C.", "AuthorID": "7006454070", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Electronic and Electrical Engineering"}, "7004751445": {"Name": "Seeds A.", "AuthorID": "7004751445", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Electronic and Electrical Engineering"}, "16231956400": {"Name": "Van Dijk F.", "AuthorID": "16231956400", "AffiliationID": "112233358", "AffiliationName": "III-V Laboratory"}}}
