Although the clinical utility of consequent epigenetic tests for risk stratification is yet to be proven, successful adoption into clinical practice also requires the public's acceptance of such tests. This cross-sectional online survey study sought to learn for the first time about European women's perceptions, attitudes, and intended behavior regarding a predictive epigenetic test for female cancer (breast, ovarian, cervical, and endometrial) risks. Methods: 1675 women (40-75 years) from five European countries (Czech Republic, Germany, United Kingdom, Italy, Sweden), drawn from online panels by the survey sampling company Harris Interactive (Germany), participated in an online survey where they first received online leaflet information on a predictive epigenetic test for female cancer risks and were subsequently queried by an online questionnaire on their desire to know their female cancer risks, their perception of the benefit-to-harm ratio of an epigenetic test predicting female cancer risks, reasons in favor and disfavor of taking such a test, and their intention to take a predictive epigenetic test for female cancer risks. Results: Most women desired information on each of their female cancer risks, 56.6% (95% CI: 54.2-59.0) thought the potential benefits outweighed potential harms, and 75% (72.0-77.8) intended to take a predictive epigenetic test for female cancer risks if freely available. Results varied considerably by country with women from Germany and the Czech Republic being more reserved about this new form of testing than women from the other three European countries. The main reason cited in favor of a predictive epigenetic test for female cancer risks was its potential to guide healthcare strategies and lifestyle changes in the future, and in its disfavor was that it may increase cancer worry and coerce unintended lifestyle changes and healthcare interventions. Conclusions: A successful introduction of predictive epigenetic tests for cancer risks will require a balanced and transparent communication of the benefit-to-harm ratio of healthcare pathways resulting from such tests in order to curb unjustified expectations and at the same time to prevent unjustified concerns.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Attitudes", "European women", "Female cancer risk", "Intentions", "Predictive epigenetic testing"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Breast Neoplasms", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Early Detection of Cancer", "Endometrial Neoplasms", "Epigenesis, Genetic", "Europe", "Female", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Genetic Testing", "Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice", "Humans", "Intention", "Middle Aged", "Neoplasms", "Ovarian Neoplasms", "Predictive Value of Tests", "Uterine Cervical Neoplasms"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85066637352", "SubjectAreas": [["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"23398957000": {"Name": "Wegwarth O.", "AuthorID": "23398957000", "AffiliationID": "60122544, 60026562", "AffiliationName": "Harding Center for Risk Literacy, Max Planck Institute for Human Development"}, "56580288300": {"Name": "Rebitschek F.G.", "AuthorID": "56580288300", "AffiliationID": "60122544, 60026562", "AffiliationName": "Harding Center for Risk Literacy, Max Planck Institute for Human Development"}, "57204528351": {"Name": "Pashayan N.", "AuthorID": "57204528351", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Applied Health Research, Institute of Epidemiology and Healthcare, University College London"}, "7006520678": {"Name": "Widschwendter M.", "AuthorID": "7006520678", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Women's Cancer, Institute for Women's Health, University College London"}}}
