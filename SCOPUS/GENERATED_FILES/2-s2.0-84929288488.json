Relative values of these ratios are likely different between alternative facility types. Empirical analyses of ratio estimates are presented for English secondary schools over recent years. Findings challenge established views of the relative cost ratios of 1 (construction), 5 (facility management) to 200 (operations or staff), suggesting the ratios are actually 1/1/5 respectively. The study also estimates the value of investing in schools in terms of improved outcomes, applying educational attainment data for rebuilt schools. These are converted into monetary values using wage uplift indicators. This produces estimates of expected economic benefits (increased productivity and output) and benefits to government via future tax receipts (financial return). Findings suggest the present value of future tax revenues alone do justify investing in school rebuilding. Average economic returns are positive but highly variable, with high dispersion in expected benefits. These benefits are positive only in half the rebuilt schools. The results will help inform allocation of public resources in schools, while also assisting management of the growing independent and semi-autonomous school estate.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Building evaluation", "Cost-benefit analysis", "Evidence base", "Human capital", "Public policy", "Schools", "Whole-life cost"], "IndexKeywords": ["Benefit analysis", "Building evaluations", "evidence base", "Human capitals", "schools", "Whole life cost"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84929288488", "SubjectAreas": [["Civil and Structural Engineering", "ENGI", "2205"], ["Building and Construction", "ENGI", "2215"]], "AuthorData": {"16174775100": {"Name": "Ive G.", "AuthorID": "16174775100", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Bartlett School of Construction and Project Management, University College London"}, "55622284600": {"Name": "Murray A.", "AuthorID": "55622284600", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Bartlett School of Construction and Project Management, University College London"}, "56602336200": {"Name": "Marsh R.", "AuthorID": "56602336200", "AffiliationID": "115240158", "AffiliationName": "Asset Management Consultants Ltd."}}}
