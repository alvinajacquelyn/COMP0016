By fitting powder X-ray diffraction patterns with DIFFaX, we show that AgI displays a strong tendency to form stacking-disordered materials. Its polytypism is determined by the silver cation to iodide molar ratio upon precipitation. Under iodide-rich conditions, fully hexagonal \u03b2-AgI is obtained, whereas a maximal percentage of cubic stacking of 81% is obtained at a 2:1 molar ratio in the silver cation-rich regime. These findings are explained on the basis of a concentration-dependent competition between kinetically and thermodynamically favored adsorption processes. Furthermore, the previously reported memory effects, observed upon transforming hexagonal and cubic AgI to the high-temperature superionic phase and back, are now followed quantitatively. We propose that the memory effects originate from excess ions at the surfaces of AgI crystals that stabilize the pyroelectricity of AgI associated with hexagonal stacking. The ability to \"design\" the polytypism of AgI by tuning the precipitation conditions provides the first example where the stacking disorder of a material can be controlled in a continuous fashion. Future studies will clarify if this design principle can be applied to other materials as well.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adsorption process", "Antimicrobial coatings", "Concentration-dependent", "Design Principles", "Disordered materials", "Hexagonal stacking", "Powder X ray diffraction", "Stacking disorders"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85063903940", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"]], "AuthorData": {"56244098700": {"Name": "Smith R.L.", "AuthorID": "56244098700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "36893205700": {"Name": "Vickers M.", "AuthorID": "36893205700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "38562022600": {"Name": "Rosillo-Lopez M.", "AuthorID": "38562022600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "7004272333": {"Name": "Salzmann C.G.", "AuthorID": "7004272333", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}}}
