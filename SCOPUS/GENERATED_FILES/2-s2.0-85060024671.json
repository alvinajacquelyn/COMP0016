This study aims to systematically review and critically appraise all available evidence to identify the factors affecting consumers\u2019 decisions in taking nutraceuticals. Questionnaire, interview or focus group studies which directly reported factors affecting consumers\u2019 decisions in using nutraceuticals were included. A thematic synthesis method was employed to synthesis the findings from the included studies. Out of the 76 studies included, the key factors identified as the most important factors motivating consumers to take nutraceuticals were the perceived health benefits and safety of nutraceuticals, as well as the advice from healthcare professionals, friends and family. The identified barriers to take nutraceuticals were a lack of belief in the health benefit of nutraceuticals, the high cost of nutraceuticals and consumers\u2019 lack of knowledge about nutraceuticals. As a chief course of recommendation for the use of nutraceuticals, healthcare professionals should strive to utilise reliable information from clinical evidence to help consumers in making an informed decision in using nutraceuticals. Future studies should explore the possible ways to improve channelling clinical evidence information of nutraceuticals to the public.", "AuthorKeywords": ["barrier", "consumer", "dietary supplement", "functional food", "motivation", "Nutraceuticals", "systematic review"], "IndexKeywords": ["Decision Making", "Dietary Supplements", "Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice", "Humans"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85060024671", "SubjectAreas": [["Food Science", "AGRI", "1106"]], "AuthorData": {"57069662700": {"Name": "Teoh S.L.", "AuthorID": "57069662700", "AffiliationID": "60018894", "AffiliationName": "School of Pharmacy, Monash University Malaysia"}, "14015058100": {"Name": "Chaiyakunapruk N.", "AuthorID": "14015058100", "AffiliationID": "60032179", "AffiliationName": "School of Pharmacy, University of Wisconsin"}, "15064227000": {"Name": "Ngorsuraches S.", "AuthorID": "15064227000", "AffiliationID": "60001085, 60011754", "AffiliationName": "Department of Health Outcomes Research and Policy, Harrison School of Pharmacy, Auburn University"}, "15022697700": {"Name": "Lai N.M.", "AuthorID": "15022697700", "AffiliationID": "60018894", "AffiliationName": "Asian Centre for Evidence Synthesis in Population, Implementation and Clinical Outcomes (PICO), Health and Well-being Cluster, Global Asia Platform in the 21st Century (GA21) Platform, Monash University Malaysia"}, "55321437800": {"Name": "Bangpan M.", "AuthorID": "55321437800", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Evidence for Policy and Practice Information and Co-ordinating Centre (EPPI-Centre), Social Science Research Unit, Department of Social Science, UCL Institute of Education, University College London"}}}
