Now, the pump with a specific speed of 55.7 is chosen as hydraulic turbine. On the basis of considering the gas compressibility, to take numerical calculation on the model under different flow rates and different gas volume fraction, to analyze the influence of gas volume fraction on vortex motion law in the impeller flow channel. Findings: When the flow rate is small, the relative velocity distribution in the impeller flow channel is uneven, the velocity field is chaotic, and there are obvious vortices, with the increase of the gas volume fraction, the vortices in the impeller flow channel gradually move to the inlet direction of the blade; With the increase of the flow rate, the flow in the channel of the hydraulic turbine impeller is unstable. Both the pressure surface and the suction surface of the blade appear vortices, the vortex region in the impeller flow channel is enlarged, and all of them are concentrated on the back of the blade. The results provide a theoretical basis for the optimal design of hydraulic turbine structures.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Gas compressibilities", "Gas volume fraction", "Numerical calculation", "Pressure surface", "Specific speed", "Suction surfaces", "Turbine structures", "Vortex regions"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85051389987", "SubjectAreas": [["Environmental Science (all)", "ENVI", "2300"], ["Earth and Planetary Sciences (all)", "EART", "1900"]], "AuthorData": {"56180839700": {"Name": "Shi G.T.", "AuthorID": "56180839700", "AffiliationID": "106563858", "AffiliationName": "Department of Power Machinery, University of Xihua"}, "57192942144": {"Name": "Liu Y.", "AuthorID": "57192942144", "AffiliationID": "106563858", "AffiliationName": "Department of Power Machinery, University of Xihua"}, "57210250215": {"Name": "Luo K.", "AuthorID": "57210250215", "AffiliationID": "106563858", "AffiliationName": "Department of Power Machinery, University of Xihua"}, "57220979106": {"Name": "Yao X.T.", "AuthorID": "57220979106", "AffiliationID": "106563858", "AffiliationName": "Department of Power Machinery, University of Xihua"}, "57213018616": {"Name": "Jiang X.P.", "AuthorID": "57213018616", "AffiliationID": "60108755", "AffiliationName": "School of Mechanical Electronic and Information Engineering, China University of Mining and Technology(Beijing)"}}}
