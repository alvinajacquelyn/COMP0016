American Geophysical Union. All Rights Reserved.Dipolarizing flux bundles (DFBs), magnetotail flux tubes with stronger, more dipolar magnetic field than the background magnetotail plasma, which are led by dipolarization fronts, typically propagate earthward within bursty bulk flows. Although DFBs are localized (typically 1-3 RE) in the cross-tail direction, many of them may combine to cause global effects, such as the substorm current wedge. Knowledge of how this local-to-global coupling happens is crucial for understanding magnetotail dynamics. We investigate how the coupling happens using multipoint observations from the Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms mission. Our results show that most DFBs expand in the cross-tail direction as they propagate earthward. Through such expansion, azimuthally localized DFBs can cover a wide region to cause global effects when they arrive at the inner edge of the plasma sheet.", "AuthorKeywords": ["bursty bulk flow", "diploarization front", "dipolarizing flux bundle", "substorm", "substorm current wedge", "wedgelet"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85027926326", "SubjectAreas": [["Geophysics", "EART", "1908"], ["Forestry", "AGRI", "1107"], ["Oceanography", "EART", "1910"], ["Aquatic Science", "AGRI", "1104"], ["Ecology", "ENVI", "2303"], ["Water Science and Technology", "ENVI", "2312"], ["Soil Science", "AGRI", "1111"], ["Geochemistry and Petrology", "EART", "1906"], ["Earth-Surface Processes", "EART", "1904"], ["Atmospheric Science", "EART", "1902"], ["Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)", "EART", "1901"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"], ["Paleontology", "EART", "1911"]], "AuthorData": {"55851738800": {"Name": "Liu J.", "AuthorID": "55851738800", "AffiliationID": "60101299, 60027550", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth, Planetary and Space Sciences, Institute of Geophysics and Planetary Physics, University of California"}, "8229486100": {"Name": "Angelopoulos V.", "AuthorID": "8229486100", "AffiliationID": "60101299, 60027550", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth, Planetary and Space Sciences, Institute of Geophysics and Planetary Physics, University of California"}, "14920116400": {"Name": "Zhou X.Z.", "AuthorID": "14920116400", "AffiliationID": "60014966", "AffiliationName": "School of Earth and Space Sciences, Peking University"}, "35554443300": {"Name": "Runov A.", "AuthorID": "35554443300", "AffiliationID": "60101299, 60027550", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth, Planetary and Space Sciences, Institute of Geophysics and Planetary Physics, University of California"}, "57197843335": {"Name": "Yao Z.H.", "AuthorID": "57197843335", "AffiliationID": "60084281, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Mullard Space Science Laboratory, University College London"}}}
