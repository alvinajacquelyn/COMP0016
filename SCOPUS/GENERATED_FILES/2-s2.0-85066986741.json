The analysis of 49 cattle is augmented with data for small numbers of animals from the contemporaneous monumental centres of West Kennet Palisade Enclosures (4), Stonehenge (1), and Marden (1). Unburnt human remains are scarce at these sites and the suite of biomolecular analyses that can be undertaken on cremated remains is limited. Therefore, these animals provide the best proxy for the origins of the people who raised them and give key information on livestock management. This builds on the Sr isotope analysis of 12 animals previously published from Durrington Walls and complements recent research on pig remains from the same sites, providing further evidence for the scale of human and animal movement and the catchment of these sites. The strontium isotope signatures from the animals\u2019 teeth range between values that are consistent with local chalkland grazing to radiogenic values typical of granites and older rock types. The oxygen isotope data, coupled with the strontium results, provide new geographic resolution and indicate that the majority of the animals come from southern and western areas of Britain.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bos taurus", "Durrington Walls", "Isotopes", "Mobility", "Neolithic", "Oxygen", "Strontium"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85066986741", "SubjectAreas": [["Archeology (arts and humanities)", "ARTS", "1204"], ["Anthropology", "SOCI", "3314"], ["Archeology", "SOCI", "3302"]], "AuthorData": {"7407665225": {"Name": "Evans J.", "AuthorID": "7407665225", "AffiliationID": "60022706", "AffiliationName": "National Environmental Isotope Facility, British Geological Survey"}, "6701858892": {"Name": "Sloane H.", "AuthorID": "6701858892", "AffiliationID": "60022706", "AffiliationName": "National Environmental Isotope Facility, British Geological Survey"}, "6507314762": {"Name": "Parker Pearson M.", "AuthorID": "6507314762", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Archaeology, UCL"}, "45161754500": {"Name": "Madgwick R.", "AuthorID": "45161754500", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "School of History, Archaeology and Religion, Cardiff University"}, "8267110000": {"Name": "Albarella U.", "AuthorID": "8267110000", "AffiliationID": "60001881", "AffiliationName": "Department of Archaeology, University of Sheffield"}}}
