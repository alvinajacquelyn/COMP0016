All rights reserved.In the early twentieth century, histopathological staining of Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease patient brains and later other neurodegenerative disorders revealed large intracellular and extracellular protein aggregates. Despite these pathological findings, 100 years later, scientists are yet to fully unravel disease pathogenesis sufficiently enough to allow early disease detection and development of therapeutic agents. While genetic and environmental factors are known to cause protein self-aggregation, recent discoveries have shown that protein intermediates are more toxic than the protein aggregates, serving as invaluable biomarkers for early disease detection. Mutations in alpha-synuclein, amyloid precursor, tau, and huntingtin proteins are known to cause self-aggregation and, via a series of conformational changes, produce oligomers and fibrils before being deposited extra- or intracellularly. In Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, intermediate oligomeric forms of alpha-synuclein and beta-amyloid have been described not only to alter calcium homeostasis, which is vital to neuronal signalling, but also to interact with and alter mitochondrial function and therefore the energetic status of neurons. Research into the effects on the energy status of brain cells is vital to understanding the process of neurotoxicity observed in neurodegenerative diseases.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alpha-synuclein", "Alzheimer's disease", "Huntingtin", "Huntington's disease", "Mitochondria", "Oligomers", "Parkinson's disease", "Protein aggregation", "Tau"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85006776328", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"]], "AuthorData": {"36482996900": {"Name": "Ludtmann M.", "AuthorID": "36482996900", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, University College London, Institute of Neurology"}, "7102348938": {"Name": "Abramov A.", "AuthorID": "7102348938", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, University College London, Institute of Neurology"}}}
