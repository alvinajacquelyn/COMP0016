We prospectively examined the association between NK-cytotoxic activity, myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), and T-regulatory cells (Tregs) on the overall survival (OS) of patients. Patients with NK-cytotoxicity above a critical threshold had a longer duration of response and survived longer than patients with severe impairment of NK-cytotoxicity. The numbers of MDSCs, and Tregs in the PB of patients after a short exposure to AZA were not different from normal donors. In conclusion, the results of our study suggest that the therapeutic activity of AZA is at least partly mediated by an immunomodulatory effect. To our knowledge, this is the first study reported so far, that shows a positive correlation between NK cytotoxicity and OS of AZA-treated patients.", "AuthorKeywords": ["acute myeloid leukemia", "azacytidine", "myelodysplastic syndrome", "Natural killer cell", "NK-cytotoxicity"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Azacitidine", "Biomarkers", "Cell Line, Tumor", "Cytotoxicity, Immunologic", "Female", "Humans", "Killer Cells, Natural", "Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute", "Lymphocyte Subsets", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Myelodysplastic Syndromes", "Prognosis", "ROC Curve"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85063968802", "SubjectAreas": [["Hematology", "MEDI", "2720"], ["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Cancer Research", "BIOC", "1306"]], "AuthorData": {"54584544300": {"Name": "Tsirogianni M.", "AuthorID": "54584544300", "AffiliationID": "112573203", "AffiliationName": "Department of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Saint Savvas Regional Cancer Hospital"}, "55428341200": {"Name": "Grigoriou E.", "AuthorID": "55428341200", "AffiliationID": "60064532", "AffiliationName": "Department of Immunology and Histocompatibility, \u201cEvangelismos\u201d General Hospital"}, "54395474600": {"Name": "Kapsimalli V.", "AuthorID": "54395474600", "AffiliationID": "60067083, 60028900", "AffiliationName": "Department of Microbiology, Medical School, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens"}, "57208153728": {"Name": "Dagla K.", "AuthorID": "57208153728", "AffiliationID": "60028900", "AffiliationName": "Hematology Division, 2nd Department of Internal Medicine, \u201cATTIKO\u201d General University Hospital, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens"}, "6603660169": {"Name": "Stamouli M.", "AuthorID": "6603660169", "AffiliationID": "60028900", "AffiliationName": "Hematology Division, 2nd Department of Internal Medicine, \u201cATTIKO\u201d General University Hospital, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens"}, "56957300500": {"Name": "Gkirkas K.", "AuthorID": "56957300500", "AffiliationID": "60028900", "AffiliationName": "Hematology Division, 2nd Department of Internal Medicine, \u201cATTIKO\u201d General University Hospital, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens"}, "57208943985": {"Name": "Konsta E.", "AuthorID": "57208943985", "AffiliationID": "60028900", "AffiliationName": "Hematology Division, 2nd Department of Internal Medicine, \u201cATTIKO\u201d General University Hospital, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens"}, "56016472300": {"Name": "Karagiannidou A.", "AuthorID": "56016472300", "AffiliationID": "60028900", "AffiliationName": "Hematology Division, 2nd Department of Internal Medicine, \u201cATTIKO\u201d General University Hospital, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens"}, "57208146465": {"Name": "Gkodopoulos K.", "AuthorID": "57208146465", "AffiliationID": "60028900", "AffiliationName": "Hematology Division, 2nd Department of Internal Medicine, \u201cATTIKO\u201d General University Hospital, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens"}, "57192662828": {"Name": "Stavroulaki G.", "AuthorID": "57192662828", "AffiliationID": "60028900", "AffiliationName": "Hematology Division, 2nd Department of Internal Medicine, \u201cATTIKO\u201d General University Hospital, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens"}, "6602846000": {"Name": "Pappa V.", "AuthorID": "6602846000", "AffiliationID": "60028900", "AffiliationName": "Hematology Division, 2nd Department of Internal Medicine, \u201cATTIKO\u201d General University Hospital, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens"}, "8647451000": {"Name": "Tsirigotis P.", "AuthorID": "8647451000", "AffiliationID": "60028900", "AffiliationName": "Hematology Division, 2nd Department of Internal Medicine, \u201cATTIKO\u201d General University Hospital, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens"}, "6701670884": {"Name": "Angelopoulou M.", "AuthorID": "6701670884", "AffiliationID": "60028900, 60024352", "AffiliationName": "Department of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Laikon General Hospital, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens"}, "7003930276": {"Name": "Lowdell M.", "AuthorID": "7003930276", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Immunity and Transplantation Centre for Cell, Gene & Tissue Therapeutics, Royal Free Hospital"}}}
