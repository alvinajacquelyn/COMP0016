The contribution of immune activation to arterial stiffness and its reversibility in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected adults in sub-Saharan Africa is unknown. Methods. HIV-uninfected and HIV-infected Malawian adults initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART) with a CD4+ T-cell count of <100 cells/\u03bc L were enrolled and followed for 44 weeks; enrollment of infected adults occurred 2 weeks after ART initiation. We evaluated the relationship between carotid femoral pulse wave velocity (cfPWV) and T-cell activation (defined as HLA-DR+CD38+ T cells), exhaustion (define as PD-1+ T cells), and senescence (defined as CD57+ T cells) and monocyte subsets, using normal regression. Results. In 279 HIV-infected and 110 HIV-uninfected adults, 142 (37%) had hypertension. HIV was independently associated with a 12% higher cfPWV (P =.02) at baseline and a 14% higher cfPWV at week 10 (P =.02), but the increases resolved by week 22. CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell exhaustion were independently associated with a higher cfPWV at baseline (P =.02). At 44 weeks, arterial stiffness improved more in those with greater decreases in the percentage of CD8+ T cells and the percentage of PD-1+CD8+ T cells (P =.01 and P =.03, respectively). When considering HIV-infected participants alone, the adjusted arterial stiffness at week 44 tended to be lower in those with higher baseline percentage of PD-1+CD8+ T cells (P =.054). Conclusions. PD-1+CD8+ T-cells are associated with HIV-related arterial stiffness, which remains elevated during the first 3 months of ART. Resources to prevent cardiovascular disease in sub-Saharan Africa should focus on blood pressure reduction and individuals with a low CD4+ T-cell count during early ART.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Arterial stiffness", "Cardiovascular disease", "Endothelial damage", "HIV", "PD-1", "Sub-Saharan Africa", "T-cell exhaustion"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Anti-Retroviral Agents", "CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes", "HIV Infections", "Humans", "Malawi", "Male", "Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor", "Vascular Stiffness"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85066919735", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"55017106200": {"Name": "Kelly C.", "AuthorID": "55017106200", "AffiliationID": "60005141", "AffiliationName": "HIV Molecular Research Group, University College Dublin"}, "7102023740": {"Name": "Khoo S.", "AuthorID": "7102023740", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Insitute of Translational Medicine, University of Liverpool"}, "6602543006": {"Name": "Mwandumba H.C.", "AuthorID": "6602543006", "AffiliationID": "60072679", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital"}, "17343722100": {"Name": "Jambo K.", "AuthorID": "17343722100", "AffiliationID": "60072678, 60072664", "AffiliationName": "Malawi-Liverpool-Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Programme, College of Medicine"}, "7005251165": {"Name": "Heyderman R.S.", "AuthorID": "7005251165", "AffiliationID": "60072678, 60072664", "AffiliationName": "Malawi-Liverpool-Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Programme, College of Medicine"}, "55212114200": {"Name": "Rapala A.", "AuthorID": "55212114200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Cardiovascular Sciences, University College London"}, "6503849350": {"Name": "Sarah Walker A.", "AuthorID": "6503849350", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60003108", "AffiliationName": "MRC Clinical Trials Unit, University College London"}, "7201775981": {"Name": "Klein N.", "AuthorID": "7201775981", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "57201645857": {"Name": "Kamng'ona R.", "AuthorID": "57201645857", "AffiliationID": "60072678, 60072664", "AffiliationName": "Malawi-Liverpool-Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Programme, College of Medicine"}, "57209228374": {"Name": "Chammudzi M.", "AuthorID": "57209228374", "AffiliationID": "60072678, 60072664", "AffiliationName": "Malawi-Liverpool-Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Programme, College of Medicine"}, "57201094320": {"Name": "Sheha I.", "AuthorID": "57201094320", "AffiliationID": "60072678, 60072664", "AffiliationName": "Malawi-Liverpool-Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Programme, College of Medicine"}, "35300534900": {"Name": "Peterson I.", "AuthorID": "35300534900", "AffiliationID": "60072678, 60072664", "AffiliationName": "Malawi-Liverpool-Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Programme, College of Medicine"}, "25031537700": {"Name": "Mallewa J.", "AuthorID": "25031537700", "AffiliationID": "60072679", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital"}}}
