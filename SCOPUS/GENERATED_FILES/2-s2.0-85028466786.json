To date, the mechanisms responsible for signalling the presence of injury or disease to selectively activate responses in distant organs were unclear. Circulating endogenous extracellular vesicles (EVs) are increased after brain injury and have the potential to carry targeted injury signals around the body. Here, we examined the potential of EVs, isolated from rats after focal inflammatory brain lesions using IL-1\u03b2, to activate a systemic APR in recipient na\u00efve rats, as well as the behavioural consequences of EV transfer. Focal brain lesions increased EV release, and, following isolation and transfer, the EVs were sequestered by the liver where they initiated an APR. Transfer of blood-borne EVs from brain-injured animals was also enough to suppress exploratory behaviours in recipient na\u00efve animals. EVs derived from brain endothelial cell cultures treated with IL-1\u03b2 also activated an APR and altered behaviour in recipient animals. These experiments reveal that inflammation-induced circulating EVs derived from endothelial cells are able to initiate the APR to brain injury and are sufficient to generate the associated sickness behaviours, and are the first demonstration that EVs are capable of modifying behavioural responses.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Acute-Phase Reaction", "Animals", "Behavior, Animal", "Cytokines", "Disease Models, Animal", "Encephalitis", "Endothelial Cells", "Extracellular Vesicles", "Hepatitis", "Illness Behavior", "Inflammation Mediators", "Kupffer Cells", "Male", "Rats"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85028466786", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"36929949400": {"Name": "Couch Y.", "AuthorID": "36929949400", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Acute Stroke Programme, RDM-Investigative Medicine, University of Oxford"}, "35434208800": {"Name": "Buchan A.M.", "AuthorID": "35434208800", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Acute Stroke Programme, RDM-Investigative Medicine, University of Oxford"}, "57194274832": {"Name": "Akbar N.", "AuthorID": "57194274832", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, RDM, University of Oxford"}, "57195491683": {"Name": "Roodselaar J.", "AuthorID": "57195491683", "AffiliationID": "60002634", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacology, University of Oxford"}, "7404538456": {"Name": "Evans M.C.", "AuthorID": "7404538456", "AffiliationID": "60002634", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacology, University of Oxford"}, "7102866439": {"Name": "Anthony D.C.", "AuthorID": "7102866439", "AffiliationID": "60002634", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacology, University of Oxford"}, "7006359228": {"Name": "Gardiner C.", "AuthorID": "7006359228", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Haemostasis Research Unit, UCL"}, "7006758263": {"Name": "Sargent I.", "AuthorID": "7006758263", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, University of Oxford"}, "7005654212": {"Name": "Romero I.A.", "AuthorID": "7005654212", "AffiliationID": "60012113", "AffiliationName": "Department of Life, Health and Chemical Sciences, Open University"}, "7006226660": {"Name": "Bristow A.", "AuthorID": "7006226660", "AffiliationID": "60000365", "AffiliationName": "NIBSC, South Mimms"}, "6701386627": {"Name": "Haughey N.", "AuthorID": "6701386627", "AffiliationID": "60005248", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology and Psychiatry, Johns Hopkins University"}}}
