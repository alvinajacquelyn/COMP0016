Several nonthermal controls on foraminifera Mg incorporation have been identified, of which vital effects, salinity, and secular variation in seawater Mg / Ca are the most commonly considered. Ocean carbonate chemistry is also known to influence Mg / Ca, yet this is rarely examined as a source of uncertainty, either because (1) precise pH and [CO32-] reconstructions are sparse or (2) it is not clear from existing culture studies how a correction should be applied. We present new culture data of the relationship between carbonate chemistry and Mg / Ca for the surface-dwelling planktic species Globigerinoides ruber and compare our results to data compiled from existing studies. We find a coherent relationship between Mg / Ca and the carbonate system and argue that pH rather than [CO32-] is likely to be the dominant control. Applying these new calibrations to data sets for the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM) and Eocene-Oligocene transition (EOT) enables us to produce a more accurate picture of surface hydrology change for the former and a reassessment of the amount of subtropical precursor cooling for the latter. We show that pH-adjusted Mg / Ca and \u03b418O data sets for the PETM are within error of no salinity change and that the amount of precursor cooling over the EOT has been previously underestimated by \u223c 2 \u00b0C based on Mg / Ca. Finally, we present new laser-ablation data of EOT-age Turborotalia ampliapertura from St. Stephens Quarry (Alabama), for which a solution inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICPMS) Mg / Ca record is available (Wade et al., 2012). We show that the two data sets are in excellent agreement, demonstrating that fossil solution and laser-ablation data may be directly comparable. Together with an advancing understanding of the effect of Mg / Casw, the coherent picture of the relationship between Mg / Ca and pH that we outline here represents a step towards producing accurate and quantitative palaeotemperatures using this proxy.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84966431229", "SubjectAreas": [["Global and Planetary Change", "ENVI", "2306"], ["Stratigraphy", "EART", "1913"], ["Paleontology", "EART", "1911"]], "AuthorData": {"57153303400": {"Name": "Evans D.", "AuthorID": "57153303400", "AffiliationID": "60005455", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geology and Geophysics, Yale University"}, "55455002400": {"Name": "M\u00fcller W.", "AuthorID": "55455002400", "AffiliationID": "60020595", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, Royal Holloway, University of London"}, "55589174000": {"Name": "Henehan M.", "AuthorID": "55589174000", "AffiliationID": "60025225, 60010934", "AffiliationName": "Ocean and Earth Science, National Oceanography Centre Southampton, University of Southampton, Waterfront Campus"}, "13004692700": {"Name": "Wade B.S.", "AuthorID": "13004692700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, University College London"}, "6701755045": {"Name": "Erez J.", "AuthorID": "6701755045", "AffiliationID": "60007903", "AffiliationName": "Earth Science Institute, Hebrew University of Jerusalem"}}}
