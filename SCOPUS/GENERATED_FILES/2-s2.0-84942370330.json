The diagnostic work-up is complex, and the etiology is unidentified in up to half of patients, making decisions like therapeutic transplantation extremely difficult. We collected clinical, laboratory, and outcome data on all patients under 5 years of age who were admitted between January 2001 and December 2011 to King\u2019s College Hospital with ALF secondary to an inherited metabolic disease (IMD), a common cause of pediatric acute liver failure. Thirty-six of 127 children with ALF had a metabolic etiology: galactosemia (17); mitochondrial respiratory chain disorder (MRCD, 7); ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) deficiency (4); tyrosinemia type 1 (4); Niemann-Pick disease type C (NPC, 3); and congenital disorder of glycosylation type 1b (1). Seven children died: MRCD (4) and NPC (3). Four children were transplanted: OTC deficiency (1) and MRCD (3). Fifteen of 25 children followed up showed evidence of developmental delay. Conclusion: IMD is the most common group of disorders in this age group; indeterminate cases may yet include undiagnosed metabolic disorders; the overall survival rate is good but largely depends on diagnosis, while developmental outcome of the surviving patients is less favorable.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Acute liver failure", "Inherited metabolic disease", "Liver transplantation", "Pediatric"], "IndexKeywords": ["Child, Preschool", "Follow-Up Studies", "Hospitals, University", "Humans", "Incidence", "Infant", "Infant, Newborn", "Liver Failure, Acute", "Metabolism, Inborn Errors", "Prognosis", "Retrospective Studies", "Survival Rate", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84942370330", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"]], "AuthorData": {"55443236800": {"Name": "Hegarty R.", "AuthorID": "55443236800", "AffiliationID": "60029685", "AffiliationName": "Pediatric Liver Unit, King\u2019s College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7004676303": {"Name": "Hadzic N.", "AuthorID": "7004676303", "AffiliationID": "60029685", "AffiliationName": "Pediatric Liver Unit, King\u2019s College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "24545802400": {"Name": "Dhawan A.", "AuthorID": "24545802400", "AffiliationID": "60029685", "AffiliationName": "Pediatric Liver Unit, King\u2019s College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "6602308059": {"Name": "Gissen P.", "AuthorID": "6602308059", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Metabolic Medicine Unit, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
