We argue that it is time to revisit this principle after the advent of programmable switch ASICs which can run complex logic at line rate. We explore the possibility and benefits of accelerating the control plane by offloading some of its tasks directly to the network hardware. We show that programmable data planes are indeed powerful enough to run key control plane tasks including: failure detection and notification, connectivity retrieval, and even policy-based routing protocols. We implement in P4 a prototype of such a \"hardware-accelerated\" control plane, and illustrate its benefits in a case study. Despite such benefits, we acknowledge that offloading tasks to hardware is not a silver bullet.We discuss its tradeoffs and limitations, and outline future research directions towards hardware-software codesign of network control planes.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Control planes", "Design Principles", "Failure detection", "Future research directions", "Hardware-accelerated", "Network control plane", "Policy based routing", "Programmable switches"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85058381757", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"]], "AuthorData": {"57055979200": {"Name": "Molero E.", "AuthorID": "57055979200", "AffiliationID": "60025858", "AffiliationName": "ETH Z\u00fcrich"}, "25927686300": {"Name": "Vanbever L.", "AuthorID": "25927686300", "AffiliationID": "60025858", "AffiliationName": "ETH Z\u00fcrich"}, "35220581300": {"Name": "Vissicchio S.", "AuthorID": "35220581300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
