Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Royal Astronomical Society.We present observations of cross coupled spheroidal modes in the Earth's free oscillation spectrum recorded by the vertical component G-ring laser (Geodetical StationWettzell) of the 2011 M<inf>w</inf> 9.0 Tohoku-Oki earthquake. In an attempt to determine which are the mechanisms responsible for spheroidal energy in a vertical axes rotational spectra, we first rule out instrumental effects as well as the effect of local heterogeneity. Secondly, we carry out simulations of an ideal rotational sensor taking into account the effects of the Earth's rotation, its hydrostatic ellipticity and structural heterogeneity, which results in a good fit to the data. Simulations considering each effect separately are performed in order to evaluate the sensitivity of rotational motions to various phenomena compared to traditional translation measurements.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Rotational seismology", "Surface waves and free oscillations"], "IndexKeywords": ["Earth's free oscillation", "Local heterogeneity", "Normal-mode coupling", "Rotational spectra", "Structural heterogeneity", "Surface waves and free oscillations", "Tohoku-Oki earthquakes", "Vertical component"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84929833025", "SubjectAreas": [["Geophysics", "EART", "1908"], ["Geochemistry and Petrology", "EART", "1906"]], "AuthorData": {"54412991100": {"Name": "Nader M.", "AuthorID": "54412991100", "AffiliationID": "60028717", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences, Ludwig-Maximilians-University"}, "7003562652": {"Name": "Igel H.", "AuthorID": "7003562652", "AffiliationID": "60028717", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences, Ludwig-Maximilians-University"}, "6603947452": {"Name": "Wassermann J.", "AuthorID": "6603947452", "AffiliationID": "60028717", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences, Ludwig-Maximilians-University"}, "14119629500": {"Name": "Ferreira A.", "AuthorID": "14119629500", "AffiliationID": "60078911, 60106051, 60004956", "AffiliationName": "ICIST, DECivil, Instituto Superior T\u00e9cnico and Universidade de Lisboa"}, "22833859700": {"Name": "Al-Attar D.", "AuthorID": "22833859700", "AffiliationID": "60008160, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, Bullard Laboratories, University of Cambridge"}, "7005894615": {"Name": "Schreiber K.", "AuthorID": "7005894615", "AffiliationID": "60019722", "AffiliationName": "Forschungseinrichtung Satellitengeod\u00e4sie, Technical University of Munich, Fundamental Station Wettzell"}}}
