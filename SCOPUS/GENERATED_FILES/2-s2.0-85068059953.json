This moved PH from a health-focussed into a broader and more politically oriented context. This article reports on the perceptions of those involved in this transition about how the PH function was changing as it transited to local government. Study design: This is a cross-sectional interview study. Methods: The study included semi-structured interviews with 31 local government councillors, directors and deputy directors of PH, PH team members and members of clinical commissioning groups. Interviews and data analysis were informed by a theoretical framework, COM-B and an inductive and deductive approach was taken to identify relevant themes. Results: There was a mixed picture of perceived gains and losses for PH. The transition from NHS to local government was seen by some as a \u2018homecoming\u2019, providing the opportunity for PH to have further reach through influence and collaboration with departments like housing, transport and planning. The opportunity to promote evidence-based practice across local government was also seen as a positive aspect of the transition. However, professional roles of PH and individual PH practitioners were perceived to have less influence and autonomy than in the NHS, with some uncertainty about roles within local government. PH practitioners perceived the need to develop other skills to fulfil their roles in local government. Shorter timescales for action and pressure for faster responses were reported to be the reason for less emphasis on using PH evidence to inform policy and decision-making than hitherto in the NHS. Conclusion: This study illustrates a variety of consequences of transitioning from NHS to local government. There were perceived benefits afforded by proximity to related local government departments but at the costs of reduction in status for PH practitioners and working to a timescale which in some cases reduced drawing on scientific evidence.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Evidence-based practice", "Guidelines", "Local government", "Reorganisation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cross-Sectional Studies", "England", "Humans", "Local Government", "Public Health Administration", "Qualitative Research", "State Medicine"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85068059953", "SubjectAreas": [["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"7005842007": {"Name": "Atkins L.", "AuthorID": "7005842007", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Behaviour Change, University College London"}, "55985851100": {"Name": "Littleford C.", "AuthorID": "55985851100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Behaviour Change, University College London"}, "7004779970": {"Name": "Michie S.", "AuthorID": "7004779970", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Behaviour Change, University College London"}, "57040355200": {"Name": "Kelly M.P.", "AuthorID": "57040355200", "AffiliationID": "60009587, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Public Health and Primary Care, Institute of Public Health, University of Cambridge"}, "21334820200": {"Name": "Leng G.", "AuthorID": "21334820200", "AffiliationID": "60022176", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health and Care Excellence"}}}
