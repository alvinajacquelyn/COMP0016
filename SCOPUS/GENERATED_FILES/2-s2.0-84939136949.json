Coherent optical communication systems result in a four-dimensional (4D) signal space, which naturally leads to 4D-CM transceivers. A practically attractive design paradigm is to use a bit-wise decoder, where the detection process is (suboptimally) separated into two steps: soft-decision demapping followed by binary decoding. In this paper, bit-wise decoders are studied from an information-theoretic viewpoint. 4D constellations with up to 4096 constellation points are considered. Metrics to predict the post-FEC bit-error rate (BER) of bit-wise decoders are analyzed. The mutual information is shown to fail at predicting the post-FEC BER of bit-wise decoders and the so-called generalized mutual information is shown to be a much more robust metric. For the suboptimal scheme under consideration, it is also shown that constellations that transmit and receive information in each polarization and quadrature independently (e.g., PM-QPSK, PM-16QAM, and PM-64QAM) outperform the best 4D constellations designed for uncoded transmission. Theoretical gains are as high as 4 dB, which are then validated via numerical simulations of low-density parity check codes.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bit-interleaved coded modulation (BICM)", "bitwise (BW) decoders", "channel capacity", "coded modulation (CM)", "fiber-optic communications", "low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes", "nonlinear distortion"], "IndexKeywords": ["Bit interleaved coded modulation", "bitwise (BW) decoders", "Coded modulation", "Fiber optic communications", "Low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84939136949", "SubjectAreas": [["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"]], "AuthorData": {"23476771600": {"Name": "Alvarado A.", "AuthorID": "23476771600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Optical Networks Group, Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "6701439390": {"Name": "Agrell E.", "AuthorID": "6701439390", "AffiliationID": "60000990", "AffiliationName": "Department of Signals and Systems, Chalmers University of Technology"}}}
