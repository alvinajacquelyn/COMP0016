However, toxicity concerns about commonly used cadmium-based QDs hinder their translation to clinical applications. In this study we describe the in vivo biodistribution and toxicology of indium-based water soluble QDs in rats following intravenous administration. The biodistribution measured at up to 90 days showed that QDs mainly accumulated in the liver and spleen, with similar elimination kinetics to subcutaneous administration. Evidence for QD degradation in the liver was found by comparing photoluminescence measurements versus elemental analysis. No organ damage or histopathological lesions were observed for the QDs treated rats after 24 h, 1 and 4 weeks following intravenous administration at 12.5 mg/kg or 50 mg/kg. Analysis of serum biochemistry and complete blood counts found no toxicity. This work supports the strong potential of indium-based QDs for translation into the clinic.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Biodistribution", "Cadmium-free quantum dots", "Nanoparticles", "Toxicology"], "IndexKeywords": ["Biodistributions", "Biomedical applications", "Complete blood counts", "Intravenous administration", "Photoluminescence measurements", "Photophysical properties", "Quantum dot nanoparticles", "Toxicology", "Animals", "Cadmium", "Female", "Indium", "Liver", "Models, Animal", "Nanoparticles", "Quantum Dots", "Rats", "Tissue Distribution", "Toxicity Tests"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85052840636", "SubjectAreas": [["Bioengineering", "CENG", "1502"], ["Medicine (miscellaneous)", "MEDI", "2701"], ["Molecular Medicine", "BIOC", "1313"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Pharmaceutical Science", "PHAR", "3003"]], "AuthorData": {"26636178300": {"Name": "Yaghini E.", "AuthorID": "26636178300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Surgery and Interventional Science, University College London"}, "26643365600": {"Name": "MacRobert A.J.", "AuthorID": "26643365600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Surgery and Interventional Science, University College London"}, "57190278720": {"Name": "Turner H.", "AuthorID": "57190278720", "AffiliationID": "60111927", "AffiliationName": "Nanoco Technologies Limited"}, "6603589574": {"Name": "Naasani I.", "AuthorID": "6603589574", "AffiliationID": "60111927", "AffiliationName": "Nanoco Technologies Limited"}, "57220810377": {"Name": "Pilling A.", "AuthorID": "57220810377", "AffiliationID": "121318336", "AffiliationName": "ToxPath Consultancy Limited, Stradbroke Business Centre, Eye"}}}
