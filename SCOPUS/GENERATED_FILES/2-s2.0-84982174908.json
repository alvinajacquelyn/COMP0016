The method (Catchment-Averaged denudatIon Rates from cosmogenic Nuclides: CAIRN) bundles previously reported production scaling and topographic shielding algorithms. In addition, it calculates production and shielding on a pixel-by-pixel basis. We explore the effect of sampling frequency across both azimuth (\u03b4\u03b8) and altitude (\u03b4 \u03c6) angles for topographic shielding and show that in high relief terrain a relatively high sampling frequency is required, with a good balance achieved between accuracy and computational expense at \u03b4\u03b8 Combining double low line 8\u00b0 and \u03b4 \u03c6 Combining double low line 5\u00b0. CAIRN includes both internal and external uncertainty analysis, and is packaged in freely available software in order to facilitate easily reproducible denudation rate estimates. CAIRN calculates denudation rates but also automates catchment averaging of shielding and production, and thus can be used to provide reproducible input parameters for the CRONUS family of online calculators.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84982174908", "SubjectAreas": [["Geophysics", "EART", "1908"], ["Earth-Surface Processes", "EART", "1904"]], "AuthorData": {"12243675500": {"Name": "Marius Mudd S.", "AuthorID": "12243675500", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "School of GeoSciences, University of Edinburgh"}, "56262398700": {"Name": "Harel M.A.", "AuthorID": "56262398700", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "School of GeoSciences, University of Edinburgh"}, "56074478500": {"Name": "Grieve S.W.D.", "AuthorID": "56074478500", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "School of GeoSciences, University of Edinburgh"}, "23991021100": {"Name": "Marrero S.M.", "AuthorID": "23991021100", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "School of GeoSciences, University of Edinburgh"}, "38961405700": {"Name": "Hurst M.D.", "AuthorID": "38961405700", "AffiliationID": "60001490", "AffiliationName": "School of Geographical and Earth Sciences, University of Glasgow"}}}
