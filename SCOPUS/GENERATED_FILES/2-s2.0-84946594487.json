To characterize genomic variation among the four major lineages of C. gattii (VGI,-II,-III, and-IV), we generated, annotated, and compared 16 de novo genome assemblies, including the first for the rarely isolated lineages VGIII and VGIV. By identifying syntenic regions across assemblies, we found 15 structural rearrangements, which were almost exclusive to the VGI-III-IV lineages. Using synteny to inform orthology prediction, we identified a core set of 87% of C. gattii genes present as single copies in all four lineages. Remarkably, 737 genes are variably inherited across lineages and are overrepresented for response to oxidative stress, mitochondrial import, and metal binding and transport. Specifically, VGI has an expanded set of iron-binding genes thought to be important to the virulence of Cryptococcus, while VGII has expansions in the stress-related heat shock proteins relative to the other lineages. We also characterized genes uniquely absent in each lineage, including a copper transporter absent from VGIV, which influences Cryptococcus survival during pulmonary infection and the onset of meningoencephalitis. Through inclusion of population-level data for an additional 37 isolates, we identified a new transcontinental clonal group that we name VGIIx, mitochondrial recombination between VGII and VGIII, and positive selection of multidrug transporters and the iron-sulfur protein aconitase along multiple branches of the phylogenetic tree. Our results suggest that gene expansion or contraction and positive selection have introduced substantial variation with links to mechanisms of pathogenicity across this species complex.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Cluster Analysis", "Cryptococcosis", "Cryptococcus gattii", "DNA, Fungal", "Environmental Microbiology", "Evolution, Molecular", "Genetic Variation", "Genome, Fungal", "Genotype", "Humans", "Molecular Sequence Annotation", "Molecular Sequence Data", "Phylogeography", "Sequence Analysis, DNA", "Synteny"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84946594487", "SubjectAreas": [["Microbiology", "IMMU", "2404"], ["Virology", "IMMU", "2406"]], "AuthorData": {"25937288800": {"Name": "Farrer R.A.", "AuthorID": "25937288800", "AffiliationID": "60001001, 60022195", "AffiliationName": "Genome Sequencing and Analysis Program, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard"}, "55913102400": {"Name": "Desjardins C.A.", "AuthorID": "55913102400", "AffiliationID": "60001001, 60022195", "AffiliationName": "Genome Sequencing and Analysis Program, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard"}, "26538122800": {"Name": "Sakthikumar S.", "AuthorID": "26538122800", "AffiliationID": "60001001, 60022195", "AffiliationName": "Genome Sequencing and Analysis Program, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard"}, "36094067900": {"Name": "Gujja S.", "AuthorID": "36094067900", "AffiliationID": "60001001, 60022195", "AffiliationName": "Genome Sequencing and Analysis Program, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard"}, "36090473300": {"Name": "Saif S.", "AuthorID": "36090473300", "AffiliationID": "60001001, 60022195", "AffiliationName": "Genome Sequencing and Analysis Program, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard"}, "8947609300": {"Name": "Zeng Q.", "AuthorID": "8947609300", "AffiliationID": "60001001, 60022195", "AffiliationName": "Genome Sequencing and Analysis Program, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard"}, "56776223500": {"Name": "Cuomo C.A.", "AuthorID": "56776223500", "AffiliationID": "60001001, 60022195", "AffiliationName": "Genome Sequencing and Analysis Program, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard"}, "56057678700": {"Name": "Chen Y.", "AuthorID": "56057678700", "AffiliationID": "60113147", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, Duke University Medical Center"}, "22636127900": {"Name": "Voelz K.", "AuthorID": "22636127900", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Microbiology and Infection and School of Biosciences, University of Birmingham"}, "7202930914": {"Name": "May R.C.", "AuthorID": "7202930914", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Microbiology and Infection and School of Biosciences, University of Birmingham"}, "19634810800": {"Name": "Heitman J.", "AuthorID": "19634810800", "AffiliationID": "60113147", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Genetics and Microbiology, Duke University Medical Center, Durham"}, "55936464000": {"Name": "Fisher M.C.", "AuthorID": "55936464000", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, Imperial College London"}}}
