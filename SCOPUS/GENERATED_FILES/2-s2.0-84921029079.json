We hypothesised that sodium valproate, an HDAC inhibitor, might have the ability to up-regulate the enzyme. We treated McArdle sheep with sodium valproate given enterically at 20-60 mg/kg body wt. Compared with untreated control animals, there was increased expression of phosphorylase in muscle fibres. The response was dose dependent and reached a maximum 2 hours after the application and increased with repeated applications. Improvement in mobility could not be demonstrated. These findings suggest that sodium valproate is a potential therapeutic treatment for McArdle disease.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Glycogen phosphorylase", "Glycogen storage disease type V", "HDCAI", "McArdle disease", "Sheep", "Sodium valproate"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Aspartate Aminotransferases", "Calcium", "Creatine Kinase", "Disease Models, Animal", "Drug Administration Schedule", "Enzyme Inhibitors", "Glycogen Storage Disease Type V", "Lactic Acid", "Locomotion", "Muscle Fibers, Skeletal", "Phosphorylases", "Sheep", "Time Factors", "Valproic Acid"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84921029079", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Genetics (clinical)", "MEDI", "2716"]], "AuthorData": {"7402273530": {"Name": "Howell J.M.C.", "AuthorID": "7402273530", "AffiliationID": "60031806", "AffiliationName": "Australian Neuro-Muscular Research Institute, CNND, University of Western Australia"}, "23972602700": {"Name": "Dunton E.", "AuthorID": "23972602700", "AffiliationID": "60019939", "AffiliationName": "School of Veterinary and Life Sciences, Murdoch University"}, "7004133722": {"Name": "Creed K.E.", "AuthorID": "7004133722", "AffiliationID": "60019939", "AffiliationName": "School of Veterinary and Life Sciences, Murdoch University"}, "57208851936": {"Name": "Quinlivan R.", "AuthorID": "57208851936", "AffiliationID": "60020736", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Neuromuscular Diseases, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "7006776367": {"Name": "Sewry C.", "AuthorID": "7006776367", "AffiliationID": "60024568", "AffiliationName": "Robert Jones and Agnes Hunt Orthopaedic hospital"}}}
