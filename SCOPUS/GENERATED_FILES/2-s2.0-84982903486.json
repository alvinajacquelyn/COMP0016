All rights reserved.A 51-year-old man gave a 2-year history of worsening mobility, cognitive decline and headaches. He had a history of thromboembolic stroke, recurrent transient ischaemic attacks and a spontaneous intraventricular haemorrhage. On examination, he had livedo reticularis and perniosis and a systolic murmur. Catheter cerebral angiography showed peripheral smallvessel and medium-vessel vasculopathy resulting in pruning of the distal cortical vessels and tortuous irregular distal collaterals. Skin biopsy showed subtle vasculopathy with ectasia of capillaries and postcapillary venules but no frank vasculitis or arterial thrombosis. Repeated serum antiphospholipid antibody titres were negative. The clinical features, skin biopsy and angiogram findings strongly supported a diagnosis of Sneddon\u2019s syndrome. Clinicians should consider Sneddon\u2019s syndrome in patients with livedo reticularis and stroke. There are treatment dilemmas in this situation when ischaemic and haemorrhagic cerebral events coexist.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Cerebral Angiography", "Cerebral Hemorrhage", "Ectoderm", "Humans", "Ischemic Attack, Transient", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Sneddon Syndrome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84982903486", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"39262567300": {"Name": "Rutter-Locher Z.", "AuthorID": "39262567300", "AffiliationID": "60021923", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, King\u2019s College Hospital"}, "57190749529": {"Name": "Chen Z.", "AuthorID": "57190749529", "AffiliationID": "60021923", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, King\u2019s College Hospital"}, "55245694100": {"Name": "Flores L.", "AuthorID": "55245694100", "AffiliationID": "60021923", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, King\u2019s College Hospital"}, "35592577400": {"Name": "Weeks R.", "AuthorID": "35592577400", "AffiliationID": "60021923", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, King\u2019s College Hospital"}, "55886286400": {"Name": "Nashef L.", "AuthorID": "55886286400", "AffiliationID": "60021923", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, King\u2019s College Hospital"}, "55243753600": {"Name": "Basu T.", "AuthorID": "55243753600", "AffiliationID": "60021923", "AffiliationName": "Department of Dermatology, King\u2019s College Hospital"}, "7004427104": {"Name": "Creamer D.", "AuthorID": "7004427104", "AffiliationID": "60021923", "AffiliationName": "Department of Dermatology, King\u2019s College Hospital"}, "7006824905": {"Name": "Arya R.", "AuthorID": "7006824905", "AffiliationID": "60021923", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, King\u2019s College Hospital"}}}
