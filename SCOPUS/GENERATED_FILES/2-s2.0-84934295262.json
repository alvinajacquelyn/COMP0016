Whole-population screening of children younger than 5 years is applied in many countries. The substantial diversity in existing programmes reflects their heterogeneous implementation in the absence of the complete evidence base that is now a pre-requisite for instituting screening. The functional importance of amblyopia at an individual level is unclear as data are scarce, but in view of the high prevalence the population-level effect might be notable. Screening of all children aged 4-5 years (eg, at school entry) confers most benefit and addresses inequity in access to timely treatment. Screening at younger ages is associated with increased risk of false-positive results, and at older ages with poor outcomes for children with moderate to severe amblyopia. We suggest that the real-life adverse effects of amblyopia should be characterised and screening and diagnosis should be standardised.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Amblyopia", "Child, Preschool", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Mass Screening", "Prevalence", "Vision Screening", "Visual Acuity"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84934295262", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"17342850000": {"Name": "Solebo A.L.", "AuthorID": "17342850000", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Ophthalmology, Life Course Epidemiology and Biostatistics Section, University College, London Institute of Child Health"}, "57211811127": {"Name": "Cumberland P.M.", "AuthorID": "57211811127", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Ulverscroft Vision Research Group, UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "57191956020": {"Name": "Rahi J.S.", "AuthorID": "57191956020", "AffiliationID": "60018207, 60012662", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital, Institute of Child Health Biomedical Research Centre"}}}
