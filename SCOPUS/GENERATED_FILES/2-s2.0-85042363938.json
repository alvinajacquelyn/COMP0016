However, their diagnostic accuracy in the differential diagnostic context is unknown. Methods: Cerebrospinal fluid NFL levels were quantified in nonprimarily neurodegenerative neurological and psychiatric diseases (n = 122), mild cognitive impairment (n = 48), Alzheimer's disease (n = 108), dementia with Lewy bodies/Parkinson's disease dementia (n = 53), vascular dementia (n = 46), frontotemporal dementia (n = 41), sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (sCJD, n = 132), and genetic prion diseases (n = 182). Results: The highest NFL levels were detected in sCJD, followed by vascular dementia, frontotemporal dementia, dementia with Lewy bodies/Parkinson's disease dementia, Alzheimer's disease, and mild cognitive impairment. In sCJD, NFL levels correlated with cerebrospinal fluid tau and disease duration. NFL levels were able to differentiate sCJD from nonprimarily neurodegenerative neurological and psychiatric diseases (area under the curve = 0.99, 95% confidence interval: 0.99\u20131) and from the other diagnostic groups showing cognitive impairment/dementia of a non-CJD etiology (area under the curve = 0.90, 95% confidence interval: 0.87\u20130.92). Compared to nonprimarily neurodegenerative neurological and psychiatric diseases, NFL was also elevated in genetic prion diseases associated with the E200K, V210I, P102L, and D178N prion protein gene mutations. Discussion: Increased NFL levels are a common feature in neurodegenerative dementias.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alzheimer's disease", "Cerebrospinal fluid", "Dementia with Lewy bodies", "Frontotemporal dementia", "Neurodegenerative dementias", "Neurofilament light", "Parkinson's disease dementia", "Prion diseases", "Vascular dementia"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85042363938", "SubjectAreas": [["Epidemiology", "MEDI", "2713"], ["Health Policy", "MEDI", "2719"], ["Developmental Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2806"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Geriatrics and Gerontology", "MEDI", "2717"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"]], "AuthorData": {"8382301500": {"Name": "Zerr I.", "AuthorID": "8382301500", "AffiliationID": "60103674", "AffiliationName": "German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE)"}, "15844268800": {"Name": "Schmitz M.", "AuthorID": "15844268800", "AffiliationID": "60103674", "AffiliationName": "German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE)"}, "36621479400": {"Name": "Villar-Piqu\u00e9 A.", "AuthorID": "36621479400", "AffiliationID": "60031514", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, University Medical School"}, "18434019500": {"Name": "Hermann P.", "AuthorID": "18434019500", "AffiliationID": "60031514", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, University Medical School"}, "57193319929": {"Name": "Knipper T.", "AuthorID": "57193319929", "AffiliationID": "60031514", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, University Medical School"}, "57200757534": {"Name": "Goebel S.", "AuthorID": "57200757534", "AffiliationID": "60031514", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, University Medical School"}, "8908300800": {"Name": "Varges D.", "AuthorID": "8908300800", "AffiliationID": "60031514", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, University Medical School"}, "55917217700": {"Name": "Karch A.", "AuthorID": "55917217700", "AffiliationID": "60012279", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology, Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research"}, "21233906500": {"Name": "Kanata E.", "AuthorID": "21233906500", "AffiliationID": "60015331", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Pharmacology, School of Health Sciences, Department of Pharmacy, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki"}, "57200762113": {"Name": "Karsanidou A.", "AuthorID": "57200762113", "AffiliationID": "60015331", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Pharmacology, School of Health Sciences, Department of Pharmacy, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki"}, "56034068100": {"Name": "Sklaviadis T.", "AuthorID": "56034068100", "AffiliationID": "60015331", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Pharmacology, School of Health Sciences, Department of Pharmacy, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki"}, "6602391612": {"Name": "Golanska E.", "AuthorID": "6602391612", "AffiliationID": "60006651", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Pathology and Neuropathology, Medical University of Lodz"}, "57203441288": {"Name": "Sikorska B.", "AuthorID": "57203441288", "AffiliationID": "60006651", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Pathology and Neuropathology, Medical University of Lodz"}, "7102019327": {"Name": "Liberski P.P.", "AuthorID": "7102019327", "AffiliationID": "60006651", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Pathology and Neuropathology, Medical University of Lodz"}, "57195297409": {"Name": "D\u00edaz-Lucena D.", "AuthorID": "57195297409", "AffiliationID": "60011805, 60001602, 60085102", "AffiliationName": "Network Center for Biomedical Research in Neurodegenerative Diseases, (CIBERNED), Institute Carlos III, Ministry of Health, Hospitalet de Llobregat"}, "36042305900": {"Name": "Ferrer I.", "AuthorID": "36042305900", "AffiliationID": "60011805, 60025847, 60001576", "AffiliationName": "Senior Consultant, Bellvitge University Hospital-IDIBELL, Department of Pathology and Experimental Therapeutics, University of Barcelona, Hospitalet de Llobregat"}, "35068919400": {"Name": "Calero O.", "AuthorID": "35068919400", "AffiliationID": "60001602", "AffiliationName": "Alzheimer Disease Research Unit, CIEN Foundation;
