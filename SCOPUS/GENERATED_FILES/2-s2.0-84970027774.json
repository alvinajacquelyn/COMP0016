It is shown that when STC is implemented based on super-twisting observer (STO), then it is not possible to achieve second-order sliding mode (SOSM) using continuous control on the chosen sliding surface. Two methodologies are proposed to circumvent the above-mentioned problem. In the first method, control input is discontinuous, which may not be desirable for practical systems. In the second method, continuous STC is proposed based on higher order sliding mode observer (HOSMO) that achieves SOSM on the chosen sliding surface. For simplicity, we are considering here only the perturbed double integrator, which can be generalized for an arbitrary-order systems. Numerical simulations and experimental validation are also presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "AuthorKeywords": ["higher order sliding mode observer (HOSMO)", "Super-twisting control (STC)", "super-twisting observer (STO)"], "IndexKeywords": ["Continuous control", "Experimental validations", "Higher order sliding modes", "Output feedback stabilization", "Practical systems", "Second order sliding mode (SOSM)", "Super twisting controls", "Super twisting observer"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84970027774", "SubjectAreas": [["Control and Systems Engineering", "ENGI", "2207"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"55368137300": {"Name": "Chalanga A.", "AuthorID": "55368137300", "AffiliationID": "60014153", "AffiliationName": "InterdisciplinaryProgram in Systems and Control Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Bombay"}, "7102126899": {"Name": "Bandyopadhyay B.", "AuthorID": "7102126899", "AffiliationID": "60014153", "AffiliationName": "InterdisciplinaryProgram in Systems and Control Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Bombay"}, "53868026300": {"Name": "Kamal S.", "AuthorID": "53868026300", "AffiliationID": "60031838", "AffiliationName": "Department of Systems Design and Informatics, Kyushu Institute of Technology"}, "7006662972": {"Name": "Fridman L.", "AuthorID": "7006662972", "AffiliationID": "60032442", "AffiliationName": "Divisi\u00f3n de Ingenier\u00eda El\u00e9ctrica, Departamento de Ingenier\u00eda de Control y Rob\u00f3tica, Facultad de Ingenier\u00eda, Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico, Ciudad Universitaria"}, "57087344600": {"Name": "Moreno J.", "AuthorID": "57087344600", "AffiliationID": "60032442", "AffiliationName": "Departamento de El\u00e9ctrica y Computaci\u00f3n, Instituto de Ingenier\u00eda, Universidad Nacional Autnoma de M\u00e9xico"}}}
