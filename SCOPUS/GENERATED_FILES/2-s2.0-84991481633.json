In the present study, we investigated the ability of cryopreserved quail spermatozoa to achieve fertilisation and embryo development. Female quail were killed 70-120min after previous oviposition to collect unfertilised oocytes from the oviduct. Fresh or cryopreserved-thawed spermatozoa were injected into the cytoplasm of unfertilised oocytes, and the manipulated oocytes were incubated in quail surrogate eggshells. Injection of fresh spermatozoa supplemented with inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) resulted in a significantly increased rate of embryo development compared with injection of fresh spermatozoa alone (90% vs 13%, respectively). Although >80% of embryos stopped cell division and development before Hamburger and Hamilton (HH) Stage 3, approximately 15% of embryos from the fresh sperm injection developed to past HH Stage 4, and one embryo survived up to HH Stage 39 (11 days of incubation). In the case of cryopreserved spermatozoa, the embryo development rate was 30% after ICSI, and this increased significantly to 74% with IP3 supplementation. In conclusion, cryopreserved spermatozoa combined with ICSI followed by surrogate eggshell culture can develop quail embryos.", "AuthorKeywords": ["surrogate eggshell"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Cryopreservation", "Female", "Fertilization", "Male", "Oocytes", "Quail", "Sperm Injections, Intracytoplasmic", "Spermatozoa"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84991481633", "SubjectAreas": [["Biotechnology", "BIOC", "1305"], ["Reproductive Medicine", "MEDI", "2743"], ["Animal Science and Zoology", "AGRI", "1103"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Endocrinology", "BIOC", "1310"], ["Developmental Biology", "BIOC", "1309"]], "AuthorData": {"36632287300": {"Name": "Kang K.", "AuthorID": "36632287300", "AffiliationID": "60120231, 60013682", "AffiliationName": "Department of Agricultural Biotechnology, College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, Seoul National University"}, "57207324937": {"Name": "Lee H.", "AuthorID": "57207324937", "AffiliationID": "60120231, 60013682", "AffiliationName": "Department of Agricultural Biotechnology, College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, Seoul National University"}, "55762558500": {"Name": "Lee H.", "AuthorID": "55762558500", "AffiliationID": "60120231, 60013682", "AffiliationName": "Department of Agricultural Biotechnology, College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, Seoul National University"}, "57051764200": {"Name": "Choi H.", "AuthorID": "57051764200", "AffiliationID": "60120231, 60013682", "AffiliationName": "Department of Agricultural Biotechnology, College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, Seoul National University"}, "7406440402": {"Name": "Han J.", "AuthorID": "7406440402", "AffiliationID": "60031955", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Biomedical Sciences, Shinshu University"}, "15749503900": {"Name": "Park T.", "AuthorID": "15749503900", "AffiliationID": "60013682", "AffiliationName": "Graduate School of International Agricultural Technology, Institute of Green-Bio Science and Technology, Seoul National University"}, "22836159100": {"Name": "Rengaraj D.", "AuthorID": "22836159100", "AffiliationID": "60014237", "AffiliationName": "Department of Animal Science and Technology, Chung-Ang University"}, "16307250700": {"Name": "Mizushima S.", "AuthorID": "16307250700", "AffiliationID": "60103680", "AffiliationName": "Department of Applied Biological Chemistry, Faculty of Agriculture, Shizuoka University"}, "7403947363": {"Name": "Ono T.", "AuthorID": "7403947363", "AffiliationID": "60031955", "AffiliationName": "Division of Animal Science, Faculty of Agriculture, Shinshu University"}}}
