We assessed the efficacy of bevacizumab plus modified FOLFOX-6 (5-fluorouracil/folinic acid, oxaliplatin) or FOLFOXIRI (5-fluorouracil/folinic acid, oxaliplatin, irinotecan) in this setting. Patients and methods: OLIVIAwas a multinational open-label phase II study conducted at 16 centres in Austria, France, Spain, and the UK. Patients with unresectable liver metastases were randomised to bevacizumab (5 mg/kg) plus mFOLFOX- 6 [oxaliplatin 85mg/m2, folinic acid 400 mg/m2, 5-fluorouracil 400 mg/m2 (bolus) then 2400 mg/m2 (46-h infusion)] or FOLFOXIRI [oxaliplatin 85 mg/m2, irinotecan 165 mg/m2, folinic acid 200 mg/m2, 5-fluorouracil 3200 mg/m2 (46-h infusion)] every 2 weeks. Unresectability was defined as \u22651 of the following criteria: no possibility of upfront R0/R1 resection of all lesions; <30% residual liver volume after resection; metastases in contact with major vessels of the remnant liver. Resectability was evaluated by multidisciplinary review. The primary end point was overall resection rate (R0/R1/R2). Efficacy end points were analysed by intention-to-treat analysis. Results: In patients assigned to bevacizumab-FOLFOXIRI (n = 41) or bevacizumab-mFOLFOX-6 (n = 39), the overall resection rate was 61% [95% confidence interval (CI) 45% to 76%] and 49% (95% CI 32% to 65%), respectively (difference 12%; 95% CI -11% to 36%). R0 resection rates were 49% and 23%, respectively. Overall tumour response rates were 81% (95% CI 65% to 91%) with bevacizumab-FOLFOXIRI and 62% (95% CI 45% to 77%) with bevacizumab-mFOLFOX-6. Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 18\u00b76 (95% CI 12.9-22.3) months and 11\u00b75 (95% CI 9.6-13.6) months, respectively. The most common grade 3-5 adverse events were neutropenia (bevacizumab-FOLFOXIRI, 50%; bevacizumab-mFOLFOX-6, 35%) and diarrhoea (30% and 14%, respectively). Conclusions: Bevacizumab-FOLFOXIRI was associated with higher response and resection rates and prolonged PFS versus bevacizumab-mFOLFOX-6 in patients with initially unresectable liver metastases from colorectal cancer. Toxicity was increased but manageable with bevacizumab-FOLFOXIRI.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bevacizumab", "Chemotherapy", "Colorectal cancer", "Liver metastases", "Secondary resection"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols", "Bevacizumab", "Camptothecin", "Colorectal Neoplasms", "Female", "Fluorouracil", "Follow-Up Studies", "Hepatectomy", "Humans", "Leucovorin", "Liver Neoplasms", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Neoplasm Grading", "Neoplasm Staging", "Organoplatinum Compounds", "Prognosis", "Survival Rate"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84926460438", "SubjectAreas": [["Hematology", "MEDI", "2720"], ["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"]], "AuthorData": {"6603768510": {"Name": "Gruenberger T.", "AuthorID": "6603768510", "AffiliationID": "60030339", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery I, Rudolfstiftung Hospital"}, "7003634798": {"Name": "Bridgewater J.", "AuthorID": "7003634798", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Oncology, University College London Cancer Institute"}, "14526721100": {"Name": "Chau I.", "AuthorID": "14526721100", "AffiliationID": "60011472", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, The Royal Marsden Hospital"}, "6602670562": {"Name": "Garc\u00eda Alfonso P.", "AuthorID": "6602670562", "AffiliationID": "60033237", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Oncology, Hospital General Universitario Gregorio Mara\u00f1\u00f3n"}, "55660521600": {"Name": "Rivoire M.", "AuthorID": "55660521600", "AffiliationID": "60023578, 60018084", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgical Oncology, L\u00e9on B\u00e9rard Cancer Center, Universit\u00e9 Claude Bernard Lyon I"}, "6603244871": {"Name": "Mudan S.", "AuthorID": "6603244871", "AffiliationID": "60011472", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery, The Royal Marsden Hospital"}, "35976354700": {"Name": "Lasserre S.", "AuthorID": "35976354700", "AffiliationID": "60008201", "AffiliationName": "F.
