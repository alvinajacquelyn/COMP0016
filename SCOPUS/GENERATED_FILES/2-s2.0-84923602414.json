Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is one of the diseases that would benefit from this prospect. Exploring this idea, we designed a screening panel to sequence 25 ALS-linked genes and examined samples from 95 patients with both familial and sporadic ALS. Forty-three rare polymorphisms were detected in this cohort. A third of these have already been reported with respect to ALS, leaving 28 novel variants all open for further investigation. This study highlights the potential benefits of next-generation sequencing as a reliable, cost and time efficient, diagnostic, and research tool for ALS.", "AuthorKeywords": ["ALS", "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis", "Diagnosis", "Genetic", "MiSeq", "Neurogenetics", "Next-generation sequencing", "NGS", "Sequencing"], "IndexKeywords": ["Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis", "Cohort Studies", "High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing", "Humans", "Polymorphism, Genetic", "Reproducibility of Results"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84923602414", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Aging", "BIOC", "1302"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Developmental Biology", "BIOC", "1309"], ["Geriatrics and Gerontology", "MEDI", "2717"]], "AuthorData": {"56478135100": {"Name": "Morgan S.", "AuthorID": "56478135100", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "55507350000": {"Name": "Shoai M.", "AuthorID": "55507350000", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "56210513900": {"Name": "Hardy J.", "AuthorID": "56210513900", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "57196045273": {"Name": "Pittman A.", "AuthorID": "57196045273", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "7003363686": {"Name": "Houlden H.", "AuthorID": "7003363686", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "12802595400": {"Name": "Fratta P.", "AuthorID": "12802595400", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurodegenerative Diseases, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "57221060388": {"Name": "Sidle K.", "AuthorID": "57221060388", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "7005900136": {"Name": "Orrell R.", "AuthorID": "7005900136", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "7201380026": {"Name": "Sweeney M.G.", "AuthorID": "7201380026", "AffiliationID": "60020736", "AffiliationName": "Neurogenetics Unit, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "55632439300": {"Name": "Shatunov A.", "AuthorID": "55632439300", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Neuroscience, King's College London, Institute of Psychiatry"}, "37113019000": {"Name": "Sproviero W.", "AuthorID": "37113019000", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Neuroscience, King's College London, Institute of Psychiatry"}, "55245748600": {"Name": "Jones A.", "AuthorID": "55245748600", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Neuroscience, King's College London, Institute of Psychiatry"}, "7003751621": {"Name": "Al-Chalabi A.", "AuthorID": "7003751621", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Neuroscience, King's College London, Institute of Psychiatry"}, "7003290890": {"Name": "Malaspina A.", "AuthorID": "7003290890", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Neuroscience and Trauma, Blizard Institute, Queen Mary University of London, North-East London and Essex Regional Motor Neuron Disease Care Centre"}}}
