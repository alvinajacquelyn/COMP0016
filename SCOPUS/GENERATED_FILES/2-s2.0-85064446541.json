All rights reserved. Gallium Phosphide (GaP) has a band gap of 2.26 eV and a valance band edge that is more negative than the water oxidation level. Hence, it may be a promising material for photoelectrochemical water splitting. However, one thing GaP has in common with other III-V semiconductors is that it corrodes in photoelectrochemical reactions. Cobalt oxide (CoO x ) is a chemically stable and highly active oxygen evolution reaction co-catalyst. In this study, we protected a GaP photoanode by using a 20 nm TiO 2 as a protection layer and a 2 nm cobalt oxide co-catalyst layer, which were both deposited via atomic layer deposition (ALD). A GaP photoanode that was modified by CoO x exhibited much higher photocurrent, potential, and photon-to-current efficiency than a bare GaP photoanode under AM1.5G illumination. A photoanode that was coated with both TiO 2 and CoO x layers was stable for over 24 h during constant reaction in 1 M NaOH (pH 13.7) solution under one sun illumination.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["One-sun illumination", "Photoelectrochemical reaction", "Photoelectrochemical water oxidation", "Photoelectrochemical water splitting", "Photon-to-current efficiencies", "Protection layers", "Valance bands", "Water oxidation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85064446541", "SubjectAreas": [["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"]], "AuthorData": {"57202830100": {"Name": "Alqahtani M.", "AuthorID": "57202830100", "AffiliationID": "60033126", "AffiliationName": "King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology (KACST)"}, "56897244300": {"Name": "Jurczak P.", "AuthorID": "56897244300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "15765485000": {"Name": "Liu H.", "AuthorID": "15765485000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "10141185300": {"Name": "Wu J.", "AuthorID": "10141185300", "AffiliationID": "60005465", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Fundamental and Frontier Sciences, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China"}, "56568432100": {"Name": "Alromaeh A.", "AuthorID": "56568432100", "AffiliationID": "60033126", "AffiliationName": "King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology (KACST)"}, "57208317412": {"Name": "Ben-Jabar S.", "AuthorID": "57208317412", "AffiliationID": "109926610", "AffiliationName": "Department of Forensic Science, King Fahad Security College (KFSC)"}, "37081732100": {"Name": "Sathasivam S.", "AuthorID": "37081732100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "57208152288": {"Name": "Xia X.", "AuthorID": "57208152288", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "7005826606": {"Name": "Blackman C.", "AuthorID": "7005826606", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "56217400400": {"Name": "Parkin I.P.", "AuthorID": "56217400400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "55839273600": {"Name": "Ebaid M.", "AuthorID": "55839273600", "AffiliationID": "60092945", "AffiliationName": "King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST)"}, "57208318239": {"Name": "Ooi B.S.", "AuthorID": "57208318239", "AffiliationID": "60092945", "AffiliationName": "King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST)"}, "55684697600": {"Name": "Qin Y.", "AuthorID": "55684697600", "AffiliationID": "60028797, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Coal Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "57194707813": {"Name": "Zhang B.", "AuthorID": "57194707813", "AffiliationID": "60028797, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Coal Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}}}
