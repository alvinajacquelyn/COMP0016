However, as environmental evaluations have typically been self-reported, the observed associations may be attributable to reporting bias. Methods: Applying instrumental-variable regression, we used staffing level (the ratio of staff to residents) as an unconfounded instrument for self-reported job demands and job strain to predict various indicators of wellbeing (perceived stress, psychological distress and sleeping problems) among 1525 registered nurses, practical nurses and nursing assistants working in elderly care wards. Results: In ordinary regression, higher self-reported job demands and job strain were associated with increased risk of perceived stress, psychological distress and sleeping problems. The effect estimates for the associations of these psychosocial factors with perceived stress and psychological distress were greater, but less precisely estimated, in an instrumental-variables analysis which took into account only the variation in self-reported job demands and job strain that was explained by staffing level. No association between psychosocial factors and sleeping problems was observed with the instrumental-variable analysis. Conclusions: These results support a causal interpretation of high self-reported job demands and job strain being risk factors for employee wellbeing.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Allied Health Personnel", "Female", "Finland", "Geriatric Nursing", "Humans", "Licensed Practical Nurses", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Nurses", "Nurses' Aides", "Occupational Health", "Risk Factors", "Stress, Psychological", "Workload", "Workplace", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84922475960", "SubjectAreas": [["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"7003614400": {"Name": "Elovainio M.", "AuthorID": "7003614400", "AffiliationID": "60002952", "AffiliationName": "Department of Behavioural Sciences, University of Helsinki"}, "6507367189": {"Name": "Heponiemi T.", "AuthorID": "6507367189", "AffiliationID": "60104546", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health and Welfare"}, "36056700500": {"Name": "Kuusio H.", "AuthorID": "36056700500", "AffiliationID": "60104546", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health and Welfare"}, "57193642961": {"Name": "Aalto A.", "AuthorID": "57193642961", "AffiliationID": "60104546", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health and Welfare"}, "35616287000": {"Name": "Pekkarinen L.", "AuthorID": "35616287000", "AffiliationID": "60104546", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health and Welfare"}, "55653537100": {"Name": "Noro A.", "AuthorID": "55653537100", "AffiliationID": "60104546", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health and Welfare"}, "8861771600": {"Name": "Finne-Soveri H.", "AuthorID": "8861771600", "AffiliationID": "60104546", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health and Welfare"}, "57193642390": {"Name": "Sinervo T.", "AuthorID": "57193642390", "AffiliationID": "60104546", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health and Welfare"}, "7004391239": {"Name": "Kivim\u00e5ki M.", "AuthorID": "7004391239", "AffiliationID": "60010493", "AffiliationName": "Finnish Institute of Occupational Health"}, "16030844400": {"Name": "Jokela M.", "AuthorID": "16030844400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}}}
