We have previously shown that np-Au nanotopography reduces astrocyte surface coverage (linked to undesirable gliosis) while maintaining high neuronal coverage in a cortical primary neuron-glia co-culture model as long as 2 weeks in vitro. Here, we investigate the potential influence of secreted soluble factors from cells grown on np-Au leading to the cell type-specific surface coverage on conventional tissue culture plastic. We then test the hypothesis that secretion of factors is responsible for inhibiting astrocyte coverage on np-Au. In order to assess whether factors secreted from cells grown on np-Au surfaces reduced surface coverage by astrocytes, we seeded fresh primary rat neuron-glia co-cultures on conventional polystyrene culture dishes, but maintained the cells in conditioned media from co-cultures grown on np-Au surfaces. After 1 week in vitro, a preferential reduction in astrocyte surface coverage was not observed, suggesting that soluble factors are not playing a role. In contrast, 4 h after cell seeding there were a significant number of non-adhered, yet still viable, cells for the cultures on np-Au surfaces. We hypothesize that the non-adherent cells are mainly astrocytes, because: (i) there was no difference in neuronal cell coverage between np-Au and pl-Au for long culture durations and (ii) neurons are post-mitotic and not expected to increase in number upon attaching to the surface. Overall, the results suggest that the np-Au topography leads to preferential neuronal attachment shortly after cell seeding and limits astrocyte-specific np-Au surface coverage at longer culture durations.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cell attachment", "Cell-material interaction", "Gliosis", "Nanoporous gold", "Nanostructure", "Neuroengineering", "Neuron-glia co-culture", "Soluble factors"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84973126993", "SubjectAreas": [["Modeling and Simulation", "MATH", "2611"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"56108111900": {"Name": "Chapman C.", "AuthorID": "56108111900", "AffiliationID": "60014439", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of California - Davis"}, "57189578374": {"Name": "Chen H.", "AuthorID": "57189578374", "AffiliationID": "60014439", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Biosciences, University of California - Davis"}, "18234252300": {"Name": "Stamou M.", "AuthorID": "18234252300", "AffiliationID": "60025858", "AffiliationName": "Department of Health Sciences and Technology, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) Zurich"}, "6603817217": {"Name": "Lein P.", "AuthorID": "6603817217", "AffiliationID": "60014439", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Biosciences, University of California - Davis"}, "14822522500": {"Name": "Seker E.", "AuthorID": "14822522500", "AffiliationID": "60014439", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California - Davis"}}}
