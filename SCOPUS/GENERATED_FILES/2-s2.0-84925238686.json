These applications rest on the fast and reversible switching between the amorphous and the crystalline phases, which takes place in the nano domain in both the time and the length scales. The fast crystallization is a key feature for the applications of phase change materials. In this work, we have investigated by means of large scale molecular dynamics simulations the crystal growth of the prototypical phase change compound GeTe at the interface between the crystalline and the supercooled liquid reached in the device upon heating the amorphous phase. A neural network interatomic potential, markedly faster with respect to first-principles methods, allowed us to consider high-symmetry crystalline surfaces as well as polycrystalline models that are very close to the actual geometry of the memory devices. We have found that the crystal growth from the interface is dominant at high temperatures while it is competing with homogeneous crystallization in the melt at lower temperatures. The crystal growth velocity markedly depends on the crystallographic plane exposed at the interface, the (100) surface being kinetically dominant with respect to the (111) surface. Polycrystalline interfaces, representative of realistic conditions in phase change memory devices, grow at significantly slower pace because of the presence of grain boundaries.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Atomistic simulations", "Crystal growth velocity", "Crystallographic plane", "First principles method", "Heterogeneous crystallization", "Interatomic potential", "Large-scale molecular dynamics", "Polycrystalline models"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84925238686", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Energy (all)", "ENER", "2100"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"], ["Surfaces, Coatings and Films", "MATE", "2508"]], "AuthorData": {"26536720300": {"Name": "Sosso G.", "AuthorID": "26536720300", "AffiliationID": "60006824", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Informatics, Universit\u00e0 della Svizzera Italiana"}, "35741835600": {"Name": "Salvalaglio M.", "AuthorID": "35741835600", "AffiliationID": "60025858", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Process Engineering, ETH Zurich"}, "57203055296": {"Name": "Parrinello M.", "AuthorID": "57203055296", "AffiliationID": "60006824", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Informatics, Universit\u00e0 della Svizzera Italiana"}, "23988656000": {"Name": "Behler J.", "AuthorID": "23988656000", "AffiliationID": "60005322", "AffiliationName": "Lehrstuhl f\u00fcr Theoretische Chemie, Ruhr-Universit\u00e4t Bochum"}, "7007016049": {"Name": "Bernasconi M.", "AuthorID": "7007016049", "AffiliationID": "60012306", "AffiliationName": "Dipartimento di Scienza Dei Materiali, Universit\u00e0 di Milano-Bicocca"}}}
