Here we investigated the Li isotope composition (\u03b47Li) and Li/Ca ratios of organisms that are abundant in the Phanerozoic record: mollusks (mostly bivalves), echinoderms, and brachiopods. The measured samples include (i) modern calcite and aragonite shells from various species and natural environments (13 mollusk samples, 5 brachiopods and 3 echinoderms), and (ii) shells from mollusks grown under controlled conditions at various temperatures. When possible, the mollusk shell ultrastructure was micro-sampled in order to assess intra-shell heterogeneity. In this paper, we systematically characterize the influence of mineralogy, temperature, and biological processes on the \u03b47Li and Li/Ca of these shells and compare with published data for other taxa (foraminifera and corals). Aragonitic mollusks have the lowest \u03b47Li, ranging from +16 to +22\u2030 echinoderms have constant \u03b47Li of about +24\u2030 brachiopods have \u03b47Li of +25 to +28\u2030 and finally calcitic mollusks have the largest range and highest \u03b47Li values, ranging from +25\u2030 to +40\u2030. Measured brachiopods have similar \u03b47Li compared to inorganic calcite precipitated from seawater (\u03b47Li of +27 to +29\u2030), indicating minimum influence of vital effects, as also observed for other isotope systems and making them a potentially viable proxy of past seawater composition. Calcitic mollusks, on the contrary, are not a good archive for seawater paleo\u2013\u03b47Li because many samples have significantly higher \u03b47Li values than inorganic calcite and display large inter-species variability, which suggests large vital effects. In addition, we observe very large intra-shell variability, in particular for mixed calcite-aragonite shells (over 20\u2030 variability), but also in mono-mineralic shells (up to 12\u2030 variability). Aragonitic bivalves have less variable \u03b47Li (7\u2030 variability) compared to calcitic mollusks, but with significantly lower \u03b47Li compared to inorganic aragonite, indicating the existence of vital effects. Bivalves grown at various temperatures show that temperature has only a minor influence on fractionation of Li isotopes during shell precipitation. Interestingly, we observe a strong correlation (R2 = 0.83) between the Li/Mg ratio in bivalve Mytilus edulis and temperature, with potential implications for paleo-temperature reconstructions. Finally, we observe a negative correlation between the \u03b47Li and both the Li/Ca and Mg/Ca ratio of calcite mollusks, which we relate to biomineralization processes. To explain this correlation, we propose preferential removal of 6Li from the calcification site of calcite mollusks by physiological processes corresponding to the regulation of the amount of Mg in the calcifying medium. We calculate that up to 80% of the initial Li within the calcification site is removed by this process, leading to high \u03b47Li and low Li/Ca in some calcite mollusk specimens. Collectively, these results suggest that Mg (and thus [Li]) is strongly biologically controlled within the calcifying medium of calcite mollusks. Overall, the results of this study show that brachiopods are likely to be suitable targets for future work on the determination of paleo-seawater Li isotope composition\u2014an emerging proxy for past weathering and hydrothermal processes.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Biogenic carbonates", "Biomineralization", "Brachiopods", "Li/Mg ratio", "Lithium isotopes", "Mollusks"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85045543685", "SubjectAreas": [["Geochemistry and Petrology", "EART", "1906"]], "AuthorData": {"56269997300": {"Name": "Dellinger M.", "AuthorID": "56269997300", "AffiliationID": "60022175", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography, Durham University"}, "26538380300": {"Name": "West A.J.", "AuthorID": "26538380300", "AffiliationID": "60029311", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, University of Southern California"}, "6602144510": {"Name": "Corsetti F.A.", "AuthorID": "6602144510", "AffiliationID": "60029311", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, University of Southern California"}, "36091823600": {"Name": "Paris G.", "AuthorID": "36091823600", "AffiliationID": "60026500, 60104289", "AffiliationName": "Centre de Recherches P\u00e9trographiques et G\u00e9ochimiques (CRPG), UMR 7358, CNRS-Universit\u00e9 de Lorraine"}, "7005564625": {"Name": "Adkins J.F.", "AuthorID": "7005564625", "AffiliationID": "60086312, 60031581", "AffiliationName": "Division of Geological and Planetary Sciences, California Institute of Technology"}, "57204707349": {"Name": "Pogge von Strandmann P.A.E.", "AuthorID": "57204707349", "AffiliationID": "60009016, 60162131, 60162128, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "London Geochemistry and Isotope Centre, Institute of Earth and Planetary Sciences, University College London and Birkbeck, University of London"}, "57199578188": {"Name": "Ullmann C.V.", "AuthorID": "57199578188", "AffiliationID": "60026479", "AffiliationName": "University of Exeter, Camborne School of Mines & Environment and Sustainability, Institute, Penryn Campus"}, "7102471083": {"Name": "Eagle R.A.", "AuthorID": "7102471083", "AffiliationID": "60019762, 60105494, 60008134, 60026314, 60019839, 60027310", "AffiliationName": "Universit\u00e9 de Brest, UBO, CNRS, IRD, Ifremer, Institut Universitaire Europ\u00e9en de la Mer, LEMAR"}, "7102269605": {"Name": "Freitas P.", "AuthorID": "7102269605", "AffiliationID": "60011373", "AffiliationName": "Danish Shellfish Centre, National Institute of Aquatic Resources, Danish Technical University, DK-7900, Nyk\u00f8bing Mors"}, "26324770300": {"Name": "Bagard M.L.", "AuthorID": "26324770300", "AffiliationID": "60029689, 60004967, 60008134", "AffiliationName": "Institut des Sciences de la Terre d'Orl\u00e9ans (ISTO), UMR 7327, CNRS, Universit\u00e9 d'Orl\u00e9ans, BRGM"}, "7006449529": {"Name": "Ries J.B.", "AuthorID": "7006449529", "AffiliationID": "60028628", "AffiliationName": "Department of Marine and Environmental Sciences, Marine Science Center, Northeastern University"}, "15842257900": {"Name": "Perez-Huerta A.", "AuthorID": "15842257900", "AffiliationID": "60025371", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geological Sciences, The University of Alabama"}, "7004411943": {"Name": "Kampf A.R.", "AuthorID": "7004411943", "AffiliationID": "60022238", "AffiliationName": "Mineral Sciences Department, Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County"}}}
