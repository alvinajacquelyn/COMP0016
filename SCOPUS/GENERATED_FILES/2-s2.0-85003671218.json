We studied 3698 women from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) who participated in a two-phase prevalence study of lifetime ED and had genotype data. The GG rs53576 genotype was associated with binge eating and purging, and the rs2254298 AG/AA genotype with restrictive eating lifetime. In addition, the rs2254298 AG/AA genotype interacted with poor maternal care to increase the odds of binge eating and purging (odds ratio = 4.40 (95% confidence intervals: 1.11\u201317.4)). This study replicates previous findings of an association between OXT-R polymorphisms and ED, and it is the first to show an interaction between OXT-R genotype and poor maternal care. As such, these findings highlight the important role of oxytocin in understanding the pathophysiology of ED. \u00a9 2016 The Authors European Eating Disorders Review published by Eating Disorders Association and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.", "AuthorKeywords": ["ALSPAC", "eating disorders", "gene\u2013environment interaction", "oxytocin"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Child", "Feeding and Eating Disorders", "Female", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Genotype", "Humans", "Longitudinal Studies", "Maternal Behavior", "Polymorphism, Genetic", "Receptors, Oxytocin", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85003671218", "SubjectAreas": [["Clinical Psychology", "PSYC", "3203"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"16031429800": {"Name": "Micali N.", "AuthorID": "16031429800", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "23968557100": {"Name": "Crous-Bou M.", "AuthorID": "23968557100", "AffiliationID": "60032499", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology, Harvard T.
