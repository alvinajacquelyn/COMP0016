Missing data in a clinical trial has the potential to impact severely on study quality and precision of estimates. In studies which use a cross-over design, even a small number of missing values can lead to the eventual design being disconnected. In this case, some or all of the treatment contrasts under test cannot be estimated and the experiment is compromised since little can be achieved from it. Experiments comparing two treatments that use a cross-over design with more than two experimental periods are considered. Methods to limit the impact of missing data on study results are explored. It is shown that the breakdown number and, if it exists, perpetual connectivity of the planned design are useful robustness properties which guard against the possibility of a disconnected eventual design. A procedure is proposed which assesses planned designs for robustness against missing values and the method is illustrated by assessing several designs that have been previously considered on cross-over studies.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Breakdown number", "Clinical trial", "Cross-over design", "Perpetually connected", "Subject drop-out"], "IndexKeywords": ["Breakdown number", "Clinical trial", "Cross over", "Drop-out", "Perpetually connected"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85050268508", "SubjectAreas": [["Statistics and Probability", "MATH", "2613"], ["Computational Mathematics", "MATH", "2605"], ["Computational Theory and Mathematics", "COMP", "1703"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"57193163196": {"Name": "Godolphin P.", "AuthorID": "57193163196", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "Stroke Trials Unit, Division of Clinical Neuroscience, University of Nottingham"}, "8554439300": {"Name": "Godolphin E.", "AuthorID": "8554439300", "AffiliationID": "60020595", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, Royal Holloway University of London"}}}
