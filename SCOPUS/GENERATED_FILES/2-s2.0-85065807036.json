Disruption of these events can cause long-term changes in cortical inhibition and may be involved in neurological disorders associated with inhibitory circuit dysfunction. We hypothesized that tonic glutamate signaling in the neonatal cortex contributes to, and is necessary for, the maturation of cortical interneurons. To test this hypothesis, we used mice of both sexes to quantify extracellular glutamate concentrations in the cortex during development, measure ambient glutamate-mediated activation of developing cortical interneurons, and manipulate tonic glutamate signaling using subtype-specific NMDA receptor antagonists in vitro and in vivo. We report that ambient glutamate levels are high (\u2248100 nm) in the neonatal cortex and decrease (to \u224850 nm) during the first weeks of life, coincident with increases in astrocytic glutamate uptake. Consistent with elevated ambient glutamate, putative parvalbumin-positive interneurons in the cortex (identified using G42:GAD1-eGFP reporter mice) exhibit a transient, tonic NMDA current at the end of the first postnatal week. GluN2C/GluN2D-containing NMDA receptors mediate the majority of this current and contribute to the resting membrane potential and intrinsic properties of developing putative parvalbumin interneurons. Pharmacological blockade of GluN2C/GluN2D-containing NMDA receptors in vivo during the period of tonic interneuron activation, but not later, leads to lasting decreases in interneuron morphological complexity and causes deficits in cortical inhibition later in life. These results demonstrate that dynamic ambient glutamate signaling contributes to cortical interneuron maturation via tonic activation of GluN2C/GluN2D-containing NMDA receptors.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Ambient glutamate", "Cortex", "Cortical interneuron", "Developmental", "Inhibition", "NMDA receptor"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Animals, Newborn", "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug", "Excitatory Amino Acid Antagonists", "Extracellular Fluid", "Female", "Glutamic Acid", "Interneurons", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Mice, Transgenic", "Organ Culture Techniques", "Receptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate", "Sensorimotor Cortex"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85065807036", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"]], "AuthorData": {"57208822833": {"Name": "Hanson E.", "AuthorID": "57208822833", "AffiliationID": "60023143", "AffiliationName": "Tufts Sackler School of Biomedical Sciences"}, "56530392800": {"Name": "Armbruster M.", "AuthorID": "56530392800", "AffiliationID": "60023143", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Tufts University, School of Medicine"}, "57192644335": {"Name": "Lau L.A.", "AuthorID": "57192644335", "AffiliationID": "60023143", "AffiliationName": "Tufts Sackler School of Biomedical Sciences"}, "57208789801": {"Name": "Sommer M.E.", "AuthorID": "57208789801", "AffiliationID": "60023143", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Tufts University, School of Medicine"}, "53880006300": {"Name": "Klaft Z.J.", "AuthorID": "53880006300", "AffiliationID": "60023143", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Tufts University, School of Medicine"}, "7402067232": {"Name": "Moss S.J.", "AuthorID": "7402067232", "AffiliationID": "60015849, 60004219", "AffiliationName": "AstraZeneca Tufts Laboratory for Basic and Translational Neuroscience, Tufts University School of Medicine"}, "8277739200": {"Name": "Dulla C.G.", "AuthorID": "8277739200", "AffiliationID": "60023143", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Tufts University, School of Medicine"}, "54885576600": {"Name": "Swanger S.A.", "AuthorID": "54885576600", "AffiliationID": "60002339", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacology, Emory University School of Medicine"}, "7004038241": {"Name": "Traynelis S.F.", "AuthorID": "7004038241", "AffiliationID": "60002339", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacology, Emory University School of Medicine"}, "57193441226": {"Name": "Chadchankar J.", "AuthorID": "57193441226", "AffiliationID": "60015849, 60004219", "AffiliationName": "AstraZeneca Tufts Laboratory for Basic and Translational Neuroscience, Tufts University School of Medicine"}, "7801418327": {"Name": "Noubary F.", "AuthorID": "7801418327", "AffiliationID": "60028628", "AffiliationName": "Department of Health Sciences, Bouv\u00e9 College of Health Sciences, Northeastern University"}}}
