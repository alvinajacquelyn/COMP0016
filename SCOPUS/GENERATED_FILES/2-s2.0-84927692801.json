This network includes medial prefrontal and medial parietal/posterior cingulate cortices, where transcranial magnetic stimulation may transiently impair self-awareness. Conversely, we hypothesize that dopaminergic stimulation may improve self-awareness and metacognition (i.e., the ability of the brain to consciously monitor its own cognitive processes). Here, we demonstrate improved noetic (conscious) metacognition by oral administration of 100 mg dopamine in minimal self-awareness. In a separate experiment with extended self-awareness dopamine improved the retrieval accuracy of memories of self-judgment (autonoetic, i.e., explicitly self-conscious) metacognition. Concomitantly, magnetoencephalography (MEG) showed increased amplitudes of oscillations (power) preferentially in the medial prefrontal cortex. Given that electromagnetic activity in this region is instrumental in self-awareness, this explains the specific effect of dopamine on explicit self-awareness and autonoetic metacognition.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Default mode", "Dopamine", "Medial prefrontal", "Metacognition", "Self-awareness"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Awareness", "Brain Waves", "Carbidopa", "Consciousness", "Dopamine", "Dopamine Agonists", "Double-Blind Method", "Drug Combinations", "Humans", "Judgment", "Levodopa", "Magnetoencephalography", "Male", "Metacognition", "Neuropsychological Tests", "Prefrontal Cortex", "Self Concept", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84927692801", "SubjectAreas": [["Anatomy", "MEDI", "2702"], ["Radiological and Ultrasound Technology", "HEAL", "3614"], ["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"], ["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"37161529500": {"Name": "Joensson M.", "AuthorID": "37161529500", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, University of Oxford"}, "35079287100": {"Name": "Thomsen K.", "AuthorID": "35079287100", "AffiliationID": "60029616", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Alcohol and Drug Research, Aarhus University"}, "56804363900": {"Name": "Andersen L.", "AuthorID": "56804363900", "AffiliationID": "60029616", "AffiliationName": "Cognitive Neurosciences Research Unit (CNRU), Hammel Neurorehabilitation Centre and University Research Clinic, Aarhus University"}, "12769803800": {"Name": "Mouridsen K.", "AuthorID": "12769803800", "AffiliationID": "60029616", "AffiliationName": "Center of Functionally Integrative Neuroscience, Aarhus University"}, "24172285600": {"Name": "Sandberg K.", "AuthorID": "24172285600", "AffiliationID": "60109771, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, University College London"}, "7006084217": {"Name": "\u00d8stergaard L.", "AuthorID": "7006084217", "AffiliationID": "60029616", "AffiliationName": "Center of Functionally Integrative Neuroscience, Aarhus University"}, "57189946078": {"Name": "Lou H.", "AuthorID": "57189946078", "AffiliationID": "60029616", "AffiliationName": "Center of Functionally Integrative Neuroscience, Aarhus University"}, "7402752222": {"Name": "Gross J.", "AuthorID": "7402752222", "AffiliationID": "60001490", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cognitive Neuroimaging, University of Glasgow"}}}
