Given diet's role in modulating inflammatory processes, excessive calorie-dense, nutrient-deficient processed food intake may contribute toward the heightened inflammation observed in SMI. This review assesses the evidence from observational and experimental studies to investigate how diet may affect physical and mental health outcomes in SMI through inflammation-related pathways. Cross-sectional studies indicate that individuals with SMI, particularly schizophrenia, consume more pro-inflammatory foods and fewer anti-inflammatory nutrients than the general population. Cohort studies indicate that high levels of dietary inflammation are associated with increased risk of developing depression, but there is currently a lack of evidence for schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. Randomized controlled trials show that dietary interventions improve symptoms of depression, but none have tested the extent to which these benefits are due to changes in inflammation. This review summarizes evidence on dietary inflammation in SMI, explores the directionality of these links, and discusses the potential use of targeted nutritional interventions for improving psychological well-being and physical health outcomes in SMI. Establishing the extent to which diet explains elevated levels of inflammatory markers observed in SMI is a priority for future research.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bipolar disorder", "Nutrients", "Nutrition", "Schizophrenia", "Vitamin"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85068227860", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"56503241000": {"Name": "Firth J.", "AuthorID": "56503241000", "AffiliationID": "60172345", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychology and Mental Health, Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, University of Manchester"}, "23496357400": {"Name": "Ee C.", "AuthorID": "23496357400", "AffiliationID": "60101528, 60017803", "AffiliationName": "NICM Health Research Institute, Western Sydney University"}, "13003478000": {"Name": "Sarris J.", "AuthorID": "13003478000", "AffiliationID": "60026553", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, University of Melbourne, Melbourne Clinic Professorial Unit"}, "36998781200": {"Name": "Veronese N.", "AuthorID": "36998781200", "AffiliationID": "60021199", "AffiliationName": "Aging Branch, Neuroscience Institute, National Research Council"}, "55999264400": {"Name": "Cotter J.", "AuthorID": "55999264400", "AffiliationID": "60112882", "AffiliationName": "Cambridge Cognition"}, "55177729700": {"Name": "Shivappa N.", "AuthorID": "55177729700", "AffiliationID": "116083226", "AffiliationName": "Connecting Health Innovations LLC"}, "7201723342": {"Name": "Hebert J.R.", "AuthorID": "7201723342", "AffiliationID": "116083226", "AffiliationName": "Connecting Health Innovations LLC"}, "37117793800": {"Name": "Smith L.", "AuthorID": "37117793800", "AffiliationID": "60000913", "AffiliationName": "Cambridge Centre for Sport and Exercise Sciences, Anglia Ruskin University"}, "57204891343": {"Name": "Stubbs B.", "AuthorID": "57204891343", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Health Service and Population Research Department, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London"}, "57196323380": {"Name": "Jackson S.E.", "AuthorID": "57196323380", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Behavioural Science and Health, University College London"}}}
