KGaA, WeinheimIn this work an improved stable isotope labeling protocol for nucleic acids is introduced. The novel building blocks eliminate/minimize homonuclear13C and1H scalar couplings thus allowing proton relaxation dispersion (RD) experiments to report accurately on the chemical exchange of nucleic acids. Using site-specific2H and13C labeling, spin topologies are introduced into DNA and RNA that make1H relaxation dispersion experiments applicable in a straightforward manner. The novel RNA/DNA building blocks were successfully incorporated into two nucleic acids. The A-site RNA was previously shown to undergo a two site exchange process in the micro- to millisecond time regime. Using proton relaxation dispersion experiments the exchange parameters determined earlier could be recapitulated, thus validating the proposed approach. We further investigated the dynamics of the cTAR DNA, a DNA transcript that is involved in the viral replication cycle of HIV-1. Again, an exchange process could be characterized and quantified. This shows the general applicablility of the novel labeling scheme for1H RD experiments of nucleic acids.", "AuthorKeywords": ["DNA", "NMR spectroscopy", "proton relaxation dispersion", "RNA", "stable isotope labeling"], "IndexKeywords": ["Building blockes", "Chemical exchange", "Exchange parameters", "Proton relaxation", "Relaxation dispersion", "Stable-isotope labeling", "Two-site exchange process", "Viral replication", "Base Sequence", "DNA", "Isotope Labeling", "Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, Biomolecular", "Nucleic Acid Conformation", "Protons", "RNA"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84994423033", "SubjectAreas": [["Catalysis", "CENG", "1503"], ["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"]], "AuthorData": {"56716322500": {"Name": "Juen M.A.", "AuthorID": "56716322500", "AffiliationID": "60009999", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Organic Chemistry and Center for Molecular Biosciences Innsbruck (CMBI), University of Innsbruck"}, "57191876954": {"Name": "Nu\u00dfbaumer F.", "AuthorID": "57191876954", "AffiliationID": "60009999", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Organic Chemistry and Center for Molecular Biosciences Innsbruck (CMBI), University of Innsbruck"}, "6602596737": {"Name": "Tollinger M.", "AuthorID": "6602596737", "AffiliationID": "60009999", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Organic Chemistry and Center for Molecular Biosciences Innsbruck (CMBI), University of Innsbruck"}, "8538975100": {"Name": "Kreutz C.", "AuthorID": "8538975100", "AffiliationID": "60009999", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Organic Chemistry and Center for Molecular Biosciences Innsbruck (CMBI), University of Innsbruck"}, "57033845700": {"Name": "Wunderlich C.H.", "AuthorID": "57033845700", "AffiliationID": "100522453", "AffiliationName": "Bachem Americas, Inc."}, "6603733184": {"Name": "Kontaxis G.", "AuthorID": "6603733184", "AffiliationID": "60025988, 60018597", "AffiliationName": "Computational Biology and Biomolecular NMR, Max F.
