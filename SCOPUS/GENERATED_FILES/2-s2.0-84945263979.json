CaP1 crystallizes in the monoclinic C2/c space group, with three water molecules occupying a half coordination sphere on one side of the Ca atom, while CaP2 crystallizes in the triclinic P1\u00af space group, with two crystallographic unique Ca atoms, each coordinated by a single water molecule. In contrast with CaP2, which exhibits very low bioactivity, CaP1 readily precipitates bone-precursor phases (octacalcium phosphate, OCP, and hydroxyapatite) in SBF solutions. Moreover, studies with MG63 osteoblast-like cells indicate that CaP1 is not toxic and stimulates bone mineralization and, thus, holds considerable potential for treating bone diseases, such as osteoporosis.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Bone Diseases", "Calcium Phosphates", "Cell Line, Tumor", "Cell Survival", "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug", "Humans", "Structure-Activity Relationship"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84945263979", "SubjectAreas": [["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"], ["Inorganic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1604"]], "AuthorData": {"8092587000": {"Name": "Shi F.N.", "AuthorID": "8092587000", "AffiliationID": "60013980, 60024825", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, CICECO-Aveiro Institute of Materials, University of Aveiro"}, "7202074281": {"Name": "Rocha J.", "AuthorID": "7202074281", "AffiliationID": "60013980, 60024825", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, CICECO-Aveiro Institute of Materials, University of Aveiro"}, "57217145328": {"Name": "Almeida J.C.", "AuthorID": "57217145328", "AffiliationID": "60013980, 60024825", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials and Ceramic Engineering, CICECO-Aveiro Institute of Materials, University of Aveiro"}, "35580041400": {"Name": "Fernandes M.H.V.", "AuthorID": "35580041400", "AffiliationID": "60013980, 60024825", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials and Ceramic Engineering, CICECO-Aveiro Institute of Materials, University of Aveiro"}, "6506608753": {"Name": "Helguero L.A.", "AuthorID": "6506608753", "AffiliationID": "60024825", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Research in Biomedicine-iBiMED, Health Sciences Program, University of Aveiro"}, "26643634100": {"Name": "Knowles J.C.", "AuthorID": "26643634100", "AffiliationID": "60013985, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Biomaterials and Tissue Engineering, UCL Eastman Dental Institute, University College London"}}}
