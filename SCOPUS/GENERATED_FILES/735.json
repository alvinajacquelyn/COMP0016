The high quantity of ash and volatile material in RDF can provide a decrease in thermal output, create high ash clinkering, and increase emission of tars and CO2, thus affecting the operability for clean syngas generation at industrial scale. By contrast, a two-stage process which separates primary gasification and selective tar and ash conversion would be inherently more forgiving and stable. This can be achieved with the use of a separate plasma converter, which has been successfully used in conjunction with conventional thermal treatment units, for the ability to 'polish' the producer gas by organic contaminants and collect the inorganic fraction in a molten (and inert) state. This research focused on the performance analysis of a two-stage fluid bed gasification-plasma process to transform solid waste into clean syngas. Thermodynamic assessment using the two-stage equilibrium method was carried out to determine optimum conditions for the gasification of RDF and to understand the limitations and influence of the second stage on the process performance (gas heating value, cold gas efficiency, carbon conversion efficiency), along with other parameters. Comparison with a different thermal refining stage, i.e. thermal cracking (via partial oxidation) was also performed. The analysis is supported by experimental data from a pilot plant.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Conversion efficiency", "Fluidized bed", "Gasification", "Plasma", "RDF"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cold gas efficiency", "Fluid bed gasification", "Fluidized bed gasifiers", "Performance analysis", "RDF", "Thermal treatment units", "Thermodynamic assessment", "Two stage equilibrium", "Bioreactors", "Gases", "Refuse Disposal", "Solid Waste", "Thermodynamics"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84954027076", "SubjectAreas": [["Waste Management and Disposal", "ENVI", "2311"]], "AuthorData": {"55623473200": {"Name": "Materazzi M.", "AuthorID": "55623473200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "56196096800": {"Name": "Taylor R.", "AuthorID": "56196096800", "AffiliationID": "60112883", "AffiliationName": "Advanced Plasma Power Ltd."}, "7403167306": {"Name": "Chapman C.", "AuthorID": "7403167306", "AffiliationID": "60112883", "AffiliationName": "Advanced Plasma Power Ltd."}, "35572355100": {"Name": "Lettieri P.", "AuthorID": "35572355100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
