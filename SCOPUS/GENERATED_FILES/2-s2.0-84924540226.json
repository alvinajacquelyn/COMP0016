We investigated associations between gestational weight gain (GWG) and birth weight along the entire birth weight distribution with quantile regression and estimated effects of hypothetical prevention strategies. Methods: The GWG-birth weight association was analyzed using quantile and classical regression models on data from a population-based gestational diabetes screening (. n=4760) at the Szent Imre Teaching Hospital in Budapest, Hungary (2002-2005). Birth weight distributions were modeled based on hypothetical GWG changes. Results: At a body mass index of 20kg/m2, a 1-kg difference in GWG was associated with a 14.2g (95% confidence interval, 10.0-20.9) higher birth weight at the fifth percentile of the birth weight distribution and a 29.0g (21.3-35.6) higher birth weight at the 95th percentile. The coefficient from linear regression was 20.7 (17.5-24.0). Estimates differed modestly between the two regressions at a body mass index of 30kg/m2. A population-wide 2-kg decrease in GWG would rather affect the risk of macrosomia (-1.8%) than that of low birth weight (+0.4%). In contrast, a 3-kg decrease in GWG among overweight and obese women would lower macrosomia more modestly (-0.8%). Conclusions: A population-wide lowering of GWG would lead to greater improvements in the right tail of the birth weight distribution.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Birth weight", "Body mass index", "Prevention", "Quantile regression", "Weight gain"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Birth Weight", "Body Mass Index", "Diabetes, Gestational", "Female", "Health Behavior", "Humans", "Hungary", "Infant, Newborn", "Pregnancy", "Regression Analysis", "Weight Gain"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84924540226", "SubjectAreas": [["Epidemiology", "MEDI", "2713"]], "AuthorData": {"55450518100": {"Name": "Hulm\u00e1n A.", "AuthorID": "55450518100", "AffiliationID": "60027332", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Medical Informatics, University of Szeged"}, "7004615724": {"Name": "Ny\u00e1ri T.", "AuthorID": "7004615724", "AffiliationID": "60027332", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Medical Informatics, University of Szeged"}, "57197805045": {"Name": "Witte D.", "AuthorID": "57197805045", "AffiliationID": "60072560", "AffiliationName": "Centre de Recherche Public de la Sant\u00e9"}, "7004062222": {"Name": "Ker\u00e9nyi Z.", "AuthorID": "7004062222", "AffiliationID": "115049429", "AffiliationName": "Diabetes Outpatient Clinic, T\u00f3th Ilona Health Service"}, "26433564400": {"Name": "Madar\u00e1sz E.", "AuthorID": "26433564400", "AffiliationID": "115049429", "AffiliationName": "Diabetes Outpatient Clinic, T\u00f3th Ilona Health Service"}, "35192307500": {"Name": "P\u00e9terfalvi A.", "AuthorID": "35192307500", "AffiliationID": "115049429", "AffiliationName": "Diabetes Outpatient Clinic, T\u00f3th Ilona Health Service"}, "56545617700": {"Name": "T\u00e4nczer T.", "AuthorID": "56545617700", "AffiliationID": "60024812", "AffiliationName": "1 Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Semmelweis University"}, "7801666836": {"Name": "Ferencz V.", "AuthorID": "7801666836", "AffiliationID": "60024812", "AffiliationName": "1 Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Semmelweis University"}, "7003480687": {"Name": "Tab\u00e1k A.", "AuthorID": "7003480687", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "6506720588": {"Name": "Bosny\u00e1k Z.", "AuthorID": "6506720588", "AffiliationID": "107653825", "AffiliationName": "Ferencv\u00e1ros Health Service"}, "56545203600": {"Name": "Szab\u00f3 E.", "AuthorID": "56545203600", "AffiliationID": "60068488", "AffiliationName": "Szent Imre Teaching Hospital"}}}
