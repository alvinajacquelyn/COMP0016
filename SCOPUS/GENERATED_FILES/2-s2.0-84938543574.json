Imaging of cerebral vascular reactivity (CVR) is a powerful tool to investigate vascular health in clinical populations although the cause of reduced CVR in AD patients is not fully understood. We investigated the specific role of tau pathology in CVR derangement in AD using the rTg4510 mouse model. We observed an increase in CVR in cortical regions with tau pathology. These data suggest that tau pathology alone does not produce the clinically observed decreases in CVR and implicates amyloid pathology as the dominant etiology of impaired CVR in AD patients.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alzheimer's", "arterial spin labelling", "cerebral vascular reactivity", "MRI", "tau"], "IndexKeywords": ["Alzheimer Disease", "Animals", "Brain", "Cerebrovascular Circulation", "Disease Models, Animal", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Mice", "Mice, Transgenic", "Spin Labels", "tau Proteins"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84938543574", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Obstetrics and Gynecology", "MEDI", "2729"]], "AuthorData": {"35220662900": {"Name": "Wells J.", "AuthorID": "35220662900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Centre for Advanced Biomedical Imaging, Division of Medicine, University College London, Paul o'Gorman Building"}, "56154918600": {"Name": "Holmes H.", "AuthorID": "56154918600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Centre for Advanced Biomedical Imaging, Division of Medicine, University College London, Paul o'Gorman Building"}, "56160211800": {"Name": "O'Callaghan J.", "AuthorID": "56160211800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Centre for Advanced Biomedical Imaging, Division of Medicine, University College London, Paul o'Gorman Building"}, "36191733400": {"Name": "Colgan N.", "AuthorID": "36191733400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Centre for Advanced Biomedical Imaging, Division of Medicine, University College London, Paul o'Gorman Building"}, "56448541700": {"Name": "Ismail O.", "AuthorID": "56448541700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Centre for Advanced Biomedical Imaging, Division of Medicine, University College London, Paul o'Gorman Building"}, "36088022100": {"Name": "Siow B.", "AuthorID": "36088022100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Centre for Advanced Biomedical Imaging, Division of Medicine, University College London, Paul o'Gorman Building"}, "7004107686": {"Name": "Lythgoe M.", "AuthorID": "7004107686", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Centre for Advanced Biomedical Imaging, Division of Medicine, University College London, Paul o'Gorman Building"}, "57203069236": {"Name": "Fisher E.", "AuthorID": "57203069236", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, Institute of Neurology, UCL"}, "7401956361": {"Name": "Murray T.", "AuthorID": "7401956361", "AffiliationID": "60025685", "AffiliationName": "Eli Lilly and Co.
