Methods: We tested the association between blood genome-wide DNAm profiles using the Illumina 450K arrays, cognitive dysfunction and brain MRI measures in selected participants of the Whitehall II imaging sub-study. Results: Eight differentially methylated regions were associated with cognitive impairment. Accelerated aging based on the Hannum epigenetic clock was associated with mean diffusivity and global fractional anisotropy. We also identified modules of co-methylated loci associated with white matter hyperintensities. These co-methylation modules were enriched among pathways relevant to \u03b2-amyloid processing and glutamatergic signaling. Conclusion: Our data support the notion that blood DNAm changes may have utility as a biomarker for cognitive dysfunction and brain aging.", "AuthorKeywords": ["brain aging", "DNA methylation", "epigenetic clock", "MCI", "mild cognitive impairment", "MRI", "peripheral biomarker"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aging, Premature", "Biomarkers", "Brain", "Cognitive Aging", "Cognitive Dysfunction", "DNA", "DNA Methylation", "Epigenesis, Genetic", "Functional Neuroimaging", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Pilot Projects"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85047125932", "SubjectAreas": [["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Cancer Research", "BIOC", "1306"]], "AuthorData": {"35361764500": {"Name": "Chouliaras L.", "AuthorID": "35361764500", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, University of Cambridge"}, "12769331900": {"Name": "Haapakoski R.", "AuthorID": "12769331900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "23989895900": {"Name": "Zsoldos E.", "AuthorID": "23989895900", "AffiliationID": "60000940, 60002634", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, Warneford Hospital, University of Oxford"}, "56128285900": {"Name": "Mahmood A.", "AuthorID": "56128285900", "AffiliationID": "60000940, 60002634", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, Warneford Hospital, University of Oxford"}, "26221643100": {"Name": "Filippini N.", "AuthorID": "26221643100", "AffiliationID": "60000940, 60002634", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, Warneford Hospital, University of Oxford"}, "7004932147": {"Name": "Ebmeier K.P.", "AuthorID": "7004932147", "AffiliationID": "60000940, 60002634", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, Warneford Hospital, University of Oxford"}, "35171140700": {"Name": "Pishva E.", "AuthorID": "35171140700", "AffiliationID": "60018869", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry and Neuropsychology, School for Mental Health and Neuroscience (MHeNS), Maastricht University"}, "56740866500": {"Name": "Burrage J.", "AuthorID": "56740866500", "AffiliationID": "60111707, 60026479", "AffiliationName": "University of Exeter Medical School, RILD, University of Exeter"}, "57219048880": {"Name": "Mill J.", "AuthorID": "57219048880", "AffiliationID": "60111707, 60026479", "AffiliationName": "University of Exeter Medical School, RILD, University of Exeter"}, "8854048100": {"Name": "Lunnon K.", "AuthorID": "8854048100", "AffiliationID": "60111707, 60026479", "AffiliationName": "University of Exeter Medical School, RILD, University of Exeter"}, "7004391239": {"Name": "Kivim\u00e4ki M.", "AuthorID": "7004391239", "AffiliationID": "60029080, 60002952", "AffiliationName": "Clinicum, Faculty of Medicine, University of Helsinki"}}}
