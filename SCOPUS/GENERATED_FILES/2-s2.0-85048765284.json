Life changes in terms of voice are different for females and males and this paper concentrates on the female singing voice in the context of choral singing. Case-study data from three choristers are presented relating to the changing female voice during puberty as part of a longitudinal study of female choristers in a major English Cathedral Choir School. In addition, discussion is presented on important considerations with respect to the female choral singing voice with a particular focus on specific choral aspects during rehearsals and performance.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Choral", "Chorister", "Girls", "Performance", "Singing"], "IndexKeywords": ["Acoustics", "Adolescent", "Adolescent Development", "Age Factors", "Child", "Child Development", "Female", "Humans", "Puberty", "Sex Factors", "Singing", "Sound Spectrography", "Voice Quality"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85048765284", "SubjectAreas": [["Otorhinolaryngology", "MEDI", "2733"], ["Speech and Hearing", "HEAL", "3616"], ["LPN and LVN", "NURS", "2912"]], "AuthorData": {"7202304897": {"Name": "Howard D.M.", "AuthorID": "7202304897", "AffiliationID": "60020595", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic Engineering, Royal Holloway, University of London"}, "7102907357": {"Name": "Welch G.F.", "AuthorID": "7102907357", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Education, University College London"}, "15757410400": {"Name": "Himonides E.", "AuthorID": "15757410400", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Education, University College London"}, "57202573285": {"Name": "Owens M.", "AuthorID": "57202573285", "AffiliationID": "108327559", "AffiliationName": "Wells Cathedral"}}}
