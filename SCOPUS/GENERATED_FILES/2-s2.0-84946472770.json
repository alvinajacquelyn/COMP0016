The impact of obesity on infection risk in ESLD is not established. Aim To characterise the impact of obesity on infection risk in ESLD. Methods We evaluated the association between infection and obesity in patients with ESLD. Patients grouped as non-obese, obesity class I-II and obesity class III were studied using the Nationwide Inpatient Sample. Validated diagnostic code based algorithms were utilised to determine weight category and infections, including bacteraemia, skin/soft tissue infection, urinary tract infection (UTI), pneumonia/respiratory infection, Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). Risk factors for infection and mortality were assessed using multivariable logistic regression analysis. Results Of 115 465 patients identified, 100 957 (87.5%) were non-obese and 14 508 (12.5%) were obese, with 9489 (8.2%) as obesity class I-II and 5019 (4.3%) as obesity class III. 37 117 patients (32.1%) had an infection diagnosis. Infection was most prevalent among obesity class III (44.0%), followed by obesity class I-II (38.9%) and then non-obese (31.9%). In multivariable modelling, class III obesity (OR = 1.41; 95% CI 1.32-1.51; P < 0.001), and class I-II obesity (OR = 1.08; 95% CI 1.01-1.15; P = 0.026) were associated with infection. Compared to non-obese patients, obese individuals had greater prevalence of bacteraemia, UTI, and skin/soft tissue infection as compared to non-obese patients. Conclusions Obesity is newly identified to be independently associated with infection in end-stage liver disease. The distribution of infection sites varies based on weight category.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Bacterial Infections", "Clostridium Infections", "Databases, Factual", "End Stage Liver Disease", "Female", "Humans", "Inpatients", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Obesity", "Pneumonia", "Prevalence", "Risk Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84946472770", "SubjectAreas": [["Hepatology", "MEDI", "2721"], ["Gastroenterology", "MEDI", "2715"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"56187283400": {"Name": "Sundaram V.", "AuthorID": "56187283400", "AffiliationID": "60016173", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center"}, "7404227560": {"Name": "Lu S.", "AuthorID": "7404227560", "AffiliationID": "60016173", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center"}, "7202887523": {"Name": "Tran T.", "AuthorID": "7202887523", "AffiliationID": "60016173", "AffiliationName": "Division of Gastroenterology, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center"}, "56347834700": {"Name": "Kaung A.", "AuthorID": "56347834700", "AffiliationID": "60016173", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center"}, "56900998000": {"Name": "Rajaram A.", "AuthorID": "56900998000", "AffiliationID": "60006462", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Touro College of Osteopathic Medicine"}, "7006186822": {"Name": "Nissen N.", "AuthorID": "7006186822", "AffiliationID": "60016173", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery, Comprehensive Transplant Center, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center"}, "7402143399": {"Name": "Klein A.", "AuthorID": "7402143399", "AffiliationID": "60016173", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery, Comprehensive Transplant Center, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center"}, "7005505892": {"Name": "Jalan R.", "AuthorID": "7005505892", "AffiliationID": "60029950", "AffiliationName": "Liver Failure Group, Institute for Liver and Digestive Health, UCL Medical School"}, "55877473200": {"Name": "Charlton M.", "AuthorID": "55877473200", "AffiliationID": "60101963", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Intermountain Medical Center"}, "16028261100": {"Name": "Jeon C.", "AuthorID": "16028261100", "AffiliationID": "60016173", "AffiliationName": "Samuel Oschin Comprehensive Cancer Institute, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center"}}}
