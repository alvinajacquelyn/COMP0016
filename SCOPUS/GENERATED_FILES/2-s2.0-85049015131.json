The MARVEL procedure is used to compute empirical rovibronic energy levels for BeH, BeD and BeT, using experimental transition data for the X 2\u03a3+, A 2P, and C 2\u03a3+ states. The energy levels from these calculations are then used in the program Duo to produce a potential energy curve for the ground state, X 2S, and to fit an improved potential energy curve for the first excited state, A 2P, including a spin-orbit coupling term, a \u03bb-doubling state to state (A-X states) coupling term, and Born-Oppenheimer breakdown terms for both curves. These, along with a previously computed ab initio dipole curve for the X and A states are used to generate vibrational-rotational wavefunctions, transition energies and A-values. From the transition energies and Einstein coefficients, accurate assigned synthetic spectra for BeH and its isotopologues are obtained at given rotational and vibrational temperatures. The BeH spectrum is compared with a high resolution hollow-cathode lamp spectrum and the BeD spectrum with high resolution spectra from JET giving effective vibrational and rotational temperatures. Full A-X and X-X line lists are given for BeH, BeD and BeT and provided as supplementary data on the ExoMol website.", "AuthorKeywords": ["beryllium monohydride", "emission spectrum", "Fusion"], "IndexKeywords": ["Born-oppenheimer breakdown", "Einstein coefficients", "Emission spectrums", "High-resolution spectra", "Potential energy curves", "Rotational temperature", "Theoretical modeling", "Vibrational temperature"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85049015131", "SubjectAreas": [["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"]], "AuthorData": {"57194267646": {"Name": "Darby-Lewis D.", "AuthorID": "57194267646", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "7101645601": {"Name": "Tennyson J.", "AuthorID": "7101645601", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "35605893200": {"Name": "Yurchenko S.N.", "AuthorID": "35605893200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "7103032460": {"Name": "Lawson K.D.", "AuthorID": "7103032460", "AffiliationID": "60033317, 60004643", "AffiliationName": "UKAEA/CCFE, Culham Science Centre"}, "7005377624": {"Name": "Stamp M.F.", "AuthorID": "7005377624", "AffiliationID": "60033317, 60004643", "AffiliationName": "UKAEA/CCFE, Culham Science Centre"}, "57203543238": {"Name": "Shaw A.", "AuthorID": "57203543238", "AffiliationID": "60033317, 60004643", "AffiliationName": "UKAEA/CCFE, Culham Science Centre"}, "6603110179": {"Name": "Brezinsek S.", "AuthorID": "6603110179", "AffiliationID": "60007774", "AffiliationName": "Institut f\u00fcr Energie und Klimaforschung, Plasmaphysik Forschungszentrum J\u00fclich GmbH"}}}
