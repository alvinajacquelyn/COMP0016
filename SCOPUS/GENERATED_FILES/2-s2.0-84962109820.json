Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) serves as a host material which additionally offers the potential to cast LSCs in arbitrary shapes. The laser dye Pyrromethene 567 is used as a prototype fluorophore, and it is shown that it has a high quantum yield of 93% over the concentration range investigated. The optical efficiency and loss channels of the flexible LSCs are investigated; it is also demonstrated that the efficiency remains high while bending the LSC which is essential for flexible LSCs to make an impact on solar energy.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Arbitrary shape", "Concentration ranges", "Host materials", "Laser dyes", "Luminescent solar concentrators", "Optical efficiency", "Polydimethylsiloxane PDMS", "Pyrromethene 567"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84962109820", "SubjectAreas": [["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"]], "AuthorData": {"55863528400": {"Name": "Tummeltshammer C.", "AuthorID": "55863528400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "55863027000": {"Name": "Taylor A.", "AuthorID": "55863027000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "7005715736": {"Name": "Kenyon A.", "AuthorID": "7005715736", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "8306417100": {"Name": "Papakonstantinou I.", "AuthorID": "8306417100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}}}
