In line with the Theory of Planned Behaviour, attitudes \u2013 which affect behaviour \u2013 are generally assumed to be constant. However, it is plausible that attitudes can change, both directly, or indirectly, through the impact of the built environment on travel behaviour, a process which is referred to as reverse causality (RC). Based on literature from social psychology, this paper provides a conceptual model for the explanation of attitude changes. It also reviews the literature in the area of BE and TB concluding that two explanations dominate: a change in attitudes due to new experiences which can be underpinned by learning theories, and a change in attitudes due to mismatches between attitudes and behaviour which can be explained by cognitive dissonance theories. The literature also suggests a few additional explanations, while we also suggest explanations not provided in travel behaviour literature. Finally, we present an agenda for future research.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Attitudes", "Built environment", "Cognitive dissonance theory", "Learning theories", "Research agenda", "Travel behaviour"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85072187329", "SubjectAreas": [["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"], ["Transportation", "SOCI", "3313"], ["Environmental Science (all)", "ENVI", "2300"]], "AuthorData": {"56672201700": {"Name": "van Wee B.", "AuthorID": "56672201700", "AffiliationID": "60006288", "AffiliationName": "Transport and Logistics Group, Faculty Technology, Policy and Management, Delft University of Technology"}, "54787558100": {"Name": "De Vos J.", "AuthorID": "54787558100", "AffiliationID": "60033316", "AffiliationName": "Geography Department, Ghent University"}, "6507924479": {"Name": "Maat K.", "AuthorID": "6507924479", "AffiliationID": "60118020, 60006288, 60118019", "AffiliationName": "Department of Transport & Planning, Faculty of Civil Engineering and Geosciences, Delft University of Technology"}}}
