These schemes, based on the facet-oriented monopolar-RWG set, become more versatile than the traditional edge-oriented schemes, based on the RWG set, because they simplify the discretization around junctions in composite objects and because they can handle nonconformal triangulations. The existing nonconforming implementations tackle the numerical evaluation of the inherent hypersingular Kernel contributions of the EFIE by testing the fields over volumetric or surface domains attached to the boundary surface inside the conductor. Hence, the application of such schemes is restricted to closed PeC surfaces. In this paper, we present a novel nonconforming implementation of the EFIE that allows the scattering analysis of open PeC surfaces by testing the fields with a new, 'balancedtangential', strategy. We show for several examples of open PeC surfaces, infinitely long (2D) or arbitrarily shaped (3D), that the proposed scheme provides similar or slightly better accuracy than the RWG-discretization of the EFIE and same meshing.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Boundary surfaces", "Composite objects", "Continuity constraints", "Discretizations", "Electric field integral equation", "Hypersingular kernels", "Nonconforming discretization", "Scattering analysis"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84992125791", "SubjectAreas": [["Instrumentation", "PHYS", "3105"], ["Radiation", "PHYS", "3108"]], "AuthorData": {"6602087365": {"Name": "Ubeda E.", "AuthorID": "6602087365", "AffiliationID": "60007592", "AffiliationName": "AntennaLab, Signal Theory and Communications Department (TSC), Universitat Polit\u00e0cnica de Catalunya (UPC)"}, "56404677400": {"Name": "Sekulic I.", "AuthorID": "56404677400", "AffiliationID": "60007592", "AffiliationName": "AntennaLab, Signal Theory and Communications Department (TSC), Universitat Polit\u00e0cnica de Catalunya (UPC)"}, "7006933058": {"Name": "Rius J.", "AuthorID": "7006933058", "AffiliationID": "60007592", "AffiliationName": "AntennaLab, Signal Theory and Communications Department (TSC), Universitat Polit\u00e0cnica de Catalunya (UPC)"}}}
