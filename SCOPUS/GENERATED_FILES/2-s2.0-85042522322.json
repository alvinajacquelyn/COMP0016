However, in-use performance consistently misses design specifications, particularly those of operational energy use and indoor environmental quality. This performance gap risks reducing design, technology, sustainability, economic, health and well-being benefits. In this paper, we compare settings of the Chinese and the UK buildings sectors and relate their historical context, design, construction and operation issues impacting energy performance, indoor environmental quality, occupant health and well-being. We identify a series of key, common factors of \u2018total\u2019 building performance across these two settings: the application of building regulations, the balance between building cost and performance, skills, construction and operation. The dynamic and complex interactions of these factors are currently poorly understood and lead to building performance gaps. We contend that a systems approach in the development of suitable building assessment methods, technologies and tools could enable the formulation and implementation of more effective policies, regulations and practices. The paper illustrates the application of the approach to the UK and Chinese settings. A full application of a systems approach may help to provide a more dynamic understanding of how factor interactions impact the \u2018total\u2019 building performance gaps and help address its multiple causes.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Buildings", "Built environment", "China", "Performance Gap", "System dynamics", "Systems thinking", "UK"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85042522322", "SubjectAreas": [["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"55358884100": {"Name": "Shrubsole C.", "AuthorID": "55358884100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Energy and Resources, University College London"}, "57207787873": {"Name": "Zimmermann N.", "AuthorID": "57207787873", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Energy and Resources, University College London"}, "54385627300": {"Name": "Papachristos G.", "AuthorID": "54385627300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Energy and Resources, University College London"}, "55843415200": {"Name": "Burman E.", "AuthorID": "55843415200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Energy and Resources, University College London"}, "14040664500": {"Name": "Mumovic D.", "AuthorID": "14040664500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Energy and Resources, University College London"}, "57202098246": {"Name": "Davies M.", "AuthorID": "57202098246", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Energy and Resources, University College London"}, "35310292700": {"Name": "Hamilton I.G.", "AuthorID": "35310292700", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Energy Institute, The Bartlett School of Environment, Energy and Resources, University College London"}, "56615866400": {"Name": "Broyd T.", "AuthorID": "56615866400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute for Digital Innovation in the Built Environment"}, "57198950567": {"Name": "Zhu Y.", "AuthorID": "57198950567", "AffiliationID": "60025278", "AffiliationName": "School of Architecture, Tsinghua University"}, "57203508765": {"Name": "Lin B.", "AuthorID": "57203508765", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
