Enhanced Recovery is an approach to major elective surgery aimed at minimizing perioperative stress for the patient. Previous studies have shown Enhanced Recovery to be associated with reduced hospital length of stay and perioperative morbidity. Methods In this national clinical audit, National Health Service hospitals in the UK were invited to submit patient-level data. The data regarding length of stay and compliance with each element of Enhanced Recovery protocols for colorectal, orthopaedic, urological and gynaecological surgery patients were analysed. The relationship between Enhanced Recovery protocol compliance and length of stay was measured. Results From 16 267 patients from 61 hospital trusts, three out of four surgical specialties showed Enhanced Recovery, compliance being weakly associated with shorter length of stay (correlation coefficients -0.18, -0.14, -0.25 in colorectal, orthopaedics and gynaecology respectively). At a cut-off of 80% compliance, good compliance was associated with two, one and three day reductions in median length of stay respectively in colorectal, orthopaedic and urological surgeries, with no saving in gynaecology. Conclusions This study is the largest assessment of the relationship between Enhanced Recovery protocol compliance and outcome in four surgical specialties. The data suggest that higher compliance with an Enhanced Recovery protocol has a weak association with shorter length of stay. This suggests that changes in process, resulting from highly protocolised pathways, may be as important in reducing perioperative length of stay as any individual element of Enhanced Recovery protocols in isolation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["anesthesia", "general surgery", "perioperative care"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Cooperative Behavior", "Elective Surgical Procedures", "Female", "Great Britain", "Guideline Adherence", "Humans", "Length of Stay", "Male", "Medical Audit", "Middle Aged", "Perioperative Care", "Postoperative Complications", "Program Evaluation", "Recovery of Function", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84943233511", "SubjectAreas": [["Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine", "MEDI", "2703"]], "AuthorData": {"57220976901": {"Name": "Simpson J.C.", "AuthorID": "57220976901", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Surgical Outcomes Research Centre (SOuRCe), University College London Hospitals NIHR, Biomedical Research Centre"}, "15046929200": {"Name": "Moonesinghe S.R.", "AuthorID": "15046929200", "AffiliationID": "60116802", "AffiliationName": "National Institute of Academic Anaesthesia, Health Services Research Centre, Royal College of Anaesthetists"}, "55348894800": {"Name": "Grocott M.P.W.", "AuthorID": "55348894800", "AffiliationID": "60000703, 60025225", "AffiliationName": "Anaesthesia and Critical Care Research Unit, University Hospitals Southampton, Integrative Physiology and Critical Illness Group, University of Southampton and University Hospital Southampton, University of Southampton NIHR, Respiratory Biomedical Research Unit"}, "56890517400": {"Name": "Oliver C.M.", "AuthorID": "56890517400", "AffiliationID": "60116802", "AffiliationName": "National Institute of Academic Anaesthesia, Health Services Research Centre, Royal College of Anaesthetists"}, "6602317411": {"Name": "Galsworthy M.J.", "AuthorID": "6602317411", "AffiliationID": "60116802", "AffiliationName": "National Institute of Academic Anaesthesia, Health Services Research Centre, Royal College of Anaesthetists"}, "35458587700": {"Name": "Mythen M.G.", "AuthorID": "35458587700", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Surgical Outcomes Research Centre (SOuRCe), University College London Hospitals NIHR, Biomedical Research Centre"}, "6701842300": {"Name": "Kuper M.", "AuthorID": "6701842300", "AffiliationID": "60005523", "AffiliationName": "Homerton Hospital"}, "56891329600": {"Name": "McMeeking A.", "AuthorID": "56891329600", "AffiliationID": "60115291", "AffiliationName": "National Cancer Action Team, NHS"}}}
