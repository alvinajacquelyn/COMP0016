Five healthy subjects were scanned with 18 echo times (TEs) as short as 0.17 ms. T2* values were fitted on a voxel-by-voxel basis using a bi-exponential model. Data were also analysed using a continuous distribution fit with a region of interest-based inverse Laplace transform. Average T2* values were 3.4 \u00b1 0.2 ms and 23.5 \u00b1 1.8 ms in white matter (WM) for the short and long components, respectively, and 3.9 \u00b1 0.5 ms and 26.3 \u00b1 2.6 ms in grey matter (GM) for the short and long components, respectively, using the bi-exponential model. Continuous distribution fits yielded results of 3.1 \u00b1 0.3 ms and 18.8 \u00b1 3.2 ms in WM for the short and long components, respectively, and 2.9 \u00b1 0.4 ms and 17.2 \u00b1 2 ms in GM for the short and long components, respectively. 23Na T2* values of the brain for the short and long components for various anatomical locations using ultra-short TEs are presented for the first time.", "AuthorKeywords": ["23Na", "neuro", "non-Cartesian", "relaxometry", "sodium", "UTE"], "IndexKeywords": ["Bi-exponential models", "Continuous distribution", "Inverse Laplace transform", "Neuro", "Non-Cartesian", "Relaxometry", "Transverse relaxation time", "^23Na", "Adult", "Brain", "Female", "Gray Matter", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Phantoms, Imaging", "Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted", "Sodium", "White Matter"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85042425283", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Medicine", "BIOC", "1313"], ["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"], ["Spectroscopy", "CHEM", "1607"]], "AuthorData": {"55614953600": {"Name": "Riemer F.", "AuthorID": "55614953600", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Brain Repair and Rehabilitation, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "57193024760": {"Name": "Solanky B.", "AuthorID": "57193024760", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Queen Square MS Centre, NMR Research Unit, Department of Neuroinflammation, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "6602501665": {"Name": "Wheeler-Kingshott C.", "AuthorID": "6602501665", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Queen Square MS Centre, NMR Research Unit, Department of Neuroinflammation, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "7004309393": {"Name": "Golay X.", "AuthorID": "7004309393", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Brain Repair and Rehabilitation, UCL Institute of Neurology"}}}
