Methods in Ecology and Evolution published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of British Ecological SocietyRecent studies have demonstrated the potential of lidar-derived methods in plant ecology and forestry. One limitation to these methods is accessing the information content of point clouds, from which tree-scale metrics can be retrieved. This is currently undertaken through laborious and time-consuming manual segmentation of tree-level point clouds from larger-area point clouds, an effort that is impracticable across thousands of stems. Here, we present treeseg, an open-source software to automate this task. This method utilises generic point cloud processing techniques including Euclidean clustering, principal component analysis, region-based segmentation, shape fitting and connectivity testing. This data-driven approach uses few a priori assumptions of tree architecture, and transferability across lidar instruments is constrained only by data quality requirements. We demonstrate the treeseg algorithm here on data acquired from both a structurally simple open forest and a complex tropical forest. Across these data, we successfully automatically extract 96% and 70% of trees, respectively, with the remainder requiring some straightforward manual segmentation. treeseg allows ready and quick access to tree-scale information contained in lidar point clouds. treeseg should help contribute to more wide-scale uptake of lidar-derived methods to applications ranging from the estimation of carbon stocks through to descriptions of plant form and function.", "AuthorKeywords": ["extraction", "forests", "laser scanning", "lidar", "point cloud", "segmentation", "trees"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85048982348", "SubjectAreas": [["Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics", "AGRI", "1105"], ["Ecological Modeling", "ENVI", "2302"]], "AuthorData": {"56041956600": {"Name": "Burt A.", "AuthorID": "56041956600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography, University College London"}, "7006197933": {"Name": "Disney M.", "AuthorID": "7006197933", "AffiliationID": "60007317", "AffiliationName": "NERC National Centre for Earth Observation (NCEO)"}, "55574436900": {"Name": "Calders K.", "AuthorID": "55574436900", "AffiliationID": "60033316", "AffiliationName": "CAVElab - Computational & Applied Vegetation Ecology, Ghent University"}}}
