Methods: Systematic review of articles using five electronic databases: MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Scopus. Quantitative and qualitative studies that were published in English in a peer-reviewed journal and assessed barriers or enablers for survivors of critical illness to perform physical activity were included. Prospero ID: CRD42016035454. Results: Eighty-nine papers were included. Five major themes and 28 sub-themes were identified, encompassing: (1) patient physical and psychological capability to perform physical activity, including delirium, sedation, illness severity, comorbidities, weakness, anxiety, confidence and motivation; (2) safety influences, including physiological stability and concern for lines, e.g. risk of dislodgement; (3) culture and team influences, including leadership, interprofessional communication, administrative buy-in, clinician expertise and knowledge; (4) motivation and beliefs regarding the benefits/risks; and (5) environmental influences, including funding, access to rehabilitation programs, staffing and equipment. Conclusions: The main barriers identified were patient physical and psychological capability to perform physical activity, safety concerns, lack of leadership and ICU culture of mobility, lack of interprofessional communication, expertise and knowledge, and lack of staffing/equipment and funding to provide rehabilitation programs. Barriers and enablers are multidimensional and span diverse factors. The majority of these barriers are modifiable and can be targeted in future clinical practice.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Behaviour change", "Critical care", "Physical activity", "Physical therapy", "Rehabilitation", "Review"], "IndexKeywords": ["Critical Illness", "Exercise", "Family", "Health Personnel", "Humans", "Intensive Care Units", "Motivation", "Qualitative Research", "Severity of Illness Index", "Survivors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85013031426", "SubjectAreas": [["Critical Care and Intensive Care Medicine", "MEDI", "2706"]], "AuthorData": {"55624923600": {"Name": "Parry S.M.", "AuthorID": "55624923600", "AffiliationID": "60026553", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physiotherapy, School of Health Sciences, The University of Melbourne"}, "57191475243": {"Name": "Denehy L.", "AuthorID": "57191475243", "AffiliationID": "60026553", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physiotherapy, School of Health Sciences, The University of Melbourne"}, "36945096900": {"Name": "Granger C.L.", "AuthorID": "36945096900", "AffiliationID": "112581022", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Breathing and Sleep"}, "57057137700": {"Name": "Knight L.D.", "AuthorID": "57057137700", "AffiliationID": "60005245", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physiotherapy, Royal Melbourne Hospital"}, "55044436900": {"Name": "Connolly B.", "AuthorID": "55044436900", "AffiliationID": "60005518", "AffiliationName": "Lane Fox Clinical Respiratory Physiology Research Centre, Guy\u2019s and St Thomas\u2019 NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57193328356": {"Name": "Mortimore J.", "AuthorID": "57193328356", "AffiliationID": "60005518", "AffiliationName": "Lane Fox Clinical Respiratory Physiology Research Centre, Guy\u2019s and St Thomas\u2019 NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57203032669": {"Name": "Hart N.", "AuthorID": "57203032669", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Division of Asthma, Allergy and Lung Biology, King\u2019s College London"}, "6508205361": {"Name": "Puthucheary Z.", "AuthorID": "6508205361", "AffiliationID": "60027403", "AffiliationName": "Division of Critical Care, Institute of Sports and Exercise Health, University College Hospitals"}, "51763114200": {"Name": "Baldwin C.", "AuthorID": "51763114200", "AffiliationID": "60031846", "AffiliationName": "International Centre for Allied Health Evidence (iCAHE) and the Sansom Institute, University of South Australia"}, "36921195500": {"Name": "Morris P.", "AuthorID": "36921195500", "AffiliationID": "60015941", "AffiliationName": "Department of Critical Care, University of Kentucky"}}}
