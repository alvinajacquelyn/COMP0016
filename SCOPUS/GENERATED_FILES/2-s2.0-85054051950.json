All rights reserved.Gender refers to the social relationships between males and females in terms of their roles, behaviours, activities, attributes and opportunities, and which are based on different levels of power. Gender interacts with, but is distinct from, the binary categories of biological sex. In this paper we consider how gender interacts with the 2030 agenda for sustainable development, including sustainable development goal (SDG) 3 and its targets for health and well-being, and the impact on health equity. We propose a conceptual framework for understanding the interactions between gender (SDG 5) and health (SDG 3) and 13 other SDGs, which influence health outcomes. We explore the empirical evidence for these interactions in relation to three domains of gender and health: gender as a social determinant of health; gender as a driver of health behaviours; and the gendered response of health systems. The paper highlights the complex relationship between health and gender, and how these domains interact with the broad 2030 agenda. Across all three domains (social determinants, health behaviours and health system), we find evidence of the links between gender, health and other SDGs. For example, education (SDG 4) has a measurable impact on health outcomes of women and children, while decent work (SDG 8) affects the rates of occupation-related morbidity and mortality, for both men and women. We propose concerted and collaborative actions across the interlinked SDGs to deliver health equity, health and well-being for all, as well as to enhance gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment. These proposals are summarized in an agenda for action.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Conservation of Natural Resources", "Female", "Health Equity", "Health Status", "Humans", "Male", "Power (Psychology)", "Sex Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85054051950", "SubjectAreas": [["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"56694571100": {"Name": "Manandhar M.", "AuthorID": "56694571100", "AffiliationID": "60027142", "AffiliationName": "Gender, Equity and Human Rights Team, World Health Organization"}, "6603945978": {"Name": "Magar V.", "AuthorID": "6603945978", "AffiliationID": "60027142", "AffiliationName": "Gender, Equity and Human Rights Team, World Health Organization"}, "7005237779": {"Name": "Hawkes S.", "AuthorID": "7005237779", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Gender and Global Health, Institute for Global Health, Faculty of Population Health Sciences, University College London"}, "35899779000": {"Name": "Buse K.", "AuthorID": "35899779000", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "57194591466": {"Name": "Nosrati E.", "AuthorID": "57194591466", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Sociology, University of Cambridge"}}}
