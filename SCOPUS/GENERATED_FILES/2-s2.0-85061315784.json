This paradigm focuses on the environmental impacts of travel and the imperative for climate change mitigation, however the specific outcomes of transport in terms of trip type and purpose are not robustly conceptualised, with limited intellectual foundations to understand the ethical considerations of transport service provision. This paper critically considers transport strategies recently developed for London's Night Time Economy, including policy discourse and technical approaches that shape of transport services provision at night. The case study evaluates the spatiotemporal dimensions of equity. Analysis of policy discourses revealed how night time transport are conceived as an instrumental means to grow the \u2018Night Time Economy\u2019 drawing from the conventional wisdom linking accessibility improvements with economic expansion. This strategy viewed \u2018London at night\u2019 as a vehicle for economic development, focusing on the consumption-side of the economy and improving individuals\u2019 access to entertainment and recreation. Policy discourse recognised the existence of night-time workers in sectors outside arts and recreation, however, attempts to broaden the \u2018Night Time Economy\u2019 agenda to accommodate the travel needs of night-time workers were lost through the narrow selection of accessibility metrics used in transport planning practice. This case demonstrates a missed opportunity to improve transport equity across spatial and temporal dimensions, as night-time workers face severe accessibility barriers, often relying on low-frequency bus services that have inadequate service coverage across Greater London. Scrutinising socio-spatial and temporal dimensions of transport provision can advance more systematic critical perspectives on transport equity by integrating a variety of distributional issues and linking more closely to the practical barriers faced by night-time workers to access transport.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Equity", "Night time economy", "Transport"], "IndexKeywords": ["Accessibility barriers", "Climate change mitigation", "Critical perspectives", "Equity", "Ethical considerations", "Night time", "Spatio-temporal dimensions", "Transport"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85061315784", "SubjectAreas": [["Civil and Structural Engineering", "ENGI", "2205"], ["Transportation", "SOCI", "3313"], ["Management Science and Operations Research", "DECI", "1803"]], "AuthorData": {"57193488696": {"Name": "McArthur J.", "AuthorID": "57193488696", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "City Leadership Laboratory, Department of Science, Technology, Engineering and Public Policy, University College London"}, "57191071720": {"Name": "Robin E.", "AuthorID": "57191071720", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "City Leadership Laboratory, Department of Science, Technology, Engineering and Public Policy, University College London"}, "57204708202": {"Name": "Smeds E.", "AuthorID": "57204708202", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "City Leadership Laboratory, Department of Science, Technology, Engineering and Public Policy, University College London"}}}
