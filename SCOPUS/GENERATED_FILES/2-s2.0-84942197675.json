However, the utility of the FAB in the differential diagnosis of PSP from frontotemporal dementia (FTD) phenotypes is still under research. Methods: We performed the FAB, in a multi-centre cohort of 70 PSP, 103 FTD (N = 84 behavioral variant FTD, N = 10 semantic dementia, N = 9 progressive non-fluent aphasia), 26 PD and 11 MSA-P patients, diagnosed according to established criteria. Patients were also rated with the mini mental state examination and motor scales. Results: The FAB total score showed a poor discriminatory power between PSP and FTD as a group [area under the curve (AUC) = 0.523]. Moreover, the FAB score showed no correlation with disease duration in PSP (r = 0.05) or FTD group (r = 0.04). In contrast, we confirmed that the FAB is clinically useful to differentiate PSP from PD and MSA-P (AUC = 0.927). In fact, the sum of two FAB subscores together (verbal fluency and Luria motor series) were as good as the total score in differentiating PSP from PD and MSA-P (AUC = 0.957). Conclusions: The FAB may not be a useful tool to differentiate PSP from FTDs, and shows no correlation with disease duration in these disorders. On the other hand, the essential information to differentiate PSP from PD and MSA-P is contained in the sum of only two FAB subscores. This should be taken into consideration in both clinical practice and the planning of clinical trials.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Frontal assessment battery", "Frontotemporal dementia", "Multiple system atrophy", "Parkinson's disease", "Progressive supranuclear palsy"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Diagnosis, Differential", "Female", "Frontotemporal Dementia", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Neuropsychological Tests", "Supranuclear Palsy, Progressive"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84942197675", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Geriatrics and Gerontology", "MEDI", "2717"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"57208560010": {"Name": "Stamelou M.", "AuthorID": "57208560010", "AffiliationID": "60029813", "AffiliationName": "Movement Disorders Department, Hygeia Hospital"}, "57198197973": {"Name": "Oertel W.", "AuthorID": "57198197973", "AffiliationID": "60012556", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Philipps Universit\u00e4t"}, "6602778605": {"Name": "H\u00f6glinger G.", "AuthorID": "6602778605", "AffiliationID": "60103674", "AffiliationName": "German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE)"}, "55351956300": {"Name": "Kontaxopoulou D.", "AuthorID": "55351956300", "AffiliationID": "60015528, 60028900", "AffiliationName": "Second Department of Neurology, Attikon University Hospital, University of Athens"}, "57202963715": {"Name": "Stefanis L.", "AuthorID": "57202963715", "AffiliationID": "60015528, 60028900", "AffiliationName": "Second Department of Neurology, Attikon University Hospital, University of Athens"}, "15770367100": {"Name": "Papageorgiou S.", "AuthorID": "15770367100", "AffiliationID": "60069142, 60028900", "AffiliationName": "First Department of Neurology, Eginition University General Hospital, University of Athens"}, "14318959100": {"Name": "Diehl-Schmid J.", "AuthorID": "14318959100", "AffiliationID": "60019722", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen"}, "35798264200": {"Name": "Hapfelmeier A.", "AuthorID": "35798264200", "AffiliationID": "60019722", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Statistics and Epidemiology, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen"}, "25958636400": {"Name": "Bhatia K.", "AuthorID": "25958636400", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Sobell Department of Motor Neuroscience and Movement Disorders, UCL Institute of Neurology"}}}
