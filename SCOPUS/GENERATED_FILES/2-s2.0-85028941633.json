While deep-level transient spectroscopy (DLTS) has proved to be a powerful tool in analysing traps in bulk semiconductors, this technique is ineffective for the characterisation of nanowires due to their very small capacitance. Here, we introduce a new technique for measuring the spectrum of deep traps in nanowires. In current-mode DLTS (\"I-DLTS\"), the temperature-dependence of the transient current through a nanowire field-effect transistor in response to an applied gate voltage pulse is measured. We demonstrate the applicability of I-DLTS to determine the activation energy and capture cross-sections of several deep defect states in zinc oxide nanowires. In addition to characterising deep defect states, we show that I-DLTS can be used to measure the surface barrier height in semiconductor nanowires.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Bulk semiconductors", "Capture cross sections", "Gate voltages", "Semiconductor nanowire", "Surface barrier", "Temperature dependence", "Transient current", "Zinc oxide nanowires"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85028941633", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"55551834500": {"Name": "Isakov I.", "AuthorID": "55551834500", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Blackett Laboratory, Imperial College London"}, "55551940600": {"Name": "Sourribes M.J.L.", "AuthorID": "55551940600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "7005264376": {"Name": "Warburton P.A.", "AuthorID": "7005264376", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}}}
