In this study, we show that both the left and right habenula are competent to adopt left-type molecular character and efferent connectivity upon the presence of only a few parapineal cells. This ability to impart left-sided character is lost in parapineal cells lacking Sox1a function, despite the normal specification of the parapineal itself. Precisely timed laser ablation experiments demonstrate that the parapineal influences neurogenesis in the left habenula at early developmental stages as well as neurotransmitter phenotype and efferent connectivity during subsequent stages of habenular differentiation. These results reveal a tight coordination between the formation of the unilateral parapineal nucleus and emergence of asymmetric habenulae, ensuring that appropriate lateralised character is propagated within left and right-sided circuitry.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Body Patterning", "Habenula", "Neural Pathways", "SOXB1 Transcription Factors", "Zebrafish"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85071044979", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Immunology and Microbiology (all)", "IMMU", "2400"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"56607215800": {"Name": "Lekk I.", "AuthorID": "56607215800", "AffiliationID": "60011394", "AffiliationName": "Center for Brain Research, Medical University of Vienna"}, "56344336000": {"Name": "Faro A.", "AuthorID": "56344336000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University College London"}, "57191754696": {"Name": "Nicolaou S.", "AuthorID": "57191754696", "AffiliationID": "60010337", "AffiliationName": "Division of Cancer Therapeutics, The Institute of Cancer Research"}, "55228586400": {"Name": "Wilson S.W.", "AuthorID": "55228586400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University College London"}, "6506439494": {"Name": "Duboc V.", "AuthorID": "6506439494", "AffiliationID": "60110693, 60008134, 60030964, 60000905, 60110697", "AffiliationName": "Universit\u00e9 C\u00f4te d\u2019Azur, CHU, Inserm, CNRS, IRCAN"}, "57203510283": {"Name": "Blader P.", "AuthorID": "57203510283", "AffiliationID": "60102124", "AffiliationName": "Centre de Biologie Int\u00e9grative (FR 3743), Centre de Biologie du D\u00e9veloppement (UMR5547), Universit\u00e9 de Toulouse CNRS"}}}
