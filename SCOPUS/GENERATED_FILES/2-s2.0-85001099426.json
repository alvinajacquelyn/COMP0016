HPA axis regulation has not previously been investigated in women with eating disorders (ED) or their infants during the perinatal period. Methods Women were recruited to a prospective longitudinal study in three groups: 1) current or active ED (C-ED = 31), 2) past ED (P-ED = 29) and healthy control (HC = 57). Maternal psychopathology, diurnal cortisol levels, corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and CRH binding protein (CRH-BP) were measured during the third trimester of pregnancy. At eight weeks postpartum infant cortisol was obtained before and after routine immunisations to determine infant hormonal response to a stressful situation. Results Women with current ED had a significantly lower cortisol decline throughout the day compared to HC, in both adjusted and unadjusted analyses. Lower cortisol decline among women with a current ED were associated with higher levels of psychopathology during pregnancy. Women's cortisol awakening response, CRH and CRH-BP levels did not differ across the three groups. Infants\u2019 stress response was also significantly higher among those in the C-ED group, although this effect was attenuated after controlling for confounders. Conclusions During pregnancy women with ED have lower cortisol declines, suggestive of blunted diurnal cortisol rhythms. Postnatally, their infants also have a heightened response to stress. This is the first study to identify HPA axis dysfunction in pregnancy in women with ED, and to show an intergenerational effect. Since dysfunctions in HPA activity during childhood may represent a risk factor for psychological and physical health problems later in life, further investigation of the potential long-term implications of these findings is crucial.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cortisol", "Eating disorders", "Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis", "Infant", "Perinatal", "Pregnancy", "Stress"], "IndexKeywords": ["Feeding and Eating Disorders", "Female", "Humans", "Hydrocortisone", "Hypothalamo-Hypophyseal System", "Infant", "Longitudinal Studies", "Male", "Pituitary-Adrenal System", "Pregnancy", "Pregnancy Complications", "Stress, Psychological"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85001099426", "SubjectAreas": [["Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism", "MEDI", "2712"], ["Endocrinology", "BIOC", "1310"], ["Endocrine and Autonomic Systems", "NEUR", "2807"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"], ["Biological Psychiatry", "NEUR", "2803"]], "AuthorData": {"24586935300": {"Name": "Easter A.", "AuthorID": "24586935300", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Health Services Research Department, Institute of Psychiatry, Kings College London"}, "37004073700": {"Name": "Taborelli E.", "AuthorID": "37004073700", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychological Medicine and Psychiatry, Section of Eating Disorders, Institute of Psychiatry, Kings College London"}, "55623960200": {"Name": "Bye A.", "AuthorID": "55623960200", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Health Services Research Department, Institute of Psychiatry, Kings College London"}, "16031429800": {"Name": "Micali N.", "AuthorID": "16031429800", "AffiliationID": "60012981", "AffiliationName": "Mindich Child Health and Development Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"}, "7006097367": {"Name": "Treasure J.", "AuthorID": "7006097367", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychological Medicine and Psychiatry, Section of Eating Disorders, Institute of Psychiatry, Kings College London"}, "7402009547": {"Name": "Schmidt U.", "AuthorID": "7402009547", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychological Medicine and Psychiatry, Section of Eating Disorders, Institute of Psychiatry, Kings College London"}, "36876333100": {"Name": "Zunszain P.", "AuthorID": "36876333100", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychological Medicine, Institute of Psychiatry, Section of Perinatal Psychiatry and Stress, Psychiatry and Immunology (SPI-lab), King's College London"}, "7003615668": {"Name": "Pariante C.", "AuthorID": "7003615668", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychological Medicine, Institute of Psychiatry, Section of Perinatal Psychiatry and Stress, Psychiatry and Immunology (SPI-lab), King's College London"}}}
