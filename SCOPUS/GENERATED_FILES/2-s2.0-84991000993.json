Broadband, large negative group-delay dispersion was achieved in the optimized design: The group-delay dispersion (GDD) as large as -3500fs2 was theoretically obtained over a 10-nm bandwidth. The designed structure was manufactured and tested, providing GDD -3320fs2 over a 7-nm bandwidth. The mirror performance was verified in semiconductor structures grown with molecular beam epitaxy. The mirror was tested in a passively mode-locked Yb:KYW laser.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Chirped mirrors", "Dispersion properties", "Group delay dispersion", "Mirror performance", "Negative group delay", "Optimized designs", "Passively mode-locked", "Semiconductor structure"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84991000993", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (miscellaneous)", "PHYS", "3101"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"6603052569": {"Name": "Dems M.", "AuthorID": "6603052569", "AffiliationID": "60016104", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Physics, Lodz University of Technology"}, "8597616000": {"Name": "Wnuk P.", "AuthorID": "8597616000", "AffiliationID": "60029010", "AffiliationName": "Max-Planck-Institut f\u00fcr Quantenoptik"}, "6602894094": {"Name": "Wasylczyk P.", "AuthorID": "6602894094", "AffiliationID": "60013756", "AffiliationName": "Photonic Nanostructure Facility, Institute of Experimental Physics, Faculty of Physics, University of Warsaw"}, "54882653000": {"Name": "Zinkiewicz \u0141.", "AuthorID": "54882653000", "AffiliationID": "60013756", "AffiliationName": "Photonic Nanostructure Facility, Institute of Experimental Physics, Faculty of Physics, University of Warsaw"}, "12780533700": {"Name": "W\u00f3jcik-Jedli\u0144ska A.", "AuthorID": "12780533700", "AffiliationID": "60069012", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Electron Technology"}, "7004634781": {"Name": "Regi\u0144ski K.", "AuthorID": "7004634781", "AffiliationID": "60069012", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Electron Technology"}, "12783225500": {"Name": "Hejduk K.", "AuthorID": "12783225500", "AffiliationID": "60069012", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Electron Technology"}, "8508503700": {"Name": "Jasik A.", "AuthorID": "8508503700", "AffiliationID": "60069012", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Electron Technology"}}}
