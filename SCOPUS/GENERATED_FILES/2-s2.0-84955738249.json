KGaA, Weinheim.Linear poly(p-phenylene)s are modestly active UV photocatalysts for hydrogen production in the presence of a sacrificial electron donor. Introduction of planarized fluorene, carbazole, dibenzo[b,d]thiophene or dibenzo[b,d]thiophene sulfone units greatly enhances the H2 evolution rate. The most active dibenzo[b,d]thiophene sulfone co-polymer has a UV photocatalytic activity that rivals TiO2, but is much more active under visible light. The dibenzo[b,d]thiophene sulfone co-polymer has an apparent quantum yield of 2.3 % at 420nm, as compared to 0.1 % for platinized commercial pristine carbon nitride.", "AuthorKeywords": ["conjugated polymer", "extended conjugation", "photocatalysis", "planarization", "water splitting"], "IndexKeywords": ["Extended conjugation", "Hydrogen evolution", "Photocatalytic activities", "Planarization", "Poly(p-phenylene)s", "Sacrificial electron donors", "Visible-light-driven", "Water splitting"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84955738249", "SubjectAreas": [["Catalysis", "CENG", "1503"], ["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"]], "AuthorData": {"36657600800": {"Name": "Sprick R.", "AuthorID": "36657600800", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Centre for Materials Discovery, University of Liverpool"}, "23099464700": {"Name": "Bonillo B.", "AuthorID": "23099464700", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Centre for Materials Discovery, University of Liverpool"}, "23491285200": {"Name": "Clowes R.", "AuthorID": "23491285200", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Centre for Materials Discovery, University of Liverpool"}, "56926651800": {"Name": "Brownbill N.", "AuthorID": "56926651800", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Centre for Materials Discovery, University of Liverpool"}, "57203048898": {"Name": "Slater B.", "AuthorID": "57203048898", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Centre for Materials Discovery, University of Liverpool"}, "57213368290": {"Name": "Blanc F.", "AuthorID": "57213368290", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Stephenson Institute for Renewable Energy, University of Liverpool"}, "55015893700": {"Name": "Adams D.", "AuthorID": "55015893700", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Centre for Materials Discovery, University of Liverpool"}, "7401832651": {"Name": "Cooper A.", "AuthorID": "7401832651", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Centre for Materials Discovery, University of Liverpool"}, "55805566600": {"Name": "Guiglion P.", "AuthorID": "55805566600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "6507121537": {"Name": "Zwijnenburg M.", "AuthorID": "6507121537", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}}}
