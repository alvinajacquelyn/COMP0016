In this paper we consider the underlying mathematical model, the inverse conductivity problem, in two dimensions and under the realistic assumption that only a part of the boundary is accessible to measurements. In this framework our data are modeled as a partial Neumann-to-Dirichlet map (ND map). We compare this data to the full-boundary ND map and prove that the error depends linearly on the size of the missing part of the boundary. The same linear dependence is further proved for the difference of the reconstructed conductivities - from partial and full boundary data. The reconstruction is based on a truncated and linearized D-bar method. Auxiliary results include an extrapolation method to estimate the full-boundary data from the measured one, an approximation of the complex geometrical optics solutions computed directly from the ND map as well as an approximate scattering transform for reconstructing the conductivity. Numerical verification of the convergence results and reconstructions are presented for simulated test cases.", "AuthorKeywords": ["D-bar method", "electrical impedance tomography", "inverse conductivity problem", "Neumann-to-Dirichlet map", "partial-boundary data"], "IndexKeywords": ["Boundary data", "D-bar method", "Dirichlet", "Electrical impedance tomography", "Inverse conductivity problem"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85010399665", "SubjectAreas": [["Theoretical Computer Science", "MATH", "2614"], ["Signal Processing", "COMP", "1711"], ["Mathematical Physics", "MATH", "2610"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"56180904900": {"Name": "Hauptmann A.", "AuthorID": "56180904900", "AffiliationID": "60002952", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics and Statistics, University of Helsinki"}, "6701640093": {"Name": "Siltanen S.", "AuthorID": "6701640093", "AffiliationID": "60002952", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics and Statistics, University of Helsinki"}, "36606960800": {"Name": "Santacesaria M.", "AuthorID": "36606960800", "AffiliationID": "60023256", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, Politecnico di Milano"}}}
