This paper presents a laboratory scale simulation that aims to investigate the effects of sulfur on the fate of Cu, Pb, and Cd during clinkerization. The sulfur-bearing phases (CaSO4\u00b72H2O and CaS) and metal oxides were mixed with cement raw meal in appropriate ratios to produce clinkers. The volatilization and solidification of Cu, Pb and Cd were investigated using atomic absorption spectrometry, thermogravimetric analysis, X-ray diffraction analyses, electron probe X-ray microanalysis, and scanning electron microscopy. The volatilization of Cu slightly increased in the temperature range 950 \u00b0C\u20131450 \u00b0C with addition of sulfur. Sulfur promotes the volatilization of Pb and Cd at the temperature from 950 \u00b0C to 1250 \u00b0C by decreasing the melting point of PbO and CdO. Sulfur increased the solidification ability of clinker decreasing the volatilization ratio of Pb and Cd at the temperature of 1350\u20131450 \u00b0C and 1450 \u00b0C, respectively. Both forms of sulfur (CaSO4\u00b72H2O and CaS) have similar effect on the Cu/Pb/Cd volatilization. Sulfur concentrated in interstitial phases of the clinkers mainly as Ca4Al6O12SO4 and CaSO4. Cu, Pb and Cd were mainly solidified within interstitial phases of the clinkers forming solid solutions with the variable compositions. Cu was also present in alite and belite and as crystalline phases of Ca2CuO3 and CaCu2O3 in the clinkers. This research can help to improve understanding of the fate of heavy metals and provide a guideline for risk assessment during the co-processing of solid wastes in cement kiln.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Clinker", "Element speciation", "Heavy metals", "Solidification", "Sulfur", "Volatilization"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cement raw meal", "Clinker", "Clinkerization", "Crystalline phasis", "Electron probe X ray microanalysis", "Element speciations", "Temperature range", "Volatilization ratio"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85048723689", "SubjectAreas": [["Civil and Structural Engineering", "ENGI", "2205"], ["Building and Construction", "ENGI", "2215"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"]], "AuthorData": {"57191293693": {"Name": "Zhang B.", "AuthorID": "57191293693", "AffiliationID": "60024542", "AffiliationName": "School of Materials Science and Engineering, South China University of Technology"}, "14059371300": {"Name": "Wei J.", "AuthorID": "14059371300", "AffiliationID": "117879085", "AffiliationName": "Guangdong Low Carbon Technologies Engineering Center for Building Materials"}, "55649760700": {"Name": "Zhang T.", "AuthorID": "55649760700", "AffiliationID": "117879085", "AffiliationName": "Guangdong Low Carbon Technologies Engineering Center for Building Materials"}, "55487630200": {"Name": "Xu W.", "AuthorID": "55487630200", "AffiliationID": "117879085", "AffiliationName": "Guangdong Low Carbon Technologies Engineering Center for Building Materials"}, "7402947710": {"Name": "Yu Q.", "AuthorID": "7402947710", "AffiliationID": "117879085", "AffiliationName": "Guangdong Low Carbon Technologies Engineering Center for Building Materials"}, "22952845400": {"Name": "Bogush A.", "AuthorID": "22952845400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Resource Efficiency & the Environment (CREE), Department of Civil, Environmental & Geomatic Engineering (CEGE), University College London (UCL)"}}}
