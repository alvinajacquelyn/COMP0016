It has been suggested that contextual cuing relies on associative learning between the distractor locations and the target position. Four experiments examined the effect of pre-exposing configurations of consistent distractors on subsequent contextual cuing. The findings demonstrate a facilitation of subsequent cuing for pre-exposed configurations compared to novel configurations that have not been pre-exposed. This facilitation suggests that learning of repeated visual search patterns involves acquisition of not just distractor-target associations but also associations between distractors within the search context, an effect that is not captured by the Brady and Chun (2007) connectionist model of contextual cuing. We propose a new connectionist model of contextual cuing that learns associations between repeated distractor stimuli, enabling it to predict an effect of pre-exposure on contextual cuing.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Associative learning", "Auto-association", "Contextual cuing", "Pre-exposure", "Visual search"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Association Learning", "Cues", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Models, Psychological", "Neuropsychological Tests", "Pattern Recognition, Visual", "Reaction Time", "Space Perception"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84925614808", "SubjectAreas": [["Language and Linguistics", "ARTS", "1203"], ["Experimental and Cognitive Psychology", "PSYC", "3205"], ["Linguistics and Language", "SOCI", "3310"]], "AuthorData": {"14424213800": {"Name": "Beesley T.", "AuthorID": "14424213800", "AffiliationID": "60028333", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, University of New South Wales"}, "6602776139": {"Name": "Vadillo M.", "AuthorID": "6602776139", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychology and Language Sciences, University College London"}, "7005569087": {"Name": "Shanks D.", "AuthorID": "7005569087", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychology and Language Sciences, University College London"}, "56402562600": {"Name": "Pearson D.", "AuthorID": "56402562600", "AffiliationID": "60028333", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, University of New South Wales"}}}
