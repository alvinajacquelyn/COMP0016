While evidence indicates that PPI can improve health-care decision making, it also consumes monetary and non-monetary resources. Given the financial climate, it is important to start thinking about the costs and benefits of PPI and how to evaluate it in economic terms. Design: We conducted a literature review to assess the potential benefits and costs of involvement and the challenges in carrying out an economic evaluation of PPI. Results: The benefits of PPI include effects on the design of new projects or services, on NHS governance, on research design and implementation and on citizenship and equity. Economic evaluation of PPI activities is limited. The lack of an appropriate analytical framework, data recording and understanding of the potential costs and benefits of PPI, especially from participants' perspectives, represent serious constraints on the full evaluation of PPI. Conclusions: By recognizing the value of PPI, health-care providers and commissioners can embed it more effectively within their organizations. Better knowledge of costs may prompt organizations to effectively plan, execute, evaluate and target resources. This should increase the likelihood of more meaningful activity, avoid tokenism and enhance organizational efficiency and reputation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Benefits", "Costs", "Engagement", "Involvement", "Patient and public involvement", "Public"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cost-Benefit Analysis", "Health Policy", "Humans", "Patient Participation", "Patient-Centered Care"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84954508365", "SubjectAreas": [["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"37063716300": {"Name": "Pizzo E.", "AuthorID": "37063716300", "AffiliationID": "60116484", "AffiliationName": "Imperial College, Business School"}, "57209094470": {"Name": "Doyle C.", "AuthorID": "57209094470", "AffiliationID": "60032993", "AffiliationName": "NIHR CLAHRC for Northwest London, Chelsea and Westminster Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "56479935900": {"Name": "Matthews R.", "AuthorID": "56479935900", "AffiliationID": "60032993", "AffiliationName": "NIHR CLAHRC for Northwest London, Chelsea and Westminster Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "26432489600": {"Name": "Barlow J.", "AuthorID": "26432489600", "AffiliationID": "60116484", "AffiliationName": "Technology and Innovation Management, Imperial College, Business School"}}}
