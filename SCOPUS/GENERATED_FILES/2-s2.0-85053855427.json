A search narrative could offer a conceptual and contextual report on the search strategy, which we suggest might benefit the peer review of literature searches and increase engagement with, and discussion of, the literature search strategy from review stakeholders, topic experts, and lay users of research. Search narratives would also increase the transparency of decision-making in literature searching.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Biomedical Research", "Decision Making", "Evidence-Based Medicine", "Humans", "Narration", "Peer Review", "Research Design", "Review Literature as Topic"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85053855427", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"]], "AuthorData": {"12647465100": {"Name": "Cooper C.", "AuthorID": "12647465100", "AffiliationID": "60016418", "AffiliationName": "Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Group, University of York"}, "57203971231": {"Name": "Hendon J.", "AuthorID": "57203971231", "AffiliationID": "60016418", "AffiliationName": "Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Group, University of York"}, "57202420867": {"Name": "Churchill R.", "AuthorID": "57202420867", "AffiliationID": "60016418", "AffiliationName": "Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Group, University of York"}, "57194055799": {"Name": "Dawson S.", "AuthorID": "57194055799", "AffiliationID": "60171764, 60020650", "AffiliationName": "Department of Population Health Sciences, Bristol Medical School, University of Bristol"}, "12239637600": {"Name": "Peters J.", "AuthorID": "12239637600", "AffiliationID": "60111707", "AffiliationName": "Exeter Test Group, University of Exeter Medical School"}, "56705513300": {"Name": "Varley-Campbell J.", "AuthorID": "56705513300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London (UCL)"}, "56545731500": {"Name": "Cockcroft E.", "AuthorID": "56545731500", "AffiliationID": "60111707", "AffiliationName": "Patient and Public Involvement Team (PenCLAHRC), University of Exeter Medical School"}}}
