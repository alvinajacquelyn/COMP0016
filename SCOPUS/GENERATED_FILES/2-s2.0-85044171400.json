The American Astronomical Society. All rights reserved..We present the ultraviolet magnitudes for over three million stars in the LAMOST survey, in which 2,202,116 stars are detected by GALEX. For 889,235 undetected stars, we develop a method to estimate their upper limit magnitudes. The distribution of (FUV - NUV) shows that the color declines with increasing effective temperature for stars hotter than 7000 K in our sample, while the trend disappears for the cooler stars due to upper atmosphere emission from the regions higher than their photospheres. For stars with valid stellar parameters, we calculate the UV excesses with synthetic model spectra, and find that the (FUV - NUV) versus can be fitted with a linear relation and late-type dwarfs tend to have high UV excesses. There are 87,178 and 1,498,103 stars detected more than once in the visit exposures of GALEX in the FUV and NUV, respectively. We make use of the quantified photometric errors to determine statistical properties of the UV variation, including intrinsic variability and the structure function on the timescale of days. The overall occurrence of possible false positives is below 1.3% in our sample. UV absolute magnitudes are calculated for stars with valid parallaxes, which could serve as a possible reference frame in the NUV. We conclude that the colors related to UV provide good criteria to distinguish between M giants and M dwarfs, and the variability of RR Lyrae stars in our sample is stronger than that of other A and F stars.", "AuthorKeywords": ["stars: activity", "stars: general", "ultraviolet: stars"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85044171400", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"55943171300": {"Name": "Bai Y.", "AuthorID": "55943171300", "AffiliationID": "60014205, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of Optical Astronomy, National Astronomical Observatories, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "7410101094": {"Name": "Liu J.", "AuthorID": "7410101094", "AffiliationID": "60027363", "AffiliationName": "College of Astronomy and Space Sciences, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "55801683900": {"Name": "Wang S.", "AuthorID": "55801683900", "AffiliationID": "60014205, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of Optical Astronomy, National Astronomical Observatories, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "56789269100": {"Name": "Guo J.", "AuthorID": "56789269100", "AffiliationID": "60014966", "AffiliationName": "Department of Astronomy, Peking University"}, "57206916461": {"Name": "He L.", "AuthorID": "57206916461", "AffiliationID": "60027363", "AffiliationName": "College of Astronomy and Space Sciences, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "36503266200": {"Name": "Wang J.", "AuthorID": "36503266200", "AffiliationID": "60014205, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of Optical Astronomy, National Astronomical Observatories, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "36698644500": {"Name": "Wu Y.", "AuthorID": "36698644500", "AffiliationID": "60014205, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of Optical Astronomy, National Astronomical Observatories, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "55360734400": {"Name": "Dong Y.", "AuthorID": "55360734400", "AffiliationID": "60014205, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of Optical Astronomy, National Astronomical Observatories, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "54405589500": {"Name": "Cao Z.", "AuthorID": "54405589500", "AffiliationID": "60014205, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of Optical Astronomy, National Astronomical Observatories, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "36626823400": {"Name": "Wicker J.", "AuthorID": "36626823400", "AffiliationID": "60014205, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "National Astronomical Observatories, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "57104181400": {"Name": "Qin Y.", "AuthorID": "57104181400", "AffiliationID": "113345443", "AffiliationName": "School of Physics"}, "56074121900": {"Name": "Zhang Y.", "AuthorID": "56074121900", "AffiliationID": "60014205, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "Nanjing Institute of Astronomical Optics and Technology, National Astronomical Observatories, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "46261260000": {"Name": "Hou Y.", "AuthorID": "46261260000", "AffiliationID": "60014205, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "Nanjing Institute of Astronomical Optics and Technology, National Astronomical Observatories, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "57206997529": {"Name": "Wang Y.", "AuthorID": "57206997529", "AffiliationID": "60014205, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "Nanjing Institute of Astronomical Optics and Technology, National Astronomical Observatories, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}}}
