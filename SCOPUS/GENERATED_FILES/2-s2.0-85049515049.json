Despite substantial amounts of effort invested in the area, there has been very little actual deployment of mechanisms to guarantee QoS in the Internet. As a result, the Internet is largely operating on a \u201cbest effort\u201d basis in terms of QoS. Here, we attempt a historical overview in order to better understand how we got to the point where we are today and consider the evolution of QoS/QoE in the future. As we move towards more demanding networking environments where enormous amounts of data is produced at the edge of the network (e.g., from IoT devices), computation will also need to migrate to the edge in order to guarantee QoS. In turn, we argue that distributed computing at the edge of the network will inevitably require infrastructure decentralisation. That said, trust to the infrastructure provider is more difficult to guarantee and new components need to be incorporated into the Internet landscape in order to be able to support emerging applications, but also achieve acceptable service quality. We start from the first steps of ATM and related IP-based technologies, we consider recent proposals for content-oriented and Information-Centric Networking, mobile edge and fog computing, and finally we see how distributed Internet governance through Distributed Ledger Technology and blockchains can influence QoS in future networks.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Blockchain", "Distributed ledger technology", "Fog computing", "Mobile edge computing", "QoE", "QoS"], "IndexKeywords": ["Emerging applications", "Information-centric networkings", "Infrastructure providers", "Mobile Edge Computing", "Network quality of services", "Networking environment", "Networking technology", "Quality of experience (QoE)"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85049515049", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"]], "AuthorData": {"7003707235": {"Name": "Pavlou G.", "AuthorID": "7003707235", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University College London"}, "16048105300": {"Name": "Psaras I.", "AuthorID": "16048105300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University College London"}}}
