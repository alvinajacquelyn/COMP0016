Frequency of fasting, purging, and binge eating was obtained by self-report from 37,592 children and combined into a measure of disordered eating (no, monthly, and weekly). Information on parental characteristics was obtained during pregnancy, from the 7-year follow-up, and by linkage to population registers. Data were analysed using multinomial logistic regression models with robust standard errors. In total, 3.1% reported weekly and 4.1% reported monthly disordered eating. Parental young age, low educational level, and overweight/obesity were associated with disordered eating. The relative risk ratios for, respectively, weekly and monthly disordered eating according to maternal eating disorder were 1.01 [0.75, 1.37] and 1.09 [0.84, 1.42]. Disordered eating is common among children and is associated with several parental characteristics. We found social inequality in disordered eating, but our data did not support an association with maternal eating disorder.", "AuthorKeywords": ["adolescent children", "eating disorder behaviours", "parental factors", "prospective study"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Binge-Eating Disorder", "Bulimia", "Child", "Cohort Studies", "Denmark", "Feeding and Eating Disorders", "Female", "Humans", "Logistic Models", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Obesity", "Overweight", "Parents", "Pregnancy", "Prospective Studies", "Self Report", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85046014563", "SubjectAreas": [["Clinical Psychology", "PSYC", "3203"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"55566247100": {"Name": "Larsen P.S.", "AuthorID": "55566247100", "AffiliationID": "60030840", "AffiliationName": "Section of Epidemiology, Department of Public Health, University of Copenhagen"}, "16318056800": {"Name": "Strandberg-Larsen K.", "AuthorID": "16318056800", "AffiliationID": "60030840", "AffiliationName": "Section of Epidemiology, Department of Public Health, University of Copenhagen"}, "8613208800": {"Name": "Olsen E.M.", "AuthorID": "8613208800", "AffiliationID": "112822026", "AffiliationName": "Healthcare Services, Research Centre for Prevention and Health"}, "26326093000": {"Name": "Nybo Andersen A.M.", "AuthorID": "26326093000", "AffiliationID": "60030840", "AffiliationName": "Section of Epidemiology, Department of Public Health, University of Copenhagen"}, "16031429800": {"Name": "Micali N.", "AuthorID": "16031429800", "AffiliationID": "60009963", "AffiliationName": "Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Division, Department de \u2018enfant et de l\u2019adolescent, HUG"}}}
