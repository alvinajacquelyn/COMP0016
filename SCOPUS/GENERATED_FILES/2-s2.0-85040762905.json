In a cT1N0M0 squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue, pre-operative radionuclide lymphoscintigraphy was performed with a sentinel node-specific radiolabeled tracer. Intraoperatively, a 3D hand-held augmented reality (AR) scanning SPECT probe assessed concordance of the SN with pre-operative SPECT-CT images. The real-time optical video was linked to the SPECT-CT images for added precision. Final guidance to the SN was performed using ICG fluorescence imaging. Dynamic and SPECT-CT showed bilateral lymphatic drainage from the tumor. The 3D hand-held AR SPECT probe SN localization was concordant with pre-operative imaging. The optical video successfully demonstrated the lymphatic drainage in real-time through a unique overlay fluorescence image. The ICG localized to the same nodes identified by both the SPECT-CT and hand-held SPECT images. The use of dual radiation and fluorescence tracers improved SN detection, especially for SN close to the injection site. The hand-held probes allowed the surgeon to dissect continuously, without needing to change tools. The combination of augmented reality, nuclear medicine, and over-lay fluorescence imaging allowed greater accuracy for matching the preoperative imaging with intraoperative identification and precisely guiding the dissection. This method uniquely permitted the surgeon to efficiently dissect the SN with accurate visualization and optimal precision.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Augmented reality", "Fluorescent imaging", "Oral squamous cell cancer", "Precision surgery", "Radio-guided 3D imaging", "Sentinel lymph node"], "IndexKeywords": ["3D imaging", "Fluorescence imaging", "Fluorescence tracers", "Fluorescent imaging", "Near-infrared fluorescence", "Oral squamous cell cancer", "Sentinel lymph nodes", "Squamous cell carcinoma", "Aged", "Carcinoma, Squamous Cell", "Female", "Humans", "Imaging, Three-Dimensional", "Lymphoscintigraphy", "Mouth Neoplasms", "Optical Imaging", "Sentinel Lymph Node", "Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography Computed Tomography"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85040762905", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Clinical Psychology", "PSYC", "3203"], ["Social Sciences (miscellaneous)", "SOCI", "3301"], ["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"], ["Spectroscopy", "CHEM", "1607"], ["Clinical Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1308"], ["Law", "SOCI", "3308"]], "AuthorData": {"35609458500": {"Name": "Chand M.", "AuthorID": "35609458500", "AffiliationID": "60024544, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery and Interventional Sciences, University College London Hospitals, NHS Trusts, GENIE Centre, University College London"}, "55559681100": {"Name": "Keller D.S.", "AuthorID": "55559681100", "AffiliationID": "60024544, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery and Interventional Sciences, University College London Hospitals, NHS Trusts, GENIE Centre, University College London"}, "23992143400": {"Name": "Devoto L.", "AuthorID": "23992143400", "AffiliationID": "60024544, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery and Interventional Sciences, University College London Hospitals, NHS Trusts, GENIE Centre, University College London"}, "57210326557": {"Name": "McGurk M.", "AuthorID": "57210326557", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Head and Neck Centre, University College London Hospitals, NHS Trusts"}}}
