The recovery of glass beads and associated production materials has enabled compositional analysis of the artefacts and preliminary dating of the site, which puts the main timing of glass-working between the eleventh and fifteenth centuries AD. The results of these studies suggest that glass bead manufacture at this site was largely independent of glass-making traditions documented farther afield, and that Igbo Olokun may represent one of the earliest known glass-production workshops in West Africa.", "AuthorKeywords": ["beads", "glass production", "Nigeria", "trade", "Yoruba"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85020284298", "SubjectAreas": [["Archeology", "SOCI", "3302"], ["Arts and Humanities (all)", "ARTS", "1200"]], "AuthorData": {"23033259400": {"Name": "Babalola A.B.", "AuthorID": "23033259400", "AffiliationID": "60005286", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anthropology, Rice University"}, "7005758942": {"Name": "McIntosh S.K.", "AuthorID": "7005758942", "AffiliationID": "60005286", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anthropology, Rice University"}, "24477239200": {"Name": "Dussubieux L.", "AuthorID": "24477239200", "AffiliationID": "60030002", "AffiliationName": "Field Museum of Natural History"}, "57202699283": {"Name": "Rehren T.", "AuthorID": "57202699283", "AffiliationID": "60111307, 60104772", "AffiliationName": "College of Humanities and Social Sciences, HBKU"}}}
