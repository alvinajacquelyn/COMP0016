We carried out a systematic review on the diagnostic accuracy and quality of evidence of these modalities. Methods: Embase, Pubmed and the Cochrane database were searched on 13 February 2017. Diagnostic accuracy studies taking post-surgical seizure outcome as reference standard were selected. Quality appraisal was based on the QUADAS-2 framework. Results: Eleven studies were included: eight MSI (n = 267), three HR-ESI (n = 127) studies. None was free from bias. This mostly involved: selection of operated patients only, interference of source imaging with surgical decision, and exclusion of indeterminate results. Summary sensitivity and specificity estimates were 82% (95% CI: 75\u201388%) and 53% (95% CI: 37\u201368%) for overall source imaging, with no statistical difference between MSI and HR-ESI. Specificity is higher when partially concordant results were included as non-concordant (p < 0.05). Inclusion of indeterminate test results as non-concordant lowered sensitivity (p < 0.05). Conclusions: Source imaging has a relatively high sensitivity but low specificity for identification of the epileptogenic zone. Significance: We need higher quality studies allowing unbiased test evaluation to determine the added value and diagnostic accuracy of source imaging in the presurgical workup of refractory focal epilepsy.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Electroencephalography", "Magnetoencephalography", "Sensitivity", "Source localization", "Specificity", "Surgery"], "IndexKeywords": ["Brain Mapping",
