Networking and communications systems are currently undergoing a substantive transformation on several fronts, promising substantially lower cost, simplified operations, and dramatically faster innovation cycles as traditional barriers to the deployment of innovations are removed. Where in the past networking functions were predominantly implemented using purpose-built hardware, custom protocols, and firmware images, those networking functions are increasingly instantiated through software that is abstracted from hardware, freely programmable, and relying on algorithmic invocation of generic application programming interfaces (APIs). This transformation is best summarized as softwarization of the network, which is, in turn, realized through advances in networking software. These articles exemplify this transformation, providing an excellent cross-section across these facets.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Custom protocols", "Innovation cycles", "Networking and communication", "Special sections"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85020866387", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"6602315335": {"Name": "Clemm A.", "AuthorID": "6602315335", "AffiliationID": "118674829", "AffiliationName": "Huawei's Future Networks Group"}, "6603596791": {"Name": "Galis A.", "AuthorID": "6603596791", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Networked and Service Systems, University College London"}, "14833744200": {"Name": "Gaspary L.P.", "AuthorID": "14833744200", "AffiliationID": "60006726", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Informatics -uFRGS"}, "7005498946": {"Name": "Laplante P.", "AuthorID": "7005498946", "AffiliationID": "60001439", "AffiliationName": "Department of Software and Systems Engineering, Pennsylvania State University"}, "6701710921": {"Name": "De Turck F.", "AuthorID": "6701710921", "AffiliationID": "60033316", "AffiliationName": "Department of Information Technology, Ghent University"}}}
