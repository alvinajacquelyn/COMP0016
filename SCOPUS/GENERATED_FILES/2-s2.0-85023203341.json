Intuition, therefore, suggests that this model would fit naturally within a streaming architecture, where new points of comparison can be inserted directly into the graph as they arrive from the data source. However, the current state of the art has yet to join these two concepts, supporting either temporal analysis on static data or streaming into one-dimensional dynamic graphs. To solve this problem we introduce Raphtory, a temporal graph streaming platform, which maintains a full graph history whilst efficiently inserting new alterations.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Data-source", "Decentralised", "State of the art", "Static datum", "Streaming architecture", "Temporal analysis", "Temporal graphs"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85023203341", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"], ["Hardware and Architecture", "COMP", "1708"], ["Control and Systems Engineering", "ENGI", "2207"], ["Software", "COMP", "1712"]], "AuthorData": {"57193179750": {"Name": "Steer B.", "AuthorID": "57193179750", "AffiliationID": "60022109", "AffiliationName": "Queen Mary University of London"}, "23008194000": {"Name": "Cuadrado F.", "AuthorID": "23008194000", "AffiliationID": "60022109", "AffiliationName": "Queen Mary University of London"}, "56186242800": {"Name": "Clegg R.", "AuthorID": "56186242800", "AffiliationID": "60022109", "AffiliationName": "Queen Mary University of London"}}}
