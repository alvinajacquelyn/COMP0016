Following the formation of the Moon in the aftermath of a giant impact, the resulting Lunar Magma Ocean (LMO) is predicted to have generated major geochemically distinct silicate reservoirs, including the sources of lunar basalts. Samples of these basalts, therefore, provide a unique opportunity to characterize these reservoirs. However, the precise timing and extent of geochemical fractionation is poorly constrained, not least due to the difficulty in determining accurate ages and initial Pb isotopic compositions of lunar basalts. Application of an in situ ion microprobe approach to Pb isotope analysis has allowed us to obtain precise crystallization ages from six lunar basalts, typically with an uncertainty of about \u00b110 Ma, as well as constrain their initial Pb-isotopic compositions. This has enabled construction of a two-stage model for the Pb-isotopic evolution of lunar silicate reservoirs, which necessitates the prolonged existence of high-\u03bc reservoirs in order to explain the very radiogenic compositions of the samples. Further, once firm constraints on U and Pb partitioning behaviour are established, this model has the potential to help distinguish between conflicting estimates for the age of the Moon. Nonetheless, we are able to constrain the timing of a lunar mantle reservoir differentiation event at 4376\u00b118 Ma, which is consistent with that derived from the Sm\u2013Nd and Lu\u2013Hf isotopic systems, and is interpreted as an average estimate of the time at which the high-\u03bc urKREEP reservoir was established and the Ferroan Anorthosite (FAN) suite was formed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["lunar basalts", "lunar magma ocean", "lunar origin", "Pb isotopes", "volcanism"], "IndexKeywords": ["Geochemical fractionations", "Isotopic composition", "Lunar origin", "Magma ocean", "Mantle differentiation", "Partitioning behaviours", "Pb isotopes", "volcanism"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84979609888", "SubjectAreas": [["Geophysics", "EART", "1908"], ["Geochemistry and Petrology", "EART", "1906"], ["Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)", "EART", "1901"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"44761467600": {"Name": "Snape J.F.", "AuthorID": "44761467600", "AffiliationID": "60029183", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geosciences, Swedish Museum of Natural History"}, "6701731963": {"Name": "Nemchin A.A.", "AuthorID": "6701731963", "AffiliationID": "60031226", "AffiliationName": "Department of Applied Geology, Curtin University"}, "23977427000": {"Name": "Bellucci J.J.", "AuthorID": "23977427000", "AffiliationID": "60029183", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geosciences, Swedish Museum of Natural History"}, "7101871222": {"Name": "Whitehouse M.J.", "AuthorID": "7101871222", "AffiliationID": "60028378", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geological Sciences, Stockholm University"}, "35103580500": {"Name": "Tart\u00e8se R.", "AuthorID": "35103580500", "AffiliationID": "60012113", "AffiliationName": "Planetary and Space Sciences, The Open University"}, "55542340000": {"Name": "Barnes J.J.", "AuthorID": "55542340000", "AffiliationID": "60012113", "AffiliationName": "Planetary and Space Sciences, The Open University"}, "23033452800": {"Name": "Anand M.", "AuthorID": "23033452800", "AffiliationID": "60025352", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, The Natural History Museum"}, "7103354128": {"Name": "Crawford I.A.", "AuthorID": "7103354128", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences, Birkbeck College, University of London"}, "14064757000": {"Name": "Joy K.H.", "AuthorID": "14064757000", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "School of Earth, Atmospheric and Environmental Sciences, University of Manchester"}}}
