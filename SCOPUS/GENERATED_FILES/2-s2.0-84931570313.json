Reading to Learn (RtL)was implemented in two districts of Kwale and Kinango in Kenya and of Amolatar and Dokolo in Uganda. This paper looks at parental involvement and their experiences with RtL. Data are obtained from survey responses at baseline and focus group discussions with parents at endline. Findings indicate that parents are key actors in literacy and numeracy of their children. The study underscores the role of parents and context in literacy activities and policy implementation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["experiences", "literacy", "numeracy", "parents", "Reading to Learn"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84931570313", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["Life-span and Life-course Studies", "SOCI", "3319"]], "AuthorData": {"36469657300": {"Name": "Abuya B.", "AuthorID": "36469657300", "AffiliationID": "60070562", "AffiliationName": "Education Research Program, African Population and Health Research Center (APHRC)"}, "11238976200": {"Name": "Oketch M.", "AuthorID": "11238976200", "AffiliationID": "60070562", "AffiliationName": "Education Research Program, African Population and Health Research Center (APHRC)"}, "8547647500": {"Name": "Ngware M.", "AuthorID": "8547647500", "AffiliationID": "60070562", "AffiliationName": "Education Research Program, African Population and Health Research Center (APHRC)"}, "35092990600": {"Name": "Mutisya M.", "AuthorID": "35092990600", "AffiliationID": "60070562", "AffiliationName": "Education Research Program, African Population and Health Research Center (APHRC)"}, "56690660200": {"Name": "K.
