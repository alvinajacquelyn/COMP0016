Demand Response (DR) can help overcoming this issue. This paper investigates how DR with HP can be used for efficient grid operation and which potential exists in the UK. A model has been developed. It allows estimating the impact of introducing HP on the half-hourly load profile on both single dwelling and UK grid level. In the base case scenario it has been shown that grid peak loads would increase by about 6 GW in the winter. On household level, peak loads would approximately triple. DR has the potential to avoid the new peak loads on grid level. On household level, new peak loads can only be reduced. In an ideal case, in the winter peak loads would rise by 2 GW on grid level. In single dwellings peak loads would increase by one quarter. In both cases DR can avoid the new peak loads. The findings confirm results of previous studies regarding future challenges for grid operators. DR can be one of several solutions that help overcoming these obstacles and it should thus be promoted.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Demand response", "Demand side management", "Heat pump", "Model", "Smart grid"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84944080286", "SubjectAreas": [["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"], ["Civil and Structural Engineering", "ENGI", "2205"], ["Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment", "ENER", "2105"], ["Transportation", "SOCI", "3313"]], "AuthorData": {"56028200500": {"Name": "Kreuder L.", "AuthorID": "56028200500", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Energy Institute, University College London, Central House"}, "26039534700": {"Name": "Spataru C.", "AuthorID": "26039534700", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Energy Institute, University College London, Central House"}}}
