The mechanisms and pathways that result in the emergence and subsequent fixation of resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis are not fully understood and recent studies suggest that they are much more complex than initially thought. In this review, we highlight the exciting new areas of research within TB resistance that are beginning to fill these gaps in our understanding, whilst also raising new questions and providing future directions.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Drug resistance", "Molecular mechanisms of resistance", "Tuberculosis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Biological Evolution", "Drug Resistance, Multiple, Bacterial", "Extensively Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis", "Humans", "Mycobacterium tuberculosis", "Tuberculosis, Multidrug-Resistant"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84925261260", "SubjectAreas": [["Microbiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2726"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"56562517400": {"Name": "Fonseca J.", "AuthorID": "56562517400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Clinical Microbiology, University College London"}, "7007165041": {"Name": "McHugh T.", "AuthorID": "7007165041", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Clinical Microbiology, University College London"}, "37034264200": {"Name": "Knight G.", "AuthorID": "37034264200", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "TB Modelling Group, TB Centre, Centre for the Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases, Faculty of Epidemiology and Population Health, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}}}
