Genome-wide association studies have previously found lysyl oxidase (LOX) and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) associated with susceptibility to KC development. The aim of our study was to validate the effects of seven single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within LOX and HGF over KC. Unrelated Czech cases with KC of European descent (108 males and 57 females, 165 cases in total) and 193 population and gender-matched controls were genotyped using Kompetitive Allele Specific PCR assays. Fisher's exact tests were used to assess the strength of associations. Evidence for association was found for both of the tested loci. It was strongest for rs3735520:G>A near HGF (allelic test odds ratio (OR)=1.45; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.06-1.98; P=0.018) with A allele being a risk factor and rs2956540:G>C (OR=0.69; 95% CI, 0.50-0.96; P=0.024) within LOX with C allele having a protective effect. This first independent association validation of rs2956540:G>C and rs3735520:G>A suggests that these SNPs may serve as genetic risk markers for KC in individuals of European descent.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Alleles", "Cornea", "European Continental Ancestry Group", "Female", "Genetic Association Studies", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Genotype", "Hepatocyte Growth Factor", "Humans", "Keratoconus", "Male", "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide", "Scavenger Receptors, Class E"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84944355095", "SubjectAreas": [["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Genetics (clinical)", "MEDI", "2716"]], "AuthorData": {"51763434300": {"Name": "Dudakova L.", "AuthorID": "51763434300", "AffiliationID": "60039507, 60016605", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of the Biology and Pathology of the Eye, Charles University in Prague, General University Hospital in Prague"}, "12773057900": {"Name": "Jirsova K.", "AuthorID": "12773057900", "AffiliationID": "60039507, 60016605", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of the Biology and Pathology of the Eye, Charles University in Prague, General University Hospital in Prague"}, "15066073600": {"Name": "Stranecky V.", "AuthorID": "15066073600", "AffiliationID": "60039507, 60016605", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of the Biology and Pathology of the Eye, Charles University in Prague, General University Hospital in Prague"}, "14119954300": {"Name": "Liskova P.", "AuthorID": "14119954300", "AffiliationID": "60039507, 60016605", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, Charles University in Prague, General University Hospital in Prague"}, "36634543300": {"Name": "Palos M.", "AuthorID": "36634543300", "AffiliationID": "60039507, 60016605", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, Charles University in Prague, General University Hospital in Prague"}, "15064433500": {"Name": "Krepelova A.", "AuthorID": "15064433500", "AffiliationID": "60023469, 60016605", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biology and Medical Genetics, Charles University in Prague, University Hospital Motol"}, "57203644841": {"Name": "Hysi P.G.", "AuthorID": "57203644841", "AffiliationID": "60004111, 60177635", "AffiliationName": "Department of Twin Research and Genetic Epidemiology, King's College London, St. Thomas' Hospital"}}}
