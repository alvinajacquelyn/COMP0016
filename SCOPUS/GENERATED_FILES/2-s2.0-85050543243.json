Speech pathology (SP) assessment and intervention strategies aim to access these sites of communication in order to facilitate participation in life situations for people with communication disorders. Surprisingly, however, there is no explicit theory of communication underpinning SP practice and research. As a result, the conceptual and practical basis for rigorous, empirical measurement of communication remains limited, which is a significant challenge for professional practice and research. This critical review discusses the prevailing ways that co-present communication has been conceptualised and measured in SP. In particular, we examine how models of health have informed current ideas and measurement practices. We argue that although patently valuable for SP, they are largely incommensurate with the realities of co-present communication. Drawing on current empirical research in Sociology and Linguistics, we specify the properties of real-time co-present communication and discuss their relationship to current SP concepts and measurement practices. We conclude by suggesting directions for conceptual development and empirical research that will draw SP assessment and intervention strategies closer to real-time co-present communication.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Communication", "enchrony", "speech pathology"], "IndexKeywords": ["Communication", "Communication Disorders", "Humans", "Speech-Language Pathology"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85050543243", "SubjectAreas": [["Language and Linguistics", "ARTS", "1203"], ["Linguistics and Language", "SOCI", "3310"], ["Speech and Hearing", "HEAL", "3616"]], "AuthorData": {"35279376600": {"Name": "Barnes S.", "AuthorID": "35279376600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Language and Cognition, University College London"}, "15030938100": {"Name": "Bloch S.", "AuthorID": "15030938100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Language and Cognition, University College London"}}}
