This leads to the need for increasing the observability of the grid to enable a series of mission-critical applications such as voltage/congestion control and fault detection/location. The deployment of Phasor Measurement Units appears to be a promising approach, offering high precision grid monitoring. However, while the low delay requirements of such applications raise a significant challenge to the communication infrastructure, there is currently no clear vision on the exact communication technologies and network topologies that could support these requirements. In this paper, we address this challenge by taking a systematic approach on the design of low latency communication infrastructures. Based on a large set of real medium voltage grid topologies from a European distribution network, we first perform a detailed analysis of the communication requirements. Guided by this analysis, we then propose two algorithms, PLeC and BW-PLeC algorithms, for the design of low latency communication infrastructures that enhance the currently available power-line communication technology with newer high-speed communication links at strategic points in the grid to satisfy the delay requirements while reducing deployment costs.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Communication infrastructure", "Communication technologies", "Distributed renewable energy resources", "Dynamic environments", "Electrical distribution networks", "High-speed communication links", "Low-latency communication", "Mission critical applications"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84922426779", "SubjectAreas": [["Communication", "SOCI", "3315"], ["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"]], "AuthorData": {"57188821228": {"Name": "Katsaros K.V.", "AuthorID": "57188821228", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "56508663000": {"Name": "Yang B.", "AuthorID": "56508663000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "14041390300": {"Name": "Chai W.K.", "AuthorID": "14041390300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "7003707235": {"Name": "Pavlou G.", "AuthorID": "7003707235", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
