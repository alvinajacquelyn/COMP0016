Indeed, identifying movement qualities with the intention of co-relating them to specific meanings and choreographic intentions is practically impossible without taking an artist-driven approach. Moreover, equipping dancers with wearable technology in order to accurately track each of their movements is only applicable in controlled laboratory scenarios, therefore not being a viable approach to analyze large scale real-world rehearsals or performances. This paper describes a visualization system that exposes movement qualities for dance through rendering effects. Combining optical flow analysis with depth video information, we were able to estimate the three-dimensional flow for each point in the cloud. This information was used to color point cloud videos with this information, showing potential to be used for the creation of different rendering effects, which are also discussed in this paper. The data used was captured in a non-intrusive manner during the creation process of a dance piece by Portuguese choreographer Rui Lopes Gra? Enabling us to examine nuances and details of the rehearsals' process, which would not be replicable in a laboratory environment.", "AuthorKeywords": ["3D visualization", "Contemporary dance", "Motion capture", "Optical flow", "Point clouds"], "IndexKeywords": ["3D Visualization", "Contemporary dance", "Controlled laboratories", "Laboratory environment", "Motion capture", "Point cloud", "Three dimensional visualization", "Three-dimensional flow"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85055343606", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Human-Computer Interaction", "COMP", "1709"], ["Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition", "COMP", "1707"], ["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"]], "AuthorData": {"55389336300": {"Name": "Dos Anjos R.", "AuthorID": "55389336300", "AffiliationID": "60105900", "AffiliationName": "Black Box-Universidade, NOVA-Faculdade de Ci\u00eacnias Sociais e Humanas"}, "55680659900": {"Name": "Ribeiro C.", "AuthorID": "55680659900", "AffiliationID": "60105900", "AffiliationName": "Black Box-Universidade, NOVA-Faculdade de Ci\u00eacnias Sociais e Humanas"}, "39061205600": {"Name": "Fernandes C.", "AuthorID": "39061205600", "AffiliationID": "60105900", "AffiliationName": "Black Box-Universidade, NOVA-Faculdade de Ci\u00eacnias Sociais e Humanas"}}}
