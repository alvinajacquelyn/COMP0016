{"Title": "A minimal threshold of FANCJ helicase activity is required for its response to replication stress or double-strand break repair", "Year": 2018, "Source": "Nucleic Acids Res.", "Volume": "46", "Issue": 12, "Art.No": null, "PageStart": 6238, "PageEnd": 6256, "CitedBy": 9, "DOI": "10.1093/nar/gky403", "Link": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85050875140&origin=inward", "Abstract": "\u00a9 Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Nucleic Acids Research 2018.Fanconi Anemia (FA) is characterized by bone marrow failure, congenital abnormalities, and cancer. Of over 20 FA-linked genes, FANCJ uniquely encodes a DNA helicase and mutations are also associated with breast and ovarian cancer. fancj -cells are sensitive to DNA interstrand cross-linking (ICL) and replication fork stalling drugs. We delineated the molecular defects of two FA patient-derived FANCJ helicase domain mutations. FANCJ-R707C was compromised in dimerization and helicase processivity, whereas DNA unwinding by FANCJ-H396D was barely detectable. DNA binding and ATP hydrolysis was defective for both FANCJ-R707C and FANCJ-H396D, the latter showing greater reduction. Expression of FANCJ-R707C or FANCJ-H396D in fancj -cells failed to rescue cisplatin or mitomycin sensitivity. Live-cell imaging demonstrated a significantly compromised recruitment of FANCJ-R707C to laser-induced DNA damage. However, FANCJ-R707C expressed in fancj-/- cells conferred resistance to the DNA polymerase inhibitor aphidicolin, G-quadruplex ligand telomestatin, or DNA strand-breaker bleomycin, whereas FANCJ-H396D failed. Thus, a minimal threshold of FANCJ catalytic activity is required to overcome replication stress induced by aphidicolin or telomestatin, or to repair bleomycin-induced DNA breakage. These findings have implications for therapeutic strategies relying on DNA cross-link sensitivity or heightened replication stress characteristic of cancer cells.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85050875140", "SubjectAreas": [["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"]], "AuthorData": {"56363266500": {"Name": "Bharti S.K.", "AuthorID": "56363266500", "AffiliationID": "60017252, 60006577", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Molecular Gerontology, National Institute on Aging, NIH, NIH Biomedical Research Center"}, "7004135663": {"Name": "Sommers J.A.", "AuthorID": "7004135663", "AffiliationID": "60017252, 60006577", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Molecular Gerontology, National Institute on Aging, NIH, NIH Biomedical Research Center"}, "55357530900": {"Name": "Awate S.", "AuthorID": "55357530900", "AffiliationID": "60017252, 60006577", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Molecular Gerontology, National Institute on Aging, NIH, NIH Biomedical Research Center"}, "15043661600": {"Name": "Bellani M.A.", "AuthorID": "15043661600", "AffiliationID": "60017252, 60006577", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Molecular Gerontology, National Institute on Aging, NIH, NIH Biomedical Research Center"}, "56018511200": {"Name": "Khan I.", "AuthorID": "56018511200", "AffiliationID": "60017252, 60006577", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Molecular Gerontology, National Institute on Aging, NIH, NIH Biomedical Research Center"}, "7004866195": {"Name": "Brosh R.M.", "AuthorID": "7004866195", "AffiliationID": "60017252, 60006577", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Molecular Gerontology, National Institute on Aging, NIH, NIH Biomedical Research Center"}, "57193854475": {"Name": "Bradley L.", "AuthorID": "57193854475", "AffiliationID": "60005281, 60006577", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Single Molecule Biophysics, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health"}, "57203191879": {"Name": "King G.A.", "AuthorID": "57203191879", "AffiliationID": "60005281, 60006577", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Single Molecule Biophysics, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health"}, "7004030161": {"Name": "Seol Y.", "AuthorID": "7004030161", "AffiliationID": "60005281, 60006577", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Single Molecule Biophysics, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health"}, "7004275047": {"Name": "Neuman K.C.", "AuthorID": "7004275047", "AffiliationID": "60005281, 60006577", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Single Molecule Biophysics, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health"}, "26029231700": {"Name": "Vidhyasagar V.", "AuthorID": "26029231700", "AffiliationID": "60015186", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemistry, University of Saskatchewan, Health Sciences Building"}, "35489474500": {"Name": "Wu Y.", "AuthorID": "35489474500", "AffiliationID": "60015186", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemistry, University of Saskatchewan, Health Sciences Building"}, "35285657800": {"Name": "Abe T.", "AuthorID": "35285657800", "AffiliationID": "60083539", "AffiliationName": "IFOM, FIRC Institute for Molecular Oncology Foundation"}, "57203182568": {"Name": "Kobayashi K.", "AuthorID": "57203182568", "AffiliationID": "60083539", "AffiliationName": "IFOM, FIRC Institute for Molecular Oncology Foundation"}, "6603317002": {"Name": "Branzei D.", "AuthorID": "6603317002", "AffiliationID": "60083539", "AffiliationName": "IFOM, FIRC Institute for Molecular Oncology Foundation"}, "7005327343": {"Name": "Shin-Ya K.", "AuthorID": "7005327343", "AffiliationID": "60024621", "AffiliationName": "Department of Life Science and Biotechnology Biotechnology Research Institute for Drug Discovery, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST)"}, "8865425500": {"Name": "Kitao H.", "AuthorID": "8865425500", "AffiliationID": "60011047", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Cancer Biology, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Kyushu University"}, "7006198663": {"Name": "Wold M.S.", "AuthorID": "7006198663", "AffiliationID": "60009788, 60024324", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemistry, Carver College of Medicine, University of Iowa"}}}
