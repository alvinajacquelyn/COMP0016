It has been argued that \u2018Big Data\u2019 will provide the necessary catalyst to advance both biomedical research and health economics and outcomes research. However, it is important that we do not succumb to being data rich but information poor. This paper discusses the benefits and challenges of building Big Data, analysing Big Data and making appropriate inferences in order to advance cancer care, using Cancer 2015 (a prospective, longitudinal, genomic cohort study in Victoria, Australia) as a case study. Cancer 2015 has been linked to State and Commonwealth reimbursement databases that have known limitations. This partly reflects the funding arrangements in Australia, a country with both public and private provision, including public funding of private healthcare, and partly the legislative frameworks that govern data linkage. Additionally, linkage is not without time delays and, as such, achieving a contemporaneous database is challenging. Despite these limitations, there is clear value in using linked data and creating Big Data. This paper describes the linked Cancer 2015 dataset, discusses estimation issues given the nature of the data and presents panel regression results that allow us to make possible inferences regarding which patient, disease, genomic and treatment characteristics explain variation in health expenditure.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Australia", "Cohort Studies", "Databases, Factual", "Economics, Medical", "Female", "Genomics", "Health Expenditures", "Humans", "Longitudinal Studies", "Male", "Medical Record Linkage", "Middle Aged", "Neoplasms", "Outcome Assessment (Health Care)", "Prospective Studies"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84958747841", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"], ["Health Policy", "MEDI", "2719"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"14038950500": {"Name": "Lorgelly P.K.", "AuthorID": "14038950500", "AffiliationID": "60019578", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Health Economics, 15 Innovation Walk, Monash University"}, "54786343600": {"Name": "Doble B.", "AuthorID": "54786343600", "AffiliationID": "60019578", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Health Economics, 15 Innovation Walk, Monash University"}, "55608401000": {"Name": "Knott R.J.", "AuthorID": "55608401000", "AffiliationID": "60019578", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Health Economics, 15 Innovation Walk, Monash University"}, "null": {"Name": null, "AuthorID": null, "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "57186794800": {"Name": "Thomas D.M.", "AuthorID": "57186794800", "AffiliationID": "60111214", "AffiliationName": "The Kinghorn Cancer Centre and Garvan Institute"}, "7401924665": {"Name": "Fox S.B.", "AuthorID": "7401924665", "AffiliationID": "60026553", "AffiliationName": "The Department of Pathology, The University of Melbourne"}, "57221726492": {"Name": "Thorne H.", "AuthorID": "57221726492", "AffiliationID": "60111214", "AffiliationName": "The Kinghorn Cancer Centre and Garvan Institute"}, "15846847900": {"Name": "Parisot J.P.", "AuthorID": "15846847900", "AffiliationID": "60111214", "AffiliationName": "The Kinghorn Cancer Centre and Garvan Institute"}, "56145244200": {"Name": "Doig K.", "AuthorID": "56145244200", "AffiliationID": "60111214", "AffiliationName": "The Kinghorn Cancer Centre and Garvan Institute"}, "6602173602": {"Name": "Fellowes A.", "AuthorID": "6602173602", "AffiliationID": "60026553", "AffiliationName": "The Department of Pathology, The University of Melbourne"}, "7003565649": {"Name": "Dobrovic A.", "AuthorID": "7003565649", "AffiliationID": "60006925", "AffiliationName": "School of Cancer Medicine, La Trobe University"}, "26323309200": {"Name": "James P.A.", "AuthorID": "26323309200", "AffiliationID": "60033129", "AffiliationName": "Division of Cancer Medicine, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre"}, "7003275508": {"Name": "Lipton L.", "AuthorID": "7003275508", "AffiliationID": "60005245", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Oncology, The Royal Melbourne Hospital"}, "35398013700": {"Name": "Ashley D.", "AuthorID": "35398013700", "AffiliationID": "60020331, 60021050", "AffiliationName": "The Andrew Love Cancer Centre, Geelong Hospital, Barwon Health"}, "57188558276": {"Name": "Hayes T.", "AuthorID": "57188558276", "AffiliationID": "112745387", "AffiliationName": "Warrnambool Hospital, SouthWest Healthcare"}, "6603009595": {"Name": "McMurrick P.", "AuthorID": "6603009595", "AffiliationID": "60009442", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery, Cabrini Institute, Cabrini Health"}, "56973425400": {"Name": "Richardson G.", "AuthorID": "56973425400", "AffiliationID": "60009442", "AffiliationName": "Department Haematology and Oncology, Cabrini Institute, Cabrini Health"}, "57202692772": {"Name": "Lorgelly P.", "AuthorID": "57202692772", "AffiliationID": "60019578", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Health Economics, Monash University"}, "57193918761": {"Name": "Lucas M.", "AuthorID": "57193918761", "AffiliationID": "60019578", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Preventative Medicine, Alfred Centre, Monash University"}, "55623402100": {"Name": "McNeil J.J.", "AuthorID": "55623402100", "AffiliationID": "60019578", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Preventative Medicine, Alfred Centre, Monash University"}, "8696243400": {"Name": "John T.", "AuthorID": "8696243400", "AffiliationID": "60005087", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Oncology, Olivia Newton John Cancer and Wellness Centre, Austin Health"}}}
