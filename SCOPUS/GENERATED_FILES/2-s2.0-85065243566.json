{"Title": "Sexual Experience before Treatment for Vaginal Agenesis: A Retrospective Review of 137 Women", "Year": 2019, "Source": "J. Pediatr. Adolesc. Gynecol.", "Volume": "32", "Issue": 3, "Art.No": null, "PageStart": 300, "PageEnd": 304, "CitedBy": 6, "DOI": "10.1016/j.jpag.2018.12.005", "Link": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85065243566&origin=inward", "Abstract": "\u00a9 2018 North American Society for Pediatric and Adolescent GynecologyStudy Objective: To summarize the self-reported sexual experiences of women with vaginal agenesis before treatment and discuss the clinical implications. Design: A retrospective review of pretreatment baseline sexuality data and medical records of women with vaginal agenesis seeking vaginal construction. Setting: A specialist multidisciplinary center for women with genital differences associated with diverse sex development. Participants: One hundred thirty-seven women with untreated vaginal agenesis associated with Mayer-Rokitansky-K\u00fcster-Hauser Syndrome and complete androgen insensitivity syndrome aged 15 to 41 years (mean age, 20 years). Interventions: Gynecological examination and completion of questionnaires. Main Outcome Measures: (1) Sexual Experiences Questionnaire; (2) Multidimensional Sexuality Questionnaire; (3) Vaginal Self-Perceptions; and (4) vaginal length. Results: A sizable proportion of women reported having had sexually intimate experiences before any medical intervention on the vagina. Vaginal length, which ranged from dimple to 7 cm and averaged 2.7 cm for the cohort, was unrelated to the range of sexual experiences. Most women perceived their vagina as being too small, but less than half believed that a sexual partner would notice this. Two-thirds of the cohort subsequently completed the dilation program, which was not predicted by pretreatment vaginal length or sexual experience. Conclusion: Contrary to the assumption that a vagina of certain dimensions is a prerequisite for women to \u201chave sex,\u201d many women with Mayer-Rokitansky-K\u00fcster-Hauser syndrome and complete androgen insensitivity syndrome reported having experienced genital and nongenital sexual activities with no medical interventions. It is recommended that treatment providers affirm women's capacity for sexual intimacy, relationships, and enjoyment before they introduce the topic of vaginal construction as a non-urgent choice.", "AuthorKeywords": ["CAIS", "Clinical psychology", "DSD", "Intersex", "MRKHS", "Multidimensional Sexuality Questionnaire", "Sexual Experience Questionnaire", "Sexual health", "Vaginal agenesis", "Vaginal dilation"], "IndexKeywords": ["46, XX Disorders of Sex Development", "Adolescent", "Adult", "Androgen-Insensitivity Syndrome", "Congenital Abnormalities", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Mullerian Ducts", "Reconstructive Surgical Procedures", "Retrospective Studies", "Self Concept", "Self Report", "Sexual Behavior", "Treatment Outcome", "Vagina", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85065243566", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Obstetrics and Gynecology", "MEDI", "2729"]], "AuthorData": {"57162842500": {"Name": "Dear J.", "AuthorID": "57162842500", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Women's Health Division, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7006425955": {"Name": "Creighton S.M.", "AuthorID": "7006425955", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Women's Health Division, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "35475924300": {"Name": "Conway G.S.", "AuthorID": "35475924300", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Women's Health Division, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57161815600": {"Name": "Williams L.", "AuthorID": "57161815600", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Women's Health Division, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7202542438": {"Name": "Liao L.M.", "AuthorID": "7202542438", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Women's Health Division, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
