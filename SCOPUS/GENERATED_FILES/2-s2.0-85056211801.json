Participants (N = 1654) provided information about two or more relationships (kin, friends, and romantic relationships), indicating whether these had originated in online or offline venues. Attachment, attraction and communication were assessed for each relationship. Relationship security was predicted by attraction, but the effects of venue were limited to avoidance towards online romantic relationships. Personality, gaming motivation, age and sex all made negligible contributions to relationship security. Limitations, including the correlational nature of the data and the high proportion of male participants, as well as suggestions for how relationship research might proceed in an increasingly online world, are discussed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Attachment", "Attraction", "Communication", "Online and offline", "Relationship"], "IndexKeywords": ["Attachment", "Attraction", "Massively multiplayer", "Offline", "Potential difference", "Relationship", "Romantic relationship", "Virtual worlds"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85056211801", "SubjectAreas": [["Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)", "ARTS", "1201"], ["Human-Computer Interaction", "COMP", "1709"], ["Psychology (all)", "PSYC", "3200"]], "AuthorData": {"7003391723": {"Name": "Coulson M.", "AuthorID": "7003391723", "AffiliationID": "60014105", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Faculty of Science & Technology, Middlesex University"}, "25522338100": {"Name": "Oskis A.", "AuthorID": "25522338100", "AffiliationID": "60014105", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Faculty of Science & Technology, Middlesex University"}, "57204575638": {"Name": "Meredith J.", "AuthorID": "57204575638", "AffiliationID": "60014105", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Faculty of Science & Technology, Middlesex University"}, "35452972800": {"Name": "Gould R.", "AuthorID": "35452972800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, Faculty of Brain Sciences, University College London"}}}
