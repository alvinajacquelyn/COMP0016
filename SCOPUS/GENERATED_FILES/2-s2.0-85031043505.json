Parametric mapping with CMR now permits the routine spatial visualization and quantification of changes in myocardial composition based on changes in T1, T2, and T2 (star) relaxation times and extracellular volume (ECV). These changes include specific disease pathways related to mainly intracellular disturbances of the cardiomyocyte (e.g., iron overload, or glycosphingolipid accumulation in Anderson-Fabry disease); extracellular disturbances in the myocardial interstitium (e.g., myocardial fibrosis or cardiac amyloidosis from accumulation of collagen or amyloid proteins, respectively); or both (myocardial edema with increased intracellular and/or extracellular water). Parametric mapping promises improvements in patient care through advances in quantitative diagnostics, inter- and intra-patient comparability, and relatedly improvements in treatment. There is a multitude of technical approaches and potential applications. This document provides a summary of the existing evidence for the clinical value of parametric mapping in the heart as of mid 2017, and gives recommendations for practical use in different clinical scenarios for scientists, clinicians, and CMR manufacturers.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Consensus", "Europe", "Heart", "Heart Diseases", "Humans", "Image Processing, Computer-Assisted", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Societies, Medical"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85031043505", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiological and Ultrasound Technology", "HEAL", "3614"], ["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"], ["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"6603344046": {"Name": "Messroghli D.R.", "AuthorID": "6603344046", "AffiliationID": "60106629", "AffiliationName": "DZHK (German Centre for Cardiovascular Research), Partner Site Berlin"}, "7403231345": {"Name": "Moon J.C.", "AuthorID": "7403231345", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60004093", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Barts Heart Centre"}, "35224811100": {"Name": "Ferreira V.M.", "AuthorID": "35224811100", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Oxford Centre for Clinical Magnetic Resonance Research, Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, Radcliffe Department of Medicine, University of Oxford"}, "16199663600": {"Name": "Grosse-Wortmann L.", "AuthorID": "16199663600", "AffiliationID": "60030319, 60016849", "AffiliationName": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Pediatrics, Hospital for Sick Children, University of Toronto"}, "34570131700": {"Name": "He T.", "AuthorID": "34570131700", "AffiliationID": "60010426, 60029329, 60033387", "AffiliationName": "Cardiovascular Science Research Centre, St george'S, University of London"}, "7004851504": {"Name": "Kellman P.", "AuthorID": "7004851504", "AffiliationID": "60006577", "AffiliationName": "National Institutes of Health"}, "6507613914": {"Name": "Mascherbauer J.", "AuthorID": "6507613914", "AffiliationID": "100396173", "AffiliationName": "Department of Internal Medicine II, Division of Cardiology"}, "7801614200": {"Name": "Nezafat R.", "AuthorID": "7801614200", "AffiliationID": "60002746, 60030058", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Cardiovascular Division, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School"}, "7103020754": {"Name": "Salerno M.", "AuthorID": "7103020754", "AffiliationID": "60029418", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Medicine Cardiology Division, Radiology and Medical Imaging, and Biomedical Engineering, University of Virginia Health System"}, "8870007100": {"Name": "Schelbert E.B.", "AuthorID": "8870007100", "AffiliationID": "60015543", "AffiliationName": "Clinical and Translational Science Institute, University of Pittsburgh"}, "55432818700": {"Name": "Taylor A.J.", "AuthorID": "55432818700", "AffiliationID": "60008014, 60033409", "AffiliationName": "Alfred Hospital, Baker Heart and Diabetes Institute"}, "55364294200": {"Name": "Thompson R.", "AuthorID": "55364294200", "AffiliationID": "60030835", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Alberta"}, "6505813232": {"Name": "Ugander M.", "AuthorID": "6505813232", "AffiliationID": "60019295, 60012311", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Physiology, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital"}, "10340726400": {"Name": "Van Heeswijk R.B.", "AuthorID": "10340726400", "AffiliationID": "60023561, 60000239", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Lausanne University Hospital (CHUV), Lausanne University (UNIL)"}, "7202067435": {"Name": "Friedrich M.G.", "AuthorID": "7202067435", "AffiliationID": "60002306", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Cardiac Sciences and Radiology, University of Calgary"}}}
