We measure multiple inequity in health care relating to multiple equity-relevant variables \u2013 including income, gender, ethnicity, rurality, insurance status and others \u2013 and decompose the contribution of each variable to multiple inequity. Our approach encompasses the standard bivariate approach as a special case in which there is only one equity-relevant variable, such as income. We illustrate through an application to physician visits in Brazil, using data from the Health and Health Care Supplement of the Brazilian National Household Sample Survey, comprising 391,868 individuals in the year 2008. We find that health insurance coverage and urban location both contribute more to multiple inequity than income. We hope this approach will help researchers and analysts shed light on the comparative size and importance of the many different inequities in health care of interest to decision makers, rather than focus narrowly on income-related inequity.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Brazil", "Concentration curve", "Income-related inequality", "Unfair inequality"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Brazil", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Educational Status", "Female", "Health Services Accessibility", "Health Status Disparities", "Healthcare Disparities", "Humans", "Income", "Logistic Models", "Male", "Middle Aged"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85062512093", "SubjectAreas": [["Health (social science)", "SOCI", "3306"], ["History and Philosophy of Science", "ARTS", "1207"]], "AuthorData": {"57203187464": {"Name": "Barbosa E.C.", "AuthorID": "57203187464", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Applied Health Research, UCL"}, "55968290000": {"Name": "Cookson R.", "AuthorID": "55968290000", "AffiliationID": "60016418", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Health Economics, University of York"}}}
