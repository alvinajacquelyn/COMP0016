The model is suggested based on a correlation for the critical wave amplitude for drop detachment proposed by Al-Wahaibi et al. (2007) and an experimentally derived formula of the maximum wave amplitude at different phase flow rates in stratified flows that uses previous data with different viscosity oils. The proposed model was found to satisfactorily predict published experimental data when relatively low viscosity oils were used (less than or equal to 12 mPa.s cp) but was found to over-predict the velocities necessary for drop formation for higher viscosity oils (greater than 28 mPa.s).", "AuthorKeywords": ["Non-stratified", "Oil-water flow", "Onset of drop formation", "Stratified", "Wave amplitude correlation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Non-stratified", "Oil water flow", "Semi-empirical modeling", "Stratified", "Wave amplitudes"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84908199222", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"]], "AuthorData": {"16240748300": {"Name": "Al-Wahaibi T.", "AuthorID": "16240748300", "AffiliationID": "60071768", "AffiliationName": "Department of Petroleum and Chemical Engineering, Sultan Qaboos University"}, "7004488806": {"Name": "Angeli P.", "AuthorID": "7004488806", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}}}
