We tested whether LMNA mutation DNA location and mutation subtype can predict phenotype severity in patients with lamin heart disease. Methods We used a semantic workflow platform and manual electronic literature search to identify published LMNA mutations with cardiac-predominant phenotype. Hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) assembled lamin heart disease into classes based on phenotype severity. 176 reported causative mutations were classified and any relationships to mutation location/subtype assessed by contingency analysis. Results More adverse phenotype was associated with mutation location upstream of the NLS (p=0.014, OR 2.38, 95% CI 1.19 to 4.80) but not with non-missense mutations (p=0.337, OR 1.36, 95% CI 0.72 to 2.57), although an association with non-missense mutations was identified in a subcluster with malignant ventricular arrhythmia (p=0.005, OR 2.64, 95% CI 0.76 to 9.21). HCA limited to the 65 mutations described on ClinVar as pathogenic/likely pathogenic showed similar findings (upstream of NLS, p=0.030, OR 4.78, 95% CI 1.28 to 17.83; non-missense, p=0.121, OR 2.64, 95% CI 0.76 to 9.21) as did analysis limited to pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants according to the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics standards. Conclusion Cardiac patients with an LMNA mutation located upstream versus downstream of the NLS have a more adverse cardiac phenotype, and some missense mutations can be as harmful as non-missense ones.", "AuthorKeywords": ["gene association", "heart failure", "systolic dysfunction"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85056264255", "SubjectAreas": [["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"6506837383": {"Name": "Captur G.", "AuthorID": "6506837383", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}, "57193206732": {"Name": "Radenkovic D.", "AuthorID": "57193206732", "AffiliationID": "60004093", "AffiliationName": "Barts Heart Centre, Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance Imaging Unit, St Bartholomew's Hospital"}, "7403231345": {"Name": "Moon J.", "AuthorID": "7403231345", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}, "8892126000": {"Name": "Syrris P.", "AuthorID": "8892126000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}, "56672467900": {"Name": "McKenna W.", "AuthorID": "56672467900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}, "7006508645": {"Name": "Arbustini E.", "AuthorID": "7006508645", "AffiliationID": "60015197, 60026556", "AffiliationName": "Center for Inherited Cardiovascular Diseases, Foundation IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo, University of Pavia"}, "37115814000": {"Name": "O'Brien B.", "AuthorID": "37115814000", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "William Harvey Research Institute, Charterhouse Square, Barts, London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London"}}}
