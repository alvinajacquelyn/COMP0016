Evolutionary rescue is more likely in populations that have been previously exposed to lower doses of the same stressor. Environmental fluctuations might also reduce the possibility of rescue, but little is known about the effect of evolutionary history on the likelihood of rescue. In this study, we hypothesised that the ubiquitous operation of generalised stress responses in many organisms increases the likelihood of rescue after exposure to other stressors. We tested this hypothesis with experimental populations that had been exposed to long-term starvation and were then selected on different, unrelated stressors. We found that prior adaptation to starvation imposes contrary effects on the plastic and evolutionary responses of populations to subsequent stressors. When first exposed to new stressors, such populations become extinct more often. If they survive the initial exposure to the new stressors, however, they are more likely to undergo evolutionary rescue.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Adaptation", "Evolutionary history", "Evolutionary rescue", "Evolutionary response", "Extinction", "General environmental stress response", "Phenotypic plasticity", "Plastic (physiological) response", "Saccharomyces paradoxus", "Stressors"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adaptation, Physiological", "Biological Evolution", "Saccharomyces", "Selection, Genetic"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84969389435", "SubjectAreas": [["Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics", "AGRI", "1105"]], "AuthorData": {"36467024200": {"Name": "Samani P.", "AuthorID": "36467024200", "AffiliationID": "60002494", "AffiliationName": "Biology Department, McGill University"}, "57203234280": {"Name": "Bell G.", "AuthorID": "57203234280", "AffiliationID": "60002494", "AffiliationName": "Biology Department, McGill University"}}}
