Most studies that report risk factors are flawed by the inclusion of patients on immunosuppression, which is likely to reduce the risk. Objective: To create a prognostic score to predict the risk of GMG. Methods: Multicenter retrospective cohort of patients with ocular myasthenia gravis for minimum 3 months, untreated with immunosuppression for minimum 2 years or until GMG onset. Results: One hundred one (57 female) patients were included, with median follow-up of 8.4 years (2-42) from disease onset. Thirty-one developed GMG at median of 1.31 years (3.5 months-20.2 years); 19 occurred within 2 years. Univariable logistic regression analysis produced 3 significant predictors (P < 0.10), adjusted odds ratios in a multivariable logistic model (\u03c72P = 0.01) with multiple imputations for missing data: seropositivity, 5.64 (95% CI, 1.45-21.97); presence of 1 or more comorbidities including autoimmune disorders, 6.49 (95% CI, 0.78-53.90); thymic hyperplasia, 5.41 (95% CI, 0.39-75.43). Prognostic score was derived from the coefficients of the logistic model: sum of the points (1 point for the presence of each of the above predictive factors), classified \"low risk\" if <1 and \"high risk\" if >2. Predicted probabilities were 0.07 (SD, 0.03) for low risk and 0.39 (SD, 0.09) for high risk. Negative predictive value was 91% (95% CI, 79-98), positive predictive value was 38% (95% CI, 23-54), sensitivity was 79% (95% CI, 54-94), specificity was 63% (95% CI, 50-74), area under receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.74 (95% CI, 0.64-0.85). Conclusions: In this preliminary study, we have shown by proof of principle that it is possible to stratify risk of GMG: an approach that may allow us to better counsel patients at diagnosis, complement decision-making, and move us toward addressing the question of modifying GMG risk in high-risk patients. Furthermore, the effect of comorbidities is novel and demands further elucidation.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Disease Progression", "Eye Movements", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Forecasting", "Humans", "Incidence", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Myasthenia Gravis", "Oculomotor Muscles", "Retrospective Studies", "Risk Assessment", "Sample Size"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84962052453", "SubjectAreas": [["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"55311660700": {"Name": "Wong S.H.", "AuthorID": "55311660700", "AffiliationID": "60020736", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuro-Ophthalmology, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "57203026074": {"Name": "Plant G.T.", "AuthorID": "57203026074", "AffiliationID": "60020736", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuro-Ophthalmology, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "35974110300": {"Name": "Petrie A.", "AuthorID": "35974110300", "AffiliationID": "60013985, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Biostatistics Unit, University College London, Eastman Dental Institute"}}}
