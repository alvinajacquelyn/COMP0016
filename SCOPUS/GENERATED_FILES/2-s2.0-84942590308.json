All rights reserved.Purpose of review: Here, we examine data on the long-term durability of endoscopic therapy in patients with mucosal neoplasia in Barrett's esophagus. Recent findings: Short-term success is seen in most patients undergoing endoscopic therapy for Barrett's esophagus neoplasia, but long-term outcomes are only just becoming available. Summary: The incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) continues to rise with poor survival seen in the majority of patients. The only known precursor to EAC is Barrett's esophagus. Although the risk of progression from metaplastic Barrett's esophagus to neoplasia is low, surveillance is advocated as patients who progress to mucosal neoplasia carry a significantly higher risk of progressing to invasive EAC. Minimally invasive endoscopic therapy with endoscopic resection and radiofrequency ablation are now the gold standard treatments for patients with intramucosal neoplasia in Barrett's esophagus. After successful treatment, follow-up is still required as long-term durability is not 100% and recurrences are not rare. This review highlights the need for vigilant follow-up, but emphasizes the consensus that most patients have durable disease reversal.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Barrett's esophagus", "Endoscopic resection", "Esophageal cancer", "Radiofrequency ablation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adenocarcinoma", "Barrett Esophagus", "Catheter Ablation", "Esophageal Neoplasms", "Esophagoscopy", "Humans", "Neoplasm Recurrence, Local", "Precancerous Conditions", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84942590308", "SubjectAreas": [["Gastroenterology", "MEDI", "2715"]], "AuthorData": {"37120187600": {"Name": "Haidry R.", "AuthorID": "37120187600", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gastroenterology and Endoscopy, University College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57203948405": {"Name": "Lovat L.", "AuthorID": "57203948405", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Surgery and Interventional Science, Research Department for Tissue and Energy, University College London, UCL, Hospitals NHS Foundation"}}}
