However, not all aggregation conditions promote oligomer formation in vitro, raising the question whether oligomer formation in vivo also requires a specific suitable cellular environment. We recently found that interaction with neuronal membranes initiates aggregation of A\u03b2-42 and neuronal uptake. Our data suggest that small molecules in the extracellular space can facilitate the formation of membrane-active A\u03b2-42 oligomers. We analyzed the early stage of A\u03b2-42 aggregation in the presence of glucose and sucrose and found that these sugars strongly favor A\u03b2-42 oligomer formation. We characterized oligomers by dynamic light scattering, atomic force microscopy, immuno-transmission electron microscopy and fluorescence cross correlation spectroscopy. We found that A\u03b2-42 spontaneously and rapidly forms low molecular weight oligomers in the presence of sugars. Slightly acidic pH (6.7-7) greatly favors oligomer formation when compared to the extracellular physiological pH (7.4). Circular dichroism demonstrated that these A\u03b2-42 oligomers did not adopt a \u03b2-sheet structure. Unstructured oligomeric A\u03b2-42 interacted with membrane bilayers of giant unilamellar vesicles (GUV) and neuronal model cells, facilitated cellular uptake of A\u03b2-42, and inhibition of mitochondrial activity. Our data therefore suggest that elevated concentrations of glucose within the range observed in diabetic individuals (10 mM) facilitate the formation of membrane-active A\u03b2-42 oligomers.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Amyloid beta-Peptides", "Circular Dichroism", "Dynamic Light Scattering", "Glucose", "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration", "Microscopy, Atomic Force", "Microscopy, Electron, Transmission", "Peptide Fragments", "Protein Multimerization", "Protein Structure, Secondary", "Spectrometry, Fluorescence", "Sucrose"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85024839492", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"]], "AuthorData": {"57191108365": {"Name": "Kedia N.", "AuthorID": "57191108365", "AffiliationID": "60010261", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Washington University"}, "57195033337": {"Name": "Almisry M.", "AuthorID": "57195033337", "AffiliationID": "60010261", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Washington University"}, "7801468972": {"Name": "Bieschke J.", "AuthorID": "7801468972", "AffiliationID": "60010261", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Washington University"}}}
