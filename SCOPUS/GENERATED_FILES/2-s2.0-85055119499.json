The observation of atypical dose-response curves when some compounds were tested against multidrug resistant malaria parasite strains guided the optimization process to define a chemical space that led to typical sigmoidal dose-response and complete kill of multidrug resistant parasites. After a structure and property analysis identified such a chemical space, compounds were prepared that displayed suitable activity, ADME, and safety profiles with respect to cytotoxicity and hERG inhibition.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Absorption, Physicochemical", "Animals", "Antimalarials", "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug", "Drug Resistance, Multiple", "Imidazoles", "Mice", "Plasmodium falciparum", "Pyridines", "Structure-Activity Relationship", "Tissue Distribution"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85055119499", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Medicine", "BIOC", "1313"], ["Drug Discovery", "PHAR", "3002"]], "AuthorData": {"37102075200": {"Name": "Le Manach C.", "AuthorID": "37102075200", "AffiliationID": "60000356", "AffiliationName": "Drug Discovery and Development Center (H3D), Department of Chemistry, University of Cape Town"}, "55522760300": {"Name": "Paquet T.", "AuthorID": "55522760300", "AffiliationID": "60000356", "AffiliationName": "Drug Discovery and Development Center (H3D), Department of Chemistry, University of Cape Town"}, "55701599700": {"Name": "Wicht K.", "AuthorID": "55701599700", "AffiliationID": "60000356", "AffiliationName": "Drug Discovery and Development Center (H3D), Department of Chemistry, University of Cape Town"}, "6507265353": {"Name": "Nchinda A.T.", "AuthorID": "6507265353", "AffiliationID": "60000356", "AffiliationName": "Drug Discovery and Development Center (H3D), Department of Chemistry, University of Cape Town"}, "57212727139": {"Name": "Eyermann C.J.", "AuthorID": "57212727139", "AffiliationID": "60000356", "AffiliationName": "Drug Discovery and Development Center (H3D), Department of Chemistry, University of Cape Town"}, "6701546201": {"Name": "Basarab G.S.", "AuthorID": "6701546201", "AffiliationID": "60000356", "AffiliationName": "Drug Discovery and Development Center (H3D), Department of Chemistry, University of Cape Town"}, "57196494370": {"Name": "Street L.J.", "AuthorID": "57196494370", "AffiliationID": "60000356", "AffiliationName": "Drug Discovery and Development Center (H3D), Department of Chemistry, University of Cape Town"}, "6701390378": {"Name": "Chibale K.", "AuthorID": "6701390378", "AffiliationID": "60000356, 60028973", "AffiliationName": "South African Medical Research Council, Drug Discovery and Development Research Unit, Department of Chemistry, Institute of Infectious Disease and Molecular Medicine, University of Cape Town"}, "35271447100": {"Name": "Brunschwig C.", "AuthorID": "35271447100", "AffiliationID": "60000356", "AffiliationName": "H3D, Division of Clinical Pharmacology, Department of Medicine, University of Cape Town"}, "55360363000": {"Name": "Njoroge M.", "AuthorID": "55360363000", "AffiliationID": "60000356", "AffiliationName": "H3D, Division of Clinical Pharmacology, Department of Medicine, University of Cape Town"}, "26326254000": {"Name": "Gibhard L.", "AuthorID": "26326254000", "AffiliationID": "60000356", "AffiliationName": "H3D, Division of Clinical Pharmacology, Department of Medicine, University of Cape Town"}, "7406866898": {"Name": "Taylor D.", "AuthorID": "7406866898", "AffiliationID": "60000356", "AffiliationName": "H3D, Division of Clinical Pharmacology, Department of Medicine, University of Cape Town"}, "56531523300": {"Name": "Lawrence N.", "AuthorID": "56531523300", "AffiliationID": "60000356", "AffiliationName": "H3D, Division of Clinical Pharmacology, Department of Medicine, University of Cape Town"}, "6603435031": {"Name": "Wittlin S.", "AuthorID": "6603435031", "AffiliationID": "60023588", "AffiliationName": "University of Basel"}, "57196631974": {"Name": "Duffy J.", "AuthorID": "57196631974", "AffiliationID": "101504358", "AffiliationName": "Medicines for Malaria Venture, ICC"}, "7005747441": {"Name": "Fish P.V.", "AuthorID": "7005747441", "AffiliationID": "60107285", "AffiliationName": "Francis Crick Institute"}}}
