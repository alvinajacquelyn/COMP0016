We describe motor and nonmotor features of G209A SNCA mutation carriers. Methods: Longitudinal clinical assessments over 2 years were collected in 22 symptomatic and 8 asymptomatic G209A SNCA mutation carriers. Motor and nonmotor rating scales were administered. Correlations were performed between clinical variables and disease duration or age. Penetrance was calculated using Kaplan-Meier survival curves. Results: Asymptomatic carriers did not manifest clear premotor symptoms, but symptomatic carriers often reported that olfactory dysfunction and rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder preceded motor symptoms. Prominent motor decline and deterioration of autonomic and cognitive function occurred at follow-up; such nonmotor features correlated with disease duration, but not age. Disease penetrance was estimated at around 90%. Conclusions: This study may help to inform clinical trials and provide the basis for studies of disease modifiers in genetic synucleinopathy cohorts. \u00a9 2016 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.", "AuthorKeywords": ["A53T", "alpha-synuclein", "asymptomatic", "Parkinson's disease", "penetrance"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "alpha-Synuclein", "Autonomic Nervous System Diseases", "Dementia", "Female", "Heterozygote", "Humans", "Longitudinal Studies", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Mutation", "Olfaction Disorders", "Parkinson Disease", "Penetrance", "Psychotic Disorders"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84963811810", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"56430631100": {"Name": "Papadimitriou D.", "AuthorID": "56430631100", "AffiliationID": "60003185", "AffiliationName": "Biomedical Research Foundation, Academy of Athens (BRFAA)"}, "7005729041": {"Name": "Papadimitriou A.", "AuthorID": "7005729041", "AffiliationID": "60022782", "AffiliationName": "Henry Dunant Hospital Center"}, "12790281200": {"Name": "Maniati M.", "AuthorID": "12790281200", "AffiliationID": "60003185", "AffiliationName": "Biomedical Research Foundation, Academy of Athens (BRFAA)"}, "57188849793": {"Name": "Papagiannakis N.", "AuthorID": "57188849793", "AffiliationID": "60015528, 60028900, 60067083", "AffiliationName": "Second Department of Neurology, \u201cAttikon\u201d University Hospital, Medical School, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens"}, "57202963715": {"Name": "Stefanis L.", "AuthorID": "57202963715", "AffiliationID": "60015528, 60028900, 60067083", "AffiliationName": "Second Department of Neurology, \u201cAttikon\u201d University Hospital, Medical School, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens"}, "42261006800": {"Name": "Antonelou R.", "AuthorID": "42261006800", "AffiliationID": "60015528, 60028900, 60067083", "AffiliationName": "Second Department of Neurology, \u201cAttikon\u201d University Hospital, Medical School, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens"}, "57217879191": {"Name": "Leonardos A.", "AuthorID": "57217879191", "AffiliationID": "60015528, 60028900, 60067083", "AffiliationName": "Second Department of Neurology, \u201cAttikon\u201d University Hospital, Medical School, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens"}, "15834998200": {"Name": "Koros C.", "AuthorID": "15834998200", "AffiliationID": "60015528, 60028900, 60067083", "AffiliationName": "Second Department of Neurology, \u201cAttikon\u201d University Hospital, Medical School, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens"}, "56575103000": {"Name": "Simitsi A.", "AuthorID": "56575103000", "AffiliationID": "60015528, 60028900, 60067083", "AffiliationName": "Second Department of Neurology, \u201cAttikon\u201d University Hospital, Medical School, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens"}, "15770367100": {"Name": "Papageorgiou S.G.", "AuthorID": "15770367100", "AffiliationID": "60015528, 60028900, 60067083", "AffiliationName": "Second Department of Neurology, \u201cAttikon\u201d University Hospital, Medical School, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens"}, "57208560010": {"Name": "Stamelou M.", "AuthorID": "57208560010", "AffiliationID": "60029813", "AffiliationName": "Movement Disorders Department, Hygeia Hospital"}, "35622400500": {"Name": "Miligkos M.", "AuthorID": "35622400500", "AffiliationID": "60016674, 60025812", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Biomathematics, School of Medicine University of Thessaly"}, "55977734100": {"Name": "Bostantjopoulou S.", "AuthorID": "55977734100", "AffiliationID": "60015331", "AffiliationName": "Third University Department of Neurology of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki"}, "6701539777": {"Name": "Kapaki E.", "AuthorID": "6701539777", "AffiliationID": "60007844, 60028900, 60067083", "AffiliationName": "First Department of Neurology, \u201cEginition\u201d University Hospital, Medical School, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens"}, "23088255000": {"Name": "Alcalay R.N.", "AuthorID": "23088255000", "AffiliationID": "60027565", "AffiliationName": "Columbia University Medical Center"}, "6603958974": {"Name": "Athanassiadou A.", "AuthorID": "6603958974", "AffiliationID": "60031155", "AffiliationName": "Department of General Biology, Medical Faculty, University of Patras"}}}
