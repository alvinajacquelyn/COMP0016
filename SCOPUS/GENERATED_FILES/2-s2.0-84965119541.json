Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the British Journal of Anaesthesia. All rights reserved.The recent outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD) has required the treatment of affected patients in the NHS system within the UK. Managing patients with a confirmed viral haemorrhagic fever requires a thorough understanding of treatment options within the confines of an effective biocontainment setting. The Royal Free Hospital High Level Isolation Unit (HLIU) in London, is a purpose built facility that allows healthcare workers to safely treat patients with highly contagious diseases. This HLIU uses Trexler isolator tents to prevent the spread of infection from patients to healthcare workers. Provision of invasive organ support can be provided in this environment, if considered appropriate, and is achievable without posing additional risk to staff. We report our recent experiences of managing patients with EVD, with particular focus on those aspects of care pertinent to anaesthesia and critical care medicine.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Anaesthesia", "critical care", "Ebola haemorrhagic fever", "Ebola virus", "multiple organ failure", "viral haemorrhagic fever"], "IndexKeywords": ["Analgesia", "Conscious Sedation", "Critical Care", "Health Personnel", "Hemorrhagic Fever, Ebola", "Humans", "Infection Control", "Infectious Disease Transmission, Patient-to-Professional", "Patient Isolation", "Patient Isolators", "Respiration, Artificial", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84965119541", "SubjectAreas": [["Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine", "MEDI", "2703"]], "AuthorData": {"24594583700": {"Name": "Martin D.", "AuthorID": "24594583700", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Centre for Altitude Space and Extreme Environment Medicine, UCLH NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, Institute of Sport and Exercise Health"}, "57190834827": {"Name": "Howard J.", "AuthorID": "57190834827", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Critical Care Unit, Centre for Altitude Space and Extreme Environment Medicine, UCLH NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, Institute of Sport and Exercise Health"}, "57214017825": {"Name": "Agarwal B.", "AuthorID": "57214017825", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Critical Care Unit, Centre for Altitude Space and Extreme Environment Medicine, UCLH NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, Institute of Sport and Exercise Health"}, "23028544400": {"Name": "Rajalingam Y.", "AuthorID": "23028544400", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Critical Care Unit, Centre for Altitude Space and Extreme Environment Medicine, UCLH NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, Institute of Sport and Exercise Health"}, "57016861800": {"Name": "Athan B.", "AuthorID": "57016861800", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Infectious Diseases Department, Royal Free Hospital"}, "8203699300": {"Name": "Bhagani S.", "AuthorID": "8203699300", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Infectious Diseases Department, Royal Free Hospital"}, "6602228387": {"Name": "Cropley I.", "AuthorID": "6602228387", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Infectious Diseases Department, Royal Free Hospital"}, "7202260726": {"Name": "Hopkins S.", "AuthorID": "7202260726", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Infectious Diseases Department, Royal Free Hospital"}, "57189868983": {"Name": "Mepham S.", "AuthorID": "57189868983", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Infectious Diseases Department, Royal Free Hospital"}, "35944368900": {"Name": "Rodger A.", "AuthorID": "35944368900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Infection, University College London, Royal Free Campus"}, "57208777922": {"Name": "Warren S.", "AuthorID": "57208777922", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Infectious Diseases Department, Royal Free Hospital"}, "36848322200": {"Name": "Jacobs M.", "AuthorID": "36848322200", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Infectious Diseases Department, Royal Free Hospital"}}}
