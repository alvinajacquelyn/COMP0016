Atacicept is a fusion protein that blocks B-lymphocyte stimulator and a proliferationinducing ligand, which are increased in patients with SLE. Methods: In this double-blind, placebo-controlled study, patients with moderate-to-severe SLE were randomised to atacicept 75 mg or atacicept 150 mg administered subcutaneously, or placebo twice-weekly for 4 weeks, then weekly for 48 weeks. Primary and secondary efficacy measures were the proportion of patients experiencing at least one flare of British Isles Lupus Assessment Group A or B, and time to first flare, respectively. Results: Enrolment in the atacicept 150 mg arm was discontinued prematurely due to two deaths. In the intention-to-treat population (n=461), there was no difference in flare rates or time to first flare between atacicept 75 mg and placebo. Analysis of patients treated with atacicept 150 mg suggested beneficial effect versus placebo in flare rates (OR: 0.48, p=0.002) and time to first flare (HR: 0.56, p=0.009). Both atacicept doses were associated with reductions in total Ig levels and antidsDNA antibodies, and increases in C3 and C4 levels. Most treatment-emergent adverse events were mild or moderate. Conclusions: There was no difference between atacicept75 mg and placebo for flare rate or time to first flare. Analysis of atacicept 150 mg suggested benefit.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Antibodies, Antinuclear", "Antirheumatic Agents", "Complement C3", "Complement C4", "Disease Progression", "Double-Blind Method", "Early Termination of Clinical Trials", "Female", "Humans", "Immunoglobulins", "Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Recombinant Fusion Proteins", "Severity of Illness Index", "Treatment Outcome", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84945242898", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Rheumatology", "MEDI", "2745"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"57201108555": {"Name": "Isenberg D.", "AuthorID": "57201108555", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Medicine, Centre for Rheumatology, University College London, Rayne Building"}, "7401477337": {"Name": "Gordon C.", "AuthorID": "7401477337", "AffiliationID": "60019702, 60033481", "AffiliationName": "Rheumatology Research Group, School of Immunity and Infection, College of Medical and Dental Sciences, University of Birmingham"}, "23493120200": {"Name": "Licu D.", "AuthorID": "23493120200", "AffiliationID": "60007757", "AffiliationName": "Merck Serono S.A."}, "12799833600": {"Name": "Copt S.", "AuthorID": "12799833600", "AffiliationID": "60007757", "AffiliationName": "Merck Serono S.A."}, "56524895100": {"Name": "Rossi C.P.", "AuthorID": "56524895100", "AffiliationID": "60007757", "AffiliationName": "Merck Serono S.A."}, "7004828657": {"Name": "Wofsy D.", "AuthorID": "7004828657", "AffiliationID": "60023691", "AffiliationName": "Division of Rheumatology, Rosalind Russell Medical Research Center for Arthritis, University of California San Francisco"}}}
