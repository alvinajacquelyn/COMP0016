The asymmetry, defined as the difference between the intensity transmission coefficients, reaches 0.72 \u00b1 0.06 for a single wavelength and exceeds 0.2 over a spectral range spanning from 700 to 850 nm for one incident polarization and 750-800 nm for both polarizations. The experimental results are consistent with the numerical model of light propagation in the structure.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Dielectric grating", "Incident polarization", "Near infrared light", "Photonic structure", "Quarter-wavelength", "Single wavelength", "Transmission coefficients", "Transmission phase"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84924107195", "SubjectAreas": [["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"]], "AuthorData": {"54882653000": {"Name": "Zinkiewicz \u0141.", "AuthorID": "54882653000", "AffiliationID": "60013756", "AffiliationName": "Photonic Nanostructure Facility, Institute of Experimental Physics, University of Warsaw"}, "6602894094": {"Name": "Wasylczyk P.", "AuthorID": "6602894094", "AffiliationID": "60013756", "AffiliationName": "Photonic Nanostructure Facility, Institute of Experimental Physics, University of Warsaw"}, "23134828000": {"Name": "Haberko J.", "AuthorID": "23134828000", "AffiliationID": "60017351", "AffiliationName": "AGH University of Science and Technology, Faculty of Physics and Applied Computer Science"}}}
