It is widely assumed that the calculation of L-values using the max-log approximation leads to an information loss. We prove that this assumption is correct for all M-PAM constellations and labelings with the exception of a symmetric 4-PAM constellation labeled with a Gray code. We also show that for max-log L-values, the BICM generalized mutual information (GMI), which is an achievable rate for a standard BICM decoder, is too pessimistic. In particular, it is proved that the so-called harmonized GMI, which can be seen as the sum of bit-level GMIs, is achievable without any modifications to the decoder. We then study how bit-level channel symmetrization and mixing affect the MI and the GMI for max-log L-values. Our results show that these operations, which are often used when analyzing BICM systems, preserve the GMI. However, this is not necessarily the case when the MI is considered. Necessary and sufficient conditions under which these operations preserve the MI are provided.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bit-interleaved coded modulation", "generalized mutual information", "logarithmic likelihood ratio", "max-log approximation", "mismatched decoder"], "IndexKeywords": ["Bit interleaved coded modulation", "Generalized mutual information", "Logarithmic likelihood ratios", "max-log approximation", "mismatched decoder"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84976361922", "SubjectAreas": [["Information Systems", "COMP", "1710"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Library and Information Sciences", "SOCI", "3309"]], "AuthorData": {"57196656798": {"Name": "Ivanov M.", "AuthorID": "57196656798", "AffiliationID": "60000990", "AffiliationName": "Department of Signals and Systems, Chalmers University of Technology"}, "55694767800": {"Name": "Hager C.", "AuthorID": "55694767800", "AffiliationID": "60000990", "AffiliationName": "Department of Signals and Systems, Chalmers University of Technology"}, "6602213696": {"Name": "Brannstrom F.", "AuthorID": "6602213696", "AffiliationID": "60000990", "AffiliationName": "Department of Signals and Systems, Chalmers University of Technology"}, "6602622050": {"Name": "Amat A.", "AuthorID": "6602622050", "AffiliationID": "60000990", "AffiliationName": "Department of Signals and Systems, Chalmers University of Technology"}, "6701439390": {"Name": "Agrell E.", "AuthorID": "6701439390", "AffiliationID": "60000990", "AffiliationName": "Department of Signals and Systems, Chalmers University of Technology"}, "23476771600": {"Name": "Alvarado A.", "AuthorID": "23476771600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Optical Networks Group, Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}}}
