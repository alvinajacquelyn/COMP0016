All rights reserved 0950-222X/17.PurposeThe diagnosis of Giant Cell Arteritis (GCA) is an area of major challenge. This is the first reported use of the directed use of transdermal optical coherence tomography (OCT) to image the superficial temporal artery (STA).MethodsThis proof of concept study used a commercially available transdermal OCT instrument to identify and image the STA in eight patients (suspected GCA, confirmed GCA, and in healthy controls). Three cases are presented to demonstrate the preliminary imaging findings.ResultsIn all eight cases the STA was identified. Imaging findings from three cases are presented. A hyper-reflective signal was seen, which distinguishes the artery from vein. In two cases, a ratio of band thickness (BT) to arterial lumen diameter (ALD) could be calculated (BT: ALD ratio) where the whole circumference of the artery was imaged.DiscussionUsing dermal OCT to image the temporal arteries is a novel concept. With ongoing advances in resolution, penetration, and blood flow detection; this non-invasive technology warrants further investigation to determine its role in Giant Cell Arteritis.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Diagnosis, Differential", "Female", "Giant Cell Arteritis", "Humans", "Male", "Optic Nerve Diseases", "Temporal Arteries", "Tomography, Optical Coherence"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85009247768", "SubjectAreas": [["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"], ["Sensory Systems", "NEUR", "2809"]], "AuthorData": {"14052501200": {"Name": "Mollan S.P.", "AuthorID": "14052501200", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "Neurotrauma and Neurodegeneration, School of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Birmingham"}, "24480921100": {"Name": "Keane P.A.", "AuthorID": "24480921100", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "54880010400": {"Name": "Denniston A.K.", "AuthorID": "54880010400", "AffiliationID": "60012191, 60026493", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Trust, Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham"}}}
