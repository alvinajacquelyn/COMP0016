Healthcare, caregiving, and other resource needs of affected individuals are thought to be substantial; however, the economic burden associated with DMD has not yet been assessed specifically in Australia. Methods: Australian households with a child with DMD were asked to complete a cross-sectional survey. Data were collected on annual resource utilization including hospital and medical services, equipment, home modifications, informal care, and working days lost. Results: Mean healthcare costs were found to be $10,046 Australian dollars per affected individual and were markedly higher than average Australian health expenditures at each age group. The mean total cost was $46,700 (median $32,300), with healthcare costs contributing 22% of total costs. Conclusions: The annual economic cost of DMD was found to be high, reflecting a significant socioeconomic burden, especially in boys who reach adulthood, where household resource use and caregiving burden is highest.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Burden", "Cost", "DMD", "Duchenne muscular dystrophy", "Healthcare", "Muscular dystrophy", "Resource use"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Age Factors", "Australia", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Cost of Illness", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Delivery of Health Care", "Female", "Health Care Surveys", "Humans", "Infant", "Male", "Muscular Dystrophy, Duchenne", "Retrospective Studies", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84966687502", "SubjectAreas": [["Physiology", "BIOC", "1314"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"], ["Physiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2737"]], "AuthorData": {"57189250348": {"Name": "Teoh L.J.", "AuthorID": "57189250348", "AffiliationID": "60031806", "AffiliationName": "School of Population Health, The University of Western Australia"}, "6701553570": {"Name": "Geelhoed E.A.", "AuthorID": "6701553570", "AffiliationID": "60031806, 60005202", "AffiliationName": "Harry Perkins Institute of Medical Research, The University of Western Australia"}, "54405477500": {"Name": "Bayley K.", "AuthorID": "54405477500", "AffiliationID": "60031806, 60005202", "AffiliationName": "Harry Perkins Institute of Medical Research, The University of Western Australia"}, "7005008313": {"Name": "Laing N.G.", "AuthorID": "7005008313", "AffiliationID": "60031806, 60005202", "AffiliationName": "Harry Perkins Institute of Medical Research, The University of Western Australia"}, "57201594550": {"Name": "Leonard H.", "AuthorID": "57201594550", "AffiliationID": "60000096", "AffiliationName": "Telethon Kids Institute, Child Disability Research"}}}
