In keratinocytes Rac1 activation by cadherin junctions requires EGFR signalling, but how EGFR does so is unclear. To address which activator could mediate E-cadherin signalling to Rac1, we investigated EGFR and two Rac1 GEFs, SOS1 and DOCK180. EGFR RNAi prevented junction-induced Rac1 activation and led to fragmented localization of E-cadherin at cadherin contacts. In contrast, depletion of another EGFR family member, ErbB3, did not interfere with either process. DOCK180 RNAi, but not SOS1, prevented E-cadherin-induced Rac1 activation. However, in a strong divergence from EGFR RNAi phenotype, DOCK180 depletion did not perturb actin recruitment or cadherin localisation at junctions. Rather, reduced DOCK180 levels impaired the resistance to mechanical stress of pre-formed cell aggregates. Thus, within the same cell type, EGFR and DOCK180 regulate Rac1 activation by newly-formed contacts, but control separate cellular events that cooperate to stabilise junctions.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cadherin", "DOCK180", "EGFR", "GEF", "Rac"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cadherins", "Cell Adhesion", "Cells, Cultured", "Humans", "Keratinocytes", "rac GTP-Binding Proteins", "rac1 GTP-Binding Protein", "Receptor, ErbB-3", "RNA Interference", "Signal Transduction"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84934439712", "SubjectAreas": [["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"11240444500": {"Name": "Erasmus J.C.", "AuthorID": "11240444500", "AffiliationID": "60010719, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "Molecular Medicine, National Heart and Lung Institute, Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London"}, "54789316300": {"Name": "Welsh N.J.", "AuthorID": "54789316300", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60018508", "AffiliationName": "Eisai-UCL Collaborative Translational Research Office"}, "7005818523": {"Name": "Braga V.M.M.", "AuthorID": "7005818523", "AffiliationID": "60010719, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "Molecular Medicine, National Heart and Lung Institute, Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London"}}}
