Performance on such tasks is strongly associated with reading ability, and there is increasing evidence that verbal task demands may be critical in explaining this relationship. The current study investigated the relationships between different forms of PAL and reading ability. A total of 97 children aged 8\u201310 years completed a battery of reading assessments and six different PAL tasks (phoneme\u2013phoneme, visual\u2013phoneme, nonverbal\u2013nonverbal, visual\u2013nonverbal, nonword\u2013nonword, and visual\u2013nonword) involving both familiar phonemes and unfamiliar nonwords. A latent variable path model showed that PAL ability is captured by two correlated latent variables: auditory\u2013articulatory and visual\u2013articulatory. The auditory\u2013articulatory latent variable was the stronger predictor of reading ability, providing support for a verbal account of the PAL\u2013reading relationship.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cross-modal associations", "Dyslexia", "Paired-associate learning", "Reading", "Reading development", "Verbal learning"], "IndexKeywords": ["Acoustic Stimulation", "Child", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Paired-Associate Learning", "Photic Stimulation", "Reading"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85042617845", "SubjectAreas": [["Experimental and Cognitive Psychology", "PSYC", "3205"], ["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"]], "AuthorData": {"57196244328": {"Name": "Clayton F.J.", "AuthorID": "57196244328", "AffiliationID": "60016418", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, University of York"}, "57193861288": {"Name": "Sears C.", "AuthorID": "57193861288", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychology and Language Sciences, University College London"}, "57200911992": {"Name": "Davis A.", "AuthorID": "57200911992", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychology and Language Sciences, University College London"}, "7006105965": {"Name": "Hulme C.", "AuthorID": "7006105965", "AffiliationID": "60175816", "AffiliationName": "Department of Education, University of Oxford"}}}
