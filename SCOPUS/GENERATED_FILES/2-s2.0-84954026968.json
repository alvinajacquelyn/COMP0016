These models have attracted considerable research attention and play a central role in DSM planning. This article provides a researcher- and clinician-friendly guide to the assessment of these personality theories. We argue that current theoretical models focus on issues of relatedness and self-definition at different hierarchically organized levels of analysis; that is (a) at the level of broad personality features, (b) at the motivational level (i.e., the motivational processes underlying the development of these dimensions), and (c) at the level of underlying internal working models or cognitive affective schemas, and the specific interpersonal features and problems in which they are expressed. Implications for further research and DSM planning are outlined.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Biomedical Research", "Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders", "Humans", "Interpersonal Relations", "Models, Psychological", "Personality Assessment", "Personality Development", "Personality Disorders", "Self Concept"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84954026968", "SubjectAreas": [["Clinical Psychology", "PSYC", "3203"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"], ["Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis", "ENVI", "2307"]], "AuthorData": {"57203069499": {"Name": "Luyten P.", "AuthorID": "57203069499", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London"}, "7102838674": {"Name": "Blatt S.", "AuthorID": "7102838674", "AffiliationID": "60005455", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Psychiatry and Psychology, Yale University"}}}
