We propose a fast approach in which the template is computed using a diffeomorphic iterative centroid method. Statistical analysis is then performed on the initial momenta that define the deformations between the centroid and each individual subject. We applied the approach to study the variability of the hippocampus in 134 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and 160 elderly control subjects. We show that this approach can describe the main modes of variability of the two populations and can predict the performance to a memory test in AD patients.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alzheimer", "diffeomorphic iterative centroid", "hippocampus", "LDDMM", "shape analysis"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85022146237", "SubjectAreas": [["Computational Mechanics", "ENGI", "2206"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"], ["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"]], "AuthorData": {"55872174000": {"Name": "Cury C.", "AuthorID": "55872174000", "AffiliationID": "60015622, 60021567", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Neurology and Neuroradiology, AP-HP, Piti\u00e9-Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re Hospital"}, "55998297900": {"Name": "Chupin M.", "AuthorID": "55998297900", "AffiliationID": "60015622, 60021567", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Neurology and Neuroradiology, AP-HP, Piti\u00e9-Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re Hospital"}, "55887247600": {"Name": "Colliot O.", "AuthorID": "55887247600", "AffiliationID": "60015622, 60021567", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Neurology and Neuroradiology, AP-HP, Piti\u00e9-Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re Hospital"}, "6507376386": {"Name": "Glaun\u00e8s J.", "AuthorID": "6507376386", "AffiliationID": "60015622, 60021567", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Neurology and Neuroradiology, AP-HP, Piti\u00e9-Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re Hospital"}}}
