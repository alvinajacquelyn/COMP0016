Without a pharmacologic agent to enhance functional recovery from these injuries, clinicians rely solely on surgery and rehabilitation to treat patients. Unfortunately, patient outcomes remain poor despite application of the most advanced microsurgical and rehabilitative techniques. We hypothesized that the detrimental effects of traumatic neonatal nerve injury could be mitigated with pharmacologic neuroprotection, and tested whether the novel neuroprotective agent P7C3 would block peripheral neuron cell death and enhance functional recovery in a rat neonatal nerve injury model. Administration of P7C3 after sciatic nerve crush injury doubled motor and sensory neuron survival, and also promoted axon regeneration in a dose-dependent manner. Treatment with P7C3 also enhanced behavioral and muscle functional recovery, and reversed pathological mobilization of spinal microglia after injury. Our findings suggest that the P7C3 family of neuroprotective compounds may provide a basis for the development of a new neuroprotective drug to enhance recovery following peripheral nerve injury.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Functional recovery", "Microglia", "Neonatal nerve injury", "Neuroprotection", "P7C3"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Animals, Newborn", "Carbazoles", "Cell Proliferation", "Cell Survival", "Disease Models, Animal", "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug", "Ganglia, Spinal", "Male", "Microglia", "Motor Neurons", "Movement Disorders", "Muscle Strength", "Nerve Regeneration", "Neuroprotective Agents", "Peripheral Nerve Injuries", "Rats", "Rats, Inbred Lew", "Sciatic Neuropathy", "Sensation", "Sensory Receptor Cells", "Spinal Cord"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84908389399", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"]], "AuthorData": {"55511748534": {"Name": "Kemp S.W.P.", "AuthorID": "55511748534", "AffiliationID": "60085584", "AffiliationName": "The Hospital for Sick Children Research Institute, Program in Neuroscience and Mental Health"}, "35799234800": {"Name": "Szynkaruk M.", "AuthorID": "35799234800", "AffiliationID": "60030319", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery, Division of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, The Hospital for Sick Children"}, "55859454900": {"Name": "Stanoulis K.N.", "AuthorID": "55859454900", "AffiliationID": "60030319", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery, Division of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, The Hospital for Sick Children"}, "7403448587": {"Name": "Wood M.D.", "AuthorID": "7403448587", "AffiliationID": "60085584", "AffiliationName": "The Hospital for Sick Children Research Institute, Program in Neuroscience and Mental Health"}, "55542409900": {"Name": "Liu E.H.", "AuthorID": "55542409900", "AffiliationID": "60030319", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery, Division of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, The Hospital for Sick Children"}, "26322056600": {"Name": "Willand M.P.", "AuthorID": "26322056600", "AffiliationID": "60085584", "AffiliationName": "The Hospital for Sick Children Research Institute, Program in Neuroscience and Mental Health"}, "7201393104": {"Name": "Gordon T.", "AuthorID": "7201393104", "AffiliationID": "60085584", "AffiliationName": "The Hospital for Sick Children Research Institute, Program in Neuroscience and Mental Health"}, "6603445987": {"Name": "Borschel G.H.", "AuthorID": "6603445987", "AffiliationID": "60025111", "AffiliationName": "Psychoactive Drug Screening Program, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"}, "11438985400": {"Name": "Beggs S.", "AuthorID": "11438985400", "AffiliationID": "60085584", "AffiliationName": "The Hospital for Sick Children Research Institute, Program in Neuroscience and Mental Health"}, "7103121448": {"Name": "Salter M.W.", "AuthorID": "7103121448", "AffiliationID": "60085584", "AffiliationName": "The Hospital for Sick Children Research Institute, Program in Neuroscience and Mental Health"}, "39561313700": {"Name": "Morlock L.", "AuthorID": "39561313700", "AffiliationID": "60014739, 60026695", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemistry, UT Southwestern Medical Center"}, "36948228700": {"Name": "Naidoo J.", "AuthorID": "36948228700", "AffiliationID": "60014739, 60026695", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemistry, UT Southwestern Medical Center"}, "7402771496": {"Name": "Williams N.S.", "AuthorID": "7402771496", "AffiliationID": "60014739, 60026695", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemistry, UT Southwestern Medical Center"}, "7003508027": {"Name": "Ready J.M.", "AuthorID": "7003508027", "AffiliationID": "60014739, 60026695", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemistry, UT Southwestern Medical Center"}, "7003682505": {"Name": "Pieper A.A.", "AuthorID": "7003682505", "AffiliationID": "60025111", "AffiliationName": "Psychoactive Drug Screening Program, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"}, "57189010620": {"Name": "Mangano T.J.", "AuthorID": "57189010620", "AffiliationID": "60025111", "AffiliationName": "Psychoactive Drug Screening Program, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"}}}
