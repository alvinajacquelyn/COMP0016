The coupling is introduced at the Lagrangian level using a variational formulation for relativistic fluids, where the interacting term generally depends on both the dynamical degrees of freedom of the theory and their spacetime derivatives. After deriving the field equations from the action, we consider applications in the context of cosmology. Two simple models are studied using dynamical system techniques showing the interesting phenomenology arising in this framework. We find that these models contain dark energy dominated late-time attractors with early-time matter dominated epochs and also obtain a possible dynamical crossing of the phantom barrier. The formulation and results presented here complete and expand the analysis exposed in the first part of this work, where only algebraic couplings, without spacetime derivatives, were considered.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84931282007", "SubjectAreas": [["Nuclear and High Energy Physics", "PHYS", "3106"], ["Physics and Astronomy (miscellaneous)", "PHYS", "3101"]], "AuthorData": {"56247935800": {"Name": "B\u00f6hmer C.", "AuthorID": "56247935800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University College London"}, "55015594800": {"Name": "Wright M.", "AuthorID": "55015594800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University College London"}, "37005969000": {"Name": "Tamanini N.", "AuthorID": "37005969000", "AffiliationID": "60019615, 60106131", "AffiliationName": "Institut de Physique Th\u00e9orique, CEA-Saclay"}}}
