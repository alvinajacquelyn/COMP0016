Here, we investigate the timing, duration, magnitude and regional coherence of the event as expressed in carbonate oxygen-isotope records from three lakes on northwest Europe's Atlantic margin in western Ireland, namely Loch Avolla, Loch Geal\u00e1in and Lough Corrib. An abrupt negative oxygen-isotope excursion lasted about 200 years. Comparison of records from three sites suggests that the excursion was primarily the result of a reduction of the oxygen-isotope values of precipitation, which was likely caused by lowered air temperatures, possibly coupled with a change in atmospheric circulation. Comparison of records from two of the lakes (Loch Avolla and Loch Geal\u00e1in), which have differing bathymetries, further suggests a reduction in evaporative loss of lake water during the cooling episode. Comparison of climate model experiments with lake-sediment isotope data indicates that effective moisture may have increased along this part of the northeast Atlantic seaboard during the 8200-year climatic event, as lower evaporation compensated for reduced precipitation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["8200-year event", "Early Holocene", "Ireland", "Isotope-enabled GCM", "Oxygen-isotopes"], "IndexKeywords": ["8200-year event", "Atmospheric circulation", "Early Holocene", "Ireland", "North East Atlantic", "Oxygen isotope records", "Oxygen isotope values", "Oxygen isotopes"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84949647393", "SubjectAreas": [["Global and Planetary Change", "ENVI", "2306"], ["Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics", "AGRI", "1105"], ["Archeology (arts and humanities)", "ARTS", "1204"], ["Archeology", "SOCI", "3302"], ["Geology", "EART", "1907"]], "AuthorData": {"7403240604": {"Name": "Holmes J.", "AuthorID": "7403240604", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Environmental Change Research Centre, Department of Geography, University College London"}, "7102823761": {"Name": "Atkinson T.", "AuthorID": "7102823761", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, University College London"}, "56155054000": {"Name": "Jourdan A.", "AuthorID": "56155054000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, University College London"}, "12759949700": {"Name": "Tindall J.", "AuthorID": "12759949700", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "School of Earth and Environment, University of Leeds"}, "57203215784": {"Name": "Roberts N.", "AuthorID": "57203215784", "AffiliationID": "60024779", "AffiliationName": "School of Geography, Earth and Environmental Sciences, University of Plymouth"}, "7401972824": {"Name": "Marshall W.", "AuthorID": "7401972824", "AffiliationID": "60024779", "AffiliationName": "School of Geography, Earth and Environmental Sciences, University of Plymouth"}, "55471965500": {"Name": "Marshall J.", "AuthorID": "55471965500", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth, Ocean and Ecological Sciences, University of Liverpool"}, "15759725600": {"Name": "Fisher E.", "AuthorID": "15759725600", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth, Ocean and Ecological Sciences, University of Liverpool"}, "56725206000": {"Name": "Bingham A.", "AuthorID": "56725206000", "AffiliationID": "60008539", "AffiliationName": "Palaeoenvironmental Research Unit, School of Geography and Archaeology, National University of Ireland Galway"}, "6504288922": {"Name": "Feeser I.", "AuthorID": "6504288922", "AffiliationID": "60012345", "AffiliationName": "Institut F\u00fcr Ur- und Fr\u00fchgeschichte Palynologisches Labor, Christian-Albrechts-Universit\u00e4t zu Kiel"}, "7201812039": {"Name": "O'Connell M.", "AuthorID": "7201812039", "AffiliationID": "60008539", "AffiliationName": "Palaeoenvironmental Research Unit, School of Geography and Archaeology, National University of Ireland Galway"}, "56725260000": {"Name": "March A.", "AuthorID": "56725260000", "AffiliationID": "60022109", "AffiliationName": "School of Geography, Queen Mary University of London"}}}
