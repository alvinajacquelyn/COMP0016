All rights reserved.Neocortical areas communicate through extensive axonal projections, but the logic of information transfer remains poorly understood, because the projections of individual neurons have not been systematically characterized. It is not known whether individual neurons send projections only to single cortical areas or distribute signals across multiple targets. Here we determine the projection patterns of 591 individual neurons in the mouse primary visual cortex using whole-brain fluorescence-based axonal tracing and high-throughput DNA sequencing of genetically barcoded neurons (MAPseq). Projections were highly diverse and divergent, collectively targeting at least 18 cortical and subcortical areas. Most neurons targeted multiple cortical areas, often in non-random combinations, suggesting that sub-classes of intracortical projection neurons exist. Our results indicate that the dominant mode of intracortical information transfer is not based on 'one neuron-one target area' mapping. Instead, signals carried by individual cortical neurons are shared across subsets of target areas, and thus concurrently contribute to multiple functional pathways.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Axons", "Brain Mapping", "Female", "Fluorescence", "High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Neural Pathways", "Neuroanatomical Tract-Tracing Techniques", "Single-Cell Analysis", "Visual Cortex"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85045150018", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"35075868400": {"Name": "Han Y.", "AuthorID": "35075868400", "AffiliationID": "60015184", "AffiliationName": "Biozentrum, University of Basel"}, "57214123507": {"Name": "Campbell R.", "AuthorID": "57214123507", "AffiliationID": "60015184", "AffiliationName": "Biozentrum, University of Basel"}, "57201502439": {"Name": "Cowan D.", "AuthorID": "57201502439", "AffiliationID": "60015184", "AffiliationName": "Biozentrum, University of Basel"}, "57016767700": {"Name": "Imhof F.", "AuthorID": "57016767700", "AffiliationID": "60015184", "AffiliationName": "Biozentrum, University of Basel"}, "57202973510": {"Name": "Mrsic-Flogel T.", "AuthorID": "57202973510", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60020649", "AffiliationName": "Sainsbury Wellcome Centre, University College London"}, "55604728400": {"Name": "Kebschull J.", "AuthorID": "55604728400", "AffiliationID": "60029652", "AffiliationName": "Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory"}, "7004503632": {"Name": "Zador A.", "AuthorID": "7004503632", "AffiliationID": "60029652", "AffiliationName": "Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory"}}}
