Strong suppression of both SGS and induced gap are observed as a function of temperature and magnetic field. The differential conductance of the Josephson junctions (JJs) as a function of external in-plane magnetic fields shows an asymmetric response to positive and negative magnetic field sweeps with a conductance maximum at close to zero. Our approach to quantum transport studies of the ballistic 2D JJs may open a new road towards scalable and integrated quantum processing and help pave the way for the development of topological circuits for the realization of the next generation of quantum processors.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Andreev reflection", "Asymmetric response", "Differential conductances", "Energy-gap structures", "In-plane magnetic fields", "Indium gallium arsenide", "Multiple andreev reflections", "Two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG)"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85064414467", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"55077348000": {"Name": "Delfanazari K.", "AuthorID": "55077348000", "AffiliationID": "60121115, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Cavendish Laboratory, University of Cambridge"}, "13405972000": {"Name": "Joyce H.", "AuthorID": "13405972000", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Electrical Engineering Division, Engineering Department, University of Cambridge"}, "8911688800": {"Name": "Kelly M.", "AuthorID": "8911688800", "AffiliationID": "60121115, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Cavendish Laboratory, University of Cambridge"}, "57195944673": {"Name": "Ma P.", "AuthorID": "57195944673", "AffiliationID": "60121115, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Cavendish Laboratory, University of Cambridge"}, "37100351300": {"Name": "Puddy R.", "AuthorID": "37100351300", "AffiliationID": "60121115, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Cavendish Laboratory, University of Cambridge"}, "57192392260": {"Name": "Cao M.", "AuthorID": "57192392260", "AffiliationID": "60121115, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Cavendish Laboratory, University of Cambridge"}, "57195944220": {"Name": "Yi T.", "AuthorID": "57195944220", "AffiliationID": "60121115, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Cavendish Laboratory, University of Cambridge"}, "8546355000": {"Name": "Farrer I.", "AuthorID": "8546355000", "AffiliationID": "60001881", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University of Sheffield"}, "36050490200": {"Name": "Ritchie D.", "AuthorID": "36050490200", "AffiliationID": "60121115, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Cavendish Laboratory, University of Cambridge"}, "55637020900": {"Name": "Smith C.", "AuthorID": "55637020900", "AffiliationID": "60121115, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Cavendish Laboratory, University of Cambridge"}, "57195947109": {"Name": "Gul Y.", "AuthorID": "57195947109", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}}}
