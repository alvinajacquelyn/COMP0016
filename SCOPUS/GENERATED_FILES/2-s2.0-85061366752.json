Published by Oxford University Press for the Infectious Diseases Society of America.Background. New treatments for severe influenza are needed. Passive transfer of influenza-specific hyperimmune pooled immunoglobulin (Flu-IVIG) boosts neutralizing antibody responses to past strains in influenza-infected subjects. The effect of Flu- IVIG on antibodies with Fc-mediated functions, which may target diverse influenza strains, is unclear. Methods. We studied the capacity of Flu-IVIG, relative to standard IVIG, to bind to Fc\u03b3 receptors and mediate antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity in vitro. The effect of Flu-IVIG infusion, compared to placebo infusion, was examined in serial plasma samples from 24 subjects with confirmed influenza infection in the INSIGHT FLU005 pilot study. Results. Flu-IVIG contains higher concentrations of Fc-functional antibodies than IVIG against a diverse range of influenza hemagglutinins. Following infusion of Flu-IVIG into influenza-infected subjects, a transient increase in Fc-functional antibodies was present for 1-3 days against infecting and noninfecting strains of influenza. Conclusions. Flu-IVIG contains antibodies with Fc-mediated functions against influenza virus, and passive transfer of Flu- IVIG increases anti-influenza Fc-functional antibodies in the plasma of influenza-infected subjects. Enhancement of Fc-functional antibodies to a diverse range of influenza strains suggests that Flu-IVIG infusion could prove useful in the context of novel influenza virus infections, when there may be minimal or no neutralizing antibodies in the Flu-IVIG preparation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["ADCC", "Fc receptor", "immunoglobulin", "influenza", "passive transfer"], "IndexKeywords": ["Antibodies, Neutralizing", "Antibodies, Viral", "Humans", "Immunoglobulin Fc Fragments", "Immunoglobulins", "Influenza, Human", "Pilot Projects", "Receptors, IgG"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85061366752", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"55190953200": {"Name": "Vanderven H.A.", "AuthorID": "55190953200", "AffiliationID": "60019870", "AffiliationName": "Biomedicine, College of Public Health, Medical and Veterinary Sciences, James Cook University"}, "57202134000": {"Name": "Wragg K.", "AuthorID": "57202134000", "AffiliationID": "60026553, 60117340", "AffiliationName": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity, University of Melbourne"}, "56195001400": {"Name": "Ana-Sosa-Batiz F.", "AuthorID": "56195001400", "AffiliationID": "60026553, 60117340", "AffiliationName": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity, University of Melbourne"}, "57189494677": {"Name": "Kristensen A.B.", "AuthorID": "57189494677", "AffiliationID": "60026553, 60117340", "AffiliationName": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity, University of Melbourne"}, "55053396400": {"Name": "Jegaskanda S.", "AuthorID": "55053396400", "AffiliationID": "60026553, 60117340", "AffiliationName": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity, University of Melbourne"}, "35110792800": {"Name": "Wheatley A.K.", "AuthorID": "35110792800", "AffiliationID": "60026553, 60117340", "AffiliationName": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity, University of Melbourne"}, "57194579067": {"Name": "Rockman S.", "AuthorID": "57194579067", "AffiliationID": "116701258", "AffiliationName": "Seqirus Ltd"}, "7201914639": {"Name": "Kent S.J.", "AuthorID": "7201914639", "AffiliationID": "60026553", "AffiliationName": "Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence in Convergent Bio-Nano Science and Technology, University of Melbourne"}, "7004800841": {"Name": "Wentworth D.", "AuthorID": "7004800841", "AffiliationID": "60029445", "AffiliationName": "Biostatistics Division, University of Minnesota"}, "35515627500": {"Name": "Wines B.D.", "AuthorID": "35515627500", "AffiliationID": "60003344", "AffiliationName": "Burnet Institute"}, "57202646662": {"Name": "Hogarth P.M.", "AuthorID": "57202646662", "AffiliationID": "60003344", "AffiliationName": "Burnet Institute"}}}
