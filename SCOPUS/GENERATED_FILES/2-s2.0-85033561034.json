Design Artificial intelligence (neural network) study. Methods We assessed 1400 OCT scans of patients with neovascular AMD. Fifteen physical features for each eligible OCT, as well as patient age, were used as input data and corresponding recorded visual acuity as the target data to train, validate, and test a supervised neural network. We then applied this network to model the impact on acuity of defined OCT changes in subretinal fluid, subretinal hyperreflective material, and loss of external limiting membrane (ELM) integrity. Results A total of 1210 eligible OCT scans were analyzed, resulting in 1210 data points, which were each 16-dimensional. A 10-layer feed-forward neural network with 1 hidden layer of 10 neurons was trained to predict acuity and demonstrated a root mean square error of 8.2 letters for predicted compared to actual visual acuity and a mean regression coefficient of 0.85. A virtual model using this network demonstrated the relationship of visual acuity to specific, programmed changes in OCT characteristics. When ELM is intact, there is a shallow decline in acuity with increasing subretinal fluid but a much steeper decline with equivalent increasing subretinal hyperreflective material. When ELM is not intact, all visual acuities are reduced. Increasing subretinal hyperreflective material or subretinal fluid in this circumstance reduces vision further still, but with a smaller gradient than when ELM is intact. Conclusions The supervised machine learning neural network developed is able to generate an estimated visual acuity value from OCT images in a population of patients with AMD. These findings should be of clinical and research interest in macular degeneration, for example in estimating visual prognosis or highlighting the importance of developing treatments targeting more visually destructive pathologies.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Female", "Fluorescein Angiography", "Fundus Oculi", "Humans", "Macula Lutea", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Neural Networks (Computer)", "Reproducibility of Results", "Retrospective Studies", "Tomography, Optical Coherence", "Visual Acuity", "Wet Macular Degeneration"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85033561034", "SubjectAreas": [["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"]], "AuthorData": {"7003670895": {"Name": "Aslam T.M.", "AuthorID": "7003670895", "AffiliationID": "60023665, 60120605", "AffiliationName": "Manchester Royal Eye Hospital, NHS Central Manchester University Hospitals"}, "57196477575": {"Name": "Zaki H.R.", "AuthorID": "57196477575", "AffiliationID": "60172345", "AffiliationName": "School of Pharmacy and Optometry, Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, The University of Manchester"}, "35221042600": {"Name": "Balaskas K.", "AuthorID": "35221042600", "AffiliationID": "60023665, 60120605", "AffiliationName": "Manchester Royal Eye Hospital, NHS Central Manchester University Hospitals"}, "23995482000": {"Name": "Mahmood S.", "AuthorID": "23995482000", "AffiliationID": "60023665, 60120605", "AffiliationName": "Manchester Royal Eye Hospital, NHS Central Manchester University Hospitals"}, "57191375644": {"Name": "Ali Z.C.", "AuthorID": "57191375644", "AffiliationID": "60023665, 60120605", "AffiliationName": "Manchester Royal Eye Hospital, NHS Central Manchester University Hospitals"}, "56473645000": {"Name": "Thorell M.R.", "AuthorID": "56473645000", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology Hospital Banco de Olhos de Porto Alegre"}, "35753008000": {"Name": "Ahmad N.A.", "AuthorID": "35753008000", "AffiliationID": "60004351", "AffiliationName": "Department of Optometry, Faculty of Health Sciences, Universiti Teknologi Mara Puncak Alam"}}}
