In particular, smoking prevention for mothers in early midlife is a significant international public health goal. A higher sense of purpose in life (PIL) is thought to reduce detrimental health behaviours. However, little is known about the association between a sense of PIL and tobacco use. This study investigates this association among community-dwelling mothers of early adolescents. Design This population-based cross-sectional study uses a self-reported questionnaire from the Tokyo Early Adolescence Survey, a large community-based survey conducted in Japan between 2012 and 2015. Setting Participants were randomly recruited from the resident registries of three municipalities in Tokyo, Japan. Participants A total of 4478 children and their primary parents participated. Responses from 4063 mothers with no missing data were analysed (mean age=42.0 years (SD=4.2)). Measures Participants' tobacco use, including the number of cigarettes smoked per day, was documented using a questionnaire. PIL was assessed using a Purpose in Life scale derived from Ryff's Psychological Well-Being Scale. Results Greater PIL was associated with a decreased likelihood of tobacco use, even when adjusted for confounders (OR=0.80, 95% CI 0.70 to 0.91). Multinomial logistic regression analyses revealed that PIL was inversely associated with tobacco consumption among mothers. These associations remained after controlling for psychological distress, socioeconomic factors and frequency of alcohol consumption among moderate to heavy smokers (OR=0.70, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.86), while attenuated among light smokers. Conclusions Increasing PIL may be a valuable intervention for reducing tobacco use among women in early midlife. This study can contribute to our understanding of the psychology of smoking behaviour and shed light on the targeted intervention to reduce tobacco use among early midlife mothers.", "AuthorKeywords": ["mother", "psychological distress", "purpose in life", "tobacco use", "Tokyo Early Adolescence Survey (T-EAS)"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Female", "Goals", "Health Behavior", "Humans", "Independent Living", "Internal-External Control", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Mothers", "Registries", "Smoking Cessation", "Tobacco Use", "Tokyo"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85056633006", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"57190253447": {"Name": "Morimoto Y.", "AuthorID": "57190253447", "AffiliationID": "60002783", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Science, Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science"}, "22036925600": {"Name": "Yamasaki S.", "AuthorID": "22036925600", "AffiliationID": "60002783", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Science, Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science"}, "53063099300": {"Name": "Ando S.", "AuthorID": "53063099300", "AffiliationID": "60178602", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuropsychiatry, Graduate School of Medicine, University of Tokyo"}, "57188725825": {"Name": "Endo K.", "AuthorID": "57188725825", "AffiliationID": "60002783", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Science, Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science"}, "12781751700": {"Name": "Nakanishi M.", "AuthorID": "12781751700", "AffiliationID": "60002783", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Science, Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science"}, "35311924300": {"Name": "Nishida A.", "AuthorID": "35311924300", "AffiliationID": "60002783", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Science, Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science"}, "57190249393": {"Name": "Fujikawa S.", "AuthorID": "57190249393", "AffiliationID": "60178602", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuropsychiatry, Graduate School of Medicine, University of Tokyo"}, "26643019200": {"Name": "Kasai K.", "AuthorID": "26643019200", "AffiliationID": "60178602", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuropsychiatry, Graduate School of Medicine, University of Tokyo"}, "36961019700": {"Name": "Koike S.", "AuthorID": "36961019700", "AffiliationID": "60025272", "AffiliationName": "University of Tokyo Institute for Diversity and Adaptation of Human Mind (UTIDAHM), University of Tokyo"}, "55821156600": {"Name": "Kanata S.", "AuthorID": "55821156600", "AffiliationID": "60029730", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, Teikyo University School of Medicine"}, "22957853600": {"Name": "Hatch S.L.", "AuthorID": "22957853600", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychological Medicine, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London"}, "7402054647": {"Name": "Richards M.", "AuthorID": "7402054647", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Unit for Lifelong Health and Aging, University College London"}, "6602340280": {"Name": "Hiraiwa-Hasegawa M.", "AuthorID": "6602340280", "AffiliationID": "60021523", "AffiliationName": "School of Advanced Science, SOKENDAI (The Graduate University for Advanced Studies)"}}}
