The complexity of the DBP algorithm including the characteristic signal power profile of distributed Raman amplifiers is assessed. The use of full-field DBP in distributed Raman amplified systems leads to 1.3 dB additional gain with respect to systems employing lumped amplification, at the cost of only a 25% increase in complexity.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Characteristic signal", "Distributed Raman amplifier", "Lumped amplifier", "Raman amplified systems"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85015655425", "SubjectAreas": [["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"]], "AuthorData": {"57193389959": {"Name": "Saavedra G.", "AuthorID": "57193389959", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Optical Networks Group, Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, UCL (University College London)"}, "57192990604": {"Name": "Semrau D.", "AuthorID": "57192990604", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Optical Networks Group, Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, UCL (University College London)"}, "36192836100": {"Name": "Galdino L.", "AuthorID": "36192836100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Optical Networks Group, Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, UCL (University College London)"}, "7003479201": {"Name": "Killey R.", "AuthorID": "7003479201", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Optical Networks Group, Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, UCL (University College London)"}, "7005053644": {"Name": "Bayvel P.", "AuthorID": "7005053644", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Optical Networks Group, Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, UCL (University College London)"}}}
