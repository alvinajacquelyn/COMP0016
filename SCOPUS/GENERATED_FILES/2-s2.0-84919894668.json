All rights reserved.We consider the initial-boundary value problem for an inhomogeneous time-fractional diffusion equation with a homogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition, a vanishing initial data and a nonsmooth right-hand side in a bounded convex polyhedral domain. We analyse two semidiscrete schemes based on the standard Galerkin and lumped mass finite element methods. Almost optimal error estimates are obtained for right-hand side data f (x, t) \u03b5 L\u221e (0, T; Hq(\u03c9)), \u22641\u2265 1, for both semidiscrete schemes. For the lumped mass method, the optimal L2(\u03c9)-norm error estimate requires symmetric meshes. Finally, twodimensional numerical experiments are presented to verify our theoretical results.", "AuthorKeywords": ["error estimate", "inhomogeneous problem", "lumped mass method", "semidiscrete Galerkin scheme", "time-fractional diffusion"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84919894668", "SubjectAreas": [["Mathematics (all)", "MATH", "2600"], ["Computational Mathematics", "MATH", "2605"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"8268296700": {"Name": "Jin B.", "AuthorID": "8268296700", "AffiliationID": "60029526", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University of California"}, "7003806023": {"Name": "Lazarov R.", "AuthorID": "7003806023", "AffiliationID": "60020547", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, Texas A and M University"}, "7004880919": {"Name": "Pasciak J.", "AuthorID": "7004880919", "AffiliationID": "60020547", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, Texas A and M University"}, "55649851300": {"Name": "Zhi Z.", "AuthorID": "55649851300", "AffiliationID": "60020547", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, Texas A and M University"}}}
