Prior to decentralisation, people travelled 56-76 km round-trip for ART; we aimed to evaluate changes in uptake of HIV-testing, ART coverage and access to ART following decentralisation. Methods: A total of 2124 adults in 1351 households in two parishes closest to Lira Kato HC were interviewed using questionnaires between March and April 2013 and 2123 adults in 1229 households between January and March 2015. Results: Adults reporting HIV-testing in the last year increased from 1077/2124 (50.7%) to 1298/2123 (61.1%) between surveys (p<0.001). ART coverage increased from 74/136 (54.4%) self-reported HIV-positive adults in 2013 to 108/133 (81.2%) in 2015 (p<0.001). Post-decentralisation, 47/108 (43.5%) of those on ART were in care at Lira Kato HC (including 37 new initiations). Most of the remainder (47/61, 77%) started ART prior to any ART provision at Lira Kato HC; the most common reason given for not accessing ART locally was concern about drug-stock-outs (30/59, 51%). Conclusions: HIV-testing and ART coverage increased after decentralisation combined with Option B+ roll-out. However, patients on ART before decentralisation were reluctant to transfer to their local facility.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Antiretroviral therapy decentralisation", "HIV services", "Population survey", "Sub-Saharan Africa", "Uganda"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Anti-Retroviral Agents", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Female", "HIV Infections", "Humans", "Male", "Politics", "Primary Health Care", "Rural Population", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "Travel", "Uganda"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85018350918", "SubjectAreas": [["Health (social science)", "SOCI", "3306"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"26321047000": {"Name": "Abongomera G.", "AuthorID": "26321047000", "AffiliationID": "60012937", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, University of Antwerp"}, "57194012128": {"Name": "Hakimf J.", "AuthorID": "57194012128", "AffiliationID": "60196602", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Paediatrics, Makerere University College of Health Sciences"}, "35301739400": {"Name": "Colebunders R.", "AuthorID": "35301739400", "AffiliationID": "60071691", "AffiliationName": "Joint Clinical Research Centre"}, "37066279800": {"Name": "Kiwuwa-Muyingo S.", "AuthorID": "37066279800", "AffiliationID": "60071671", "AffiliationName": "Department of Statistics, Medical Research Council, Uganda Virus Research Institute"}, "57204369179": {"Name": "Gilks C.", "AuthorID": "57204369179", "AffiliationID": "60111561", "AffiliationName": "Department of Research, Dignitas International"}, "7005429371": {"Name": "Seeley J.", "AuthorID": "7005429371", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Global Health and Development, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "57193543168": {"Name": "Revill P.", "AuthorID": "57193543168", "AffiliationID": "60016418", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Health Economics, University of York"}, "24537111400": {"Name": "Chiwaula L.", "AuthorID": "24537111400", "AffiliationID": "60111561", "AffiliationName": "Department of Research, Dignitas International"}, "55855324800": {"Name": "Mabugu T.", "AuthorID": "55855324800", "AffiliationID": "60033774", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Research Centre, University of Zimbabwe"}, "6602918610": {"Name": "Kityo C.", "AuthorID": "6602918610", "AffiliationID": "60033774", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Research Centre, University of Zimbabwe"}, "35372648800": {"Name": "Phillips A.N.", "AuthorID": "35372648800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infection and Population Health, University College London"}, "6701499800": {"Name": "Katabira E.", "AuthorID": "6701499800", "AffiliationID": "60071676", "AffiliationName": "Department of Research, Infectious Diseases Institute, Makerere University"}, "57194009377": {"Name": "Chane A.K.", "AuthorID": "57194009377", "AffiliationID": "60016849", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, University of Toronto"}, "57194022227": {"Name": "Musiimea V.", "AuthorID": "57194022227", "AffiliationID": "60031004", "AffiliationName": "School of Population Health, University of Queensland"}, "35495600000": {"Name": "Gibb D.M.", "AuthorID": "35495600000", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council, Clinical Trials Unit at University College London"}, "7401568316": {"Name": "Ford D.", "AuthorID": "7401568316", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council, Clinical Trials Unit at University College London"}}}
