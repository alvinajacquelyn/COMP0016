However, it can be difficult for older people with dementia, particularly those living alone, to access Cognitive Stimulation Therapy groups in the community. Television offers familiar technology with potential to transmit material similar to that used in Cognitive Stimulation Therapy groups. Consequently, an interactive pilot television episode of Cognitive Stimulation Therapy was devised that adheres to the key principles and session themes of group Cognitive Stimulation Therapy. Consideration was given to the suitability of resources, on-screen visual cues, time given for the person with dementia viewing to process, consider and answer questions, possible interactions with the audience, and the grading of activities. The aim of the pilot episode was to be accessible in the home of the person with dementia, by themselves or with a caregiver, with the potential for enjoyment and cognitive stimulation similar to that seen in group Cognitive Stimulation Therapy.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cognitive Stimulation Therapy", "dementia", "implementation", "innovative practice", "quality of life", "television"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85062941412", "SubjectAreas": [["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"], ["Social Sciences (all)", "SOCI", "3300"]], "AuthorData": {"54405136100": {"Name": "Streater A.", "AuthorID": "54405136100", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry and Applied Psychology, University of Nottingham"}, "8664530600": {"Name": "Yates L.", "AuthorID": "8664530600", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry and Applied Psychology, University of Nottingham"}, "7006161600": {"Name": "Orrell M.", "AuthorID": "7006161600", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry and Applied Psychology, University of Nottingham"}, "57207820989": {"Name": "Rosen J.", "AuthorID": "57207820989", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry and Applied Psychology, University of Nottingham"}, "57207830010": {"Name": "Taylor Smith A.", "AuthorID": "57207830010", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry and Applied Psychology, University of Nottingham"}, "7404422376": {"Name": "Schneider J.", "AuthorID": "7404422376", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry and Applied Psychology, University of Nottingham"}}}
