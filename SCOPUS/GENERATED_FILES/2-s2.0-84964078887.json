The relationship between healthcare services and physical facilities and the resultant effect on the level of patient satisfaction was explored. The samples of this research were based on the feedbacks of 400 in and out patients from two private hospitals in the east of Bangkok, Thailand, supported by a one-day survey for collecting data on patient satisfaction. Statistical analysis including frequencies, percentages and relationship was applied within the methodology including consideration to the limitations of this research. The research results were able to highlight what particular services affected the satisfaction level of patients most, which proved to be important when aiming to reduce dissatisfaction rates. The research mainly examined B-class graded healthcare businesses in Bangkok and patient perception of its facilities and service quality, highlighting several key relationships that showed high level of relationship between the feedbacks received; such relationships between core and non-core facilities/services could therefore be improved to directly affect patient satisfaction.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Customer Perception", "Customer Satisfaction", "Facilities Management", "Healthcare", "Thailand"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84964078887", "SubjectAreas": [["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"15838056200": {"Name": "Pitt M.", "AuthorID": "15838056200", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Bartlett School of Graduate Studies, University College London"}, "57188872570": {"Name": "Panupattanapong P.", "AuthorID": "57188872570", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Bartlett School of Graduate Studies, University College London"}, "24474159000": {"Name": "Chotipanich S.", "AuthorID": "24474159000", "AffiliationID": "60028190", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Architecture, Chulalongkorn University"}, "57188871958": {"Name": "Issarasak S.", "AuthorID": "57188871958", "AffiliationID": "60028190", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Architecture, Chulalongkorn University"}, "57188881097": {"Name": "Mulholland K.", "AuthorID": "57188881097", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil, Environmental and Geomatic Engineering, University College London"}}}
