Human poisoning with AlP due to suicide attempt or accidental environmental exposure is associated with very high mortality partially due to development of severe metabolic acidosis. Previous studies have shown that hemoglobin has high buffering capacity and erythrocytes can potentially be used for management of metabolic acidosis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of fresh packed red blood cells (RBC) transfusion on survival and cardiovascular function in AlP-poisoned rats. Methodology/Principal findings Rats were poisoned with AlP by gavage. Fresh packed RBC was transfused via tail vein after AlP administration. Acid-base balance, vital signs and mortality was assessed and compared in experimental groups. Infusion of fresh packed RBC (1.5 ml) one hour after AlP (4\u201315 mg/kg) intoxication was associated with a significant decrease in mortality rate. Packed RBC infusion improved blood pH, HCO3-, Na+ and Ca2+ levels. Plasma troponin level was also reduced and ECG changes were reversed following packed RBC infusion in AlP intoxicated rats. Conclusions Our results showed that fresh RBC transfusion could ameliorate metabolic acidosis and enhance survival in AlP-poisoned rat. We assume that an increase in pool of RBCs may modulate acid-base balance or potentially chelate AlP-related toxic intermediates via phosphine-hemoglobin interaction.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Acidosis", "Aluminum Compounds", "Animals", "Erythrocyte Transfusion", "Erythrocytes", "Hemoglobins", "Pesticides", "Phosphines", "Rats", "Rats, Wistar"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85044715981", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"54781701100": {"Name": "Rahimi N.", "AuthorID": "54781701100", "AffiliationID": "60025392", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacology, School of Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences"}, "35733175500": {"Name": "Abdolghaffari A.H.", "AuthorID": "35733175500", "AffiliationID": "60089143, 60017558", "AffiliationName": "Medicinal Plants Research Center, Institute of Medicinal Plants, ACECR"}, "16836868100": {"Name": "Partoazar A.", "AuthorID": "16836868100", "AffiliationID": "60195975, 60027708", "AffiliationName": "Experimental Medicine Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences"}, "57190733719": {"Name": "Javadian N.", "AuthorID": "57190733719", "AffiliationID": "60025392", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacology, School of Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences"}, "7005678616": {"Name": "Dehpour A.R.", "AuthorID": "7005678616", "AffiliationID": "60025392", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacology, School of Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences"}, "54917541500": {"Name": "Dehpour T.", "AuthorID": "54917541500", "AffiliationID": "60162048", "AffiliationName": "Whittington Hospital NHS Trust"}, "7101619634": {"Name": "Mani A.R.", "AuthorID": "7101619634", "AffiliationID": "60182839, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Division of Medicine, University College London"}}}
