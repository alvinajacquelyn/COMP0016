A unified Boltzmann equation set is solved for hydrodynamic and thermodynamic quantities as well as higher order kinetic moments. The collision, reaction, and force terms are uniformly calculated with a matrix inversion method, which is physically accurate, numerically efficient, and convenient for coding. Via the Chapman-Enskog analysis, the DBM is demonstrated to recover reactive Navier-Stokes (NS) equations in the hydrodynamic limit. Both specific heat ratio and Prandtl number are adjustable. Moreover, it provides quantification of hydrodynamic and thermodynamic nonequilibrium effects beyond the NS equations. The capability of the DBM is demonstrated through simulations of chemical reactions in the free falling process, sound wave, thermal Couette flow, and steady and unsteady detonation cases. Moreover, nonequilibrium effects on the predicted physical quantities in unsteady combustion are quantified via the DBM. It is demonstrated that nonequilibrium effects suppress detonation instability and dissipate small oscillations of fluid flows.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Higher-order kinetics", "Matrix inversion methods", "Multiple-relaxation time", "Non-equilibrium effects", "Physical quantities", "Specific heat ratio", "Thermodynamic non-equilibrium", "Thermodynamic quantities"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85061249352", "SubjectAreas": [["Statistical and Nonlinear Physics", "PHYS", "3109"], ["Statistics and Probability", "MATH", "2613"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"]], "AuthorData": {"35337043800": {"Name": "Lin C.", "AuthorID": "35337043800", "AffiliationID": "60025278, 60001604, 60123068", "AffiliationName": "Center for Combustion Energy, Key Laboratory for Thermal Science and Power Engineering, Ministry of Education, Department of Energy and Power Engineering, Tsinghua University"}, "7102436109": {"Name": "Luo K.H.", "AuthorID": "7102436109", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}}}
