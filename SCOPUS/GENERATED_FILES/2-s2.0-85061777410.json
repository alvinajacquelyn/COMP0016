However, constructing effective measures of students\u2019 approaches to learning is a complex task, and it is an empirical question whether such measures transfer well across contexts. In this paper, we examine the functioning of a moderately modified version of one of the most commonly used assessment of approaches to learning \u2013 the revised two-factor Study Process Questionnaire (R-SPQ2F) \u2013 in three African contexts (Ghana, Kenya and Botswana). We first present confirmatory factor analysis, which demonstrates that the modified R-SPQ2F functions in these contexts as intended by the developers of the instrument. We then consider the potential utility of the R-SPQ2F in these contexts by examining its relationship with student background characteristics, educational experiences at universities and learning outcomes.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Approaches to learning", "confirmatory factor analysis", "higher education", "research methods"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85061777410", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"]], "AuthorData": {"16234808800": {"Name": "Rolleston C.", "AuthorID": "16234808800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "56646320300": {"Name": "Schendel R.", "AuthorID": "56646320300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "57206659298": {"Name": "Grijalva Espinosa A.", "AuthorID": "57206659298", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
