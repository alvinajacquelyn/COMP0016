Furthermore, a long-chain selective glycerol-3-phosphocholine diacylation is elucidated. These reactions are environmentally benign, rapid, high yielding, and the products are readily purified. Importantly, this reaction may indicate a prebiotically plausible reaction pathway for the selective acylation of key metabolites to facilitate their incorporation into protometabolism.", "AuthorKeywords": ["acylation", "lipids", "nucleotides", "prebiotic chemistry", "water"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84991236331", "SubjectAreas": [["Organic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1605"]], "AuthorData": {"57191518996": {"Name": "Fern\u00e1ndez-Garc\u00eda C.", "AuthorID": "57191518996", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "14631029600": {"Name": "Powner M.", "AuthorID": "14631029600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
