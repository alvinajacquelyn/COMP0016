A centralized PCa AS database, comprising data of more than 15 000 patients worldwide, was created. Comparability of the histopathology between the different cohorts was assessed by a centralized pathology review of 445 biopsies from 15 GAP3 centers. Grade group 1 (Gleason score 6) in 85% and grade group \u22652 (Gleason score \u22657) in 15% showed 89% concordance at review with moderate agreement (\u03ba = 0.56). Average biopsy core length was similar among the analyzed cohorts. Recently established highly adverse pathologies, including cribriform and/or intraductal carcinoma, were observed in 3.6% of the reviewed biopsies. In conclusion, the centralized pathology review of 445 biopsies revealed comparable histopathology among the 15 GAP3 centers with a low frequency of high-risk features. This enables further data analyses\u2014without correction\u2014toward uniform global AS guidelines for men with low-risk PCa. Patient summary: Movember Foundation's Global Action Plan Prostate Cancer Active Surveillance (GAP3) initiative combines data from 15 000 men with low-risk prostate cancer (PCa) across the globe to standardize active surveillance protocols. Histopathology review confirmed that the histopathology was consistent with low-risk PCa in most men and comparable between different centers. A centralized pathological review showed consistent biopsy quality and Gleason grading within the global active surveillance Global Action Plan 3 initiative, a prerequisite for future studies toward uniform global guidelines for active surveillance of men with low-risk prostate cancer.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Active surveillance", "Biopsy quality", "GAP3 consortium", "Gleason grading", "Pathology review", "Prostate cancer"], "IndexKeywords": ["Biopsy", "Humans", "Male", "Neoplasm Grading", "Prostatic Neoplasms", "Quality of Health Care", "Watchful Waiting"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85067355838", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"], ["Urology", "MEDI", "2748"]], "AuthorData": {"35397577500": {"Name": "van der Kwast T.H.", "AuthorID": "35397577500", "AffiliationID": "60008768, 60014468", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, Princess Margaret Cancer Center, University Health Network"}, "57207794706": {"Name": "Helleman J.", "AuthorID": "57207794706", "AffiliationID": "60032114", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, Erasmus MC"}, "55453603300": {"Name": "Nieboer D.", "AuthorID": "55453603300", "AffiliationID": "60032114", "AffiliationName": "Department of Public Health, Erasmus MC"}, "55555569200": {"Name": "Bruinsma S.M.", "AuthorID": "55555569200", "AffiliationID": "60032114", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, Erasmus MC"}, "57203077040": {"Name": "Roobol M.J.", "AuthorID": "57203077040", "AffiliationID": "60032114", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, Erasmus MC"}}}
