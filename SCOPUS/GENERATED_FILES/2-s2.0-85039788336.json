This is challenging when they are different in detail and extent. Practical methods of Computer Vision approach this through the tools of downsampling, pyramids, cropping and patches. In this paper we develop an ideal geometric structure for this, compatible with the existing scale space model of image measurement. Its elements are apertures which view the image like fuzzy-edged portholes of frosted glass. We establish containment and cause/effect relations between apertures, and show that these link them into cross-scale atlases. Atlases formed of Gaussian apertures are shown to be a continuous version of the image pyramid used in Computer Vision, and allow various types of image description to naturally be expressed within their framework. We show that views through Gaussian apertures are approximately equivalent to the jets of derivative of Gaussian filter responses that form part of standard Scale Space theory. This supports a view of the simple cells of mammalian V1 as implementing a system of local views of the retinal image of varying extent and resolution. As a worked example we develop a keypoint descriptor scheme that outperforms previous schemes that do not make use of learning.", "AuthorKeywords": ["filter steering", "Gaussian derivatives", "Image analysis", "image representation", "image resolution", "keypoints"], "IndexKeywords": ["Apertures", "Filtering theory", "Gaussian derivatives", "Image representations", "IP networks", "Kernel", "Keypoints"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85039788336", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition", "COMP", "1707"], ["Computational Theory and Mathematics", "COMP", "1703"], ["Artificial Intelligence", "COMP", "1702"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"7102753156": {"Name": "Griffin L.", "AuthorID": "7102753156", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dept of Computer Science, University College London"}}}
