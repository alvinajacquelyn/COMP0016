All rights reserved.Post-focus compression (PFC), the lowering of pitch range and intensity of the post prosodic focus components, is a phenomenon that has been found in various languages worldwide. The interesting findings of the presence and absence of PFC in two closely-related Mandarin Chinese languages, Beijing Mandarin and Taiwan Mandarin respectively, have brought several discussions on the historical origin and spreading of PFC. This study examined Jincheng subgroup of Lan-Yin Mandarin, a group of Mandarin Chinese mainly spoken in the North-western region of China. Acoustic analyses and statistics showed that all speakers raised their pitch and intensity of focused words, and lowered pitch and intensity of post-focused words except in one condition where post-low bouncing was present. We therefore conclude that Lan-Yin Mandarin exhibits PFC in a very similar way as in Beijing Mandarin, and this further provides support for a hypothetical major typological division among the Chinese languages.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Lan-Yin Mandarin", "Post-focus compression", "Post-low bouncing", "Prosodic focus"], "IndexKeywords": ["Acoustic analysis", "Beijing mandarins", "Chinese language", "Jincheng", "Mandarin Chinese", "Post-low bouncing", "Taiwan Mandarin", "Western region of chinas"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84982918877", "SubjectAreas": [["Language and Linguistics", "ARTS", "1203"], ["Linguistics and Language", "SOCI", "3310"]], "AuthorData": {"57190756838": {"Name": "Shen C.", "AuthorID": "57190756838", "AffiliationID": "60001881", "AffiliationName": "School of English and Department of Human Communication Sciences, University of Sheffield"}, "55695016900": {"Name": "Xu Y.", "AuthorID": "55695016900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Speech, Hearing and Phonetic Sciences, University College London"}}}
