However, there remains much debate regarding the roles and responsibilities for PA promotion, as well as \u201coptimal\u201d recommendations and advice. This study aimed to qualitatively explore cystic fibrosis (CF) multidisciplinary teams (MDTs) advice, recommendations and practices relating to PA promotion for adolescents with CF. Method: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with fifteen members of CF MDTs (11 physiotherapists, two dieticians and two paediatricians). Thematic analysis was used to analyse the data. Results: Major themes identified were: (1) structure of MDTs, (2) recommendations relating to intensities, durations and types of PA, and (3) use of exercise testing. Participants reported variation between MDTs in terms of who is responsible for promoting and supporting PA, the nature of advice given to patients, and the use of exercise testing. Participants consistently lacked confidence in their own or others\u2019 knowledge to provide standardised recommendations to patients and highlighted that PA promotion and support was often overlooked during busy periods. Conclusions: Despite its importance, PA support and promotion is not always prioritised. MDTs lack confidence in their ability to promote PA. Standardised advice and training relating to optimal intensities, durations and types of PA would provide a baseline from which to individualise advice to each patient and could increase confidence in PA promotion among MDTs.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cystic fibrosis", "Exercise", "Physical activity", "Qualitative", "Respiratory", "Youth"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Cystic Fibrosis", "Exercise", "Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice", "Health Promotion", "Humans", "Patient Care Team", "Qualitative Research", "Standard of Care", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85064162425", "SubjectAreas": [["Physical Therapy, Sports Therapy and Rehabilitation", "HEAL", "3612"]], "AuthorData": {"24070564000": {"Name": "Denford S.", "AuthorID": "24070564000", "AffiliationID": "60026479", "AffiliationName": "Children's Health and Exercise Research Centre, Sport and Health Sciences, University of Exeter"}, "14008425100": {"Name": "Barker A.R.", "AuthorID": "14008425100", "AffiliationID": "60026479", "AffiliationName": "Children's Health and Exercise Research Centre, Sport and Health Sciences, University of Exeter"}, "57201609242": {"Name": "Williams C.A.", "AuthorID": "57201609242", "AffiliationID": "60026479", "AffiliationName": "Children's Health and Exercise Research Centre, Sport and Health Sciences, University of Exeter"}, "54393701200": {"Name": "Mackintosh K.A.", "AuthorID": "54393701200", "AffiliationID": "60004572", "AffiliationName": "Applied Sports Science, Technology, Exercise and Medicine Research Centre (A-STEM), Swansea University, Bay Campus"}, "36545062000": {"Name": "McNarry M.A.", "AuthorID": "36545062000", "AffiliationID": "60004572", "AffiliationName": "Applied Sports Science, Technology, Exercise and Medicine Research Centre (A-STEM), Swansea University, Bay Campus"}}}
