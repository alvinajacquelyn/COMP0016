The frequency\u2013magnitude distribution analysis is performed in a nonextensive statistical physics context. The nonextensive parameter q<inf>M</inf>, which is related to the frequency-magnitude distribution, reflects the existence of long-range correlations and is used as an index of the physical state of the studied area. Examination of the possible variations of q<inf>M</inf> values is performed during the period 1990\u20131998. A significant increase of q<inf>M</inf> occurs some months before the strong earthquake on April 9, 1994 indicating the start of a preparation phase prior to the Kobe earthquake. It should be noted that this increase coincides with the occurrence of six seismic events. Each of these events had a magnitude M = 4.1. The evolution of seismicity along with the increase of q<inf>M</inf> indicate the system\u2019s transition away from equilibrium and its preparation for energy release. It seems that the variations of q<inf>M</inf> values reflect rather well the physical evolution towards the 1995 Kobe earthquake.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Earthquake magnitudes", "Frequency-magnitude distribution", "Japan earthquakes", "Kobe earthquake", "Long range correlations", "Magnitude distribution", "Non-extensive statistical physics", "Strong earthquakes"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84931281572", "SubjectAreas": [["Geophysics", "EART", "1908"], ["Geochemistry and Petrology", "EART", "1906"]], "AuthorData": {"36483451100": {"Name": "Papadakis G.", "AuthorID": "36483451100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Risk and Disaster Reduction, University College London"}, "56264486500": {"Name": "Vallianatos F.", "AuthorID": "56264486500", "AffiliationID": "60032307", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Geophysics and Seismology, Technological Educational Institute of Crete"}, "6603943658": {"Name": "Sammonds P.", "AuthorID": "6603943658", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Risk and Disaster Reduction, University College London"}}}
