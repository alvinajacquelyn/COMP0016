We aimed to analyze demographic, depression, and trauma characteristics of major depressive disorder (MDD) patients with regard to inflammatory monocyte gene expression. Fifty-six naturalistically treated MDD patients (32\u00b112years) and 57 healthy controls (HC; 31\u00b111years) were analyzed by the Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (IDS) and by the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ). We determined the expression of 38 inflammatory and immune activation genes including the glucocorticoid receptor (GR)\u03b1 and GR\u03b2 genes in purified CD14+ monocytes using quantitative-polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Monocyte gene expression was age-dependent, particularly in MDD patients. Increased monocyte gene expression and decreased GR\u03b1/\u03b2 ratio were only present in MDD patients aged \u226528years. Post hoc analyses of monocyte immune activation in patients <28years showed two subgroups: a subgroup with a severe course of depression (recurrent type, onset <15years) - additionally characterized by panic/arousal symptoms and childhood trauma - that had a monocyte gene expression similar to HC, and a second subgroup with a milder course of the disorder (73% first episode depression, onset \u226515years) - additionally characterized by the absence of panic symptoms - that exhibited a strongly reduced inflammatory monocyte activation compared to HC. In conclusion, monocyte immune activation was not uniformly raised in MDD patients but was increased only in patients of 28years and older.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Age", "Glucocorticoid receptor", "Inflammation", "Major depressive disorder", "Monocyte gene expression", "Psychoneuroimmunology"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Age Factors", "Depressive Disorder, Major", "Female", "Gene Expression", "Humans", "Inflammation", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Monocytes", "Receptors, Glucocorticoid", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84918512616", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"], ["Endocrine and Autonomic Systems", "NEUR", "2807"], ["Behavioral Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2802"]], "AuthorData": {"56344342200": {"Name": "Grosse L.", "AuthorID": "56344342200", "AffiliationID": "60000401", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, University of M\u00fcnster"}, "55341940400": {"Name": "Ruland T.", "AuthorID": "55341940400", "AffiliationID": "60000401", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, University of M\u00fcnster"}, "8764118800": {"Name": "Ambr\u00e9e O.", "AuthorID": "8764118800", "AffiliationID": "60000401", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, University of M\u00fcnster"}, "6603149596": {"Name": "Alferink J.", "AuthorID": "6603149596", "AffiliationID": "60000401", "AffiliationName": "Cells-in-Motion Cluster of Excellence (EXC 1003-CiM), University of M\u00fcnster"}, "56247579900": {"Name": "Arolt V.", "AuthorID": "56247579900", "AffiliationID": "60000401", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, University of M\u00fcnster"}, "55440517500": {"Name": "Carvalho L.", "AuthorID": "55440517500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "7801340241": {"Name": "Wijkhuijs A.", "AuthorID": "7801340241", "AffiliationID": "60032114", "AffiliationName": "Department of Immunology"}, "55624007700": {"Name": "Drexhage H.", "AuthorID": "55624007700", "AffiliationID": "60032114", "AffiliationName": "Department of Immunology"}, "23767154900": {"Name": "Bellingrath S.", "AuthorID": "23767154900", "AffiliationID": "60014264", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, University of Duisburg-Essen"}, "6603589721": {"Name": "Ehring T.", "AuthorID": "6603589721", "AffiliationID": "60000401", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, University of M\u00fcnster"}}}
