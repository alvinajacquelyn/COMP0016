One particularly promising approach is based upon tissue engineering and involves applying autologous cells to transplantable scaffolds. Here, we present the reported pre-clinical and clinical data exploring the various options for achieving such seeding. Recent Findings: Various cell combinations, delivery strategies, and outcome measures are described. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are the most widely employed cell type in tracheal bioengineering. Airway epithelial cell luminal seeding is also widely employed, alone or in combination with other cell types. Combinations have thus far shown the greatest promise. Chondrocytes may improve mechanical outcomes in pre-clinical models, but have not been clinically tested. Rapid or pre-vascularization of scaffolds is an important consideration. Overall, there are few published objective measures of post-seeding cell viability, survival, or overall efficacy. Summary: There is no clear consensus on the optimal cell-scaffold combination and mechanisms for seeding. Systematic in vivo work is required to assess differences between tracheal grafts seeded with combinations of clinically deliverable cell types using objective outcome measures, including those for functionality and host immune response.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Autologous cell seeding", "Clinical translation", "Pre-clinical models", "Tissue engineering", "Trachea"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85046021632", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Developmental Biology", "BIOC", "1309"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"24574421800": {"Name": "Maughan E.F.", "AuthorID": "24574421800", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60018207", "AffiliationName": "Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine Section, UCL Institute of Child Health and Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "55503347900": {"Name": "Hynds R.E.", "AuthorID": "55503347900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Lungs for Living Research Centre, UCL Respiratory, University College London"}, "56514246800": {"Name": "Janes S.M.", "AuthorID": "56514246800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Lungs for Living Research Centre, UCL Respiratory, University College London"}, "57203257829": {"Name": "De Coppi P.", "AuthorID": "57203257829", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Centre for Regenerative Medicine, University College London"}, "57204557861": {"Name": "Proctor T.J.", "AuthorID": "57204557861", "AffiliationID": "60032819, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cell, Gene and Tissue Therapies, Royal Free Hospital & University College London"}, "7003930276": {"Name": "Lowdell M.W.", "AuthorID": "7003930276", "AffiliationID": "60032819, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cell, Gene and Tissue Therapies, Royal Free Hospital & University College London"}, "7402622372": {"Name": "Elliott M.", "AuthorID": "7402622372", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "7004957785": {"Name": "Birchall M.A.", "AuthorID": "7004957785", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Centre for Regenerative Medicine, University College London"}}}
