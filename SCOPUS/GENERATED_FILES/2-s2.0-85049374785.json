Methods: A total of 418 hospitalized patients were analyzed between January and September 2016 in a noncardiac intensive care unit. Clinical characteristics, interventions, and biochemical markers were recorded during hospitalization. In-hospital mortality and length of hospital stay in the intensive care unit were also evaluated. Results: A total of 310 patients were included. The mean age of the patients was 61.0 \u00b1 18.3 years, 49.4% were male, and 23.5% presented de novo atrial fibrillation. The multivariate model identified previous stroke (OR = 10.09; p = 0.016) and elevated levels of pro-B type natriuretic peptide (proBNP, OR = 1.28 for each 1,000pg/mL increment; p = 0.004) as independent predictors of de novo atrial fibrillation. Analysis of the proBNP receiver operating characteristic curve for prediction of de novo atrial fibrillation revealed an area under the curve of 0.816 (p < 0.001), with a sensitivity of 65.2% and a specificity of 82% for proBNP > 5,666pg/mL. There were no differences in mortality (p = 0.370), but the lengths of hospital stay (p = 0.002) and stay in the intensive care unit (p = 0.031) were higher in patients with de novo atrial fibrillation. Conclusions: A history of previous stroke and elevated proBNP during hospitalization were independent predictors of de novo atrial fibrillation in the polyvalent intensive care unit. The proBNP is a useful and easy- and quick-access tool in the stratification of atrial fibrillation risk.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Atrial fibrillation/ epidemiology", "Incidence", "Intensive care"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Atrial Fibrillation", "Biomarkers", "Female", "Hospital Mortality", "Hospitalization", "Humans", "Intensive Care Units", "Length of Stay", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Multivariate Analysis", "Natriuretic Peptide, Brain", "Peptide Fragments", "Prognosis", "Retrospective Studies", "Risk Factors", "ROC Curve", "Sensitivity and Specificity"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85049374785", "SubjectAreas": [["Critical Care and Intensive Care Medicine", "MEDI", "2706"]], "AuthorData": {"57196035427": {"Name": "Augusto J.B.", "AuthorID": "57196035427", "AffiliationID": "113142699", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Hospital Professor Doutor Fernando Fonseca"}, "7004828617": {"Name": "Morais C.", "AuthorID": "7004828617", "AffiliationID": "113142699", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Hospital Professor Doutor Fernando Fonseca"}, "57199406802": {"Name": "Fernandes A.", "AuthorID": "57199406802", "AffiliationID": "113142699", "AffiliationName": "Polyvalent Intensive Care Unit, Hospital Professor Doutor Fernando Fonseca"}, "57198890162": {"Name": "De Freitas P.T.", "AuthorID": "57198890162", "AffiliationID": "113142699", "AffiliationName": "Polyvalent Intensive Care Unit, Hospital Professor Doutor Fernando Fonseca"}, "7006635729": {"Name": "Gil V.", "AuthorID": "7006635729", "AffiliationID": "106743797", "AffiliationName": "Cardiovascular Unit, Hospital dos Lus\u00edadas"}}}
