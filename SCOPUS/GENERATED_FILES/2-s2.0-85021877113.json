Some aspects of perception reflect processing within individual channels, but others involve the integration of information across them. One instance of this is sound localization, which improves with increasing bandwidth. The processing of binaural cues for sound location has been studied extensively. However, although the advantage conferred by bandwidth is clear, we currently know little about how this additional information is combined to form our percept of space. We investigated the ability of cells in the auditory system of guinea pigs to compare interaural level differences (ILDs), a key localization cue, between tones of disparate frequencies in each ear. Cells in auditory cortex believed to be integral to ILD processing (excitatory from one ear, inhibitory from the other: EI cells) compare ILDs separately over restricted frequency ranges which are not consistent with their monaural tuning. In contrast, cells that are excitatory from both ears (EE cells) show no evidence of frequency-specific processing. Both cell types are explained by a model in which ILDs are computed within separate frequency channels and subsequently combined in a single cortical cell. Interestingly, ILD processing in all inferior colliculus cell types (EE and EI) is largely consistent with processing within single, matched-frequency channels from each ear. Our data suggest a clear constraint on the way that localization cues are integrated: cortical ILD tuning to broadband sounds is a composite of separate, frequency specific, binaurally sensitive channels. This frequency-specific processing appears after the level of the midbrain.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Auditory cortex", "Frequency specificity", "Inferior colliculus", "Sound localization"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Auditory Cortex", "Female", "Guinea Pigs", "Male", "Mesencephalon", "Nerve Net", "Pitch Discrimination", "Sound Localization", "Space Perception"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85021877113", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"]], "AuthorData": {"55308098400": {"Name": "Sollini J.", "AuthorID": "55308098400", "AffiliationID": "60015138, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council Institute of Hearing Research, University of Nottingham"}, "36802198000": {"Name": "Mill R.", "AuthorID": "36802198000", "AffiliationID": "60015138, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council Institute of Hearing Research, University of Nottingham"}, "16508104900": {"Name": "Sumner C.J.", "AuthorID": "16508104900", "AffiliationID": "60015138, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council Institute of Hearing Research, University of Nottingham"}}}
