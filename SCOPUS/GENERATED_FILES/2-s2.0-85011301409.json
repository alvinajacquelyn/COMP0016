EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have high response rates in patients with activating EGFR mutations, but acquired resistance is inevitable. Acquisition of the EGFR T790M mutation causes over 50% of resistance; MET amplification is also common. Preclinical data suggest synergy between MET and EGFR inhibitors. We hypothesized that EGFR-MET dimerization determines response to MET inhibition, depending on EGFR mutation status, independently of MET copy number. We tested this hypothesis by generating isogenic cell lines from NCI-H1975 cells, which co-express L858R and T790M EGFR mutations, namely H1975L858R/T790M (EGFR TKI resistant); H1975L858R (sensitized) and H1975WT (wild-type). We assessed cell proliferation in vitro and tumor growth/stroma formation in derived xenograft models in response to a MET TKI (SGX523) and correlated with EGFR-MET dimerization assessed by F\u00f6rster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET). SGX523 significantly reduced H1975L858R/T790M cell proliferation, xenograft tumor growth and decreased ERK phosphorylation. The same was not seen in H1975L858R or H1975WT cells. SGX523 only reduced stroma formation in H1975L858R. SGX523 reduced EGFR-MET dimerization in H1975L858R/T790M but induced dimer formation in H1975L858R with no effect in H1975WT. Our data suggests that MET inhibition by SGX523 and EGFR-MET heterodimerisation are determined by EGFR genotype. As tumor behaviour is modulated by this interaction, this could determine treatment efficacy.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adenocarcinoma", "Animals", "Cell Line, Tumor", "Cell Proliferation", "Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases", "Focal Adhesion Protein-Tyrosine Kinases", "HEK293 Cells", "Humans", "Lung Neoplasms", "Mice, Inbred BALB C", "Mice, Nude", "Mutation", "Phosphorylation", "Protein Binding", "Protein Kinase Inhibitors", "Protein Multimerization", "Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt", "Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-met", "Receptor, Epidermal Growth Factor", "Reproducibility of Results"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85011301409", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"7801403447": {"Name": "Ortiz-Zapater E.", "AuthorID": "7801403447", "AffiliationID": "60009797, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "Division of Asthma, Allergy and Lung Biology, King's College London, Guy's Hospital"}, "57220848794": {"Name": "Lee R.W.", "AuthorID": "57220848794", "AffiliationID": "60009797, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "Division of Asthma, Allergy and Lung Biology, King's College London, Guy's Hospital"}, "57189066652": {"Name": "Owen W.", "AuthorID": "57189066652", "AffiliationID": "60009797, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "Division of Asthma, Allergy and Lung Biology, King's College London, Guy's Hospital"}, "25632441400": {"Name": "McCaughan F.", "AuthorID": "25632441400", "AffiliationID": "60009797, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "Division of Asthma, Allergy and Lung Biology, King's College London, Guy's Hospital"}, "6701907274": {"Name": "Santis G.", "AuthorID": "6701907274", "AffiliationID": "60009797, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "Division of Asthma, Allergy and Lung Biology, King's College London, Guy's Hospital"}, "6508113523": {"Name": "Weitsman G.", "AuthorID": "6508113523", "AffiliationID": "60177635, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "Richard Dimbleby Department of Cancer Research, Randall Division of Cell and Molecular Biophysics, King's College London, Guy's Medical School Campus"}, "7402229941": {"Name": "Ng T.", "AuthorID": "7402229941", "AffiliationID": "60109234, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Cancer Institute, Paul O' Gorman Building, University College London"}, "6507547753": {"Name": "Fruhwirth G.", "AuthorID": "6507547753", "AffiliationID": "60004111, 60177635, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Imaging Chemistry and Biology, Division of Imaging Science and Biomedical Engineering, King's College London, Rayne Institute, St. Thomas' Hospital"}, "57220719987": {"Name": "Dunn R.G.", "AuthorID": "57220719987", "AffiliationID": "60009797, 60005518", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cancer Genetics, Viapath, Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust, Guy's Hospital"}, "55936348500": {"Name": "Neat M.J.", "AuthorID": "55936348500", "AffiliationID": "60009797, 60005518", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cancer Genetics, Viapath, Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust, Guy's Hospital"}, "7202013506": {"Name": "Parker P.", "AuthorID": "7202013506", "AffiliationID": "60107285", "AffiliationName": "Protein Phosphorylation Laboratory, Francis Crick Institute"}}}
