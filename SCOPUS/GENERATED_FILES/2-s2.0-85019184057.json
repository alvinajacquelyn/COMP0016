We examine policy discourses leading up to that. The government supported the removal of Assad but faced the challenge of explaining how that would be realised. Given its unwillingness and inability to mobilise support for military intervention, or to tailor policy goals to match available means, government strategy arguably lacked credibility. Our purpose is to examine how the government tried to close this ends means gap and how, having failed to do that, its \u2018discursive strategy\u2019 legitimised its approach. We argue the resources for the government\u2019s discursive strategy on Syria can be found in the earlier articulation of \u2018liberal conservatism\u2019. A policy that from an ideal-liberal or ideal-conservative position might have been criticised as half-baked was maintained by a strategy that gave consideration to, but did not completely follow through on, either archetype. Drawing on an analysis of 2,152 sources and supplemented by elite interviews, we illustrate how this strategy managed the interplay of two basic discourses: a liberal insistence that the UK should support \u2018the Arab Spring\u2019 and a conservative insistence that military intervention was imprudent because \u2018Syria was not Libya\u2019.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Discursive Strategy", "Intervention", "Syria", "UK Foreign Policy"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85019184057", "SubjectAreas": [["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"], ["Political Science and International Relations", "SOCI", "3320"]], "AuthorData": {"35559727200": {"Name": "Ralph J.", "AuthorID": "35559727200", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": null}, "36639856400": {"Name": "Holland J.", "AuthorID": "36639856400", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": null}, "57194208894": {"Name": "Zhekova K.", "AuthorID": "57194208894", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": null}}}
