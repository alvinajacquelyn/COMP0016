This paper outlines how EMS works and investigates its accuracy for linkage across public health datasets. Methods: EMS is a configurable Microsoft SQL Server database program. To examine the accuracy of EMS, two public health databases were matched using National Health Service (NHS) numbers as a gold standard unique identifier. Probabilistic linkage was then performed on the same two datasets without inclusion of NHS number. Sensitivity analyses were carried out to examine the effect of varying matching process parameters. Results: Exact matching using NHS number between two datasets (containing 5931 and 1759 records) identified 1071 matched pairs. EMS probabilistic linkage identified 1068 record pairs. The sensitivity of probabilistic linkage was calculated as 99.5% (95%CI: 98.9, 99.8), specificity 100.0% (95%CI: 99.9,100.0), positive predictive value 99.8% (95%CI: 99.3,100.0), and negative predictive value 99.9% (95%CI: 99.8,100.0). Probabilistic matching was most accurate when including address variables and using the automatically generated threshold for determining links with manual review. Conclusion: With the establishment of national electronic datasets across health and social care, EMS enables previously unanswerable research questions to be tackled with confidence in the Copyright:", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Databases, Factual", "Electronic Health Records", "England", "Epidemiologic Studies", "Humans", "Medical Record Linkage", "Public Health", "Tuberculosis"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84942848810", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"57209842885": {"Name": "Aldridge R.W.", "AuthorID": "57209842885", "AffiliationID": "114434400", "AffiliationName": "Farr Institute of Health Informatics Research"}, "35944648500": {"Name": "Hayward A.C.", "AuthorID": "35944648500", "AffiliationID": "114434400", "AffiliationName": "Farr Institute of Health Informatics Research"}, "56884444800": {"Name": "Shaji K.", "AuthorID": "56884444800", "AffiliationID": "60000733, 60111140", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Infectious Disease Surveillance and Control, Public Health England"}, "6602338051": {"Name": "Abubakar I.", "AuthorID": "6602338051", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60003108", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infection and Population Health, MRC Clinical Trials Unit, University College London"}}}
