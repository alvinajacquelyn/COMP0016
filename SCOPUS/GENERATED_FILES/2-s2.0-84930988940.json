In this longitudinal study, the effect of natalizumab on absolute concentrations of total N-acetylaspartate, a marker for neuronal integrity, and other brain metabolites is investigated in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis by using MR spectroscopic imaging. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this explorative observational study, 25 patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis initiating natalizumab treatment were included and scanned every 6 months for 18 months. Additionally 18 matched patients with relapsingremitting multiple sclerosis continuing treatment with interferon-\u03b2 or glatiramer acetate were included along with 12 healthy controls. Imaging included short TE 2D-MR spectroscopic imaging with absolute metabolite quantification of total N-acetylaspartate, creatine and phosphocreatine, choline-containing compounds, myo-inositol, and glutamate. Concentrations were determined for lesional white matter, normal-appearing white matter, and gray matter. RESULTS: At baseline in both patient groups, lower concentrations of total N-acetylaspartate and creatine and phosphocreatine were found in lesional white matter compared with normal-appearing white matter and additionally lower glutamate in lesional white matter of patients receiving natalizumab. In those patients, a significant yearly metabolite increase was found for lesional white matter total N-acetylaspartate (7%, P < .001), creatine and phosphocreatine (6%, P = .042), and glutamate (10%, P = .028), while lesion volumes did not change. In patients receiving interferon-\u03b2/glatiramer acetate, no significant change was measured in lesional white matter for any metabolite, while whole-brain normalized lesion volumes increased. CONCLUSIONS: Patients treated with natalizumab showed an increase in total N-acetylaspartate, creatine and phosphocreatine, and glutamate in lesional white matter. These increasing metabolite concentrations might be a sign of enhanced axonal metabolism.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Axons", "Brain", "Early Medical Intervention", "Energy Metabolism", "Female", "Glatiramer Acetate", "Humans", "Image Enhancement", "Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted", "Interferon-beta", "Longitudinal Studies", "Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Multiple Sclerosis, Relapsing-Remitting", "Natalizumab"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84930988940", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"54794673700": {"Name": "Wiebenga O.", "AuthorID": "54794673700", "AffiliationID": "60008734", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anatomy and Neurosciences, Neuroscience Campus Amsterdam, VU University"}, "55991919500": {"Name": "Nagtegaal G.", "AuthorID": "55991919500", "AffiliationID": "60008734", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anatomy and Neurosciences, Neuroscience Campus Amsterdam, VU University"}, "55653016200": {"Name": "Steenwijk M.", "AuthorID": "55653016200", "AffiliationID": "60008734", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology and Nuclear Medicine, Neuroscience Campus Amsterdam, VU University"}, "7102989379": {"Name": "Barkhof F.", "AuthorID": "7102989379", "AffiliationID": "60008734", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology and Nuclear Medicine, Neuroscience Campus Amsterdam, VU University"}, "35264309600": {"Name": "Klauser A.", "AuthorID": "35264309600", "AffiliationID": "60008734", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anatomy and Neurosciences, Neuroscience Campus Amsterdam, VU University"}, "26643174700": {"Name": "Geurts J.", "AuthorID": "26643174700", "AffiliationID": "60008734", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anatomy and Neurosciences, Neuroscience Campus Amsterdam, VU University"}, "25958454400": {"Name": "Schoonheim M.", "AuthorID": "25958454400", "AffiliationID": "60008734", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Neuroscience Campus Amsterdam, VU University"}, "55971984000": {"Name": "Van Rossum J.", "AuthorID": "55971984000", "AffiliationID": "60008734", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Neuroscience Campus Amsterdam, VU University"}, "35360606800": {"Name": "Polman C.", "AuthorID": "35360606800", "AffiliationID": "60008734", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Neuroscience Campus Amsterdam, VU University"}, "7005232562": {"Name": "Pouwels P.", "AuthorID": "7005232562", "AffiliationID": "60008734", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Medical Technology, Neuroscience Campus Amsterdam, VU University"}}}
