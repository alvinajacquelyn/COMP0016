We examined the cross-sectional association between physical activity and successful ageing using data on 3,749 participants (age range = 60-83years) of the Whitehall II study. The participants underwent a clinical assessment, completed a 20-item physical activity questionnaire, and wore a wrist-mounted accelerometer for 9 days. Successful ageing was defined as good cognitive, motor, and respiratory functioning, along with absence of disability, mental health problems, and major chronic diseases. Time spent in moderate-To-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) episodes assessed by accelerometer was classified as \"short\" (1-9.59 minutes) and \"long\" (\u226510 minutes) bouts. Linear multivariate regression showed that successful agers (N = 789) reported 3.79 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.39-6.19) minutes more daily MVPA than other participants. Accelerometer data showed this difference to be 3.40 (95% CI:2.44-4.35) minutes for MVPA undertaken in short bouts, 4.16 (95% CI:3.11-5.20) minutes for long bouts, and 7.55 (95% CI:5.86-9.24) minutes for all MVPA bouts lasting 1 minute or more. Multivariate logistic regressions showed that participants undertaking \u2265150 minutes of MVPA per week were more likely to be successful agers with both self-reported (Odd Ratio (OR) = 1.29,95% (CI):1.09-1.53) and accelerometer data (length bout \u22651 minute:OR = 1.92, 95%CI:1.60-2.30). Successful agers practice more MVPA, having both more short and long bouts, than non-successful agers.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Accelerometry", "Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Aging", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Exercise", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Motor Activity", "Self Report", "Surveys and Questionnaires"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85016745132", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"55425766700": {"Name": "Menai M.", "AuthorID": "55425766700", "AffiliationID": "60106085, 60106017", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Research in Epidemiology and Population Health, Univ.
