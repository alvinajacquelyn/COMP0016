The experiments were performed using a Perspex bed (50mm i.d.) of poppy seeds: air at 298K was admitted to the base of the bed through a single, central orifice, 2mm in diameter. Poppy seeds (Geldart Group B, measured minimum fluidisation velocity with air at 298K and 1atm of 0.13m/s and particle density ~1060kg/m3) were used because of their high content of oil, which contains mobile protons and hence is suitable for MRI examination. The lengths of jet measured using the three techniques were in agreement between 50m/s<Uo<100m/s, where Uo is the superficial velocity through the orifice. Below Uo=50m/s, X-ray measurements of jet lengths were shorter than those measured using MRI. This was attributed to the minimum diameter of void, found to be 5mm, detectable in a 50mm bed using ultra-fast X-ray measurements. PEPT is most commonly used to calculate particle velocities, whilst jet lengths are usually calculated from determinations of voidage. However, the particle locations determined in this work by PEPT were used to calculate a fractional occupancy count, from which a jet length could be inferred.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Fluidization", "Imaging", "Magnetic resonance", "Particles", "PEPT", "X-ray"], "IndexKeywords": ["Minimum diameters", "Particle densities", "Particle locations", "Particle velocities", "PEPT", "Positron emission particle tracking", "Superficial velocity", "X ray measurements"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84908046964", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"], ["Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering", "ENGI", "2209"]], "AuthorData": {"11939498400": {"Name": "Pore M.", "AuthorID": "11939498400", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering and Biotechnology, University of Cambridge"}, "56386899500": {"Name": "Ong G.", "AuthorID": "56386899500", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering and Biotechnology, University of Cambridge"}, "55904949100": {"Name": "Boyce C.", "AuthorID": "55904949100", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering and Biotechnology, University of Cambridge"}, "6701843023": {"Name": "Sederman A.", "AuthorID": "6701843023", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering and Biotechnology, University of Cambridge"}, "55521052700": {"Name": "Dennis J.", "AuthorID": "55521052700", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering and Biotechnology, University of Cambridge"}, "7202290158": {"Name": "Holland D.", "AuthorID": "7202290158", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering and Biotechnology, University of Cambridge"}, "55623473200": {"Name": "Materazzi M.", "AuthorID": "55623473200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "35572355100": {"Name": "Lettieri P.", "AuthorID": "35572355100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "36697835400": {"Name": "Gargiuli J.", "AuthorID": "36697835400", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "School of Physics and Astronomy, University of Birmingham"}, "24776157500": {"Name": "Leadbeater T.", "AuthorID": "24776157500", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "School of Physics and Astronomy, University of Birmingham"}, "57199462330": {"Name": "Parker D.", "AuthorID": "57199462330", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "School of Physics and Astronomy, University of Birmingham"}, "8846190200": {"Name": "Ingram A.", "AuthorID": "8846190200", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemical Engineering, University of Birmingham"}}}
