This paper argues that the current narrowing of early years assessment, along with increased inspection and surveillance, operates as a policy technology leading to an intensification of \u2018school readiness\u2019 pressures upon the earliest stage of education. The paper suggests that this governance has encouraged a functional \u2018datafication\u2019 of early years pedagogy so that early years teacher\u2019s work is increasingly constrained by performativity demands to produce \u2018appropriate\u2019 data. The article argues that early years high-stakes national assessments act as a \u2018meta-policy\u2019, \u2018steering\u2019 early years pedagogy \u2018from a distance\u2019 and have the power to challenge, disrupt and constrain early years teacher\u2019s deeply held child-centred pedagogical values.", "AuthorKeywords": ["assessment", "datafication", "early years teachers", "neo-liberal", "pedagogy"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84926261267", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"]], "AuthorData": {"37069905200": {"Name": "Roberts-Holmes G.", "AuthorID": "37069905200", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Education, Primary Education and Early Childhood, University of London"}}}
