The fibrillation of human amylin (also known as islet amyloid polypeptide, hIAPP) and the amyloid-beta peptide (A\u03b2-40) are thought to be pathogenic factors in Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and Alzheimer's disease (AD), respectively. Amyloid diseases may involve co-aggregation of different protein species, in addition to the self-assembly of single precursor sequences. Here we investigate the formation of heterogeneous pre-fibrillar, oligomeric species produced by the co-incubation of hIAPP and A\u03b2-40 using electrospray ionisation-ion mobility spectrometry-mass spectrometry (ESI-IMS-MS)-based methods. Conformational properties and gas-phase stabilities of amyloid oligomers formed from hIAPP or A\u03b240 alone, and from a 1:1 mixture of hIAPP and A\u03b240 monomers, were determined and compared. We show that co-assembly of the two sequences results in hetero-oligomers with distinct properties and aggregation kinetics properties compared with the homo-oligomers present in solution. The observations may be of key significance to unravelling the mechanisms of amyloid formation in vivo and elucidating how different sequences and/or assembly conditions can result in different fibril structures and/or pathogenic outcomes.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Amino Acid Sequence", "Amyloid beta-Peptides", "Humans", "Islet Amyloid Polypeptide", "Molecular Sequence Data", "Peptide Fragments", "Protein Multimerization", "Protein Stability", "Protein Structure, Secondary", "Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84942683971", "SubjectAreas": [["Analytical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1602"], ["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Environmental Chemistry", "ENVI", "2304"], ["Spectroscopy", "CHEM", "1607"], ["Electrochemistry", "CHEM", "1603"]], "AuthorData": {"56496112600": {"Name": "Young L.M.", "AuthorID": "56496112600", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "Astbury Centre for Structural Molecular Biology, School of Molecular and Cellular Biology, University of Leeds"}, "56578406000": {"Name": "Mahood R.A.", "AuthorID": "56578406000", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "Astbury Centre for Structural Molecular Biology, School of Molecular and Cellular Biology, University of Leeds"}, "56577251700": {"Name": "Saunders J.C.", "AuthorID": "56577251700", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "Astbury Centre for Structural Molecular Biology, School of Molecular and Cellular Biology, University of Leeds"}, "7005041518": {"Name": "Radford S.E.", "AuthorID": "7005041518", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "Astbury Centre for Structural Molecular Biology, School of Molecular and Cellular Biology, University of Leeds"}, "7003435130": {"Name": "Ashcroft A.E.", "AuthorID": "7003435130", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "Astbury Centre for Structural Molecular Biology, School of Molecular and Cellular Biology, University of Leeds"}, "54904840000": {"Name": "Tu L.H.", "AuthorID": "54904840000", "AffiliationID": "60026415", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Stony Brook University"}, "7006500064": {"Name": "Raleigh D.P.", "AuthorID": "7006500064", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Structural and Molecule Biology, University College London"}}}
