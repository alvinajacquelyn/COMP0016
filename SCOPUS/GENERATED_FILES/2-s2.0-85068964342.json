All rights reserved.Objective: In 2010, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in the UK published Clinical Guideline 95 (CG95) advocating risk stratification of patients using 'CADScore' to guide appropriate cardiac investigations for chest pain of recent onset. Implementation of the guideline in the University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust was evaluated to see if it led to a reduction in the average cost of the diagnostic journey per patient and fewer investigations per patient in order to confirm a diagnosis. Methods: This was a single centre study at a Tertiary Centre in Central London. The investigative journey for each patient presenting to the Rapid Access Chest Pain Clinic (RACPC) at University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust was recorded. Retrospective analysis on this data was performed. Results: Data for 4968 patients presenting to the RACPC from 2004 to 2012 was analysed and a sizematched cohort of 1503 patients preimplementation and postimplementation of the guidelines was compared. The mean cost of investigations postimplementation was \u00a3291.83 as compared to \u00a3319.54 preimplementation of the guidelines despite higher costs associated with some of the recommended initial investigations. The mean number of tests per patient postguidelines was 0.78 compared to 0.97 for preguidelines. An approximate twofold increase in patients not requiring tests was seen post-CG95 implementation (245 pre-CG95 vs 476 post-CG95). Conclusions: The implementation of the NICE guidelines in our trust has reduced the average cost of the investigative journey and the number of investigations required per patient.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85068964342", "SubjectAreas": [["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"25929947500": {"Name": "Lee A.J.X.", "AuthorID": "25929947500", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Medical Sciences Division, Academic Foundation Programme, University of Oxford"}, "56378442500": {"Name": "Michail M.", "AuthorID": "56378442500", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Heart Hospital, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "56113018900": {"Name": "Quaderi S.A.", "AuthorID": "56113018900", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Heart Hospital, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57217294617": {"Name": "Richardson J.A.", "AuthorID": "57217294617", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Heart Hospital, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "16318880800": {"Name": "Aggarwal S.K.", "AuthorID": "16318880800", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Heart Hospital, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57210807494": {"Name": "Speechly-Dick M.E.", "AuthorID": "57210807494", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Heart Hospital, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
