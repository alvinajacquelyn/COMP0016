Here, we suggest a unified approach to investigate segregation and its effects on the mechanical properties of polycrystalline alloys using the example of 3sp impurities (Mg, Al, Si, P, or S) at a special type \u03a35(310)[001] tilt grain boundary in Cu. We show that for these impurities segregating to the grain boundary, the strain contribution to the work of grain boundary decohesion is small and that the chemical contribution correlates with the electronegativity difference between Cu and the impurity. The strain contribution to the work of dislocation emission is calculated to be negative, while the chemical contribution is calculated to be always positive. Both the strain and chemical contributions to the work of dislocation emission generally become weaker with the increasing electronegativity from Mg to S. By combining these contributions together, we find, in agreement with experimental observations, that a strong segregation of S can reduce the work of grain boundary separation below the work of dislocation emission, thus embrittling Cu, while such an embrittlement cannot be produced by a P segregation because it lowers the energy barrier for dislocation emission relatively more than for work separation.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Dislocation emissions", "Electronegativity difference", "Grain boundary cohesion", "Grain boundary decohesion", "Grain boundary separation", "Mechanical behavior", "Polycrystalline alloys", "Tilt grain boundary"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85049393345", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Physics and Astronomy (miscellaneous)", "PHYS", "3101"]], "AuthorData": {"57205356000": {"Name": "Li Y.", "AuthorID": "57205356000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Mathematical and Physical Sciences, University College London"}, "7003798130": {"Name": "Korzhavyi P.", "AuthorID": "7003798130", "AffiliationID": "60068681", "AffiliationName": "Materials Modeling and Development Laboratory, NUST MISIS"}, "7102611818": {"Name": "Sandstr\u00f6m R.", "AuthorID": "7102611818", "AffiliationID": "60002014", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Royal Institute of Technology (KTH)"}, "23067604800": {"Name": "Lilja C.", "AuthorID": "23067604800", "AffiliationID": "60119209", "AffiliationName": "Swedish Nuclear Fuel and Waste Management Company"}}}
