The data shows the use of already-known Roman glass groups during the first half of the time frame, for imported vessels as well as locally worked glass. No compositional change is seen related to the introduction of glass blowing for either of the glass groups in use during this time. During the first half of the 1st millennium AD, two previously little-known boron- and alumina-rich compositional groups emerge. These glass groups, thought to be regionally produced, dominate glass compositions in Pergamon during the mid-to late Byzantine and Islamic periods, indicating a major shift in glass supply and a fragmentation of the economy into more regional units. Plant-ash glass, from the 9th century AD replacing mineral natron glass in the Levant, plays only a minor role in Byzantine and Islamic Pergamon.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Glass working", "High-boron glass", "Mineral natron glass", "Pergamon"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84922775781", "SubjectAreas": [["Archeology (arts and humanities)", "ARTS", "1204"], ["Archeology", "SOCI", "3302"]], "AuthorData": {"57202699283": {"Name": "Rehren T.", "AuthorID": "57202699283", "AffiliationID": "60107608", "AffiliationName": "UCL Qatar, Georgetown Building"}, "56516294000": {"Name": "Connolly P.", "AuthorID": "56516294000", "AffiliationID": "60107608", "AffiliationName": "UCL Qatar, Georgetown Building"}, "30567735100": {"Name": "Schibille N.", "AuthorID": "30567735100", "AffiliationID": "60017317", "AffiliationName": "Art History, University of Sussex"}, "56516557100": {"Name": "Schwarzer H.", "AuthorID": "56516557100", "AffiliationID": "60000401", "AffiliationName": "Institut f\u00fcr Klassische Arch\u00e4ologie und Christliche Arch\u00e4ologie, Arch\u00e4ologisches Museum Westf\u00e4lische Wilhelms-Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnster"}}}
