The relatively small (~60%) volumetric expansion of NiCo2S4 nanosheets during the lithiation process was confirmed by in situ transmission electron microscopy and is attributed to their mesoporous nature. The 3D network structure of NiCo2S4 nanosheets offers the additional advantages of large surface area, efficient electron and ion transport capability, easy access of electrolyte to the electrode surface, sufficient void space and mechanical robustness. The fabricated electrodes exhibited outstanding lithium-storage performance including high specific capacity, excellent cycling stability and high rate of performance. A reversible capacity of ~ 1275 mAh g- 1 was obtained at a current density of 1000 mA g - 1, and the devices retained ~ 1137 mAh g - 1 after 100 cycles, which is the highest value reported to date for electrodes made of metal sulfide nanostructures or their composites. Our results suggest that 3D-networked NiCo2S4 NSA/carbon cloth composites are a promising material for electrodes in high-performance lithium-ion batteries.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["3D-network structures", "High specific capacity", "High-performance lithium-ion batteries", "In-situ transmission electron microscopies", "Mechanical robustness", "Reversible capacity", "Threedimensional (3-d)", "Volumetric expansion"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84990886691", "SubjectAreas": [["Modeling and Simulation", "MATH", "2611"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"]], "AuthorData": {"24475575100": {"Name": "Zou R.", "AuthorID": "24475575100", "AffiliationID": "60010953", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory for Modification of Chemical Fibers and Polymer Materials, College of Materials Science and Engineering, Donghua University"}, "56150320000": {"Name": "Zhang Z.", "AuthorID": "56150320000", "AffiliationID": "60013983", "AffiliationName": "Center of Super-Diamond and Advanced Films (COSDAF), Department of Physics and Materials Science, City University of Hong Kong"}, "54882046300": {"Name": "Yuen M.", "AuthorID": "54882046300", "AffiliationID": "60013983", "AffiliationName": "Center of Super-Diamond and Advanced Films (COSDAF), Department of Physics and Materials Science, City University of Hong Kong"}, "35772710100": {"Name": "Sun M.", "AuthorID": "35772710100", "AffiliationID": "60013983", "AffiliationName": "Center of Super-Diamond and Advanced Films (COSDAF), Department of Physics and Materials Science, City University of Hong Kong"}, "16464316100": {"Name": "Lee C.", "AuthorID": "16464316100", "AffiliationID": "60013983", "AffiliationName": "Center of Super-Diamond and Advanced Films (COSDAF), Department of Physics and Materials Science, City University of Hong Kong"}, "37070726100": {"Name": "Zhang W.", "AuthorID": "37070726100", "AffiliationID": "60013983", "AffiliationName": "Center of Super-Diamond and Advanced Films (COSDAF), Department of Physics and Materials Science, City University of Hong Kong"}, "8242699400": {"Name": "Hu J.", "AuthorID": "8242699400", "AffiliationID": "60010953", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory for Modification of Chemical Fibers and Polymer Materials, College of Materials Science and Engineering, Donghua University"}}}
