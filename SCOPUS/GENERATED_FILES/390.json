We examine the geometric content of such an operator and show that it implicitly contains a Lorentzian metric, Pauli matrices, connection coefficients for spinor fields and an electromagnetic covector potential. This observation allows us to give a simple representation of the massive Dirac equation as a system of four scalar equations involving an arbitrary two-by-two matrix operator as above and its adjugate. The point of the paper is that in order to write down the Dirac equation in the physically meaningful four-dimensional hyperbolic setting one does not need any geometric constructs. All the geometry required is contained in a single analytic object - an abstract formally self-adjoint first order linear differential operator acting on pairs of complex-valued scalar fields.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Analysis of partial differential equations", "Dirac equation", "gauge theory"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84926649920", "SubjectAreas": [["Statistical and Nonlinear Physics", "PHYS", "3109"], ["Statistics and Probability", "MATH", "2613"], ["Modeling and Simulation", "MATH", "2611"], ["Mathematical Physics", "MATH", "2610"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"56585111900": {"Name": "Fang Y.", "AuthorID": "56585111900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University College London"}, "6603201024": {"Name": "Vassiliev D.", "AuthorID": "6603201024", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University College London"}}}
