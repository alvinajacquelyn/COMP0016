In this study, we estimated production-based CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion and industrial processes in eleven cities in Hebei Province of China in 2012 and used input-output theory to measure their consumption-based CO2 emissions. By comprehensively comparing production- and consumption-based emissions, we found that six developed cities were consumers with import-depended trade patterns, while the five other cities were producers, mostly medium in size, with the potential to transform into consumer cities with socioeconomic development. Emissions embodied in imports accounted for more than half of the consumption-based emissions in most cities, which shows the significance of interregional cooperation in tackling climate change. International cooperation is also important at the city level, as international imports also impact consumption-based emissions. From the perspective of final use, emissions caused by fixed capital formation predominated in most cities and were determined by their economic development models.", "AuthorKeywords": ["City", "Consumption-based accounting", "Embodied CO2 emissions", "Input-output model", "Production-based accounting"], "IndexKeywords": ["City", "Climate change mitigation", "CO2 emissions", "Fossil fuel combustion", "Input output model", "Interregional cooperation", "Production and consumption", "Socio-economic development"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85056234857", "SubjectAreas": [["Building and Construction", "ENGI", "2215"], ["Energy (all)", "ENER", "2100"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"], ["Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law", "ENVI", "2308"]], "AuthorData": {"55272317400": {"Name": "Mi Z.", "AuthorID": "55272317400", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "The Bartlett School of Construction and Project Management, University College London"}, "57200973818": {"Name": "Zheng J.", "AuthorID": "57200973818", "AffiliationID": "60027363", "AffiliationName": "School of Economics and Management, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "56603101200": {"Name": "Coffman D.M.", "AuthorID": "56603101200", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "The Bartlett School of Construction and Project Management, University College London"}, "35195168500": {"Name": "Wang S.", "AuthorID": "35195168500", "AffiliationID": "60027363", "AffiliationName": "School of Economics and Management, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "55975044300": {"Name": "Meng J.", "AuthorID": "55975044300", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Politics and International Studies, University of Cambridge"}, "54411744100": {"Name": "Zheng H.", "AuthorID": "54411744100", "AffiliationID": "60000112", "AffiliationName": "Water Security Research Center, School of International Development, University of East Anglia"}, "57204575391": {"Name": "Li X.", "AuthorID": "57204575391", "AffiliationID": "60000112", "AffiliationName": "Water Security Research Center, School of International Development, University of East Anglia"}, "15839411900": {"Name": "Guan D.", "AuthorID": "15839411900", "AffiliationID": "60000112", "AffiliationName": "Water Security Research Center, School of International Development, University of East Anglia"}, "22952374500": {"Name": "Woltjer J.", "AuthorID": "22952374500", "AffiliationID": "60000508", "AffiliationName": "Department of Planning and Transport, Faculty of Architecture and the Built Environment, University of Westminster"}}}
