Published by Elsevier Ltd.This paper aims to assess the potential of high renewable energy (wind and solar) integration in the Greek island of Syros, following the scheduled interconnection with the national grid system. Currently, Syros operates an oil fired autonomous power system (APS), emitting large amounts of carbon emissions. Interconnection among a number of islands in the Cyclades and the mainland will eliminate the use of APS, will reinforce islands' power network and will allow exploitation of high wind and solar potential. It has been concluded that following the interconnection, the installation of 33.5 MW of wind and solar energy is feasible. The assumed capacity will cover the total energy demand by 2030 allowing also electricity exports to the Greek mainland. Transforming Syros into a regional renewable energy hub will contribute to the energy security, providing access to its own energy resources.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Interconnection", "Island", "Renewable energy", "Solar", "Wind"], "IndexKeywords": ["Autonomous power system", "Electricity export", "Interconnection", "Island", "National grid systems", "Renewable energies", "Renewable energy penetrations", "Solar"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84958179717", "SubjectAreas": [["Energy (all)", "ENER", "2100"]], "AuthorData": {"56528434800": {"Name": "Zafeiratou E.", "AuthorID": "56528434800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Energy Institute, UCL, Central House"}, "26039534700": {"Name": "Spataru C.", "AuthorID": "26039534700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Energy Institute, UCL, Central House"}}}
