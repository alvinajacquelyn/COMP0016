There are concerns that patients are not all interpreting the questionnaire items in the same way. Cognitive interviewing is a research technique that identifies 'interpretative measurement error' (IME). IME is distinct from traditional components of measurement error, such as not reading the question as worded, or recording answers inaccurately. Aim To use cognitive interviewing techniques to explore patterns in answer mapping and comprehension of the PHQ-9 questionnaire to ascertain whether the measure captures meaningful symptoms of low mood. Design and setting Qualitative study using cognitive interviewing techniques and card sorting in six GP practices in Bristol. Method The study recruited 18 participants at the point of entry to a longitudinal primary care depression cohort study, PANDA (the indications for Prescribing ANtiDepressants that will leAd to a clinical benefit). Participants were interviewed 2, 4, and 6 weeks after their baseline visit. Cognitive interviews were digitally recorded. Analysis used the digital audio file, rather than verbatim transcripts, as it retained important features needed for analyses. Results Cognitive interviewing revealed that items on the PHQ-9 are interpreted in a range of ways, that patients often cannot 'fit' their experience into the response options, and therefore often feel the questionnaire is misrepresenting their experience of meaningful symptoms of low mood. Conclusion The PHQ-9 may be missing the presence and/or intensity of certain symptoms that are meaningful to patients. Clinicians should adopt caution when using it.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cognitive interviewing", "Depression", "Mood questionnaire", "PHQ-9", "Prescribing in primary care", "Safety culture"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Cognition", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Humans", "Incidence", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Mood Disorders", "Primary Health Care", "Psychometrics", "Qualitative Research", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84957989599", "SubjectAreas": [["Family Practice", "MEDI", "2714"]], "AuthorData": {"9248649100": {"Name": "Malpass A.", "AuthorID": "9248649100", "AffiliationID": "60171764", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Academic Primary Care, School of Social and Community Medicine, University of Bristol"}, "6602536089": {"Name": "Wiles N.", "AuthorID": "6602536089", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "Academic Unit of Psychiatry, Department of Community Based Medicine, University of Bristol"}, "56360697900": {"Name": "Dowrick C.", "AuthorID": "56360697900", "AffiliationID": "116345464", "AffiliationName": "Department of Primary Medical Care, Psychological Sciences, Institute of Psychology Health and Society"}, "55480355000": {"Name": "Robinson J.", "AuthorID": "55480355000", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Department of the Anthropology of Health and Illness, Department of Sociology, Social Policy and Criminology, School of Law and Social Justice, University of Liverpool"}, "7003612713": {"Name": "Gilbody S.", "AuthorID": "7003612713", "AffiliationID": "60016418", "AffiliationName": "Department of Primary Care Mental Health, Health Sciences, University of York"}, "7402636617": {"Name": "Lewis G.", "AuthorID": "7402636617", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatric Epidemiology, Division of Psychiatry, UCL"}, "24778271400": {"Name": "Duffy L.", "AuthorID": "24778271400", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
