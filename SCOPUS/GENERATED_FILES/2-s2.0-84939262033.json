Consequentially, reuse, reanalysis, replication, and aggregation of data are limited and the potential impact of individual studies is severely constrained. This paper begins to address this issue by introducing and developing a foundational method for observational design research to improve replicability, reuse, and overall comparability of empirical studies. A three-step foundational method is proposed that covers capture, coding, and analysis. The capture step defines overall and situational context as well as multiple capture streams, generating a broad data-set that can be examined from multiple perspectives. The coding step employs a multi-level approach that seeks to minimise workload while describing both detailed and high-level information. The analysis step builds on the multi-level approach to provide for a flexible yet standardised examination of the data-set. The overall approach is introduced theoretically and illustrated using a comparison of an industrial study and an experimental study. Finally, it is argued that the proposed method promotes rigour, reliability, and standardisation; and could provide one means for improving comparison and aggregation, ultimately increasing impact in academia and practice.", "AuthorKeywords": ["descriptive models of the design process", "empirical study", "ethnography"], "IndexKeywords": ["Design process", "Empirical studies", "Engineering design researches", "ethnography", "High-level information", "Observation method", "Observational study", "Situational context"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84939262033", "SubjectAreas": [["Engineering (all)", "ENGI", "2200"]], "AuthorData": {"47661004600": {"Name": "Cash P.", "AuthorID": "47661004600", "AffiliationID": "60011373", "AffiliationName": "Department of Management Engineering, DTU, Technology Innovation Management"}, "7103008964": {"Name": "Hicks B.", "AuthorID": "7103008964", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Bristol"}, "35587180500": {"Name": "Culley S.", "AuthorID": "35587180500", "AffiliationID": "60030480", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Bath"}, "16400826100": {"Name": "Adlam T.", "AuthorID": "16400826100", "AffiliationID": "60030480", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Bath"}}}
