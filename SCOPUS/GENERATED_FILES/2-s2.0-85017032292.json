When used to impute missing values in covariates of regression models, imputation models may be misspecified if they are not compatible with the substantive model of interest for the outcome. In this article, we introduce the smcfcs command, which imputes covariates by substantive-model compatible fully conditional specification. This modifies the popular fully conditional specification or chained-equations approach to multiple imputation by imputing each covariate compatibly with a user-specified substantive model. We compare the smcfcs command with standard fully conditional specification imputation using mi impute chained in a simulation study and illustrative analysis of data from a study investigating time to tumor recurrence in breast cancer.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Congenial", "Interactions", "Multiple imputation", "Nonlinearities", "smcfcs", "st0387", "Substantive model compatible"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85017032292", "SubjectAreas": [["Mathematics (miscellaneous)", "MATH", "2601"]], "AuthorData": {"15051425400": {"Name": "Bartlett J.W.", "AuthorID": "15051425400", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Statistics, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "37066305600": {"Name": "Morris T.P.", "AuthorID": "37066305600", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}}}
