The lipid phase comprised soy phosphatidylcholine (SPC) and cholesterol (1:1), and the ratios of lipid to carrier were 1:2, 1:4, 1:6, 1:8 or 1:10 w/w. X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) revealed an interaction between the components of the proliposome particles, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed that mannitol-based proliposomes were uniformly sized and spherical, whilst LMH-based proliposomes were irregular and relatively large. Using a two-stage impinger (TSI), fine particle fraction (FPF) values of the proliposomes were higher for mannitol-based formulations, reaching 52.6%, which was attributed to the better flow properties when mannitol was used as carrier. Following hydration of proliposomes, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) demonstrated that vesicles generated from mannitol-based formulations were oligolamellar, whilst LMH-based proliposomes generated \u2018worm-like\u2019 structures and vesicle clusters. Vesicle size decreased upon increasing carrier to lipid ratio, and the zeta potential values were negative. Drug entrapment efficiency (EE) was higher for liposomes generated from LMH-based proliposomes, reaching 37.76% when 1:2 lipid to carrier ratio was used. The in vitro drug release profile was similar for both carriers when 1:6 lipid to carrier ratio was used. This study showed that spray drying can produce inhalable proliposome microparticles that can generate liposomes upon contact with an aqueous phase, and the FPF of proliposomes and the EE offered by liposomes were formulation-dependent.", "AuthorKeywords": ["aerosol", "morphology", "particle size", "powder", "pulmonary"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aerosols", "Lactose", "Liposomes", "Mannitol", "Nebulizers and Vaporizers", "Particle Size"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85048038281", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmaceutical Science", "PHAR", "3003"]], "AuthorData": {"57188924759": {"Name": "Omer H.K.", "AuthorID": "57188924759", "AffiliationID": "60109544", "AffiliationName": "College of Pharmacy, Hawler Medical University"}, "57202360457": {"Name": "Hussein N.R.", "AuthorID": "57202360457", "AffiliationID": "60109544", "AffiliationName": "College of Pharmacy, Hawler Medical University"}, "57202367500": {"Name": "Ferraz A.", "AuthorID": "57202367500", "AffiliationID": "60031259", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Nanotechnology and Bioengineering, School of Pharmacy and Biomedical Sciences, University of Central Lancashire"}, "11439157000": {"Name": "Najlah M.", "AuthorID": "11439157000", "AffiliationID": "60000913", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Medical Science, Anglia Ruskin University"}, "7103287195": {"Name": "Ahmed W.", "AuthorID": "7103287195", "AffiliationID": "60026830", "AffiliationName": "Nanoscience Research Group, School of Mathematics and Physics, College of Science, University of Lincoln"}, "57212938394": {"Name": "Taylor K.M.G.", "AuthorID": "57212938394", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "School of Pharmacy, UCL"}, "8691124200": {"Name": "Elhissi A.M.A.", "AuthorID": "8691124200", "AffiliationID": "60072749", "AffiliationName": "College of Pharmacy, Qatar University"}}}
