Detailed data in situ about the bubble populations are required to understand these processes. However, these data are difficult to acquire because bubble populations are complex, spatially inhomogeneous, and short lived. This paper describes the design and development of a novel high-resolution underwater optical instrument for imaging oceanic bubbles at the sea. The instrument was successfully deployed in 2013 as part of the HiWINGS campaign in the North Atlantic Ocean. It contains a high-resolution machine vision camera, strobe flash unit to create a light sheet, and single board computer to control system operation. The instrument is shown to successfully detect bubbles of radii in the range 20-10 000 \u03bcm.", "AuthorKeywords": ["High-resolution oceanic bubble image", "imaging oceanic bubbles", "oceanic bubble optical instrument", "oceanic bubble size distribution"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aerosol production", "Design and Development", "High resolution", "Machine vision cameras", "North Atlantic Ocean", "Single board computers", "Spatially inhomogeneous", "System operation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84982759983", "SubjectAreas": [["Ocean Engineering", "ENGI", "2212"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"57201044981": {"Name": "Al-Lashi R.", "AuthorID": "57201044981", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "School of Food Science and Nutrition, Faculty of Mathematics and Physical Sciences, University of Leeds"}, "7005911660": {"Name": "Gunn S.", "AuthorID": "7005911660", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronics and Computer Science, Faculty of Physical Sciences and Engineering, University of Southampton"}, "57193411642": {"Name": "Webb E.", "AuthorID": "57193411642", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronics and Computer Science, Faculty of Physical Sciences and Engineering, University of Southampton"}, "13614216200": {"Name": "Czerski H.", "AuthorID": "13614216200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}}}
