The arrangement of ground with respect to peak-to-peak voltage (V<inf>pp</inf>) plays a crucial role in manipulating the GO nanostructures. Grounds on both sides of the V<inf>pp</inf> electrode give an excellent linking of GO nanostructures which is explained by scanning electron microscopy and current-voltage characteristics. A finite element method simulation explains the electric field and voltage variation profile during DEP process. The optimized aligned GO nanostructures are used as hydrogen gas sensor with a sensitivity of 6.0% for 800 ppm hydrogen gas.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Conducting electrodes", "Electrical configurations", "Finite element method simulation", "Hydrogen gas sensing", "Hydrogen gas sensors", "Micro-gap electrodes", "Peak-to-peak voltages", "Voltage variation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84929991911", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (miscellaneous)", "PHYS", "3101"]], "AuthorData": {"55227021800": {"Name": "Singh B.", "AuthorID": "55227021800", "AffiliationID": "60007511", "AffiliationName": "School of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, Sungkyunkwan Advanced Institute of Nanotechnology (SAINT), Sungkyunkwan University"}, "54386255900": {"Name": "Wang J.", "AuthorID": "54386255900", "AffiliationID": "60007511", "AffiliationName": "School of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, Sungkyunkwan Advanced Institute of Nanotechnology (SAINT), Sungkyunkwan University"}, "36838604200": {"Name": "Rathi S.", "AuthorID": "36838604200", "AffiliationID": "60007511", "AffiliationName": "School of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, Sungkyunkwan Advanced Institute of Nanotechnology (SAINT), Sungkyunkwan University"}, "57210288630": {"Name": "Kim G.H.", "AuthorID": "57210288630", "AffiliationID": "60007511", "AffiliationName": "School of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, Sungkyunkwan Advanced Institute of Nanotechnology (SAINT), Sungkyunkwan University"}}}
