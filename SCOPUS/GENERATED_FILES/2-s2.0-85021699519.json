The definition of the training set needs to be considered in detail when ML techniques are used in HCI. Interactive systems are usually evaluated with a training set obtained from a certain population of users. When evaluating the system, authors should report both: results using training data only from the same individual (personalized model) and results using data from the entire population (generic model). This is necessary for systems where no data exists for first-time users and, therefore, classifiers have to be bootstrapped with data from other users. Researchers have to be very careful in interpreting how the behavioral characteristics are linked to the actual emotional states of users. Another important aspect to consider is the problem of correlation versus causation. Most of the results of ML algorithms provide insights into association relationships and not causality relationships. Consequently, researchers should be extremely careful in extrapolating conclusions from results that might be the effect of correlation and not causation.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Behavioral characteristics", "Emotional state", "First-time user", "Generic modeling", "Interactive system", "Ml algorithms", "Personalized model", "Training data"], "DocumentType": "Trade Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85021699519", "SubjectAreas": [["Human-Computer Interaction", "COMP", "1709"]], "AuthorData": {"6508135447": {"Name": "Kostakos V.", "AuthorID": "6508135447", "AffiliationID": "60026553", "AffiliationName": "University of Melbourne"}, "9743656700": {"Name": "Musolesi M.", "AuthorID": "9743656700", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60111768", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Alan Turing Institute"}}}
