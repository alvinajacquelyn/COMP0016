All rights reserved.This paper provides a knowledge representation process for authoring of learning experiences that capture feedback designed in the context of learning environments. The paper reports on a year long study with designers who are creating mathematical teaching and learning resources as part of an EU project (M C Squared). In this paper we examine the knowledge representation process we used in design and creation of a mediation vocabulary. The model to be designed has to provide different layers of 'knowledge integration' and thus offers insights into the importance of knowledge mediation in the emergence of new learning environments and experiences. Hence, authoring of designs and feedback through use of ontologies to form part of the annotating of the learning activities. The annotations form part of the context to be used as part of the learning analytics.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Designing a Mediation Vocabulary", "Education", "Feedback", "Knowledge Integration", "Knowledge Representation", "Learning Analytics"], "IndexKeywords": ["Designing a Mediation Vocabulary", "Different layers", "Knowledge integration", "Learning Activity", "Learning Analytics", "Learning environments", "Learning experiences", "Teaching and learning"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84961178046", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"]], "AuthorData": {"56903884400": {"Name": "Charlton P.", "AuthorID": "56903884400", "AffiliationID": "60117699, 60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "London Knowledge Lab, Institute of Education, University College London"}, "56333544000": {"Name": "Karkalas S.", "AuthorID": "56333544000", "AffiliationID": "60117699, 60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "London Knowledge Lab, Institute of Education, University College London"}, "25651815200": {"Name": "Mavrikis M.", "AuthorID": "25651815200", "AffiliationID": "60117699, 60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "London Knowledge Lab, Institute of Education, University College London"}}}
