All rights reserved.Oral squamous papilloma (OSP) is a benign epithelial neoplasia associated with the proliferation of oral epithelium, which promotes a papillary or verrucous surface associated with infection. Fibroma or fibrous hyperplasia (FH) is a reactive lesion that originates from the connective tissue and represents a very common lesion of the oral cavity. Biosafety protocols were rigorously followed, with consideration given to the risk of smoke contamination and dental team and patient contamination when removing the oral papilloma. CO2 laser, high power diode laser, and Nd:YAG laser surgery should be performed under local anesthesia, and similar postoperative results can be obtained. In summary, the Nd:YAG laser was effective for the surgical treatment of OSP and FH. HPV DNA has been identified in the plume generated during CO2 laser treatment of respiratory tract papillomas and plantar warts, but whether or not these dispersed viral particles are infectious remains elusive.", "AuthorKeywords": ["CO2 laser", "Fibrous hyperplasia (FH)", "Human papilloma virus (HPV)", "Nd:YAG laser", "Oral squamous papilloma (OSP)"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84976870717", "SubjectAreas": [["Dentistry (all)", "DENT", "3500"]], "AuthorData": {"57190048496": {"Name": "Guerios L.", "AuthorID": "57190048496", "AffiliationID": "60031482", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinic and Preventive Dentistry, Pernambuco Federal University"}, "7003789865": {"Name": "Le\u00e3o J.", "AuthorID": "7003789865", "AffiliationID": "112845995", "AffiliationName": "Maur\u00edcio de Nassau University Center"}, "36627770400": {"Name": "Silva I.", "AuthorID": "36627770400", "AffiliationID": "60031482", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinic and Preventive Dentistry, Pernambuco Federal University"}, "57190044962": {"Name": "De F\u00e1tima Cavalcanti Dos Santos L.", "AuthorID": "57190044962", "AffiliationID": "60070422", "AffiliationName": "Real Center of Systemic Dentistry, Real Hospital Portugu\u00eas de Pernambuco"}}}
