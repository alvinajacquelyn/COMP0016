These composite (W/Nb) single layer thin film devices, patterned by FIB milling, show extremely good low-noise performance ~170 n\u03a60 at temperatures between 5 and 8.5 K and can operate in rather high magnetic fields (at least up to 1 T). The devices produced so far have a limited operating temperature range, typically only 1-2 K. We have the goal of achieving operation at 4.2 K, to be compatible with the best SQUID series array (SSA) preamplifier available. Using the SSA to readout the nanoSQUIDs provides us with a means of investigating the intrinsic noise of the former. In this paper we report improved white noise levels of these nanoSQUIDs, enabling potential detection of a single electronic spin flip in a 1-Hz bandwidth. At low frequencies the noise performance is already limited by SSA preamplifier noise.", "AuthorKeywords": ["NanoSQUIDs", "noise measurements", "Tc suppression"], "IndexKeywords": ["High magnetic fields", "Low noise performance", "NanoSQUIDs", "Noise measurements", "Noise performance", "Operating temperature ranges", "Preamplifier noise", "Single electronics"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84921324662", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"56486983400": {"Name": "Patel T.", "AuthorID": "56486983400", "AffiliationID": "60010785", "AffiliationName": "National Physical Laboratory"}, "56486247600": {"Name": "Li B.", "AuthorID": "56486247600", "AffiliationID": "60010785", "AffiliationName": "National Physical Laboratory"}, "16218796100": {"Name": "Gallop J.", "AuthorID": "16218796100", "AffiliationID": "60010785", "AffiliationName": "National Physical Laboratory"}, "7403240913": {"Name": "Cox D.", "AuthorID": "7403240913", "AffiliationID": "60010785", "AffiliationName": "National Physical Laboratory"}, "34769536200": {"Name": "Hao L.", "AuthorID": "34769536200", "AffiliationID": "60010785", "AffiliationName": "National Physical Laboratory"}, "8683196800": {"Name": "Kirkby K.", "AuthorID": "8683196800", "AffiliationID": "60021097", "AffiliationName": "University of Surrey"}, "7005065727": {"Name": "Nisbet A.", "AuthorID": "7005065727", "AffiliationID": "60021097", "AffiliationName": "University of Surrey"}, "6701351606": {"Name": "Romans E.", "AuthorID": "6701351606", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "London Center for Nanotechnology, University College London"}, "56477430300": {"Name": "Chen J.", "AuthorID": "56477430300", "AffiliationID": "60020623", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering and Design, Brunel University"}}}
