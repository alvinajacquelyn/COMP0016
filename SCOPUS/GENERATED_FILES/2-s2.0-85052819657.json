We undertook a cross-sectional survey with 564 nursing staff and healthcare assistants from 31 psychiatric wards in nine NHS Trusts using the SF-36, a reliable and valid measure of health status and compared summary scores with national normative data. Additional violence exposure data were collated simultaneously and also compared with health status. The physical health of staff was worse, and their mental health was better than the general population. Physical health data were skewed and showed a small number of staff in relatively poor health while the majority were above average. Better physical health was associated with less time in the current post, a higher pay grade, and less exposure to mild physical violence in the past year. Better mental health was associated with being older and from an ethnic minority background. Violence exposure influenced physical health but not mental health when possible confounders were considered. Mental health was strongly influenced by ethnicity, and further research might highlight the impact on own-group ethnic density on the quality of care. The impact of staff whom are physically unwell or impaired in the workplace needs to be considered as the quality of care may be compromised despite this being an example of inclusiveness, equal opportunities employment, and positive staff motivation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["aggression", "staff health", "violence", "wellbeing"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Female", "Health Status", "Humans", "Male", "Mental Health", "Middle Aged", "Psychiatric Department, Hospital", "Psychiatric Nursing", "Violence"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85052819657", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychiatric Mental Health", "NURS", "2921"]], "AuthorData": {"23571242000": {"Name": "Renwick L.", "AuthorID": "23571242000", "AffiliationID": "60172345", "AffiliationName": "Division of Nursing, Midwifery and Social Work, Faculty of Medicine, Biology and Health, University of Manchester"}, "55786464300": {"Name": "Lavelle M.", "AuthorID": "55786464300", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Patient Safety and Translational Research Centre, Imperial College London"}, "22985170000": {"Name": "James K.", "AuthorID": "22985170000", "AffiliationID": "60029329, 60172339, 60033359", "AffiliationName": "Joint Faculty of Health, Social Care and Education, Kingston University and St George's University of London"}, "16640434900": {"Name": "Stewart D.", "AuthorID": "16640434900", "AffiliationID": "60016418", "AffiliationName": "Department of Health Sciences, University of York"}, "36053555200": {"Name": "Richardson M.", "AuthorID": "36053555200", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Social Science Research Unit, Institute of Education, University College London"}, "7102732657": {"Name": "Bowers L.", "AuthorID": "7102732657", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Section of Mental Health Nursing, Health Service and Population Research, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, Kings College London"}}}
