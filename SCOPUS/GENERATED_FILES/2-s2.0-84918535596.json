The finding is consistent both across selected samples attending dental clinics at major competitions and more representative sampling of teams and has led to calls from the International Olympic Committee for more accurate data on oral health. Poor oral health is an important issue directly as it can cause pain, negative effects on appearance and psychosocial effects on confidence and quality of life and may have long-term consequences for treatment burden. Self-reported evidence also suggests an impact on training and performance of athletes. There are many potential challenges to the oral health of athletes including nutritional, oral dehydration, exercise-induced immune suppression, lack of awareness, negative health behaviours and lack of prioritisation. However, in theory, oral diseases are preventable by simple interventions with good evidence of efficacy. The consensus statement aims to raise awareness of the issues of oral health in elite sport and recommends strategies for prevention and health promotion in addition to future research strategies.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Athletic Performance", "Consensus", "Dehydration", "Food Habits", "Health Behavior", "Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice", "Health Promotion", "Humans", "Mouth Diseases", "Oral Health", "Risk Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84918535596", "SubjectAreas": [["Orthopedics and Sports Medicine", "MEDI", "2732"], ["Physical Therapy, Sports Therapy and Rehabilitation", "HEAL", "3612"]], "AuthorData": {"7004601297": {"Name": "Needleman I.", "AuthorID": "7004601297", "AffiliationID": "60013985", "AffiliationName": "UCL Eastman Dental Institute, Unit of Periodontology"}, "7006826945": {"Name": "Ashley P.", "AuthorID": "7006826945", "AffiliationID": "60013985", "AffiliationName": "UCL Eastman Dental Institute, Unit of Periodontology"}, "56448156300": {"Name": "Fine P.", "AuthorID": "56448156300", "AffiliationID": "60013985", "AffiliationName": "UCL Eastman Dental Institute, Unit of Periodontology"}, "7004314492": {"Name": "Donos N.", "AuthorID": "7004314492", "AffiliationID": "60013985", "AffiliationName": "UCL Eastman Dental Institute, Unit of Periodontology"}, "7201730425": {"Name": "Porter S.", "AuthorID": "7201730425", "AffiliationID": "60013985", "AffiliationName": "UCL Eastman Dental Institute, Unit of Periodontology"}, "7203033976": {"Name": "Haddad F.", "AuthorID": "7203033976", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute for Sport Exercise and Health"}, "22941686000": {"Name": "Loosemore M.", "AuthorID": "22941686000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute for Sport Exercise and Health"}, "56448419200": {"Name": "Medici A.D.", "AuthorID": "56448419200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute for Sport Exercise and Health"}, "35606052400": {"Name": "Newton T.", "AuthorID": "35606052400", "AffiliationID": "60177635", "AffiliationName": "KCL Dental Institute"}, "56016822200": {"Name": "Moazzez R.", "AuthorID": "56016822200", "AffiliationID": "60177635", "AffiliationName": "KCL Dental Institute"}, "55607398700": {"Name": "Someren K.V.", "AuthorID": "55607398700", "AffiliationID": "60020649", "AffiliationName": "Human Performance Lab, GlaxoSmithKline"}, "7005531764": {"Name": "Jaques R.", "AuthorID": "7005531764", "AffiliationID": "112937446", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Sport and Exercise Medicine"}, "56260265900": {"Name": "Hunter G.", "AuthorID": "56260265900", "AffiliationID": "60107252", "AffiliationName": "English Institute of Sport"}, "7403177580": {"Name": "Khan K.", "AuthorID": "7403177580", "AffiliationID": "60105844", "AffiliationName": "Aspetar Orthopaedic and Sports Medicine Hospital"}, "56449351500": {"Name": "Shimmin M.", "AuthorID": "56449351500", "AffiliationID": "114817750", "AffiliationName": "Dental Practice"}, "57197420057": {"Name": "Brewer J.", "AuthorID": "57197420057", "AffiliationID": "60108766", "AffiliationName": "St Mary's University, Twickenham, School of Sport, Health and Applied Science"}, "56449031300": {"Name": "Meehan L.", "AuthorID": "56449031300", "AffiliationID": "114817553", "AffiliationName": "Dental Practice"}, "7202974014": {"Name": "Mills S.", "AuthorID": "7202974014", "AffiliationID": "105461018", "AffiliationName": "Academy for Sports Dentistry"}}}
