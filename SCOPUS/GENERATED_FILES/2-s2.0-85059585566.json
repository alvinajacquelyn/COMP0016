Study design: Retrospective case series. Methods: The medical charts of the 3 patients were reviewed. Results: A 43-year-old woman, a 68-year-old woman, and a 41-year-old woman were referred to Nagoya University Hospital. Their main symptom was bilateral acute photophobia. None of the patients had any systemic diseases or specific medical history. The decimal best-corrected visual acuity (> 0.8) and Humphrey visual fields (mean deviation > -3 dB) were relatively well preserved in all 3 patients. The optical coherence tomography (OCT) and fundus autofluorescence findings were essentially normal. Fluorescein angiography showed mild leakage in 1 patient but no abnormality in the other 2 patients. However, the ERGs of the 3 patients had the features of abnormal ERGs found in patients with incomplete congenital stationary night blindness (CSNB). Exome analyses found no pathogenic variants related to known CSNB-related genes. The symptoms and ERGs of the 3 patients have not progressed or recovered after a relatively long follow-up period. Conclusion: The ERG characteristics of 3 patients with bilateral photophobia were similar to those of incomplete CSNB, suggesting post-phototransductional abnormalities. The symptoms and genetic analyses indicated the possibility of an acquired condition rather than a hereditary retinal disease.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Acquired retinal disease", "Incomplete-type congenital stationary night blindness", "Negative-type ERG", "Post-phototransduction abnormality"], "IndexKeywords": ["Acute Disease", "Adult", "Aged", "Diagnosis, Differential", "Electroretinography", "Eye Diseases, Hereditary", "Female", "Fluorescein Angiography", "Follow-Up Studies", "Fundus Oculi", "Genetic Diseases, X-Linked", "Humans", "Myopia", "Night Blindness", "Photophobia", "Retrospective Studies", "Tomography, Optical Coherence", "Visual Acuity"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85059585566", "SubjectAreas": [["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"]], "AuthorData": {"7402327647": {"Name": "Ueno S.", "AuthorID": "7402327647", "AffiliationID": "60161458", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine"}, "57196298213": {"Name": "Inooka D.", "AuthorID": "57196298213", "AffiliationID": "60161458", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine"}, "57205328641": {"Name": "Meinert M.", "AuthorID": "57205328641", "AffiliationID": "60029170", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, Lund University"}, "55253552600": {"Name": "Ito Y.", "AuthorID": "55253552600", "AffiliationID": "60161458", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine"}, "7103159537": {"Name": "Terasaki H.", "AuthorID": "7103159537", "AffiliationID": "60161458", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine"}, "7101962991": {"Name": "Tsunoda K.", "AuthorID": "7101962991", "AffiliationID": "60032544", "AffiliationName": "National Institute of Sensory Organs, National Hospital Organization Tokyo Medical Center"}, "23027590900": {"Name": "Fujinami K.", "AuthorID": "23027590900", "AffiliationID": "60013148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genetics, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "35477839800": {"Name": "Iwata T.", "AuthorID": "35477839800", "AffiliationID": "60032544", "AffiliationName": "National Institute of Sensory Organs, National Hospital Organization Tokyo Medical Center"}, "7006179787": {"Name": "Ohde H.", "AuthorID": "7006179787", "AffiliationID": "60025252", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, Keio University School of Medicine"}}}
