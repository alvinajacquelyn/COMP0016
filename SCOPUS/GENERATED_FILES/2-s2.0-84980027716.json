Parents\u2019 use of language-stimulating and emotionally rich reading styles was measured via a specially developed Book Sharing Scale for Infants. Aspects of child temperament were assessed by the Infant Characteristics Questionnaire [Bates, J. E., Freeland, C. A. B., & Lounsbury, M. L. (1979). Measurement of infant difficultness. Child Development, 50(3), 794\u2013803], and parents responsivity was measured by the Caregiver Interaction Scale [Arnett, J. (1989). Caregiver interaction scale. Princeton, NJ: Educational Testing Service]. Parents\u2019 socio-economic status and education, parents\u2019 impression of their child being unsociable and the warmth of the caregiver\u2019s interaction were positively predictive of the quality of the reading interaction. This suggests that the extent to which parents employ high-quality reading styles with their 10-month-old babies, depends on socio-demographic variables, children\u2019s ability to communicate with their parents, and the overall affective quality of their relationship.", "AuthorKeywords": ["infant characteristics", "parents\u2019 reading styles", "parent\u2013child interaction", "Shared book reading"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84980027716", "SubjectAreas": [["Social Psychology", "PSYC", "3207"], ["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"], ["Pediatrics", "NURS", "2919"]], "AuthorData": {"54408784700": {"Name": "Kucirkova N.", "AuthorID": "54408784700", "AffiliationID": "60022046", "AffiliationName": "Childhood, Youth and Education Studies, Faculty of Education, Manchester Metropolitan University"}, "7101987679": {"Name": "Dale P.S.", "AuthorID": "7101987679", "AffiliationID": "60033021", "AffiliationName": "Speech & Hearing Sciences, University of New Mexico"}, "6603365997": {"Name": "Sylva K.", "AuthorID": "6603365997", "AffiliationID": "60175816", "AffiliationName": "Department of Education, University of Oxford"}}}
