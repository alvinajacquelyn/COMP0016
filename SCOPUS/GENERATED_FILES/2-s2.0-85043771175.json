We consider a redatuming problem for a wave equation on a bounded domain, or on a manifold with boundary, and model data acquisition by a restriction of the associated Neumann-to-Dirichlet map. This map models measurements with sources and receivers on an open subset contained in the boundary of the manifold. We model the wavespeed by a Riemannian metric and suppose that the metric is known in some coordinates in a neighborhood of. Our goal is to move sources and receivers into this known near boundary region. We formulate redatuming as a collection of unique continuation problems and provide a two-step procedure to solve the redatuming problem. We investigate the stability of the First step in this procedure, showing that it enjoys conditional H\u00f6lder stability under suitable geometric hypotheses. In addition, we provide computational experiments that demonstrate our redatuming procedure.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Boundary control method", "Redatuming", "Wave equation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Acquisition geometry", "Boundary control methods", "Computational experiment", "Data processing techniques", "Inverse boundary value problem", "Redatuming", "Two-step procedure", "Unique continuation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85043771175", "SubjectAreas": [["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"7004025757": {"Name": "De Hoop M.V.", "AuthorID": "7004025757", "AffiliationID": "60005286", "AffiliationName": "Simons Department of Computational and Applied Mathematics and Earth Science, Rice University"}, "57189039967": {"Name": "Kepley P.", "AuthorID": "57189039967", "AffiliationID": "60028629, 60009254", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, Purdue University"}, "36241865400": {"Name": "Oksanen L.", "AuthorID": "36241865400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University College London"}}}
