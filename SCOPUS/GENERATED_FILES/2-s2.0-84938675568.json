This contrasts with rigid approaches, which assume that mapping is based on particular functional heads. We provide support for this proposal with data from the Bantu language B\u00e0s\u00e0\u00e1 and the Finno-Ugric language Hungarian, showing that a left-peripheral constituent may be prosodically outside the core intonational phrase even though its syntactic position is relatively low, as long as the verb is even lower, and, conversely, that a constituent may be phrased inside the core intonational phrase even if it is in a syntactically high position, as long as the verb is also high.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84938675568", "SubjectAreas": [["Language and Linguistics", "ARTS", "1203"], ["Linguistics and Language", "SOCI", "3310"]], "AuthorData": {"36097514800": {"Name": "Hamlaoui F.", "AuthorID": "36097514800", "AffiliationID": "101631665", "AffiliationName": "Centre for General Linguistics (ZAS)"}, "6505922471": {"Name": "Szendroi K.", "AuthorID": "6505922471", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Linguistics, University College London, Chandler House"}}}
