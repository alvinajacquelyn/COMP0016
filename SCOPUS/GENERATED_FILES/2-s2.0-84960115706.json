Published by Oxford University Press.Emotion and cognition are dynamically coupled to bodily arousal: The induction of anger, even unconsciously, can reprioritise neural and physiological resources toward action states that bias cognitive processes. Here we examine behavioural, neural and bodily effects of covert anger processing and its influence on cognition, indexed by lexical decision-making. While recording beat-to-beat blood pressure, the words ANGER or RELAX were presented subliminally just prior to rapid word/non-word reaction-time judgements of letter-strings. Subliminal ANGER primes delayed the time taken to reach rapid lexical decisions, relative to RELAX primes. However, individuals with high trait anger were speeded up by subliminal anger primes. ANGER primes increased systolic blood pressure and the magnitude of this increase predicted reaction time prolongation. Within the brain, ANGER trials evoked an enhancement of activity within dorsal pons and an attenuation of activity within visual occipitotemporal and attentional parietal cortices. Activity within periaqueductal grey matter, occipital and parietal regions increased linearly with evoked blood pressure changes, indicating neural substrates through which covert anger impairs semantic decisions, putatively through its expression as visceral arousal. The behavioural and physiological impact of anger states compromises the efficiency of cognitive processing through action-ready changes in autonomic response that skew regional neural activity.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Emotion", "fMRI", "Lexical decision task", "Subliminal", "Systolic blood pressure"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Anger", "Arousal", "Attention", "Autonomic Nervous System", "Blood Pressure", "Brain", "Cognition Disorders", "Decision Making", "Female", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Reaction Time", "Subliminal Stimulation", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84960115706", "SubjectAreas": [["Experimental and Cognitive Psychology", "PSYC", "3205"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"]], "AuthorData": {"26648254700": {"Name": "Garfinkel S.N.", "AuthorID": "26648254700", "AffiliationID": "60017317", "AffiliationName": "Sackler Centre for Consciousness Science, University of Sussex"}, "57159953400": {"Name": "Zorab E.", "AuthorID": "57159953400", "AffiliationID": "60100018", "AffiliationName": "Division of Medicine, Psychiatry, Brighton and Sussex Medical School"}, "57159556900": {"Name": "Navaratnam N.", "AuthorID": "57159556900", "AffiliationID": "60100018", "AffiliationName": "Division of Medicine, Psychiatry, Brighton and Sussex Medical School"}, "7006731538": {"Name": "Critchley H.D.", "AuthorID": "7006731538", "AffiliationID": "60017317", "AffiliationName": "Sackler Centre for Consciousness Science, University of Sussex"}, "57159114900": {"Name": "Engels M.", "AuthorID": "57159114900", "AffiliationID": "60018869", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Psychology and Neuroscience, Maastricht University"}, "55625010400": {"Name": "Mallorqu\u00ed-Bagu\u00e9 N.", "AuthorID": "55625010400", "AffiliationID": "112595604", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, Psychology and Psychosomatic Medicine, Institut Universitari Quir\u00f3n Dexeus"}, "15844021600": {"Name": "Minati L.", "AuthorID": "15844021600", "AffiliationID": "60017275", "AffiliationName": "U.O.
