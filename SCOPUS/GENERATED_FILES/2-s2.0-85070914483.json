This naturally leads to the question of what is a workable standard for establishing the existence of sham litigation, and how it is possible to distinguish between the legitimate use of the regulatory/litigation process and strategic attempts to use the process in order to restrict competition. Legal and economic literature, as well as the courts, have struggled to define operational tests enabling them to determine the boundaries of the \u201csham\u201d/\u201cvexatious\u201d litigation antitrust category. This article examines the intellectual underpinnings of this form of abusive/anticompetitive conduct and puts forward a \u201cmechanism design approach\u201d with the aim to reduce the occurrence of sham litigation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Abuse of dominance", "Abuse of regulatory process", "Antitrust", "Noerr-Pennington doctrine", "Sham litigation", "Vexatious litigation"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85070914483", "SubjectAreas": [["Economics and Econometrics", "ECON", "2002"], ["Law", "SOCI", "3308"]], "AuthorData": {"23088833500": {"Name": "Lianos I.", "AuthorID": "23088833500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Global Competition Law and Public Policy, Centre for Law, Economics and Society (CLES), UCL Faculty of Laws"}, "6602701792": {"Name": "Regibeau P.", "AuthorID": "6602701792", "AffiliationID": "60015150, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Imperial College London\u2019s IP Centre, Centre for Law, Economics and Society, UCL Faculty of Laws"}}}
