All rights reserved.The Future: Total Scarring Control: Significant advances have been made in developing new treatments and refining existing treatments for the prevention of scarring after disease, trauma, or surgical intervention. The advent of new technologies in addition to traditional chemical drugs such as dendrimers, nanoparticles, aptamers, ribozymes, gene therapy with viral vectors, and RNA interference, opens the door to a new generation of therapies to prevent fibrosis after glaucoma surgery. The ability to fully control fibrotic processes in the eye offers the tantalizing prospect of 100% success of glaucoma surgery, with pressure around 10 mmHg associated with minimal progression over a decade. Genetic mapping may allow accurate prediction of a patient's wound-healing response to surgery, and accurate intervention for minimal scarring.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84944391820", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"7006578947": {"Name": "Khaw P.T.", "AuthorID": "7006578947", "AffiliationID": "60016691, 60172638, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Biomedical Research Centre, Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust and UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "7103079618": {"Name": "Lockwood A.", "AuthorID": "7103079618", "AffiliationID": "60016691, 60172638, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Biomedical Research Centre, Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust and UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "25121217700": {"Name": "Georgoulas S.", "AuthorID": "25121217700", "AffiliationID": "60016691, 60172638, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Biomedical Research Centre, Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust and UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "22950013600": {"Name": "Dahlmann-Noor A.H.", "AuthorID": "22950013600", "AffiliationID": "60016691, 60172638, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Biomedical Research Centre, Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust and UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "6701323615": {"Name": "Brocchini S.", "AuthorID": "6701323615", "AffiliationID": "60016379, 60016691, 60172638, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy, National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Biomedical Research Centre, Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust and UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}}}
