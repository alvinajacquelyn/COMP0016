Teachers are currently positioned in ways that underline their instrumental role\u2013their duty to students, parents, school and government to ensure that students achieve. A lack of faith in teachers\u2019 capacity to innovate on their own terms means that creative practice in schools is routinely overlooked or mistrusted. My own history serves to illustrate the complex ways in which teachers develop their practice, and the cultural and political influences that play their part in the process. This article ends with some comparison between my own experience and that of my student teachers as they embark on their teaching careers nearly 30 years later.", "AuthorKeywords": ["agency", "community", "creativity", "Drama in education", "filmmaking", "pedagogy", "role"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85038397216", "SubjectAreas": [["Cultural Studies", "SOCI", "3316"], ["Education", "SOCI", "3304"]], "AuthorData": {"55845872000": {"Name": "Bryer T.", "AuthorID": "55845872000", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Education, University College London"}}}
