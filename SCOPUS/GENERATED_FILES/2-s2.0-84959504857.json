Little is known about how fidgeting behaviors might modify the association. Methods Data were from the United Kingdom (UK) Women's Cohort Study. In 1999-2002, a total of 12,778 women (aged 37-78 years) provided data on average daily sitting time, overall fidgeting (irrespective of posture), and a range of relevant covariates including physical activity, diet, smoking status, and alcohol consumption. Participants were followed for mortality over a mean of 12 years. Proportional hazards Cox regression models estimated the relative risk of mortality in high (versus low) and medium (versus low) sitting time groups. Results Fidgeting modified the risk associated with sitting time (p=0.04 for interaction), leading us to separate groups for analysis. Adjusting for covariates, sitting for \u22657 hours/day (versus <5 hours/day) was associated with 30% increased all-cause mortality risk (hazard ratio [HR]=1.30, 95% CI=1.02, 1.66) only among women in the low fidgeting group. Among women in the high fidgeting group, sitting for 5-6 hours/day (versus <5 hours/day) was associated with decreased mortality risk (HR=0.63, 95% CI=0.43, 0.91), adjusting for a range of covariates. There was no increased mortality risk from longer sitting time in the middle and high fidgeting groups. Conclusions Fidgeting may reduce the risk of all-cause mortality associated with excessive sitting time. More detailed and better-validated measures of fidgeting should be identified in other studies to replicate these findings and identity mechanisms, particularly measures that distinguish fidgeting in a seated from standing posture.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Alcohol Drinking", "Body Mass Index", "Cause of Death", "Diet", "Exercise", "Female", "Health Behavior", "Humans", "Middle Aged", "Posture", "Proportional Hazards Models", "Prospective Studies", "Risk Factors", "Sedentary Lifestyle", "Smoking", "Socioeconomic Factors", "Time Factors", "United Kingdom", "Women's Health"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84959504857", "SubjectAreas": [["Epidemiology", "MEDI", "2713"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"12769074400": {"Name": "Hagger-Johnson G.", "AuthorID": "12769074400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Health and Social Surveys Research Group, Department of Epidemiology and Public Health"}, "8591529000": {"Name": "Gow A.J.", "AuthorID": "8591529000", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cognitive Ageing and Cognitive Epidemiology, University of Edinburgh"}, "6701393403": {"Name": "Burley V.", "AuthorID": "6701393403", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "Nutritional Epidemiology Group, School of Food Science and Nutrition, University of Leeds"}, "7102348853": {"Name": "Greenwood D.", "AuthorID": "7102348853", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "Division of Biostatistics, University of Leeds"}, "7005622445": {"Name": "Cade J.E.", "AuthorID": "7005622445", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "Nutritional Epidemiology Group, School of Food Science and Nutrition, University of Leeds"}}}
