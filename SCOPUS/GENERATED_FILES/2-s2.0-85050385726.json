All rights reserved.We describe a case series of 35 Ebola virus disease (EVD) survivors during the epidemic in West Africa who had neurologic and accompanying psychiatric sequelae. Survivors meeting neurologic criteria were invited from a cohort of 361 EVD survivors to attend a preliminary clinic. Those whose severe neurologic features were documented in the preliminary clinic were referred for specialist neurologic evaluation, ophthalmologic examination, and psychiatric assessment. Of 35 survivors with neurologic sequelae, 13 had migraine headache, 2 stroke, 2 peripheral sensory neuropathy, and 2 peripheral nerve lesions. Of brain computed tomography scans of 17 patients, 3 showed cerebral and/or cerebellar atrophy and 2 confirmed strokes. Sixteen patients required mental health follow-up; psychiatric disorders were diagnosed in 5. The 10 patients who experienced greatest disability had co-existing physical and mental health conditions. EVD survivors may have ongoing central and peripheral nervous system disorders, including previously unrecognized migraine headaches and stroke.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Cohort Studies", "Epidemics", "Female", "Hemorrhagic Fever, Ebola", "Humans", "Male", "Migraine Disorders", "Peripheral Nervous System Diseases", "Sierra Leone", "Stroke", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85050385726", "SubjectAreas": [["Epidemiology", "MEDI", "2713"], ["Microbiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2726"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"57007929800": {"Name": "Howlett P.J.", "AuthorID": "57007929800", "AffiliationID": "100365325", "AffiliationName": "King\u2019s Sierra Leone Partnership, Connaught Hospital"}, "57198779218": {"Name": "Walder A.R.", "AuthorID": "57198779218", "AffiliationID": "60109217, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "King\u2019s College London, King\u2019s Health Partners"}, "56577986700": {"Name": "Lado M.", "AuthorID": "56577986700", "AffiliationID": "60109217, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "King\u2019s College London, King\u2019s Health Partners"}, "12809768100": {"Name": "Brown C.S.", "AuthorID": "12809768100", "AffiliationID": "60109217, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "King\u2019s College London, King\u2019s Health Partners"}, "57007875000": {"Name": "Lisk D.R.", "AuthorID": "57007875000", "AffiliationID": "60072928", "AffiliationName": "University of Sierra Leone"}, "57203065871": {"Name": "N\u2019Jai A.", "AuthorID": "57203065871", "AffiliationID": "60072928", "AffiliationName": "University of Sierra Leone"}, "57008064100": {"Name": "Deen G.F.", "AuthorID": "57008064100", "AffiliationID": "60072928", "AffiliationName": "University of Sierra Leone"}, "55750371200": {"Name": "Fitzgerald F.", "AuthorID": "55750371200", "AffiliationID": "60109245", "AffiliationName": "Save the Children, United Kingdom and Sierra Leone"}, "57200279624": {"Name": "Sevalie S.", "AuthorID": "57200279624", "AffiliationID": "106999143", "AffiliationName": "34 Military Hospital, Republic of Sierra Leone Joint Armed Forces Joint Medical Unit"}, "6506493626": {"Name": "Sahr F.", "AuthorID": "6506493626", "AffiliationID": "106999143", "AffiliationName": "34 Military Hospital, Republic of Sierra Leone Joint Armed Forces Joint Medical Unit"}, "57185751200": {"Name": "Sesay F.", "AuthorID": "57185751200", "AffiliationID": "106999143", "AffiliationName": "34 Military Hospital, Republic of Sierra Leone Joint Armed Forces Joint Medical Unit"}, "36761595400": {"Name": "Read J.M.", "AuthorID": "36761595400", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "University of Liverpool"}, "57194587036": {"Name": "Steptoe P.J.", "AuthorID": "57194587036", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "University of Liverpool"}, "6603858517": {"Name": "Beare N.A.V.", "AuthorID": "6603858517", "AffiliationID": "60023925", "AffiliationName": "Royal Liverpool University Hospital"}, "7006478127": {"Name": "Semple M.G.", "AuthorID": "7006478127", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "University of Liverpool"}, "7407335491": {"Name": "Scott J.T.", "AuthorID": "7407335491", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "University of Liverpool"}, "57220519345": {"Name": "Dwivedi R.", "AuthorID": "57220519345", "AffiliationID": "60023925", "AffiliationName": "Royal Liverpool University Hospital"}, "6603880605": {"Name": "Solbrig M.", "AuthorID": "6603880605", "AffiliationID": "60009697", "AffiliationName": "University of Manitoba"}, "7102024641": {"Name": "Solomon T.", "AuthorID": "7102024641", "AffiliationID": "60160417", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Global Health, Walton Centre NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
