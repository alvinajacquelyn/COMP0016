{"Title": "Hepatic steatosis risk is partly driven by increased de novo lipogenesis following carbohydrate consumption", "Year": 2018, "Source": "Genome Biol.", "Volume": "19", "Issue": 1, "Art.No": null, "PageStart": null, "PageEnd": null, "CitedBy": 17, "DOI": "10.1186/s13059-018-1439-8", "Link": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85048856778&origin=inward", "Abstract": "\u00a9 2018 The Author(s).Background: Diet is a major contributor to metabolic disease risk, but there is controversy as to whether increased incidences of diseases such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease arise from consumption of saturated fats or free sugars. Here, we investigate whether a sub-set of triacylglycerols (TAGs) were associated with hepatic steatosis and whether they arise from de novo lipogenesis (DNL) from the consumption of carbohydrates. Results: We conduct direct infusion mass spectrometry of lipids in plasma to study the association between specific TAGs and hepatic steatosis assessed by ultrasound and fatty liver index in volunteers from the UK-based Fenland Study and evaluate clustering of TAGs in the National Survey of Health and Development UK cohort. We find that TAGs containing saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids with 16-18 carbons are specifically associated with hepatic steatosis. These TAGs are additionally associated with higher consumption of carbohydrate and saturated fat, hepatic steatosis, and variations in the gene for protein phosphatase 1, regulatory subunit 3b (PPP1R3B), which in part regulates glycogen synthesis. DNL is measured in hyperphagic ob/ob mice, mice on a western diet (high in fat and free sugar) and in healthy humans using stable isotope techniques following high carbohydrate meals, demonstrating the rate of DNL correlates with increased synthesis of this cluster of TAGs. Furthermore, these TAGs are increased in plasma from patients with biopsy-confirmed steatosis. Conclusion: A subset of TAGs is associated with hepatic steatosis, even when correcting for common confounding factors. We suggest that hepatic steatosis risk in western populations is in part driven by increased DNL following carbohydrate rich meals in addition to the consumption of saturated fat.", "AuthorKeywords": ["De novo lipogenesis", "Direct infusion mass spectrometry", "Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease", "Triacylglycerols", "Triglycerides"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Carbohydrates", "Diet", "Fatty Liver", "Female", "Humans", "Lipids", "Lipogenesis", "Liver", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Mice, Obese", "Middle Aged", "Risk", "Triglycerides"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85048856778", "SubjectAreas": [["Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics", "AGRI", "1105"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"56533444600": {"Name": "Sanders F.W.B.", "AuthorID": "56533444600", "AffiliationID": "60015394", "AffiliationName": "MRC Human Nutrition Research"}, "37107117500": {"Name": "Acharjee A.", "AuthorID": "37107117500", "AffiliationID": "60119931, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "University of Cambridge, Department of Biochemistry and the Cambridge Systems Biology Centre"}, "16240388000": {"Name": "Walker C.", "AuthorID": "16240388000", "AffiliationID": "60015394", "AffiliationName": "MRC Human Nutrition Research"}, "25422138500": {"Name": "Marney L.", "AuthorID": "25422138500", "AffiliationID": "60015394", "AffiliationName": "MRC Human Nutrition Research"}, "24167485600": {"Name": "Roberts L.D.", "AuthorID": "24167485600", "AffiliationID": "60023959, 60012070", "AffiliationName": "University of Leeds, Leeds Institute of Cardiovascular and Metabolic Medicine"}, "56500017600": {"Name": "Jenkins B.", "AuthorID": "56500017600", "AffiliationID": "60015394", "AffiliationName": "MRC Human Nutrition Research"}, "7402324282": {"Name": "Ray S.", "AuthorID": "7402324282", "AffiliationID": "118354224", "AffiliationName": "NNEdPro Global Centre for Nutrition and Health"}, "35785284900": {"Name": "Vacca M.", "AuthorID": "35785284900", "AffiliationID": "60031101, 60120909", "AffiliationName": "University of Cambridge, Institute of Metabolic Science"}, "57212735167": {"Name": "Koulman A.", "AuthorID": "57212735167", "AffiliationID": "60015394", "AffiliationName": "MRC Human Nutrition Research"}, "35473647700": {"Name": "Griffin J.L.", "AuthorID": "35473647700", "AffiliationID": "60119931, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "University of Cambridge, Department of Biochemistry and the Cambridge Systems Biology Centre"}, "57217329396": {"Name": "Case J.", "AuthorID": "57217329396", "AffiliationID": "60119931, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "University of Cambridge, Department of Biochemistry and the Cambridge Systems Biology Centre"}, "26667673200": {"Name": "Imamura F.", "AuthorID": "26667673200", "AffiliationID": "60031101, 60009969, 60017488", "AffiliationName": "Addenbrooke's Hospital, MRC Epidemiology, University of Cambridge"}, "6603478414": {"Name": "Forouhi N.", "AuthorID": "6603478414", "AffiliationID": "60031101, 60009969, 60017488", "AffiliationName": "Addenbrooke's Hospital, MRC Epidemiology, University of Cambridge"}, "34668706300": {"Name": "Wareham N.", "AuthorID": "34668706300", "AffiliationID": "60031101, 60009969, 60017488", "AffiliationName": "Addenbrooke's Hospital, MRC Epidemiology, University of Cambridge"}, "8447660100": {"Name": "Virtue S.", "AuthorID": "8447660100", "AffiliationID": "60031101, 60120909", "AffiliationName": "University of Cambridge, Institute of Metabolic Science"}, "7003817501": {"Name": "Vidal-Puig A.", "AuthorID": "7003817501", "AffiliationID": "60031101, 60120909", "AffiliationName": "University of Cambridge, Institute of Metabolic Science"}, "8329745200": {"Name": "Kuh D.", "AuthorID": "8329745200", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Unit for Lifelong Health and Ageing at UCL"}, "57204025615": {"Name": "Hardy R.", "AuthorID": "57204025615", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Unit for Lifelong Health and Ageing at UCL"}, "7102381712": {"Name": "Allison M.", "AuthorID": "7102381712", "AffiliationID": "60016390", "AffiliationName": "Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Liver Unit, Department of Medicine, Cambridge Biomedical Research Centre"}, "57205685245": {"Name": "Murray A.J.", "AuthorID": "57205685245", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "University of Cambridge, Department of Physiology, Development and Neuroscience"}}}
