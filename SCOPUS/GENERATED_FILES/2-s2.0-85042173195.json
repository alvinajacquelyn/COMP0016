XEN-D0103 is a nanomolar ion channel blocker that selectively inhibits potassium ion flux through the Kv1.5 ion channel. The efficacy of XEN-D0103 in reducing AF burden was assessed in patients with DDDRp permanent pacemakers (PPMs) and PAF. Methods: A double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study was performed in patients with PAF and DDDRp PPMs with advanced atrial and ventricular Holters allowing beat-to-beat arrhythmia follow-up. All anti-arrhythmic drugs were withdrawn before randomised treatment. After baseline assessment, patients were randomly assigned to two treatment periods of placebo then XEN-D0103 50 mg bd, or XEN-D0103 50 mg bd then placebo. Results: Fifty-four patients were screened and 21 patients were eligible and included in the randomised trial. All 21 patients completed both treatment periods. The primary endpoint was change in AF burden assessed by PPM. There was no significant difference in AF burden on treatment with XEN-D0103 versus placebo. There was a reduction in the mean frequency of AF episodes (relative reduction 0.72, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.77; p < 0.0001). XEN-D0103 was safe and well tolerated, and there were no serious adverse events. XEN-D0103 did not have any apparent effect on heart rate compared to placebo. Conclusions: XEN-D0103 did not reduce AF burden in patients with PAF and dual chamber pacemakers providing beat-to-beat monitoring. XEN-D0103 was well tolerated and did not have any apparent effect on heart rate. Although single-ion channel blockade with XEN-D0103 did not affect AF in this study, there might be a potential for this agent to be used in combination with other atrially specific drugs in the treatment of AF.
