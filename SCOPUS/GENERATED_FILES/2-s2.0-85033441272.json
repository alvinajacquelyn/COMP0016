A system which could estimate level of fatigue from speech would have application in domains where operators engage in regular verbal communication as part of their duties. Previous studies on the prediction of fatigue from speech have been limited because of their reliance on subjective ratings and because they lack comparison to other methods for assessing fatigue. In this paper, we present an analysis of voice recordings and psychophysiological test scores collected from seven aerospace personnel during a training task in which they remained awake for 60 h. We show that voice features and test scores are affected by both the total time spent awake and the time position within each subject's circadian cycle. However, we show that time spent awake and time-of-day information are poor predictors of the test results, while voice features can give good predictions of the psychophysiological test scores and sleep latency. Mean absolute errors of prediction are possible within about 17.5% for sleep latency and 5-12% for test scores. We discuss the implications for the use of voice as a means to monitor the effects of fatigue on cognitive performance in practical applications.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bioinformatics", "Computational paralinguistics", "Fatigue", "Speech"], "IndexKeywords": ["Automatic systems", "Cognitive performance", "Critical environment", "Mean absolute error", "Paralinguistics", "Subjective rating", "Test performance", "Verbal communications"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85033441272", "SubjectAreas": [["Biotechnology", "BIOC", "1305"], ["Bioengineering", "CENG", "1502"], ["Histology", "MEDI", "2722"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"]], "AuthorData": {"55764009400": {"Name": "Baykaner K.R.", "AuthorID": "55764009400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Speech Hearing and Phonetic Sciences, Psychology and Language Sciences, University College London"}, "6603430483": {"Name": "Huckvale M.", "AuthorID": "6603430483", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Speech Hearing and Phonetic Sciences, Psychology and Language Sciences, University College London"}, "35423146300": {"Name": "Whiteley I.", "AuthorID": "35423146300", "AffiliationID": "60084281, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Mullard Space Science Laboratory, Centre for Space Medicine, University College London"}, "57027607900": {"Name": "Andreeva S.", "AuthorID": "57027607900", "AffiliationID": "100862176", "AffiliationName": "Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Centre"}, "57028514000": {"Name": "Ryumin O.", "AuthorID": "57028514000", "AffiliationID": "100862176", "AffiliationName": "Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Centre"}}}
