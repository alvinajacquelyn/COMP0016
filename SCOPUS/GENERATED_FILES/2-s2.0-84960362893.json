Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Gerontological Society of America.Background. Eye-gaze following is a fundamental social skill, facilitating communication. The present series of studies explored adult age-related differences in this key social-cognitive ability. Method. In Study 1 younger and older adult participants completed a cueing task in which eye-gaze cues were predictive or non-predictive of target location. Another eye-gaze cueing task, assessing the influence of congruent and incongruent eye-gaze cues relative to trials which provided no cue to target location, was administered in Study 2. Finally, in Study 3 the eye-gaze cue was replaced by an arrow. Results. In Study 1 older adults showed less evidence of gaze following than younger participants when required to strategically follow predictive eye-gaze cues and when making automatic shifts of attention to non-predictive eye-gaze cues. Findings from Study 2 suggested that, unlike younger adults, older participants showed no facilitation effect and thus did not follow congruent eye-gaze cues. They also had significantly weaker attentional costs than their younger counterparts. These age-related differences were not found in the non-social arrow cueing task. Discussion. Taken together these findings suggest older adults do not use eye-gaze cues to engage in joint attention, and have specific social difficulties decoding critical information from the eye region.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Aging", "Arrows", "Attention", "Eye-gaze", "Orienting"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Aging", "Attention", "Cues", "Female", "Fixation, Ocular", "Humans", "Male", "Nonverbal Communication", "Photic Stimulation", "Reaction Time", "Social Skills", "Statistics as Topic", "Task Performance and Analysis"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84960362893", "SubjectAreas": [["Health (social science)", "SOCI", "3306"], ["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"], ["Life-span and Life-course Studies", "SOCI", "3319"]], "AuthorData": {"22235510900": {"Name": "Slessor G.", "AuthorID": "22235510900", "AffiliationID": "60015875", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, College of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Aberdeen"}, "55159269800": {"Name": "Bonny E.J.", "AuthorID": "55159269800", "AffiliationID": "60015875", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, College of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Aberdeen"}, "38361539800": {"Name": "Insch P.M.", "AuthorID": "38361539800", "AffiliationID": "60015875", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, College of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Aberdeen"}, "55159697100": {"Name": "Rokaszewicz A.", "AuthorID": "55159697100", "AffiliationID": "60015875", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, College of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Aberdeen"}, "55607038100": {"Name": "Finnerty A.N.", "AuthorID": "55607038100", "AffiliationID": "60015875", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, College of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Aberdeen"}, "57197137483": {"Name": "Venturini C.", "AuthorID": "57197137483", "AffiliationID": "60000481", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, University of Padova"}}}
