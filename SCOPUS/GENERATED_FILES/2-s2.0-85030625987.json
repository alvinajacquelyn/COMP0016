Licensee MDPI.Background: There is increasing evidence that marine omega-3 oils are involved in the reduction of cancer risk and progression. However, the anticancer effect of omega-3 monoglyceride on colorectal cancer has yet to be assessed. The goal of this study was to evaluate the anti-cancer effects of eicosapentaenoic acid monoglyceride (MAG-EPA) in HCT116 colorectal carcinoma cells. Methods: The effect of MAG-EPA was evaluated in vitro on HCT116 cells and in vivo on mouse model of HCT116 xenograft. Results: Our data reveal that MAG-EPA decreased cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in HCT116 cells. In a xenograft mouse model, daily per os administration of MAG-EPA reduced tumor growth. Furthermore, MAG-EPA treatments decreased EGFR, VEGFR, and AKT activation pathways and reduced VEGF and HIF1\u03b1 expression levels in tumors. Conclusion: MAG-EPA may promote apoptosis and inhibit growth of tumors by suppressing EGFR and VEGFR activation pathways. Altogether, these data provide new evidence regarding the mode of action of MAG-EPA in colorectal cancer cells.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Apoptosis", "Colorectal carcinoma", "EGFR", "EPA", "HIF1\u03b1", "VEGF"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adenocarcinoma", "Animals", "Antineoplastic Agents", "Aquatic Organisms", "Cell Proliferation", "Colorectal Neoplasms", "Eicosapentaenoic Acid", "Female", "HCT116 Cells", "Humans", "Inhibitory Concentration 50", "Mice", "Mice, Nude", "Monoglycerides"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85030625987", "SubjectAreas": [["Drug Discovery", "PHAR", "3002"]], "AuthorData": {"35985776100": {"Name": "Morin C.", "AuthorID": "35985776100", "AffiliationID": "112639382", "AffiliationName": "SCF Pharma"}, "49561277900": {"Name": "Fortin S.", "AuthorID": "49561277900", "AffiliationID": "60004026", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biology, Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Rimouski"}, "57195501960": {"Name": "Rodr\u00edguez E.", "AuthorID": "57195501960", "AffiliationID": "60004026", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biology, Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Rimouski"}, "7102313720": {"Name": "Blier P.U.", "AuthorID": "7102313720", "AffiliationID": "60004026", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biology, Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Rimouski"}}}
