Cognitive reserve is difficult to quantify experimentally and studies rely largely on the use of proxy measures such as premorbid IQ, education and occupation. Nevertheless, powerful longitudinal study designs suggest that premorbid IQ modifies the neurodevelopmental process in schizophrenia and modulates the impact of neurodegeneration in dementia. Evidence from intelligence research suggests that dysfunction of a fronto-parietal network has explanatory power for the effect of cognitive reserve in both disorders.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84935916334", "SubjectAreas": [["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"], ["Behavioral Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2802"]], "AuthorData": {"56581079800": {"Name": "Watson A.", "AuthorID": "56581079800", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Sobell Department of Motor Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "7006398244": {"Name": "Joyce E.", "AuthorID": "7006398244", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Sobell Department of Motor Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology"}}}
