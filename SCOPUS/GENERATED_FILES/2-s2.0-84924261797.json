Karger AG, Basel.Background: Senile plaques in Alzheimer's disease (AD) are composed of amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2), especially N-truncated forms including A\u03b24-42. These are thought to be neurotoxic. However, individuals may live for decades with biomarker evidence of cerebral \u03b2-Amyloidosis (positive amyloid PET imaging and/or low cerebrospinal fluid levels of the 42 amino acid form of A\u03b2) without cognitive impairment. This condition may be termed pathological ageing (PA). Objective: To investigate whether there is a difference in the cerebral A\u03b2 fragment pattern in brain specimens from non-demented (PA) and demented (AD) individuals expressing the full neuropathological triad of AD (senile plaques, neurofibrillary tangles and neurodegeneration). Methods: We extracted A\u03b2 using formic acid and hybrid (6E10 and 4G8) immunoprecipitation from fresh-frozen temporal cortex tissue of 6 elderly individuals (mean age \u00b1 SD: 89 \u00b1 3.5 years) with PA and 10 patients with AD (mean age \u00b1 SD: 72 \u00b1 8.5 years). The full spectrum of A\u03b2 peptides was determined by matrix-Assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Results: AD patients had generally more N-terminally truncated and pyroglutamate-modified A\u03b2 than PA patients, whereas PA patients had on average more A\u03b21-40 than AD patients. Conclusion: Senile plaques in AD may have an A\u03b2 fragment composition distinct from PA with more N-terminally and pyroglutamate-modified A\u03b2 peptides that may be linked to neurotoxicity.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alzheimer's disease", "Amyloid precursor protein", "Amyloid-\u03b2", "Brain", "Immunoprecipitation", "Mass spectrometry", "Pathological ageing"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Aging", "Alzheimer Disease", "Amyloid beta-Peptides", "Autopsy", "Biological Markers", "Female", "Humans", "Immunoprecipitation", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Peptide Fragments", "Plaque, Amyloid", "Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization", "Temporal Lobe"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84924261797", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"12806782700": {"Name": "Portelius E.", "AuthorID": "12806782700", "AffiliationID": "60016437", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry and Neurochemistry, Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, University of Gothenburg"}, "56176961600": {"Name": "Westerlund A.", "AuthorID": "56176961600", "AffiliationID": "60016437", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry and Neurochemistry, Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, University of Gothenburg"}, "7006516989": {"Name": "Persson R.", "AuthorID": "7006516989", "AffiliationID": "60016437", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry and Neurochemistry, Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, University of Gothenburg"}, "56415176000": {"Name": "Blennow K.", "AuthorID": "56415176000", "AffiliationID": "60016437", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry and Neurochemistry, Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, University of Gothenburg"}, "6701454676": {"Name": "Zetterberg H.", "AuthorID": "6701454676", "AffiliationID": "60115564", "AffiliationName": "Reta Lila Weston Research Laboratories, Department of Molecular Neuroscience"}, "6602721075": {"Name": "Lashley T.", "AuthorID": "6602721075", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Queen Square Brain Bank"}, "7102381695": {"Name": "Revesz T.", "AuthorID": "7102381695", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Queen Square Brain Bank"}, "7201444328": {"Name": "Fox N.C.", "AuthorID": "7201444328", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dementia Research Centre, UCL Institute of Neurology, University College London"}}}
