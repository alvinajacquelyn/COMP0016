The frequency of the microwave control pulses is chosen to match the qubit transition but this can be detuned from resonance by experimental errors, hyperfine coupling intrinsic to the qubit, or inhomogeneous broadening. The detuning acts as an additional static field which is generally assumed to be completely removed in Hahn echo and DD experiments. Here we demonstrate that this is not the case in the presence of finite pulse-durations, where a detuning can drastically alter the coherence response of the probe qubit, with important implications for sensing applications. Using the electronic spin associated with a nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond as a test qubit system, we analytically and experimentally study the qubit coherence response under CPMG and XY8 dynamical decoupling control schemes in the presence of finite pulse-durations and static detunings. Most striking is the splitting of the NMR resonance under CPMG, whereas under XY8 the amplitude of the NMR signal is modulated. Our work shows that the detuning error must not be neglected when extracting data from quantum sensor coherence traces.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Dynamical decoupling", "Experimental errors", "Hyperfine coupling", "Inhomogeneous broadening", "Microwave control", "Nitrogen-vacancy center", "Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)", "Sensing applications"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85059811523", "SubjectAreas": [["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"]], "AuthorData": {"57014099700": {"Name": "Lang J.E.", "AuthorID": "57014099700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "55950044400": {"Name": "Monteiro T.S.", "AuthorID": "55950044400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "57205377294": {"Name": "Madhavan T.", "AuthorID": "57205377294", "AffiliationID": "60026553", "AffiliationName": "School of Physics, University of Melbourne"}, "36099557800": {"Name": "Tetienne J.P.", "AuthorID": "36099557800", "AffiliationID": "60026553", "AffiliationName": "School of Physics, University of Melbourne"}, "57191622107": {"Name": "Broadway D.A.", "AuthorID": "57191622107", "AffiliationID": "60026553, 60160443", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Quantum Computation and Communication Technology, School of Physics, University of Melbourne"}, "35190313900": {"Name": "Hall L.T.", "AuthorID": "35190313900", "AffiliationID": "60026553", "AffiliationName": "School of Physics, University of Melbourne"}, "56596328800": {"Name": "Stacey A.", "AuthorID": "56596328800", "AffiliationID": "60026553, 60160443", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Quantum Computation and Communication Technology, School of Physics, University of Melbourne"}, "6701356330": {"Name": "Hollenberg L.C.L.", "AuthorID": "6701356330", "AffiliationID": "60026553, 60160443", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Quantum Computation and Communication Technology, School of Physics, University of Melbourne"}, "7003576838": {"Name": "Teraji T.", "AuthorID": "7003576838", "AffiliationID": "60002414", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Materials Science"}}}
