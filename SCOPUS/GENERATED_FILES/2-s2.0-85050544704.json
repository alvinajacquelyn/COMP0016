Influenza-like illnesses (ILI) account for substantial inappropriate antibiotic use; patient understanding and expectations probably play an important role. Aim: This study aimed to investigate what drives patient expectations of antibiotics for ILI and particularly whether AMR awareness, risk preferences (attitudes to taking risks with health) or time preferences (the extent to which people prioritise good health today over good health in the future) play a role. Methods: In 2015, a representative online panel survey of 2,064 adults in the United Kingdom was asked about antibiotic use and effectiveness for ILI. Explanatory variables in multivariable regression included AMR awareness, risk and time preferences and covariates. Results: The tendency not to prioritise immediate gain over later reward was independently strongly associated with greater awareness that antibiotics are inappropriate for ILI. Independently, believing antibiotics were effective for ILI and low AMR awareness significantly predicted reported antibiotic use. However, 272 (39%) of those with low AMR awareness said that the AMR information we provided would lead them to ask a doctor for antibiotics more often, significantly more than would do so less often, and in contrast to those with high AMR awareness (p < 0.0001). Conclusion: Information campaigns to reduce AMR may risk a paradoxical consequence of actually increasing public demand for antibiotics. Public antibiotic stewardship campaigns should be tested on a small scale before wider adoption.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Anti-Bacterial Agents", "Drug Prescriptions", "Drug Resistance, Microbial", "Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice", "Humans", "Patient Preference", "Surveys and Questionnaires"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85050544704", "SubjectAreas": [["Epidemiology", "MEDI", "2713"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"], ["Virology", "IMMU", "2406"]], "AuthorData": {"55481531500": {"Name": "Roope L.S.J.", "AuthorID": "55481531500", "AffiliationID": "60026851, 60172638", "AffiliationName": "The National Institute for Health Research Health Protection Research Unit in Healthcare Associated Infections and Antimicrobial Resistance, University of Oxford"}, "6602314884": {"Name": "Wordsworth S.", "AuthorID": "6602314884", "AffiliationID": "60026851, 60008323, 60172675, 60172638", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health Research Oxford Biomedical Research Centre, John Radcliffe Hospital, University of Oxford"}, "37033113000": {"Name": "Tonkin-Crine S.", "AuthorID": "37033113000", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Nuffield Department of Primary Care Health Sciences, University of Oxford"}, "55814434300": {"Name": "Butler C.C.", "AuthorID": "55814434300", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Nuffield Department of Primary Care Health Sciences, University of Oxford"}, "7102132600": {"Name": "Crook D.", "AuthorID": "7102132600", "AffiliationID": "60170323", "AffiliationName": "Oxford University Hospitals, National Health Service Trust"}, "7005772816": {"Name": "Peto T.", "AuthorID": "7005772816", "AffiliationID": "60170323", "AffiliationName": "Oxford University Hospitals, National Health Service Trust"}, "7403910584": {"Name": "Walker A.S.", "AuthorID": "7403910584", "AffiliationID": "60008936, 60008323, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Nuffield Department of Clinical Medicine, University of Oxford, John Radcliffe Hospital, University of Oxford"}, "9635024500": {"Name": "Peters M.", "AuthorID": "9635024500", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Health Services Research Unit, Nuffield Department of Population Health, University of Oxford"}}}
