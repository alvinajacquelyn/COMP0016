Simulating the evolution of a state, or even storing its description, rapidly becomes intractable for exact classical algorithms. Recently, machine learning techniques, in the form of restricted Boltzmann machines, have been proposed as a way to efficiently represent certain quantum states with applications in state tomography and ground state estimation. Here, we introduce a practically usable deep architecture for representing and sampling from probability distributions of quantum states. Our representation is based on variational auto-encoders, a type of generative model in the form of a neural network. We show that this model is able to learn efficient representations of states that are easy to simulate classically and can compress states that are not classically tractable. Specifically, we consider the learnability of a class of quantum states introduced by Fefferman and Umans. Such states are provably hard to sample for classical computers, but not for quantum ones, under plausible computational complexity assumptions. The good level of compression achieved for hard states suggests these methods can be suitable for characterizing states of the size expected in first generation quantum hardware.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Computational resources", "Deep architectures", "Generative model", "Machine learning techniques", "Many-body quantum systems", "Quantum distribution", "Restricted boltzmann machine", "State tomography"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85055207068", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Science (miscellaneous)", "COMP", "1701"], ["Statistical and Nonlinear Physics", "PHYS", "3109"], ["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"], ["Computational Theory and Mathematics", "COMP", "1703"]], "AuthorData": {"57200687948": {"Name": "Rocchetto A.", "AuthorID": "57200687948", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "57210736883": {"Name": "Grant E.", "AuthorID": "57210736883", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "8984521800": {"Name": "Severini S.", "AuthorID": "8984521800", "AffiliationID": "60025084", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Natural Sciences, Shanghai Jiao Tong University"}, "54919096000": {"Name": "Strelchuk S.", "AuthorID": "54919096000", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "DAMTP, University of Cambridge"}, "35092029300": {"Name": "Carleo G.", "AuthorID": "35092029300", "AffiliationID": "60105360", "AffiliationName": "Center for Computational Quantum Physics, Flatiron Institute"}}}
