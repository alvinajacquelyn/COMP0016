Methods Data in two waves of NHANES (2011\u20132014) were aggregated. Handgrip strength in kilogram (kg) was defined as the maximum value achieved using either hand. Two cognitive function tests were conducted among adults 60 years and older. The Animal Fluency Test (AFT) examines categorical verbal fluency (a component of executive function), and the Digital Symbol Substitution test (DSST) assesses processing speed, sustained attention, and working memory. Survey analysis procedures were used to account for the complex sampling design of the NHANES. Multiple linear regression models were used to estimate associations of handgrip strength with cognitive test scores, adjusting for confounders (age, gender, race/ethnicity, education, marital status, smoking status, depressive symptoms and leisure time physical activity). Results Among 383 cancer survivors (58.5% women, mean age = 70.9 years, mean BMI = 29.3 kg/ m2), prevalent cancer types were breast (22.9%), prostate (16.4%), colon (6.9%) and cervix (6.2%). In women, each increase in kg of handgrip strength was associated with 0.20 (95% CI: 0.08 to 0.33) higher score on AFT and 0.83 (95% CI: 0.30 to 1.35) higher score on DSST. In men, we observed an inverted U-shape association where cognitive function peaked at handgrip strength of 40\u201342 kg. Conclusions Handgrip strength, a modifiable factor, appears to be associated with aspects of cognitive functions in cancer survivors. Prospective studies are needed to address their causal relationship.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Cancer Survivors", "Cognition", "Female", "Hand Strength", "Health Surveys", "Humans", "Male", "Nutrition Surveys"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85048033571", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"57189045362": {"Name": "Yang L.", "AuthorID": "57189045362", "AffiliationID": "60011394", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology, Center for Public Health, Medical University of Vienna"}, "7004238723": {"Name": "Waldh\u00f6r T.", "AuthorID": "7004238723", "AffiliationID": "60011394", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology, Center for Public Health, Medical University of Vienna"}, "57197741912": {"Name": "Koyanagi A.", "AuthorID": "57197741912", "AffiliationID": "60104561, 60001602", "AffiliationName": "Instituto de Salud Carlos III, Centro de Investigaci\u00f3n Biom\u00e9dica en Red de Salud Mental, CIBERSAM"}, "37117793800": {"Name": "Smith L.", "AuthorID": "37117793800", "AffiliationID": "60000913", "AffiliationName": "Cambridge Centre for Sports and Exercise Sciences, Anglia Ruskin University"}, "56612611500": {"Name": "Hu L.", "AuthorID": "56612611500", "AffiliationID": "60003970", "AffiliationName": "Department of Sport Science, Zhejiang University"}, "57206520256": {"Name": "Colditz G.A.", "AuthorID": "57206520256", "AffiliationID": "60022756", "AffiliationName": "Division of Public Health Sciences, Washington University School of Medicine"}, "23490812800": {"Name": "Toriola A.T.", "AuthorID": "23490812800", "AffiliationID": "60022756", "AffiliationName": "Division of Public Health Sciences, Washington University School of Medicine"}, "56371435100": {"Name": "Felipe L\u00f3pez S\u00e1nchez G.", "AuthorID": "56371435100", "AffiliationID": "60000130", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Sports Sciences, University of Murcia"}, "26326634000": {"Name": "Vancampfort D.", "AuthorID": "26326634000", "AffiliationID": "60031069", "AffiliationName": "University Psychiatric Centre Catholic University Leuven"}, "8502496600": {"Name": "Hamer M.", "AuthorID": "8502496600", "AffiliationID": "60000891", "AffiliationName": "School of Sport, Exercise and Health Sciences, Loughborough University"}, "57204891343": {"Name": "Stubbs B.", "AuthorID": "57204891343", "AffiliationID": "60170475, 60000913", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Health, Social Care and Education, Anglia Ruskin University"}}}
