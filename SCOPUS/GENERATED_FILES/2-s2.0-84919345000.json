Design Secondary data analysis comparing ratings of child psychological well-being (Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire, SDQ) in the UK Millennium Cohort Study at 7 years by socioeconomic circumstances (SEC). A number of measures of SEC were tested; results are reported for maternal education. From a sample of 13 168 singletons who participated at the age of 7 years, complete data were available for 8207 children.Results There was a social gradient in SDQ scores reported by parents and teachers, with 'borderline/ abnormal' scores more prevalent in children with lowereducated mothers. However, the gradient was more marked in parent report compared with teacher report, and discrepancies between parent and teacher reports were greatest for children from higher SECs.Conclusions The social gradient in child psychological well-being, although present, was weaker in teacher report compared with parent report. This may be because children behave differently in school and home settings, or parents and teachers demonstrate reporting bias.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Child", "Child Behavior Disorders", "Cohort Studies", "Faculty", "Female", "Great Britain", "Humans", "Longitudinal Studies", "Male", "Mental Disorders", "Parents", "Risk Factors", "Socioeconomic Factors", "Surveys and Questionnaires"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84919345000", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"]], "AuthorData": {"57197348864": {"Name": "Lewis H.", "AuthorID": "57197348864", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Population, Policy and Practice Programme, UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "7005279868": {"Name": "Hope S.", "AuthorID": "7005279868", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Population, Policy and Practice Programme, UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "23397901800": {"Name": "Pearce A.", "AuthorID": "23397901800", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Population, Policy and Practice Programme, UCL Institute of Child Health"}}}
