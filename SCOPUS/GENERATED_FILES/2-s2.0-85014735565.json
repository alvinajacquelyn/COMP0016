Little attention, however, has been given to athletes\u2019 life histories and how these might influence their engagement with the coaching process. The purpose of this paper is to examine how key and cumulative events in Faye\u2019s (all names are pseudonym) life influenced her engagement in distance running and with the coach with whom she worked. The findings highlight that, whilst Faye\u2019s preferences were not entirely stable, she was predisposed towards a specific type of coach, in this instance, Dave. Dave promoted working conditions that encouraged athletes to see their bodies-as-machines, to follow his orders, and not to take short-cuts. Although, on the surface, Faye \u2018bought into\u2019 Dave\u2019s coaching, the dialectical interactions between the established set of working conditions and Faye\u2019s embodiment raise a number of questions pertinent to coaching scholars and practitioners.", "AuthorKeywords": ["athlete embodiment", "distance running", "Habitus", "life history"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85014735565", "SubjectAreas": [["Tourism, Leisure and Hospitality Management", "BUSI", "1409"], ["Business and International Management", "BUSI", "1403"], ["Social Sciences (miscellaneous)", "SOCI", "3301"]], "AuthorData": {"57216154927": {"Name": "Barker E.", "AuthorID": "57216154927", "AffiliationID": "60160138", "AffiliationName": "School of Education and Lifelong Learning, University of East Anglia"}, "55626514600": {"Name": "Bailey J.", "AuthorID": "55626514600", "AffiliationID": "60103682", "AffiliationName": "Cardiff School of Sport, Cardiff Metropolitan University"}}}
