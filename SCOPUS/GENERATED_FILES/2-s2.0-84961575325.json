All rights reserved.This article examines how cancer genetics has emerged as a focus for research and healthcare in Cuba and Brazil. Drawing on ethnographic research undertaken in community genetics clinics and cancer genetics services, the article examines how the knowledge and technologies associated with this novel area of healthcare are translated and put to work by researchers, health professionals, patients and their families in these two contexts. It illuminates the comparative similarities and differences in how cancer genetics is emerging in relation to transnational research priorities, the history and contemporary politics of public health and embodied vulnerability to cancer that reconfigures the scope and meaning of genomics as \u201cpersonalised\u201d medicine.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Biomedicalisation", "Brazil", "Cancer genetics", "Cuba"], "IndexKeywords": ["Biomedical Research", "Brazil", "Cuba", "Diet", "Genomics", "Humans", "Medicalization", "Neoplasms", "Precision Medicine", "Public Health"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84961575325", "SubjectAreas": [["History and Philosophy of Science", "ARTS", "1207"]], "AuthorData": {"14031617000": {"Name": "Gibbon S.", "AuthorID": "14031617000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Medical Anthropology, Anthropology Department, University College London"}}}
