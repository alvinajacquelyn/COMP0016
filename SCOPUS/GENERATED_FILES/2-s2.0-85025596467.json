Studies show that generation of angiotensin-(1-7) by ACE2 and its binding to the Mas receptor (MasR) improves glucose homeostasis, partly by enhancing glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS). Thus, islet ACE2 upregulation is viewed as a desirable therapeutic goal. Here, we show that, although endogenous islet ACE2 expression is sparse, its inhibition abrogates angiotensin-(1-7)-mediated GSIS. However, a more widely expressed islet peptidase, neprilysin, degrades angiotensin-(1-7) into several peptides. In neprilysin-deficient mouse islets, angiotensin-(1-7) and neprilysin-derived degradation products angiotensin-(1-4), angiotensin-(5-7), and angiotensin-(3-4) failed to enhance GSIS. Conversely, angiotensin-(1-2) enhanced GSIS in both neprilysin-deficient and wild-type islets. Rather than mediating this effect via activation of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) MasR, angiotensin-(1-2) was found to signal via another GPCR, namely GPCR family C group 6 member A (GPRC6A). In conclusion, in islets, intact angiotensin-(1-7) is not the primary mediator of beneficial effects ascribed to the ACE2/angiotensin-(1-7)/MasR axis. Our findings warrant caution for the concurrent use of angiotensin-(1-7) compounds and neprilysin inhibitors as therapies for diabetes.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Angiotensin I", "Angiotensins", "Animals", "Glucose", "Insulin", "Insulin-Secreting Cells", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Neprilysin", "Peptide Fragments", "Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A", "Proteolysis", "Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled", "Renin-Angiotensin System", "Signal Transduction"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85025596467", "SubjectAreas": [["Internal Medicine", "MEDI", "2724"], ["Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism", "MEDI", "2712"]], "AuthorData": {"57193672761": {"Name": "Brar G.", "AuthorID": "57193672761", "AffiliationID": "60031866", "AffiliationName": "Veterans Affairs Puget Sound Health Care System"}, "55659313300": {"Name": "Barrow B.", "AuthorID": "55659313300", "AffiliationID": "60031866", "AffiliationName": "Veterans Affairs Puget Sound Health Care System"}, "57195126170": {"Name": "Choung E.", "AuthorID": "57195126170", "AffiliationID": "60031866", "AffiliationName": "Veterans Affairs Puget Sound Health Care System"}, "8604937900": {"Name": "Zraika S.", "AuthorID": "8604937900", "AffiliationID": "60015481", "AffiliationName": "Division of Metabolism, Endocrinology and Nutrition, Department of Medicine, University of Washington"}, "56277144400": {"Name": "Watson M.", "AuthorID": "56277144400", "AffiliationID": "60026415", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Stony Brook University"}, "7006500064": {"Name": "Raleigh D.", "AuthorID": "7006500064", "AffiliationID": "60026415", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Stony Brook University"}, "57195138216": {"Name": "Griesbach R.", "AuthorID": "57195138216", "AffiliationID": "60015481", "AffiliationName": "Division of Metabolism, Endocrinology and Nutrition, Department of Medicine, University of Washington"}, "57210477522": {"Name": "Welch A.", "AuthorID": "57210477522", "AffiliationID": "60015481", "AffiliationName": "Division of Metabolism, Endocrinology and Nutrition, Department of Medicine, University of Washington"}, "6602952513": {"Name": "Ruzsicska B.", "AuthorID": "6602952513", "AffiliationID": "60026415", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Chemical Biology and Drug Discovery, Stony Brook University"}}}
