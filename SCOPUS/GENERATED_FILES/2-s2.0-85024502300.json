Chemotherapy that substantially suppresses free light chain production is associated with improved patient survival, but its benefit in delaying the onset of renal replacement therapy among patients who present with established advanced CKD has not been studied. To evaluate this, we studied 1000 patients enrolled in the prospective UK AL amyloidosis chemotherapy study (ALchemy). Of these, 84 patients had advanced amyloid-related CKD defined by an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) under 20 ml/min/1.73 m2. We determined outcomes among these 84 patients, who had a median eGFR of 10 ml/min/1.73 m2, in relation to response to chemotherapy evaluated at three, six, and 12 months from baseline. Patients who achieved suppression of 90% or more in their amyloidogenic free light chain (dFLC) within three months of baseline had significantly better overall survival, prolonged time to dialysis, and prolonged time to the composite endpoint of \u2018death or dialysis\u2019 compared to those who achieved lesser degrees of clonal response at the same time point. Even when this target of greater than 90% dFLC response was achieved but was delayed beyond 3 months, it was associated with worse outcomes. Cox regression analyses confirmed that a 90% or better dFLC response within 3 months was the only significant independent predictor of all three of these outcome measures. Thus, renal survival among patients with systemic immunologic light chain amyloidosis who present with advanced CKD is strongly dependent upon the magnitude and speed with which the underlying hematologic disorder is suppressed by chemotherapy.", "AuthorKeywords": ["amyloid", "amyloidosis", "chemotherapy", "chronic kidney disease"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Amyloid", "Biopsy", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Glomerular Filtration Rate", "Humans", "Immunoglobulin Light Chains", "Immunoglobulin Light-chain Amyloidosis", "Immunosuppressive Agents", "Kaplan-Meier Estimate", "Kidney", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Prospective Studies", "Renal Dialysis", "Renal Insufficiency, Chronic"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85024502300", "SubjectAreas": [["Nephrology", "MEDI", "2727"]], "AuthorData": {"55985701600": {"Name": "Rezk T.", "AuthorID": "55985701600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Centre for Nephrology, Division of Medicine, University College London"}, "7004915734": {"Name": "Lachmann H.J.", "AuthorID": "7004915734", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "National Amyloidosis Centre, University College London"}, "16306839900": {"Name": "Fontana M.", "AuthorID": "16306839900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "National Amyloidosis Centre, University College London"}, "55621355900": {"Name": "Sachchithanantham S.", "AuthorID": "55621355900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "National Amyloidosis Centre, University College London"}, "50361564300": {"Name": "Mahmood S.", "AuthorID": "50361564300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "National Amyloidosis Centre, University College London"}, "36647033100": {"Name": "Whelan C.J.", "AuthorID": "36647033100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "National Amyloidosis Centre, University College London"}, "36151178100": {"Name": "Pinney J.H.", "AuthorID": "36151178100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "National Amyloidosis Centre, University College London"}, "55215439900": {"Name": "Foard D.", "AuthorID": "55215439900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "National Amyloidosis Centre, University College London"}, "41861760800": {"Name": "Lane T.", "AuthorID": "41861760800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "National Amyloidosis Centre, University College London"}, "16481538400": {"Name": "Youngstein T.", "AuthorID": "16481538400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "National Amyloidosis Centre, University College London"}, "6506002568": {"Name": "Wechalekar A.D.", "AuthorID": "6506002568", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "National Amyloidosis Centre, University College London"}, "35464959200": {"Name": "Hawkins P.N.", "AuthorID": "35464959200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "National Amyloidosis Centre, University College London"}, "7003539031": {"Name": "Gillmore J.D.", "AuthorID": "7003539031", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "National Amyloidosis Centre, University College London"}, "57220463444": {"Name": "Bass P.", "AuthorID": "57220463444", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Centre for Nephrology, Division of Medicine, University College London"}, "35974110300": {"Name": "Petrie A.", "AuthorID": "35974110300", "AffiliationID": "60013985, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Eastman Dental Institute, University College London"}}}
