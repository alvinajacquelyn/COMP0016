Understanding classrooms as constituted by complex power struggles for voice, authenticity and recognition, the paper offers an in-depth exploration of a particular dominant performance of science that was enacted across classes by some students\u2014and which curtailed the possibilities for other students in terms of who can, and cannot, be intelligible in school science. Analysing data from 9 months of observations conducted with nine teachers and c. 200 students aged 11\u201315 from six London schools and 13 discussion groups with 59 of these students, a dominant performance was identified across the classrooms of \u2018talking science through muscular intellect\u2019. This was predominantly enacted by a small group of working-class boys from a range of ethnic backgrounds and was generally recognised as an authentic and legitimate performance of science by both teachers and other students. These performances comprised three main elements: competition; dominating and controlling class science talk; and policing the science talk of others. However, such performances were experienced ambiguously by teachers and were viewed negatively by Other students, notably girls and \u2018quiet\u2019 boys, due to silencing their contributions and limiting the range of ways that Others might be recognised as intelligible science students. The paper concludes by reflecting on the implications of the dominance of performances of \u2018talking science through muscular intellect\u2019 for students, teachers and social justice approaches to science education.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Discourse", "Gender", "Judith Butler", "Power", "Urban students"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85054545744", "SubjectAreas": [["Cultural Studies", "SOCI", "3316"]], "AuthorData": {"7103359770": {"Name": "Archer L.", "AuthorID": "7103359770", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Education, Practice and Society, UCL Institute of Education, University College London"}, "57192958414": {"Name": "Nomikou E.", "AuthorID": "57192958414", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Education, Practice and Society, UCL Institute of Education, University College London"}, "35325212300": {"Name": "Mau A.", "AuthorID": "35325212300", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Education, Practice and Society, UCL Institute of Education, University College London"}, "57189708174": {"Name": "Godec S.", "AuthorID": "57189708174", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Education, Practice and Society, UCL Institute of Education, University College London"}, "16202360400": {"Name": "DeWitt J.", "AuthorID": "16202360400", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Education, Practice and Society, UCL Institute of Education, University College London"}, "56957721300": {"Name": "King H.", "AuthorID": "56957721300", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "School of Education, Communication and Society, King\u2019s College London"}, "36637036800": {"Name": "Dawson E.", "AuthorID": "36637036800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Science and Technology Studies, University College London"}}}
