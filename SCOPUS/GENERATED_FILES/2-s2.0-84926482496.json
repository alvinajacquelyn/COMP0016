A range of methods for assessing change exist, but it remains unclear which are best to use and under which circumstances. Method: This paper reviews four indices of change [difference scores (DS), crossing clinical threshold (CCT), reliable change index (RCI) and added value scores (AVS)] drawing on outcome data for 9764 young people from child and adolescent mental health services across England. Results: Looking at DS, the t-test for time one to time two scores indicated a significant difference between baseline and follow up scores, with a standardised effect size of d = 0.40. AVS analysis resulted in a smaller effect size of 0.12. Analysis of those crossing the clinical threshold showed 21.2% of cases were classified as recovered, while 5.5% were classified as deteriorated. RCI identified 16.5% of cases as showing reliable improvement and 2.3% of cases as showing reliable deterioration. Across RCI and CCT 80.5% of the pairings were exact (i.e., identified in the same category using each method). Conclusions: Findings indicate that the level of agreement across approaches is at least moderate; however, the estimated extent of change varied to some extent based on the index used. Each index may be appropriate for different contexts: CCT and RCI may be best suited to use for individual case review; whereas DS and AVS may be more appropriate for case-mix adjusted national reporting.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Added value scores", "Child mental health", "Crossing clinical threshold", "Difference scores", "Indices of change", "Reliable change index"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84926482496", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"6701596440": {"Name": "Wolpert M.", "AuthorID": "6701596440", "AffiliationID": "60170329, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Evidence Based Practice Unit (EBPU), UCL and the Anna Freud Centre"}, "55260138800": {"Name": "G\u00f6rzig A.", "AuthorID": "55260138800", "AffiliationID": "60004814", "AffiliationName": "University of West London"}, "41861122100": {"Name": "Deighton J.", "AuthorID": "41861122100", "AffiliationID": "60170329, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Evidence Based Practice Unit (EBPU), UCL and the Anna Freud Centre"}, "8923645900": {"Name": "Fugard A.J.B.", "AuthorID": "8923645900", "AffiliationID": "60170329, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Evidence Based Practice Unit (EBPU), UCL and the Anna Freud Centre"}, "56583391100": {"Name": "Newman R.", "AuthorID": "56583391100", "AffiliationID": "112910442", "AffiliationName": "Child Outcomes Research Consortium (CORC)"}, "7202760757": {"Name": "Ford T.", "AuthorID": "7202760757", "AffiliationID": "60111707", "AffiliationName": "University of Exeter Medical School"}}}
