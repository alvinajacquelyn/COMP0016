Nail-patella syndrome (NPS) is an autosomal dominant disorder that may lead to ESRD caused by mutations in the transcription factor LMX1B. Renal-limited forms of this disease, termed nail-patella-like renal disease (NPLRD), and LMX1B nephropathy have recently been described. We report a large family, from the North East of England, with seven affected members with varying phenotypes of renal disease, ranging from ESRD at 28 years of age to microscopic haematuria and proteinuria and relatively preserved renal function. In this family, there were no extra-renal manifestations to suggest NPS. Genome-wide linkage studies and inheritance by descent (IBD) suggested disease loci on Chromosome 1 and 9. Whole exome sequencing (WES) analysis identified a novel sequence variant (p.R249Q) in the LMX1B gene in each of the three samples submitted, which was confirmed using Sanger sequencing. The variant segregated with the disease in all affected individuals. In silico modelling revealed that R249 is putatively located in close proximity to the DNA phosphoskeleton, supporting a role for this residue in the interaction between the LMX1B homeodomain and its target DNA. WES and analysis of potential target genes, including CD2AP, NPHS2, COL4A3, COL4A4 and COL4A5, did not reveal any co-inherited pathogenic variants. In conclusion, we confirm a novel LMX1B mutation in a large family with an autosomal dominant pattern of nephropathy. This report confirms that LMX1B mutations may cause a glomerulopathy without extra-renal manifestations. A molecular genetic diagnosis of LMX1B nephropathy thus provides a definitive diagnosis, prevents the need for renal biopsies and allows at risk family members to be screened.", "AuthorKeywords": ["end-stage renal disease", "LMX1B", "podocytopathy", "proteinuria", "transcription factor"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84983169929", "SubjectAreas": [["Nephrology", "MEDI", "2727"], ["Transplantation", "MEDI", "2747"]], "AuthorData": {"35483773300": {"Name": "Edwards N.", "AuthorID": "35483773300", "AffiliationID": "60026712, 60006222", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Cell and Molecular Biosciences, Faculty of Medical Sciences, Framlington Place, Newcastle University"}, "55417159200": {"Name": "Rice S.J.", "AuthorID": "55417159200", "AffiliationID": "60026712, 60006222", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Cell and Molecular Biosciences, Faculty of Medical Sciences, Framlington Place, Newcastle University"}, "51863789200": {"Name": "Hynes A.M.", "AuthorID": "51863789200", "AffiliationID": "60026712, 60006222, 60006924", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Genetic Medicine, International Centre for Life, Newcastle University"}, "57215337372": {"Name": "Srivastava S.", "AuthorID": "57215337372", "AffiliationID": "60026712, 60006222, 60006924", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Genetic Medicine, International Centre for Life, Newcastle University"}, "6602252848": {"Name": "Al-Hamed M.", "AuthorID": "6602252848", "AffiliationID": "60026712, 60006222, 60006924", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Genetic Medicine, International Centre for Life, Newcastle University"}, "56488822000": {"Name": "Xu Y.", "AuthorID": "56488822000", "AffiliationID": "60026712, 60006222, 60006924", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Genetic Medicine, International Centre for Life, Newcastle University"}, "55235074500": {"Name": "Santibanez-Koref M.", "AuthorID": "55235074500", "AffiliationID": "60026712, 60006222, 60006924", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Genetic Medicine, International Centre for Life, Newcastle University"}, "7006610761": {"Name": "Sayer J.A.", "AuthorID": "7006610761", "AffiliationID": "60026712, 60006222, 60006924", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Genetic Medicine, International Centre for Life, Newcastle University"}, "7006384827": {"Name": "Thwaites D.T.", "AuthorID": "7006384827", "AffiliationID": "60026712, 60006222", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Cell and Molecular Biosciences, Faculty of Medical Sciences, Framlington Place, Newcastle University"}, "56257605500": {"Name": "Raman S.", "AuthorID": "56257605500", "AffiliationID": "60024240, 60001239", "AffiliationName": "Royal Victoria Infirmary, Newcastle Upon Tyne NHS Hospitals Foundation Trust"}, "7102234282": {"Name": "Moore I.", "AuthorID": "7102234282", "AffiliationID": "60007175", "AffiliationName": "Renal Unit, Sunderland Royal Infirmary"}, "22634019700": {"Name": "Gale D.P.", "AuthorID": "22634019700", "AffiliationID": "60032819, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Centre for Nephrology, Royal Free Hospital"}}}
