Previous studies in humans have relied on QT interval measurements; however, a direct relationship between beat-to-beat variability of APD and arrhythmogenesis in humans has yet to be demonstrated. Objective: This study aimed to explore the beat-to-beat repolarization dynamics in patients with heart failure at the level of ventricular APD. Methods: Forty-three patients with heart failure and implanted cardiac resynchronization therapy \u2013 defibrillator devices were studied. Activation-recovery intervals as a surrogate for APD were recorded from the left ventricular epicardial lead while pacing from the right ventricular lead to maintain a constant cycle length. Results: During a mean follow-up of 23.6\u00b113.6 months, 11 patients sustained ventricular fibrillation/ventricular tachycardia (VT/VF) and received appropriate implantable cardioverter-defibrillator therapies (antitachycardia pacing or shock therapy). Activation-recovery interval variability (ARIV) was significantly greater in patients with subsequent VT/VF than in those without VT/VF (3.55\u00b11.3 ms vs 2.77\u00b11.09 ms; P=.047). Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis (area under the curve 0.71; P=.046) suggested high- and low-risk ARIV groups for VT/VF. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis demonstrated that the time until first appropriate therapy for VT/VF was significantly shorter in the high-risk ARIV group (P=.028). ARIV was a predictor for VT/VF in the multivariate Cox model (hazard ratio 1.623; 95% confidence interval 1.1\u20132.393; P=.015). Conclusion: Increased left ventricular ARIV is associated with an increased risk of VT/VF in patients with heart failure.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Activation-recovery interval", "Beat-to-beat variability", "Cardiac resynchronization therapy \u2013 defibrillator", "Intracardiac electrogram", "Ventricular arrhythmia"], "IndexKeywords": ["Analysis of Variance", "Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy", "Defibrillators, Implantable", "Electrophysiologic Techniques, Cardiac", "Female", "Heart Conduction System", "Heart Failure", "Heart Ventricles", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Risk Factors", "Tachycardia, Ventricular"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85064322714", "SubjectAreas": [["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"], ["Physiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2737"]], "AuthorData": {"57192436471": {"Name": "Porter B.", "AuthorID": "57192436471", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "School of Biomedical Engineering and Imaging Sciences, King's College London"}, "26664065700": {"Name": "Bishop M.J.", "AuthorID": "26664065700", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "School of Biomedical Engineering and Imaging Sciences, King's College London"}, "37107296200": {"Name": "Claridge S.", "AuthorID": "37107296200", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "School of Biomedical Engineering and Imaging Sciences, King's College London"}, "57193110465": {"Name": "Sieniewicz B.J.", "AuthorID": "57193110465", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "School of Biomedical Engineering and Imaging Sciences, King's College London"}, "57194686865": {"Name": "Gould J.", "AuthorID": "57194686865", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "School of Biomedical Engineering and Imaging Sciences, King's College London"}, "57200621668": {"Name": "Sidhu B.", "AuthorID": "57200621668", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "School of Biomedical Engineering and Imaging Sciences, King's College London"}, "55626526700": {"Name": "Chen Z.", "AuthorID": "55626526700", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "School of Biomedical Engineering and Imaging Sciences, King's College London"}, "55768059200": {"Name": "Child N.", "AuthorID": "55768059200", "AffiliationID": "60005518", "AffiliationName": "Guy's and St Thomas\u2019 Hospital"}, "7003724795": {"Name": "Bostock J.", "AuthorID": "7003724795", "AffiliationID": "60005518", "AffiliationName": "Guy's and St Thomas\u2019 Hospital"}, "57217533072": {"Name": "Rinaldi C.A.", "AuthorID": "57217533072", "AffiliationID": "60005518", "AffiliationName": "Guy's and St Thomas\u2019 Hospital"}, "56427485300": {"Name": "Gill J.S.", "AuthorID": "56427485300", "AffiliationID": "60005518", "AffiliationName": "Guy's and St Thomas\u2019 Hospital"}, "56399352800": {"Name": "Van Duijvenboden S.", "AuthorID": "56399352800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "7102037062": {"Name": "Hanson B.", "AuthorID": "7102037062", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "7006677172": {"Name": "Taggart P.", "AuthorID": "7006677172", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiovascular Sciences, University College London"}}}
