Electrophysiological studies have focused on three \u03b17-selective PAMs (A-867744, TBS-516, and TQS) that display similar effects on wild-type \u03b17 nAChRs. In addition to potentiating agonist-evoked responses, all three compounds reduce receptor desensitization and, consequently, are classed as type II PAMs. Despite having similar effects on wild-type receptors, A-867744 was found to have profoundly differing effects on mutated receptors compared with TBS-516 and TQS, a finding that is consistent with previous studies indicating that A-867744 may have a different mechanism of action compare with other \u03b17-selective type II PAMs. Due to evidence that these PAMs bind within the \u03b17 nAChR transmembrane region, we generated and validated new structural models of \u03b17. Importantly, we have corrected a previously identified error in the transmembrane region of the original cryo-electron microscopy Torpedo model; the only pentameric ligand-gated ion channel imaged in a native lipid membrane. Real-space refinement was used to generate closed and open conformations on which the \u03b17 models were based. Consensus docking with an extended series of PAMs with chemical similarity to A-867744, TBS-516, and TQS suggests that all bind to a broadly similar intersubunit transmembrane site. However, differences in the predicted binding of A-867744, compared with TBS-516 and TQS, may help to explain the distinct functional effects of A-867744. Thus, our revised structural models may provide a useful tool for interpreting functional effects of PAMs.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Allosteric Regulation", "alpha7 Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptor", "Amino Acid Sequence", "Animals", "Humans", "Models, Molecular", "Molecular Docking Simulation", "Mutagenesis, Site-Directed", "Naphthalenes", "Nicotinic Agonists", "Protein Binding", "Pyrroles", "Quinolines", "Radioligand Assay", "Sequence Homology, Amino Acid", "Sulfonamides", "Torpedo", "Xenopus"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85041168650", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Medicine", "BIOC", "1313"], ["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"]], "AuthorData": {"57200832162": {"Name": "Newcombe J.", "AuthorID": "57200832162", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, Birkbeck, University of London"}, "7006813758": {"Name": "Sheppard T.D.", "AuthorID": "7006813758", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "55595777100": {"Name": "Chatzidaki A.", "AuthorID": "55595777100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology, University College London"}, "7006347978": {"Name": "Millar N.S.", "AuthorID": "7006347978", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology, University College London"}, "7006421825": {"Name": "Topf M.", "AuthorID": "7006421825", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, Birkbeck, University of London"}}}
