The primary objective is improving the capability of our societies to cope with such events and mitigate their detrimental consequences through an evolved understanding of their nature. Rather than being merely considered as an outcome of low-probability/high-impact processes, cascading events can be associated with the cross-scale accumulation of vulnerability paths constituted by events waiting to happen. In this context, instead of focusing solely on triggering events, it seems important to point out the interactions orienting the escalation of secondary emergencies through vulnerability paths. This special issue integrates those emerging aspects with an operational approach that considers cascades as the complex, non-linear escalation of secondary emergencies. Key topics addressed by the contributions include: cross-domain modelling of interdependent systems; decision support systems; economic impact assessment of critical events; and cascades in the built environment, in social domains, and in applied emergency management. Our conclusions support the work of academia, and of public and private stakeholders, by providing a comprehensive analysis of the topic for the improvement of theory, the assessment of resilience, the formulation of policies for managing crises, and operational planning for emergencies.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cascading disasters", "Climate change", "Critical infrastructure", "Emergency planning", "Impact assessment", "Interconnected risk", "Resilience assessment", "Vulnerability assessment"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85050732545", "SubjectAreas": [["Geotechnical Engineering and Engineering Geology", "EART", "1909"], ["Safety Research", "SOCI", "3311"], ["Geology", "EART", "1907"]], "AuthorData": {"55991538100": {"Name": "Pescaroli G.", "AuthorID": "55991538100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Risk and Disaster Reduction, University College London"}, "7402830661": {"Name": "Alexander D.", "AuthorID": "7402830661", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Risk and Disaster Reduction, University College London"}, "35119245600": {"Name": "Nones M.", "AuthorID": "35119245600", "AffiliationID": "60028218", "AffiliationName": "Research Centre for Constructions - Fluid Dynamics Unit, University of Bologna"}, "23569290700": {"Name": "Galbusera L.", "AuthorID": "23569290700", "AffiliationID": "60103695", "AffiliationName": "European Commission, DG Joint Research Centre (JRC), Directorate E - Space, Security and Migration"}}}
