Siblings of people with MS have an increased risk of both MS and demonstrating asymptomatic changes in keeping with MS. We set out to develop an MS risk score integrating both genetic and environmental risk factors. We used this score to identify siblings at extremes of MS risk and attempted to validate the score using brain MRI. Methods: 78 probands with MS, 121 of their unaffected siblings and 103 healthy controls were studied. Personal history was taken, and serological and genetic analysis using the illumina immunochip was performed. Odds ratios for MS associated with each risk factor were derived from existing literature, and the log values of the odds ratios from each of the risk factors were combined in an additive model to provide an overall score. Scores were initially calculated using log odds ratio from the HLA-DRB1\u22171501 allele only, secondly using data from all MS-associated SNPs identified in the 2011 GWAS. Subjects with extreme risk scores underwent validation studies. MRI was performed on selected individuals. Results: There was a significant difference in the both risk scores between people with MS, their unaffected siblings and healthy controls (p<0.0005). Unaffected siblings had a risk score intermediate to people with MS and controls (p<0.0005). The best performing risk score generated an AUC of 0.82 (95%CI 0.75-0.88). Interpretations: The risk score demonstrates an AUC on the threshold for clinical utility. Our score enables the identification of a high-risk sibling group to inform pre-symptomatic longitudinal studies.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Alleles", "Female", "Gene Frequency", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Genetic Testing", "Genotype", "HLA-DRB1 Chains", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Multiple Sclerosis", "Odds Ratio", "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide", "Risk Factors", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84994031871", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"36093903900": {"Name": "Dobson R.", "AuthorID": "36093903900", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Queen Mary University London, Blizard Institute, Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry"}, "14049256200": {"Name": "Ramagopalan S.", "AuthorID": "14049256200", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Queen Mary University London, Blizard Institute, Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry"}, "55347725200": {"Name": "Topping J.", "AuthorID": "55347725200", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Queen Mary University London, Blizard Institute, Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry"}, "8711451500": {"Name": "Schmierer K.", "AuthorID": "8711451500", "AffiliationID": "60010088, 60159931", "AffiliationName": "Royal London Hospital, Barts Health NHS Trust"}, "34770127900": {"Name": "Giovannoni G.", "AuthorID": "34770127900", "AffiliationID": "60010088, 60159931", "AffiliationName": "Royal London Hospital, Barts Health NHS Trust"}, "57214269325": {"Name": "Smith P.", "AuthorID": "57214269325", "AffiliationID": "60010088, 60159931", "AffiliationName": "Royal London Hospital, Barts Health NHS Trust"}, "57193024760": {"Name": "Solanky B.", "AuthorID": "57193024760", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148, 60176027", "AffiliationName": "NMR Research Unit, Queen Square Multiple Sclerosis Centre, University College London (UCL), Institute of Neurology"}, "7004057758": {"Name": "Chard D.", "AuthorID": "7004057758", "AffiliationID": "60024544, 60172638", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health Research (NIHR), University College London Hospitals (UCLH), Biomedical Research Centre"}}}
