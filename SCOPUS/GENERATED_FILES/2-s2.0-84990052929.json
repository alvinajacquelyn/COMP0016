This study compared a biological marker of head trauma in American football athletes with non-contact sport athletes and examined changes over the course of a season. Baseline serum neurofilament light polypeptide (NFL) was measured after 9 weeks of no contact and compared with a non-contact sport. Serum NFL was then measured over the course of the entire season at eight time-points coincident with expected changes in likelihood of increased head impacts. Data were compared between starters (n = 11) and non-starters (n = 9). Compared with non-starters (mean \u00b1 standard deviation) (7.30 \u00b1 3.57 pg\u2022mL-1) and controls (6.75 \u00b1 1.68 pg\u2022mL-1), serum NFL in starters (8.45 \u00b1 5.90 pg\u2022mL-1) was higher at baseline (mean difference; \u00b190% confidence interval) (1.69; \u00b1 1.96 pg\u2022mL-1 and 1.15; \u00b1 1.4 pg\u2022mL-1, respectively). Over the course of the season, an increase (effect size [ES] = 1.8; p < 0.001) was observed post-camp relative to baseline (1.52 \u00b1 1.18 pg\u2022mL-1), which remained elevated until conference play, when a second increase was observed (ES = 2.6; p = 0.008) over baseline (4.82 \u00b1 2.64 pg\u2022mL-1). A lack of change in non-starters resulted in substantial differences between starters and non-starters over the course of the season. These data suggest that a season of collegiate American football is associated with elevations in serum NFL, which is indicative of axonal injury, as a result of head impacts.", "AuthorKeywords": ["adult brain injury", "axonal injury", "biomarkers", "head trauma", "traumatic brain injury"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84990052929", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"53868293200": {"Name": "Oliver J.M.", "AuthorID": "53868293200", "AffiliationID": "60019424", "AffiliationName": "Texas Christian University, Sports Concussion Research Group, Department of Kinesiology"}, "57189329844": {"Name": "Kirk K.M.", "AuthorID": "57189329844", "AffiliationID": "60032357", "AffiliationName": "Department of Sport Medicine, John Peter Smith Hospital"}, "57057421300": {"Name": "Gable D.A.", "AuthorID": "57057421300", "AffiliationID": "60019424", "AffiliationName": "Department of Sport Medicine, Texas Christian University"}, "57057713100": {"Name": "Repshas J.T.", "AuthorID": "57057713100", "AffiliationID": "60019424", "AffiliationName": "Texas Christian University, Sports Concussion Research Group, Department of Kinesiology"}, "57056871000": {"Name": "Johnson T.A.", "AuthorID": "57056871000", "AffiliationID": "60019424", "AffiliationName": "Texas Christian University, Sports Concussion Research Group, Department of Kinesiology"}, "7501849515": {"Name": "Jones M.T.", "AuthorID": "7501849515", "AffiliationID": "60021890", "AffiliationName": "Division of Health and Human Performance, George Mason University"}, "6507640983": {"Name": "Norgren N.", "AuthorID": "6507640983", "AffiliationID": "60112896", "AffiliationName": "UmanDiagnostics"}, "6507790467": {"Name": "Andr\u00e9asson U.", "AuthorID": "6507790467", "AffiliationID": "60027675, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Neurochemistry Laboratory, Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, Sahlgrenska Academy at University of Gothenburg"}, "56415176000": {"Name": "Blennow K.", "AuthorID": "56415176000", "AffiliationID": "60027675, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Neurochemistry Laboratory, Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, Sahlgrenska Academy at University of Gothenburg"}, "6701454676": {"Name": "Zetterberg H.", "AuthorID": "6701454676", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, University College London, Institute of Neurology"}}}
