Three human WNV infections had been diagnosed during the past decade in Austria. The Austrian Red Cross Blood Service (ARC-BS) started a first voluntary screening for WNV in blood donors from Eastern Austria by Nucleic Acid Testing (NAT) in June 2014. This is also the most extensive WNV surveillance programme in humans in Austria so far. In August 2014, one autochthonous WNV infection was detected in a blood donor from Vienna. By now, one in 67,800 whole blood donations was found to be positive for WNV RNA.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Austria", "Blood donor", "Full-length genome", "Phylogeny", "West Nile virus"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Austria", "Blood Donors", "Female", "Genome, Viral", "Humans", "Mass Screening", "Nucleic Acid Amplification Techniques", "Phylogeny", "RNA, Viral", "West Nile Fever", "West Nile virus"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84923338691", "SubjectAreas": [["Virology", "IMMU", "2406"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"16555373200": {"Name": "Jungbauer C.", "AuthorID": "16555373200", "AffiliationID": "112928080", "AffiliationName": "Austrian Red Cross, Blood Service for Vienna, Lower Austria and Burgenland"}, "57213886262": {"Name": "Mayr W.", "AuthorID": "57213886262", "AffiliationID": "112928080", "AffiliationName": "Austrian Red Cross, Blood Service for Vienna, Lower Austria and Burgenland"}, "6507935867": {"Name": "Hourfar M.", "AuthorID": "6507935867", "AffiliationID": "60077790", "AffiliationName": "German Red Cross, Blood Service for Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg-Hessen"}, "7004415608": {"Name": "Stiasny K.", "AuthorID": "7004415608", "AffiliationID": "60011394", "AffiliationName": "Department of Virology, Medical University of Vienna"}, "35607513000": {"Name": "Aberle S.", "AuthorID": "35607513000", "AffiliationID": "60011394", "AffiliationName": "Department of Virology, Medical University of Vienna"}, "16424743500": {"Name": "Cadar D.", "AuthorID": "16424743500", "AffiliationID": "60020135", "AffiliationName": "Bernhard Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine, WHO Collaborating Centre for Arbovirus and Haemorrhagic Fever Reference and Research"}, "17344337000": {"Name": "Schmidt-Chanasit J.", "AuthorID": "17344337000", "AffiliationID": "113939230", "AffiliationName": "German Centre for Infection Research (DZIF), Partner site Hamburg-Luebeck-Borstel"}}}
