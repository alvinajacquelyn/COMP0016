Extant theories have linked identity diffusion to many of the interpersonal problems characteristic of BPD patients. Recent theoretical accounts have suggested that identity diffusion results from problems with mentalizing or reflective functioning, that is, the capacity to understand oneself and others in terms of intentional mental states. In this study we tested these assumptions, i.e., whether identity diffusion plays a mediating role in the relationship between mentalizing difficulties and interpersonal problems, in a sample of 167 BPD patients. Highly significant correlations were found between mentalizing impairments, identity diffusion and interpersonal problems. Mediation analyses showed that identity diffusion fully mediated the relationship between mentalizing difficulties and interpersonal problems. This study provides preliminary evidence that impairments in mentalizing are related to identity diffusion, which in turn is related to interpersonal problems in BPD. Further longitudinal research is needed to further substantiate these conclusions.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Borderline personality disorder", "Identity diffusion", "Interpersonal problems", "Mentalizing", "Reflective functioning"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Borderline Personality Disorder", "Female", "Humans", "Interpersonal Relations", "Male", "Models, Psychological", "Theory of Mind"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85030788302", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"], ["Biological Psychiatry", "NEUR", "2803"]], "AuthorData": {"57194712976": {"Name": "De Meulemeester C.", "AuthorID": "57194712976", "AffiliationID": "60025063", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Psychology and Educational Sciences, KU Leuven"}, "57203069499": {"Name": "Luyten P.", "AuthorID": "57203069499", "AffiliationID": "60025063", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Psychology and Educational Sciences, KU Leuven"}, "6505845650": {"Name": "Lowyck B.", "AuthorID": "6505845650", "AffiliationID": "60025063", "AffiliationName": "University Psychiatric Hospital UPC KU Leuven, Campus Kortenberg and Department of Neurosciences, Faculty of Medicine, KU Leuven"}, "6602364383": {"Name": "Vermote R.", "AuthorID": "6602364383", "AffiliationID": "60025063", "AffiliationName": "University Psychiatric Hospital UPC KU Leuven, Campus Kortenberg and Department of Neurosciences, Faculty of Medicine, KU Leuven"}, "26656442200": {"Name": "Verhaest Y.", "AuthorID": "26656442200", "AffiliationID": "60025063", "AffiliationName": "University Psychiatric Hospital UPC KU Leuven, Campus Kortenberg"}}}
