All rights reserved.Three-dimensional (3D) printing describes a process where the raw material, in a form of powder, liquid or solid filament, is deposited layer-by-layer to build up a physical 3D object. The aim of this chapter is to provide a comprehensive overview of the 3D printing techniques suitable for medical applications. Here we highlight the main innovations and breakthroughs achieved in the past three decades and categorize the additive manufacturing technologies available into resin-, powder-, extrusion-, and droplet-based systems. Additionally, this chapter discusses the recent technological advances and challenges in bioprinting of tissue constructs and organs with a hardware perspective. Bioprinting has been investigated for the fabrication of several biological constructs, ranging from skin, bone, vascular and cartilage tissues, as well as for the fabrication of high-throughput microarrays for toxicological analysis and drug screening. Future development in bioprinting techniques and bioink materials will certainly allow the fabrication of customized tissues and organs.", "AuthorKeywords": ["3D bioprinting", "Droplet-based", "Extrusion-based", "Powder-based", "Resin-based"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85040594014", "SubjectAreas": [["Engineering (all)", "ENGI", "2200"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"57194619702": {"Name": "Provaggi E.", "AuthorID": "57194619702", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "24070966200": {"Name": "Kalaskar D.", "AuthorID": "24070966200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
