All rights reserved.Background:The ABC-02 (Advanced Biliary Tract Cancer) study established cisplatin and gemcitabine (CisGem) as the standard first-line chemotherapy for patients with locally advanced or metastatic biliary tract cancer (BTC). We examine quality of life (QoL), describe the long-Term survivors and provide a long-Term outcome.Methods:A total of 410 BTC patients were randomised to receive either CisGem or gemcitabine alone (Gem); 324 patients consented to complete EORTC QLQ-C30 and EORTC QLQ-PAN26 QoL questionnaires; 268 (83%) patients returned at least one QoL questionnaire (134 in each arm). Long-Term survivors were defined as those surviving over 2 years and we performed a final analysis of the primary outcome; overall survival (OS).Results:Most QoL scales showed a trend favouring the combined CisGem arm, including functional and symptomatic scales, although the differences were not statistically significant. Forty-five (11%)) patients survived at least 2 years (34 received CisGem and 11 Gem) and 21 (5%) 3 years or more (14 received CisGem and 7 Gem). After a median follow-up of 9.2 months and 398 deaths, the median OS was 11.7 months for CisGem and 8.1 months for Gem (hazard ratio (HR)=0.65, 95% CI: 0.53-0.79, P<0.001).Conclusions:The survival advantage of CisGem compared to Gem was not associated with an improvement or deterioration of QoL. Long-Term survivors were more likely to have received CisGem and the long-Term OS is identical to that previously described.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Biliary Tract Neoplasms", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Quality of Life", "Survivors", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84964689505", "SubjectAreas": [["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Cancer Research", "BIOC", "1306"]], "AuthorData": {"7003634798": {"Name": "Bridgewater J.", "AuthorID": "7003634798", "AffiliationID": "60109234, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Cancer Institute, UCL"}, "56719092100": {"Name": "Lopes A.", "AuthorID": "56719092100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL and CRUK Clinical Trials Centre, UCL"}, "8753793600": {"Name": "Palmer D.", "AuthorID": "8753793600", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Translational Medicine, University of Liverpool"}, "36071300500": {"Name": "Cunningham D.", "AuthorID": "36071300500", "AffiliationID": "60011472", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Royal Marsden Hospital"}, "6602973978": {"Name": "Anthoney A.", "AuthorID": "6602973978", "AffiliationID": "60020454", "AffiliationName": "Department of Oncology, St. James's Hospital"}, "6701792215": {"Name": "Maraveyas A.", "AuthorID": "6701792215", "AffiliationID": "60025144", "AffiliationName": "Department of Oncology, Castle Hill Hospital"}, "6602463634": {"Name": "Madhusudan S.", "AuthorID": "6602463634", "AffiliationID": "60025016", "AffiliationName": "Department of Oncology, Nottingham University Hospitals"}, "57200870006": {"Name": "Iveson T.", "AuthorID": "57200870006", "AffiliationID": "60000703", "AffiliationName": "Department of Oncology, Southampton University Hospitals"}, "7101953217": {"Name": "Valle J.", "AuthorID": "7101953217", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "University of Manchester, Manchester"}, "6701461568": {"Name": "Wasan H.", "AuthorID": "6701461568", "AffiliationID": "60020416", "AffiliationName": "Hammersmith Hospital"}}}
