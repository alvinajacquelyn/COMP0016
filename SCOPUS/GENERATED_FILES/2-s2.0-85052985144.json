For instance, accuracy may be improved by processing elements one at a time1\u20134 or over extended periods5\u20138; speed can increase if the internal representation of elements is accelerated9,10. However, little is known about how humans actually approach these challenges because behavioural findings can be accounted for by multiple alternative process models11 and neuroimaging investigations typically rely on haemodynamic signals that change too slowly. Consequently, to uncover the fast neural dynamics that support information integration, we decoded magnetoencephalographic signals that were recorded as human subjects performed a complex decision task. Our findings reveal three sources of individual differences in the temporal structure of the integration process\u2014sequential representation, partial reinstatement and early computation\u2014each having a dissociable effect on how subjects handled problem complexity and temporal constraints. Our findings shed new light on the structure and influence of self-determined neural integration processes.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Brain", "Decision Making", "Female", "Functional Neuroimaging", "Humans", "Magnetoencephalography", "Male", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85052985144", "SubjectAreas": [["Social Psychology", "PSYC", "3207"], ["Experimental and Cognitive Psychology", "PSYC", "3205"], ["Behavioral Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2802"]], "AuthorData": {"23004344800": {"Name": "Eldar E.", "AuthorID": "23004344800", "AffiliationID": "60122566", "AffiliationName": "Max Planck University College London Centre for Computational Psychiatry and Ageing Research"}, "57203805523": {"Name": "Bae G.J.", "AuthorID": "57203805523", "AffiliationID": "60122566", "AffiliationName": "Max Planck University College London Centre for Computational Psychiatry and Ageing Research"}, "21833994400": {"Name": "Kurth-Nelson Z.", "AuthorID": "21833994400", "AffiliationID": "60122566", "AffiliationName": "Max Planck University College London Centre for Computational Psychiatry and Ageing Research"}, "55027467100": {"Name": "Dolan R.J.", "AuthorID": "55027467100", "AffiliationID": "60122566", "AffiliationName": "Max Planck University College London Centre for Computational Psychiatry and Ageing Research"}, "7006914663": {"Name": "Dayan P.", "AuthorID": "7006914663", "AffiliationID": "60084280, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit, University College London"}}}
