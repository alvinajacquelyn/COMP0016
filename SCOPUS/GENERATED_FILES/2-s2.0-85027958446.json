These rules are diligently studied and applied to driving situations by human drivers who have read Highway Traffic driving manuals (road marking interpretation). An autonomous vehicle must however be taught to read the road, as a human might. This paper addresses the problem of automatically reading the rules encoded in road markings, by classifying them into seven distinct classes: single boundary, double boundary, separator, zig-zag, intersection, boxed junction and special lane. Our method employs a unique set of geometric feature functions within a probabilistic RUSBoost and Conditional Random Field (CRF) classification framework. This allows us to jointly classify extracted road markings. Furthermore, we infer the semantics of road scenes (pedestrian approaches and no drive regions) based on marking classification results. Finally, our algorithms are evaluated on a large real-life ground truth annotated dataset from our vehicle.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Road marking classification", "scene interpretation", "scene understanding", "Situational awareness"], "IndexKeywords": ["Classification and interpretation", "Classification framework", "Classification results", "Conditional random field", "Road marking", "Scene interpretation", "Scene understanding", "Situational awareness"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85027958446", "SubjectAreas": [["Automotive Engineering", "ENGI", "2203"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"]], "AuthorData": {"55531448000": {"Name": "Mathibela B.", "AuthorID": "55531448000", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Mobile Robotics Group, Department of Engineering Science, University of Oxford"}, "7202400228": {"Name": "Newman P.", "AuthorID": "7202400228", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Mobile Robotics Group, Department of Engineering Science, University of Oxford"}, "23010022000": {"Name": "Posner I.", "AuthorID": "23010022000", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Mobile Robotics Group, Department of Engineering Science, University of Oxford"}}}
