Outputs from a transmission dynamic model of NCNGU in a population of 16\u201330 year olds in England simulating the number of consultations, PID cases and patients treated over time amongst others, were used along with secondary data to undertake a cost-effectiveness analysis carried out from a health care provider perspective. The main outcome measure was cost per case of PID averted. A secondary outcome measure was cost per major outcome averted, where a major outcome is a case of symptomatic PID, ectopic pregnancy, or infertility. Offering a limited number of asymptomatic men urethral microscopy was more effective than the current practice of no microscopy in terms of reducing the number of cases of PID with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of \u00a315,700, meaning that an investment of \u00a315,800 is required to avert one case of PID. For major outcomes averted, offering some asymptomatic men urethral microscopy was again found to be more effective than no microscopy, but here an investment of \u00a349,900 is required to avert one major outcome. Testing asymptomatic men for NCNGU in a small number of genitourinary medicine settings in England is not cost-effective, and thus by maintaining the current practice of not offering this patient group microscopy, this continues to make savings for the health care provider.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Men", "Non-gonococcal urethritis", "Urethritis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Asymptomatic Infections", "Cost-Benefit Analysis", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Microscopy", "Mycoplasma genitalium", "Mycoplasma Infections", "Pelvic Inflammatory Disease", "Sexual Partners", "Urethritis"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85042463321", "SubjectAreas": [["Dermatology", "MEDI", "2708"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"56001807000": {"Name": "Sutton A.J.", "AuthorID": "56001807000", "AffiliationID": "119102759", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Diagnostic Evidence Co-operative Leeds"}, "55606369800": {"Name": "Roberts T.E.", "AuthorID": "55606369800", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "Health Economics Unit, University of Birmingham"}, "56005942400": {"Name": "Jackson L.", "AuthorID": "56005942400", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "Health Economics Unit, University of Birmingham"}, "25959731200": {"Name": "Saunders J.", "AuthorID": "25959731200", "AffiliationID": "60159931", "AffiliationName": "Barts Health NHS Trust"}, "57205874518": {"Name": "Estcourt C.", "AuthorID": "57205874518", "AffiliationID": "60159931", "AffiliationName": "Barts Health NHS Trust"}, "8677587200": {"Name": "White P.J.", "AuthorID": "8677587200", "AffiliationID": "60000733, 60111140", "AffiliationName": "Modelling and Economics Unit, Centre for Infectious Disease Surveillance and Control, Public Health England"}, "14027791500": {"Name": "Birger R.", "AuthorID": "14027791500", "AffiliationID": "60003269", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, Princeton University"}}}
