Examining conservation problems solely from the perspective of the species or habitat that is put under pressure simply leads to a rapidly escalating list of ever-more-difficult problems. Solutions are hard to find, especially solutions that will be effective over longer time periods. In fact, conservation is almost never this straightforward anyway. It is much more complex and usually there are many different winners and losers in different sectors of society, and often over time and in different places as well. No wonder, then, that progress tomeet conservation targets has been so challenging. As the authors in this book show over and over again, the apparent conflicts between people and the environment are better tackled by appreciating that the conflicts are actually between different groups of people. While sometimes the conflicts are very clear, especially to conservationists working on the front line who encounter stakeholders with different perspectives, this is rarely the case, and it is even rarer that the issues can be simply or neatly circumscribed.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": null, "EID": "2-s2.0-84954122645", "SubjectAreas": [["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Environmental Science (all)", "ENVI", "2300"]], "AuthorData": {"7006595259": {"Name": "Mace G.", "AuthorID": "7006595259", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
