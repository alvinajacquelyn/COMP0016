Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.Aim Despite the importance of neonatal skin stimulation, little is known about activation of the newborn human infant brain by sensory stimulation of the skin. We carried out functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to assess the feasibility of measuring brain activation to a range of mechanical stimuli applied to the skin of neonatal infants. Methods We studied 19 term infants with a mean age of 13 days. Brain activation was measured in response to brushing, von Frey hair (vFh) punctate stimulation and, in one case, nontissue damaging pinprick stimulation of the plantar surface of the foot. Initial whole brain analysis was followed by region of interest analysis of specific brain areas. Results Distinct patterns of functional brain activation were evoked by brush and vFh punctate stimulation, which were reduced, but still present, under chloral hydrate sedation. Brain activation increased with increasing stimulus intensity. The feasibility of using pinprick stimulation in fMRI studies was established in one unsedated healthy full-term infant. Conclusion Distinct brain activity patterns can be measured in response to different modalities and intensities of skin sensory stimulation in term infants. This indicates the potential for fMRI studies in exploring tactile and nociceptive processing in the infant brain.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Brain", "Cutaneous stimulation", "Magnetic resonance imaging", "Neonatal", "Pain"], "IndexKeywords": ["Brain", "Chloral Hydrate", "Feasibility Studies", "Female", "Humans", "Hypnotics and Sedatives", "Infant, Newborn", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Nociception", "Physical Stimulation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84921594044", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"]], "AuthorData": {"56390770900": {"Name": "Williams G.", "AuthorID": "56390770900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Department of Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology, University College London"}, "57203193780": {"Name": "Fabrizi L.", "AuthorID": "57203193780", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Department of Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology, University College London"}, "57214265255": {"Name": "Jackson D.", "AuthorID": "57214265255", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Department of Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology, University College London"}, "36057048100": {"Name": "Slater R.", "AuthorID": "36057048100", "AffiliationID": "60002634", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatrics, University of Oxford"}, "7402773525": {"Name": "Fitzgerald M.", "AuthorID": "7402773525", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Department of Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology, University College London"}, "7102666483": {"Name": "Meek J.", "AuthorID": "7102666483", "AffiliationID": "60084905, 60027403", "AffiliationName": "Elizabeth Garrett Anderson Obstetric Wing, University College Hospital"}, "7102941268": {"Name": "Robertson N.", "AuthorID": "7102941268", "AffiliationID": "60084905, 60027403", "AffiliationName": "Elizabeth Garrett Anderson Obstetric Wing, University College Hospital"}, "57191026623": {"Name": "Tracey I.", "AuthorID": "57191026623", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Nuffield Department of Clinical Neurosciences, Oxford Centre for Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the Brain (FMRIB), University of Oxford"}}}
