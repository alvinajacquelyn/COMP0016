While most of these spatial classification systems include a plethora of socioeconomic attributes, there is arguablylitt le to no input regarding attributes of the built environment or physical space, and their relationship to socioeconomic profi les within this context has not been evaluated in any systematic way. This research explores the generation of neighbourhood characteristics and other attributes using a geographic data science approach, taking advantage of the increasing availability of such spatial data from open data sources. We adopt a SOM (Self-Organizing Maps) methodology to create a classification of Multidimensional Open Data Urban Morphology (MODUM) and test the extent to which this output systematically follows conventional socioeconomic profiles. Such an analysis can also provide a simplified structure of the physical properties of geographic space that can be further used as input to more complex socioeconomic models.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84991207023", "SubjectAreas": [["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"], ["Urban Studies", "SOCI", "3322"]], "AuthorData": {"57191514005": {"Name": "Alexiou A.", "AuthorID": "57191514005", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "25723810200": {"Name": "Singleton A.", "AuthorID": "25723810200", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "7003966507": {"Name": "Longley P.", "AuthorID": "7003966507", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
