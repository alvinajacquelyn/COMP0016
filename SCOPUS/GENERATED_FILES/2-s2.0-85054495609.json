We explore and analyse the key EU education policy documents that refer to immigrants to identify the forms of citizenship attributed to various types of incomers by the EU. Our analysis demonstrates that the EU\u2019s conception of refugee-migrants is more closely affiliated with the notion of \u2018Global citizens\u2019 rather than with that of \u2018European citizens\u2019. Furthermore, we suggest that the EU distinguishes and navigates between various migratory flows, namely internal-European, desired external-European and undesired external-European (refugee-migrants), each associated with a distinctive conception of citizenship as well as with related policy discourses. In the light of the migratory flows into Europe, the particularistic conceptions of citizenship shaping the EU\u2019s educational policy carry considerable implications for the future integration of refugee-migrants in Europe.", "AuthorKeywords": ["discourse analysis", "EU", "global citizenship", "humanitarian crisis", "refugees"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85054495609", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"]], "AuthorData": {"56568323300": {"Name": "Dvir Y.", "AuthorID": "56568323300", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Education, University College London"}, "7402150308": {"Name": "Morris P.", "AuthorID": "7402150308", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Education, University College London"}, "8667142200": {"Name": "Yemini M.", "AuthorID": "8667142200", "AffiliationID": "60005681", "AffiliationName": "School of Education, Tel Aviv University, Ramat Aviv"}}}
