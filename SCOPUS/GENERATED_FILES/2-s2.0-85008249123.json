Few studies have been done to examine predictors of relapse and readmission after contact with CRTs. Methods We used the Clinical Record Interactive Search to identify all patients receiving care from CRTs in two National Health Service (NHS) mental health trusts in London: Camden and Islington NHS Foundation Trust and South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust. We used Cox regression models to examine rates and predictors of admission to acute mental health services within 1 year of contact with CRTs. Sex, age, ethnicity, marital status, social deprivation, severity of psychopathology, duration of index CRT episode, first contact with services, and diagnosis were extracted and examined as predictors of admission. Findings Between Jan 1, 2008, and Aug 31, 2014, 17 666 patients were treated by CRTs\u20148759 patients in the Camden and Islington trust and 8907 patients in the South London and Maudsley trust. 53\u00b79 patients per 100 person-years (95% CI 52\u00b71\u201355\u00b78) in Camden and Islington and 51\u00b73 patients per 100 person-years (95% CI 49\u00b76\u201353\u00b71) in South London and Maudsley were admitted to acute services within 1 year of seeing the CRT. In both cohorts, non-affective psychotic disorders (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 1\u00b725, 95% CI 1\u00b709\u20131\u00b744 in Camden and Islington; 1\u00b727, 1\u00b717\u20131\u00b738 in South London and Maudsley) and age older than 65 years (1\u00b718, 1\u00b701\u20131\u00b737 in Camden and Islington; 1\u00b732, 1\u00b712\u20131\u00b756 in South London and Maudsley) were associated with increased risk of admission, whereas first contact with services (0\u00b757, 0\u00b752\u20130\u00b762 in Camden and Islington; 0\u00b769, 0\u00b763\u20130\u00b775 in South London and Maudsley), anxiety disorders (0\u00b781, 0\u00b769\u20130\u00b796 in Camden and Islington; 0\u00b777, 0\u00b767\u20130\u00b787 in South London and Maudsley), and longer index CRT episodes (adjusted HR per day 0\u00b7996, 0\u00b7994\u20130\u00b7998 in Camden and Islington; 0\u00b7989, 0\u00b7987\u20130\u00b7991 in South London and Maudsley) were associated with reduced risk of admission. Interpretation Past use of mental health services and a diagnosis of non-affective psychosis, which are markers of severity of mental illness, and older age, which is a marker of chronicity, are all risk factors for future relapse after interactions with CRTs. These findings might help clinicians and policy makers to offer more targeted and cost-effective services to reduce relapse rates.
