Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.The debate on low-carbon heat in Europe has become focused on a narrow range of technological options and has largely neglected hydrogen and fuel cell technologies, despite these receiving strong support towards commercialisation in Asia. This review examines the potential benefits of these technologies across different markets, particularly the current state of development and performance of fuel cell micro-CHP. Fuel cells offer some important benefits over other low-carbon heating technologies, and steady cost reductions through innovation are bringing fuel cells close to commercialisation in several countries. Moreover, fuel cells offer wider energy system benefits for high-latitude countries with peak electricity demands in winter. Hydrogen is a zero-carbon alternative to natural gas, which could be particularly valuable for those countries with extensive natural gas distribution networks, but many national energy system models examine neither hydrogen nor fuel cells for heating. There is a need to include hydrogen and fuel cell heating technologies in future scenario analyses, and for policymakers to take into account the full value of the potential contribution of hydrogen and fuel cells to low-carbon energy systems.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Energy policy", "Fuel cell CHP", "Hydrogen heating", "Low-carbon heat", "Systems integration"], "IndexKeywords": ["Energy system model", "Fuel cell technologies", "Gas distribution network", "Low carbon", "Low-carbon energy systems", "Peak electricity demand", "Potential benefits", "Systems integration"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84921386041", "SubjectAreas": [["Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment", "ENER", "2105"], ["Fuel Technology", "ENER", "2103"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Energy Engineering and Power Technology", "ENER", "2102"]], "AuthorData": {"55224736800": {"Name": "Dodds P.E.", "AuthorID": "55224736800", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Energy Institute, University College"}, "56381692300": {"Name": "Li F.", "AuthorID": "56381692300", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Energy Institute, University College"}, "12763822300": {"Name": "McDowall W.", "AuthorID": "12763822300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute for Sustainable Resources, University College London"}, "23101313800": {"Name": "Staffell I.", "AuthorID": "23101313800", "AffiliationID": "60116484, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "Imperial College Business School, Imperial College"}, "13610020900": {"Name": "Hawkes A.D.", "AuthorID": "13610020900", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, Imperial College"}, "12793233300": {"Name": "Gr\u00fcnewald P.", "AuthorID": "12793233300", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, Imperial College"}, "7004909341": {"Name": "Ekins P.", "AuthorID": "7004909341", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute for Sustainable Resources, University College London"}}}
