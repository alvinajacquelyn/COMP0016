Methods: We assessed 327 outpatients (mean age: 45.2 \u00b1 13.4) with depressive or anxiety disorders. Results: Absolute differences in prevalence rates between DSM-5 and DSM-IV AUD ranged from \u22121.1% (subjects with anxiety disorders) to +1.8% (tobacco smokers). The agreement was excellent (k = 0.88), also accounting for specific subgroups (relevant k coefficients >0.80). Discussion and Conclusions: DSM-5 criteria did not inflate AUD rates. Scientific Significance: Our results have epidemiological significance since, unlike previous reports, we found diagnostic stability between new and old AUD criteria in this clinical population.
