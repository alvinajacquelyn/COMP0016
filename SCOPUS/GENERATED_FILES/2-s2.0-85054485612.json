In addition to meticulous supportive care, drug therapy may be appropriate in certain situations. There is, however, considerable variation among individuals regarding what gastric residual volume identifies gastric dysmotility and would encourage use of a promotility drug. While the administration of either metoclopramide or erythromycin is supported by evidence it appears that, dual-drug therapy (erythromycin and metoclopramide) reduces the rate of treatment failure. There is a lack of evidence to guide drug therapy of ileus, but neither erythromycin nor metoclopramide appear to have a role. Several drugs, including ghrelin agonists, highly selective 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor agonists, and opiate antagonists are being studied in clinical trials. Neostigmine, when infused at a relatively slow rate in patients receiving continuous hemodynamic monitoring, may alleviate the need for endoscopic decompression in some patients.", "AuthorKeywords": ["critical illness", "enteral nutrition", "gastrointestinal motility", "gastroparesis", "prescription drugs"], "IndexKeywords": ["Acute Disease", "Critical Illness", "Enteral Nutrition", "Gastrointestinal Agents", "Gastrointestinal Diseases", "Gastrointestinal Motility", "Humans"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85054485612", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (miscellaneous)", "MEDI", "2701"], ["Nutrition and Dietetics", "NURS", "2916"]], "AuthorData": {"57203069120": {"Name": "Deane A.", "AuthorID": "57203069120", "AffiliationID": "60026553, 60005245", "AffiliationName": "Intensive Care Unit, Royal Melbourne Hospital, University of Melbourne"}, "35329221900": {"Name": "Chapman M.", "AuthorID": "35329221900", "AffiliationID": "60031564", "AffiliationName": "Department of Critical Care Services, Royal Adelaide Hospital"}, "37059553400": {"Name": "Reintam Blaser A.", "AuthorID": "37059553400", "AffiliationID": "60033223", "AffiliationName": "Center of Intensive Care Medicine, Lucerne Cantonal Hospital"}, "7005543370": {"Name": "McClave S.", "AuthorID": "7005543370", "AffiliationID": "60020633", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, University of Louisville"}, "7003781894": {"Name": "Emmanuel A.", "AuthorID": "7003781894", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuro-Gastroenterology, University College London"}}}
