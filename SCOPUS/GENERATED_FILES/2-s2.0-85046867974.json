With longer lifespans also comes the need to improve the timeframe and accuracy with which we can diagnose, monitor and treat patients, ensuring longevity of vision contributes to a meaningful quality of life. Current markers used in glaucoma practice are in many cases suboptimal in their ability to accurately identify glaucomatous damage in time to prevent irreversible optic neuropathy. Areas covered: This review summarises the important properties of successful biomarkers and surrogates, and relates this to how intraocular pressure, visual field testing, and imaging have been refined to improve early diagnosis and progression analysis of glaucoma patients. Secondly, we discuss newer concepts in imaging, genetics, and quality of life measures which may provide biomarkers and surrogate endpoints with which to develop novel treatments in the future. Expert commentary: We summarise the key relevant points in glaucoma research, and the current techniques being trialled that are most likely to lead to valuable biomarkers for the future.", "AuthorKeywords": ["biomarkers", "endpoints", "Glaucoma", "neurodegeneration", "surrogate marker"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85046867974", "SubjectAreas": [["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"], ["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"], ["Optometry", "HEAL", "3610"]], "AuthorData": {"57201720193": {"Name": "Yap T.E.", "AuthorID": "57201720193", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "The Imperial College Ophthalmic Research Group (ICORG), Imperial College London"}, "16646771400": {"Name": "Normando E.M.", "AuthorID": "16646771400", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "The Imperial College Ophthalmic Research Group (ICORG), Imperial College London"}, "57210287162": {"Name": "Cordeiro M.F.", "AuthorID": "57210287162", "AffiliationID": "60013148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Visual Neuroscience, Glaucoma and Retinal Neurodegeneration Group, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}}}
