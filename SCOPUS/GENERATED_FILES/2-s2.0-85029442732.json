Developmental Neurobiology Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.The concept of adaptive myelination\u2014myelin plasticity regulated by activity\u2014is an important advance for the field. What signals set up the adaptable pattern in the first place? Here we review work that demonstrates an intrinsic pathway within oligodendrocytes requiring only an axon-shaped substrate to generate multilayered and compacted myelin sheaths of a physiological length. Based on this, we discuss a model we proposed in 2015 which argues that myelination has two phases\u2014intrinsic and then adaptive\u2014which together generate \u201csmart wiring,\u201d in which active axons become more myelinated. This model explains why prior studies have failed to identify a signal necessary for central nervous system myelination and argues that myelination, like synapses, might contribute to learning by the activity-dependent modification of an initially hard-wired pattern. \u00a9 2017 The Authors.
