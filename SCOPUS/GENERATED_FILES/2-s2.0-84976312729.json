Since then, the provincial government in Quebec City and the federal government in Ottawa have had to tread a fine line in accommodating each other\u2019s constitutional rights in the field of international relations\u2014a line that has occasionally been breached, especially in the years following the Quiet Revolution and in critical periods such as those prior to the 1980 and 1995 referenda. Foreign governments have also had to engage in careful diplomacy in order to avoid upsetting either Ottawa or Quebec City\u2014and this has been especially true in the case of the countries historically most involved with Canada and Quebec\u2014France, the United States, and Britain. But whereas there has been some academic writing on Quebec\u2019s relationships with France and the United States, very little attention has been devoted to Quebec\u2013UK relations since the Quiet Revolution. This article seeks to fill that gap and argues that the Quebec\u2013UK relationship since the 1960s can itself best be characterized as a \u201cquiet revolution\u201d in diplomacy that has largely avoided the controversies that have sometimes dogged Quebec\u2019s relations with France and the United States.", "AuthorKeywords": ["monarchy", "paradiplomacy", "patriation", "Quebec", "quiet revolution", "United Kingdom"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84976312729", "SubjectAreas": [["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"], ["Earth-Surface Processes", "EART", "1904"]], "AuthorData": {"41862011600": {"Name": "McCulloch T.", "AuthorID": "41862011600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of the Americas, University College London"}}}
