Materials and Methods: We reviewed the pre-AUS urodynamics of 99 patients with PPI at two tertiary referral centers. We documented the peak DO pressure (Pdet), capacity, and compliance (C). We defined success as patient-reported continence or only using one safety pad. Patients\u2019 perception of improvement was assessed using the PGI-I score. Results: Sixty-eight percent (n = 68) of patients had a successful outcome. The mean compliance for the \u201csuccess\u201d and \u201cfailure\u201d group was 112.3 mL/cmH2O (\u00b1119.7) and 34.1 mL/cmH2O (\u00b136.2), respectively. Fifty-five percent (17/31) of patients in the \u201cfailure\u201d group demonstrated DO(Pdet = 36.2 \u00b1 18.2 cmH2O) compared to 18% (12/68) in the success group. The differences between the two groups in Pdet and compliance were statistically significant (all P < 0.01). There was, however, no statistical difference between the mean cystometric capacities of patients in the two outcome groups. Thirteen out of 18 (72%) patients who had radiotherapy had a poor outcome (\u201csuccess\u201d group only 15% [9/59]). These results were used to develop a nomogram for the probability of AUS success. A good inverse correlation (r = \u22120.65) was demonstrated between the probability of AUS success as deduced from the nomogram and PGI-I score post-AUS implantation. Conclusion: Compliance and Pdet are predictors of outcome following AUS implantation for PPI. We have developed and internally validated a nomogram that may be used to determine an individualized likelihood of AUS success. This nomogram may be used as a counseling tool to objectively set realistic expectations of continence post-AUS implantation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["artificial urinary sphincter", "prostatectomy", "radiotherapy", "urinary incontinence", "urodynamics"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Prostatectomy", "Treatment Outcome", "Urinary Incontinence", "Urinary Sphincter, Artificial", "Urodynamics"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84994708630", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Urology", "MEDI", "2748"]], "AuthorData": {"57190621213": {"Name": "Solomon E.", "AuthorID": "57190621213", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "University College London Hospital"}, "43261497500": {"Name": "Malde S.", "AuthorID": "43261497500", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "University College London Hospital"}, "7004415688": {"Name": "Greenwell T.J.", "AuthorID": "7004415688", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "University College London Hospital"}, "35489481000": {"Name": "Veeratterapillay R.", "AuthorID": "35489481000", "AffiliationID": "60018514", "AffiliationName": "Freeman Hospital"}, "8933960100": {"Name": "Harding C.", "AuthorID": "8933960100", "AffiliationID": "60018514", "AffiliationName": "Freeman Hospital"}}}
