To address this problem, we develop a framework to model the evolution of development indicators as a political economy game on a network. Our approach accounts for the \u2013recently documented\u2013 network of interactions between policy issues, as well as the well-known political economy problem arising from budget assignment. This allows us to infer not only policy priorities, but also the effective use of resources in each policy issue. Using development indicators data from more than 100 countries over 11 years, we show that the country-specific context is a central determinant of the effectiveness of policy priorities. In addition, our model explains well-known aggregate facts about the relationship between corruption and development. Finally, this framework provides a new analytic tool to generate bespoke advice on development strategies.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Agent-based modeling", "Behavioral game", "Development indicators", "Networks", "Public policy", "Sustainable development goals"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85053780329", "SubjectAreas": [["Economics and Econometrics", "ECON", "2002"], ["Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management", "BUSI", "1407"]], "AuthorData": {"55915716200": {"Name": "Casta\u00f1eda G.", "AuthorID": "55915716200", "AffiliationID": "60022321", "AffiliationName": "Economics Division, CIDE"}, "56922327500": {"Name": "Ch\u00e1vez-Ju\u00e1rez F.", "AuthorID": "56922327500", "AffiliationID": "121382494", "AffiliationName": "National Laboratory of Public Policies, CIDE and CONACYT"}, "55511204700": {"Name": "Guerrero O.A.", "AuthorID": "55511204700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Economics and STEaPP, University College London"}}}
