However, large grid sizes are generally needed to capture the phenomena of interest. Here, a novel approach to reduce the computational complexity is presented. The model uses an accelerated k-space pseudospectral method which enables more than one hundred GPUs to be exploited to solve problems with more than 3 \u00d7109 grid points. The classic communication bottleneck of Fourier spectral methods, all-to-all global data exchange, is overcome by the application of domain decomposition using local Fourier basis. Compared to global domain decomposition, for a grid size of 1536 \u00d7 1024 \u00d7 2048, this reduces the simulation time by a factor of 7.5 and the simulation cost by a factor of 3.8.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Domain decomposition", "FFT", "GPU", "Local Fourier basis", "Spectral methods", "Ultrasound simulation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Biological tissues", "Local Fourier basis", "Pseudospectral methods", "Simulation cost", "Simulation time", "Spectral domain decomposition", "Spectral methods", "Ultrasound simulation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85038374051", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Information Systems", "COMP", "1710"], ["Hardware and Architecture", "COMP", "1708"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"], ["Computational Theory and Mathematics", "COMP", "1703"]], "AuthorData": {"13408713400": {"Name": "Jaros J.", "AuthorID": "13408713400", "AffiliationID": "60083321", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Information Technology, Brno University of Technology"}, "57193705731": {"Name": "Vaverka F.", "AuthorID": "57193705731", "AffiliationID": "60083321", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Information Technology, Brno University of Technology"}, "16200175900": {"Name": "Treeby B.", "AuthorID": "16200175900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}}}
