Published by the Royal Society under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License.Ageing is an irreversible cellular decline partly driven by failing mitochondrial integrity. Mitochondria accumulate DNA mutations and reduce ATP production necessary for cellular metabolism. This is associated with inflammation. Near-infrared exposure increases retinal ATP in old mice via cytochrome c oxidase absorption and reduces inflammation. Here, we expose fruitflies daily to 670 nmradiation, revealing elevatedATP and reduced inflammation with age. Critically, therewas a significant increase in average lifespan: 100-175% more flies survived into old age following 670 nm exposure and these had significantly improved mobility. This may be a simple route to extending lifespan and improving function in old age.", "AuthorKeywords": ["ATP", "Fly", "Inflammation", "Lifespan"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adenosine Triphosphate", "Aging", "Animals", "Drosophila melanogaster", "Inflammation", "Infrared Rays", "Locomotion", "Longevity", "Male", "Mitochondria"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84924976051", "SubjectAreas": [["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (miscellaneous)", "AGRI", "1101"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"]], "AuthorData": {"55093471600": {"Name": "Begum R.", "AuthorID": "55093471600", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}, "25622194900": {"Name": "Kam J.H.", "AuthorID": "25622194900", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}, "7006239396": {"Name": "Salt T.E.", "AuthorID": "7006239396", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}, "7004551545": {"Name": "Jeffery G.", "AuthorID": "7004551545", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}, "6507058096": {"Name": "Calaza K.", "AuthorID": "6507058096", "AffiliationID": "60000036, 60001865", "AffiliationName": "Program of Neuroscience, Institute de Biologia, Universidade Federal Fluminense"}, "7004403506": {"Name": "Hogg C.", "AuthorID": "7004403506", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital"}}}
