Rather than suppressing interference as in conventional schemes, we take advantage of constructive interference among users, inherent in the downlink, as a source of both useful information and wireless energy. Specifically, we propose a new precoding design that minimizes the transmit power while guaranteeing the quality of service (QoS) and energy harvesting constraints for generic phase shift keying modulated signals. The QoS constraints are modified to accommodate constructive interference. We derive a sub-optimal solution and a local optimum solution to the precoding optimization problem. The proposed precoding reduces the transmit power compared to conventional schemes, by adapting the constraints to accommodate constructive interference as a source of useful signal power. Our simulation results show significant power savings with the proposed data-aided precoding compared to the conventional precoding.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84953741342", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"16176882900": {"Name": "Zheng G.", "AuthorID": "16176882900", "AffiliationID": "60001359", "AffiliationName": "School of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering, University of Essex"}, "23009493900": {"Name": "Masouros C.", "AuthorID": "23009493900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "6508343836": {"Name": "Krikidis I.", "AuthorID": "6508343836", "AffiliationID": "60071343", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Cyprus"}, "24777010200": {"Name": "Timotheou S.", "AuthorID": "24777010200", "AffiliationID": "60071343", "AffiliationName": "KIOS Research Center for Intelligent Systems and Networks, University of Cyprus"}}}
