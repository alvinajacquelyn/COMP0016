This article articulates an agenda for research focused on better understanding and addressing the health and well-being of emerging adults in or pursuing same-sex romantic relationships. We provide a general summary of what is known about health and well-being in same-sex relationships, followed by an overview of the current and changing social climate surrounding same-sex relationships. We point out how recent historical changes present sexual minority emerging adults with unique relational benefits and challenges that have not been examined within the social and health sciences. We conclude by proposing a set of research questions to help develop knowledge needed to improve the health and well-being of emerging adults in or pursuing same-sex relationships.", "AuthorKeywords": ["gay/lesbian", "health", "intimacy", "life course", "romantic relationships", "sexual identity"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84920973116", "SubjectAreas": [["Experimental and Cognitive Psychology", "PSYC", "3205"], ["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"], ["Life-span and Life-course Studies", "SOCI", "3319"]], "AuthorData": {"12807081700": {"Name": "Frost D.", "AuthorID": "12807081700", "AffiliationID": "60030162", "AffiliationName": "Columbia University"}, "7005740600": {"Name": "Meyer I.", "AuthorID": "7005740600", "AffiliationID": "60027550", "AffiliationName": "University of California"}, "6603119568": {"Name": "Hammack P.", "AuthorID": "6603119568", "AffiliationID": "60024941", "AffiliationName": "University of California"}}}
