The same constructions have also been applied to reason about natural language semantics under the name: \"categorical distributional compositional\" semantics, or in short, the \"DisCoCat\" model. This model combines the statistical vector models of word meaning with the compositional models of grammatical structure. It has been applied to natural language tasks such as disambiguation, paraphrasing and entailment of phrases and sentences. The passage from the grammatical structure to vectors is provided by a functor, similar to the Quantization functor of Quantum Field Theory. The original DisCoCat model only used compact closed categories. Later, Frobenius algebras were added to it to model long distance dependancies such as relative pronouns. Recently, bialgebras have been added to the pack to reason about quantifiers. This paper reviews these constructions and their application to natural language semantics. We go over the theory and present some of the core experimental results.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bialgebras", "Categorical quantum mechanics", "Compact closed categories", "Compositional distributional semantics", "Frobenius algebras", "Natural language processing", "Pregroup grammars", "Quantization functor"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85029663435", "SubjectAreas": [["Biophysics", "BIOC", "1304"], ["Materials Science (miscellaneous)", "MATE", "2501"], ["Mathematical Physics", "MATH", "2610"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"]], "AuthorData": {"24339612000": {"Name": "Sadrzadeh M.", "AuthorID": "24339612000", "AffiliationID": "60022109", "AffiliationName": "Theory Group and Computational Linguistics Lab, School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science, Queen Mary University"}}}
