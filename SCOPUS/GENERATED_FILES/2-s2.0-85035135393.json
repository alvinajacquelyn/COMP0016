We examine two real-world examples from the Ethereum blockchain and analyzing how they are vulnerable to bugs that are closely reminiscent to those that often occur in traditional concurrent programs. We then elaborate on the relation between observable contract behaviors and well-studied concurrency topics, such as atomicity, interference, synchronization, and resource ownership. The described contracts-as-concurrent-objects analogy provides deeper understanding of potential threats for smart contracts, indicate better engineering practices, and enable applications of existing state-of-the-art formal verification techniques.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Classical problems", "Concurrent objects", "Concurrent program", "Engineering practices", "Potential threats", "Resource ownership", "State of the art", "Verification techniques"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85035135393", "SubjectAreas": [["Theoretical Computer Science", "MATH", "2614"], ["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"]], "AuthorData": {"35114020100": {"Name": "Sergey I.", "AuthorID": "35114020100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "24468153800": {"Name": "Hobor A.", "AuthorID": "24468153800", "AffiliationID": "60106365, 60017161", "AffiliationName": "Yale-NUS College and School of Computing, National University of Singapore"}}}
