All Rights Reserved.In this research the Haynesville-Bossier Shale play (USA), which is a clay-bearing siliceous, organic-rich, gas-mature shale play, was characterized over pore diameters ranging 2 nm to 3000 nm. Three advanced imaging techniques were utilized correlatively, including the application of Xe+ plasma focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy (plasma FIB or PFIB), complemented by the Ga+FIB method which is now frequently used to characterise porosity and organic/inorganic phases, together with transmission electron microscope tomography of the nano-scale pores. This is the first study to comprehensively develop pore geometric and network models in 3D based on experimental characterisation over these critical length scales.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Critical length", "Focused ion beam-scanning electron microscopies", "Nano-scale pores", "Network models", "Organic/inorganic", "Pore diameters", "Shale plays", "Transmission electron"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85066469460", "SubjectAreas": [["Geotechnical Engineering and Engineering Geology", "EART", "1909"]], "AuthorData": {"35428783800": {"Name": "Taylor K.", "AuthorID": "35428783800", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "University of Manchester"}, "57203506990": {"Name": "Ma L.", "AuthorID": "57203506990", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "University of Manchester"}, "54881460100": {"Name": "Dowey P.", "AuthorID": "54881460100", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "University of Manchester"}, "57207223439": {"Name": "Lee P.", "AuthorID": "57207223439", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
