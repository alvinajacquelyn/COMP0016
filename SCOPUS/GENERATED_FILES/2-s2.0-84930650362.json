The aim of this study was to examine the trajectories of physical functioning across age groups and whether the trajectories differ according to disease status in different population subgroups. Methods: Repeat data from a nationally representative population sample, the Health and Retirement Study, was used. Participants were 10,709 men and 13,477 women aged 60-107 years at baseline with biennial surveys from 1992 to 2010. Average length of follow-up was 10.3 years ranging from 0 to 18 years. Disease status and physical functioning was asked about at all study phases and 10 items were summed to obtain a physical functioning score (0-10). Results: Age modified the relationship between number of chronic diseases and physical functioning with older participants having more physical functioning difficulties with increasing number of diseases. An average 70-year-old participant with no diseases had 0.89 (95% CI: 0.85-0.93) physical functioning difficulties, with one disease 1.72 (95% CI: 1.69-1.76) difficulties, with two diseases 2.57 (95% CI: 2.52-2.62) difficulties, and with three or more diseases 3.82 (95% CI: 3.76-3.88) difficulties. Of the individual diseases memory-related diseases, stroke, pulmonary diseases, and arthritis were associated with significantly higher physical functioning difficulties compared with other diseases. Conclusions: Comorbidity is associated with greater burden of physical functioning difficulties. Of the studied diseases, memory-related diseases, stroke, pulmonary diseases, and arthritis alone or in combination limit most physical functioning.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Aging", "Comorbidity", "Disability", "Physical functioning"], "IndexKeywords": ["Activities of Daily Living", "Age Factors", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Chronic Disease", "Comorbidity", "Female", "Health Status", "Humans", "Longitudinal Studies", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Retirement", "Socioeconomic Factors", "United States"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84930650362", "SubjectAreas": [["Aging", "BIOC", "1302"], ["Geriatrics and Gerontology", "MEDI", "2717"]], "AuthorData": {"16308130100": {"Name": "Stenholm S.", "AuthorID": "16308130100", "AffiliationID": "60104546", "AffiliationName": "Department of Health, Functional Capacity and Welfare, National Institute for Health and Welfare (THL)"}, "7003922524": {"Name": "Vahtera J.", "AuthorID": "7003922524", "AffiliationID": "60025765", "AffiliationName": "Turku University Hospital"}, "57203071324": {"Name": "Westerlund H.", "AuthorID": "57203071324", "AffiliationID": "60027398, 60028378", "AffiliationName": "Stress Research Institute, Stockholm University"}, "7005382627": {"Name": "Hyde M.", "AuthorID": "7005382627", "AffiliationID": "60027398, 60028378", "AffiliationName": "Stress Research Institute, Stockholm University"}, "7202619429": {"Name": "Head J.", "AuthorID": "7202619429", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "7004391239": {"Name": "Kivim\u00e4ki M.", "AuthorID": "7004391239", "AffiliationID": "60010493", "AffiliationName": "Centre of Expertise for the Development of Work and Organizations, Finnish Institute of Occupational Health"}, "7103096477": {"Name": "Kawachi I.", "AuthorID": "7103096477", "AffiliationID": "60032499", "AffiliationName": "Department of Society, Human Development, and Health, Harvard School of Public Health"}, "7003843149": {"Name": "Pentti J.", "AuthorID": "7003843149", "AffiliationID": "60010493", "AffiliationName": "Centre of Expertise for the Development of Work and Organizations, Finnish Institute of Occupational Health"}}}
