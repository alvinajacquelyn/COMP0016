Engineered partial or total laryngeal replacements would need to match the ambitious specifications of replicating functionality, outer biocompatibility, and permissiveness for an inner mucosal lining. Here we present porous polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane-poly(carbonate urea) urethane (POSS-PCUU) as a potential scaffold for engineering laryngeal tissue. Specifically, we employ a precipitation and porogen leaching technique for manufacturing the polymer. The polymer is chemically consistent across all sample types and produces a foam-like scaffold with two distinct topographies and an internal structure composed of nano- and micro-pores. While the highly porous internal structure of the scaffold contributes to the complex tensile behaviour of the polymer, the surface of the scaffold remains largely non-porous. The low number of pores minimise access for cells, although primary fibroblasts and epithelial cells do attach and proliferate on the polymer surface. Our data show that with a change in manufacturing protocol to produce porous polymer surfaces, POSS-PCUU may be a potential candidate for overcoming some of the limitations associated with laryngeal reconstruction and regeneration.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cell", "Characterisation", "Epithelial cells", "Larynx", "Polymer", "Tissue engineering"], "IndexKeywords": ["Characterisation", "Epithelial cells", "Internal structure", "Laryngeal reconstruction", "Larynx", "Manufacturing protocol", "Polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxanes", "Tensile behaviour", "Animals", "Cells, Cultured", "Epithelial Cells", "Fibroblasts", "Larynx", "Organosilicon Compounds", "Polyurethanes", "Swine", "Tissue Engineering", "Tissue Scaffolds"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85049638083", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Mechanics of Materials", "ENGI", "2211"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"]], "AuthorData": {"36677771600": {"Name": "Mehrban N.", "AuthorID": "36677771600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Surgery, University College London"}, "35733502300": {"Name": "Darbyshire A.", "AuthorID": "35733502300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Surgery, University College London"}, "55574192663": {"Name": "Bowen J.", "AuthorID": "55574192663", "AffiliationID": "60012113", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering and Innovation, The Open University"}, "56779636700": {"Name": "Tait A.", "AuthorID": "56779636700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemical Engineering, University College London"}, "56387646400": {"Name": "Virasami A.K.", "AuthorID": "56387646400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Histopathology, University College London"}, "7003930276": {"Name": "Lowdell M.W.", "AuthorID": "7003930276", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, University College London"}, "7004957785": {"Name": "Birchall M.A.", "AuthorID": "7004957785", "AffiliationID": "60011326, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Ear Institute, University College London"}}}
