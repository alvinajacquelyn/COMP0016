This confounds attempts to use segmentation models to define the likelihood of future rupture scenarios. We attempt to study this problem comparing the offsets produced in single earthquakes with those produced by multiple earthquakes over longer timescales, together with detailed studies of the structural geology. We study the active normal fault system that caused the Mw 6.3 2009 L'Aquila earthquake in central Italy, comparing the spatial distribution of coseismic offsets, cumulative offsets that have developed since 15 \u00b1 3 ka, and the total offsets that have accumulated since the faults initiated at 2\u20133 Ma. Our findings suggest that: 1) faults within a segmented fault system behave as a single interacting fault segment over time periods including multiple earthquake cycles (e.g. 2\u20133 Ma or 15\u00b13ka), with single earthquakes causing either partial or total ruptures of the entire system; 2) an along-strike bend causes throw and throw-rates enhancements within the bend throughout the seismic history of the fault system. We discuss the synchronised and geometrically controlled activity rates on these faults in terms of the propensity for floating earthquakes, multi-fault earthquakes, and seismic hazard.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Active normal faults", "Central Apennines", "L'aquila earthquakes", "Multiple earthquake cycles", "Normal fault system", "Normal faulting", "Segmentation models", "Seismic hazards"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85066267843", "SubjectAreas": [["Geology", "EART", "1907"]], "AuthorData": {"56419852600": {"Name": "Iezzi F.", "AuthorID": "56419852600", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences, Birkbeck, University of London"}, "7403399232": {"Name": "Roberts G.", "AuthorID": "7403399232", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences, Birkbeck, University of London"}, "57209001704": {"Name": "Walker J.F.", "AuthorID": "57209001704", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Risk and Disaster Reduction, University College London"}, "6603943907": {"Name": "Papanikolaou I.", "AuthorID": "6603943907", "AffiliationID": "60018592", "AffiliationName": "Mineralogy-Geology Laboratory, Department of Natural Resources Development and Agricultural Engineering, Agricultural University of Athens"}}}
