Over three decades, IFN-\u03b1 and nucleoside analogs have reduced the morbidity from the disease. A large reservoir of chronic infection remains. The natural history of HBV infection is still being defined. Understanding the interactions between HBV and the host will be fundamental to achieving higher rates of cure. Curing hepatitis B will require several steps for either eradication, or a functional cure in the host. It is unclear whether covently closed circular DNA chromatin would need to be cleared to cure hepatitis B, or whether low threshold levels would slow the disease.", "AuthorKeywords": ["antiviral therapy", "entecavir", "HBsAg", "hepatitis B", "hepatitis B surface antigen", "hepatitis B vaccination", "immunomodulatory therapy", "nucleoside analogs"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84952683858", "SubjectAreas": [["Virology", "IMMU", "2406"]], "AuthorData": {"55597869500": {"Name": "Demma S.", "AuthorID": "55597869500", "AffiliationID": "60010146", "AffiliationName": "Hepatology Unit, Department of Medical and Pediatric Sciences, University of Catania"}, "7006885162": {"Name": "Dusheiko G.", "AuthorID": "7006885162", "AffiliationID": "60170516, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Liver and Digestive Health, Royal Free NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
