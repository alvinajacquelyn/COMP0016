It draws not only from microaggression theory but also from broader frameworks of minority stress theory and studies on everyday discrimination. The chapter provides a framework developed by Michelle Fine and J. Ruglis that calls for interrogating \u201ccircuits of dispossession and resistance\u201d. It illustrates how structures and histories of oppressionaffect groupsof young people; how dispossession in one arena bleeds into other arenas; and how resistance can be mobilized not only within groups but also across groups in solidarity. Queer and trans youth, particularly Youth of Color, report cumulative experiences of state violence, social discrimination, and intimate/stranger microaggressions. They also narrate individual and collective insistence on radical recognition and intersectionality, and they model stunning \u201cconversion\u201d struggles as they morph oppression into varied forms of activism.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Conversion strategies dispossession", "Intersectionality", "Microaggression theory", "Social activism social discrimination", "State violence structural oppression"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85061158010", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychology (all)", "PSYC", "3200"], ["Social Sciences (all)", "SOCI", "3300"]], "AuthorData": {"7202778308": {"Name": "Fine M.", "AuthorID": "7202778308", "AffiliationID": "60032373", "AffiliationName": "The Graduate Center CUNY"}, "7102393367": {"Name": "Torre M.E.", "AuthorID": "7102393367", "AffiliationID": "60032373", "AffiliationName": "The Graduate Center CUNY"}, "57202534558": {"Name": "Cabana A.", "AuthorID": "57202534558", "AffiliationID": "60032373", "AffiliationName": "The Graduate Center CUNY"}, "12807081700": {"Name": "Frost D.", "AuthorID": "12807081700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
