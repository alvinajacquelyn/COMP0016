However, these measurements do not always agree and may represent partly different aspects of the underlying Alzheimer's disease pathology. The goal of this study was therefore to test if cerebrospinal fluid and positron emission tomography amyloid-\u03b2 biomarkers are independently related to other Alzheimer's disease markers, and to examine individuals who are discordantly classified by these two biomarker modalities. Cerebrospinal fluid and positron emission tomography amyloid-\u03b2 were measured at baseline in 769 persons [161 healthy controls, 68 subjective memory complaints, 419 mild cognitive impairment and 121 Alzheimer's disease dementia, mean age 72 years (standard deviation 7 years), 47% females] and used to predict diagnosis, APOE e4 carriage status, cerebral blood flow, cerebrospinal fluid total-tau and phosphorylated-tau levels (cross-sectionally); and hippocampal volume, fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography results and Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale scores (longitudinally). Cerebrospinal fluid and positron emission tomography amyloid-\u03b2 were highly correlated, but adjusting one of these predictors for the other revealed that they both provided partially independent information when predicting diagnosis, APOE e4, hippocampal volume, metabolism, cognition, total-tau and phosphorylated-tau (the 95% confidence intervals of the adjusted effects did not include zero). Cerebrospinal fluid amyloid-\u03b2 was more strongly related to APOE e4 whereas positron emission tomography amyloid-\u03b2 was more strongly related to tau levels (P50.05). Discordance (mainly isolated cerebrospinal fluid amyloid-\u03b2 positivity) differed by diagnostic group (P50.001) and was seen in 21% of cognitively healthy people but only 6% in dementia patients. The finding that cerebrospinal fluid and positron emission tomography amyloid-\u03b2 provide partially independent information about a wide range of Alzheimer's measures supports the theory that these modalities represent partly different aspects of Alzheimer's pathology. The fact that mismatch, with positive cerebrospinal fluid amyloid-\u03b2 but normal positron emission tomography amyloid-\u03b2, is relatively common in cognitively healthy people may be considered when using these biomarkers to identify early stage Alzheimer's disease. Reduced cerebrospinal fluid amyloid-\u03b2 may be more strongly related to early stage Alzheimer's disease, whereas increased positron emission tomography amyloid-\u03b2 may be more strongly related to disease progression.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alzheimer's disease", "Amyloid", "Biomarker", "Cerebrospinal fluid", "Positron emission tomography"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Alzheimer Disease", "Amyloid beta-Peptides", "Aniline Compounds", "Apolipoprotein E4", "Cognition Disorders", "Cohort Studies", "Ethylene Glycols", "Female", "Fluorine Radioisotopes", "Fluorodeoxyglucose F18", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Neuropsychological Tests", "Peptide Fragments", "Positron-Emission Tomography"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84927957367", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"23005631700": {"Name": "Mattsson N.", "AuthorID": "23005631700", "AffiliationID": "60105915", "AffiliationName": "Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Centre, Centre for Imaging of Neurodegenerative Diseases, Building 13"}, "6701454676": {"Name": "Zetterberg H.", "AuthorID": "6701454676", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "56415176000": {"Name": "Blennow K.", "AuthorID": "56415176000", "AffiliationID": "60016437", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Neurochemistry Laboratory, Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, University of Gothenburg"}, "8906027600": {"Name": "Insel P.", "AuthorID": "8906027600", "AffiliationID": "60105915", "AffiliationName": "Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Centre, Centre for Imaging of Neurodegenerative Diseases, Building 13"}, "57203177938": {"Name": "Weiner M.", "AuthorID": "57203177938", "AffiliationID": "60105915", "AffiliationName": "Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Centre, Centre for Imaging of Neurodegenerative Diseases, Building 13"}, "16833592500": {"Name": "Donohue M.", "AuthorID": "16833592500", "AffiliationID": "60030612", "AffiliationName": "Division of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics, Department of Family and Preventive Medicine, University of California"}, "7101777243": {"Name": "Landau S.", "AuthorID": "7101777243", "AffiliationID": "60025038", "AffiliationName": "Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute, School of Public Health, University of California"}, "7006830290": {"Name": "Jagust W.", "AuthorID": "7006830290", "AffiliationID": "60025038", "AffiliationName": "Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute, School of Public Health, University of California"}, "57203176542": {"Name": "Shaw L.", "AuthorID": "57203176542", "AffiliationID": "60003711", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Centre for Neurodegenerative Disease Research, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine"}, "57202554064": {"Name": "Trojanowski J.", "AuthorID": "57202554064", "AffiliationID": "60003711", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Centre for Neurodegenerative Disease Research, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine"}}}
