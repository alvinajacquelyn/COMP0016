The efficacy and safety of catheter ablation in this setting is poorly characterised. We aimed to systematically review the existing literature and to perform a meta-Analysis to determine the efficacy and safety of catheter ablation of AF in patients with HCM. Methods Random-effects meta-Analysis of studies comparing HCM versus non-HCM controls. The outcomes of freedom from AF/atrial tachycardia, and acute procedure-related complications were assessed. Studies were searched on MEDLINE, EMBASE, COCHRANE and clinicaltrials.gov. Results Fourteen studies were considered eligible for the systematic review, of which five were included in the meta-Analysis. Freedom from AF/atrial tachycardia relapse was higher in patients without HCM (after a single procedure: 38.7% HCM vs 49.8% controls, OR=2.25, 95% CI 1.09 to 4.64, p=0.03; after \u22651 procedure: 51.8% HCM vs 71.2% controls, OR=2.62, 95% CI 1.52 to 4.51, p=0.0006; I2=33% and 26%, respectively). Risk of procedure-related adverse events was low. Repeat procedures (mean difference=0.16, 95% CI 0.0 to 0.32, p=0.05, I2=53%) and antiarrhythmic drugs (OR=4.70, 95% CI 2.31 to 9.55, p<0.0001, I2=0%) are more frequently needed in patients with HCM to prevent arrhythmia relapse. Sensitivity analyses suggested that the outcome in patients with HCM with less dilated atria and paroxysmal AF may be more comparable to the general population. Conclusions The observed complication rate of catheter ablation of AF in patients with HCM was low. Even though the risk of relapse is twofold higher, catheter ablation can be effective in patients with HCM and AF, particularly in patients with paroxysmal AF and smaller atria.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Anti-Arrhythmia Agents", "Atrial Fibrillation", "Cardiomyopathy, Hypertrophic", "Catheter Ablation", "Chi-Square Distribution", "Disease-Free Survival", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Odds Ratio", "Recurrence", "Reoperation", "Risk Factors", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85011045311", "SubjectAreas": [["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"15769947600": {"Name": "Providencia R.", "AuthorID": "15769947600", "AffiliationID": "60004093, 60159931", "AffiliationName": "Barts Heart Centre, Barts Health NHS Trust"}, "7202244843": {"Name": "Elliott P.", "AuthorID": "7202244843", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60004093", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College of London, Barts Heart Centre"}, "57190984518": {"Name": "Babu G.", "AuthorID": "57190984518", "AffiliationID": "60004093, 60159931", "AffiliationName": "Barts Heart Centre, Barts Health NHS Trust"}, "56800023900": {"Name": "Srinivasan N.", "AuthorID": "56800023900", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60004093", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College of London, Barts Heart Centre"}, "56912321900": {"Name": "Bronis K.", "AuthorID": "56912321900", "AffiliationID": "60004093, 60159931", "AffiliationName": "Barts Heart Centre, Barts Health NHS Trust"}, "57210709690": {"Name": "Papageorgiou N.", "AuthorID": "57210709690", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60004093", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College of London, Barts Heart Centre"}, "16063029200": {"Name": "Chow A.", "AuthorID": "16063029200", "AffiliationID": "60004093, 60159931", "AffiliationName": "Barts Heart Centre, Barts Health NHS Trust"}, "56313471000": {"Name": "Rowland E.", "AuthorID": "56313471000", "AffiliationID": "60004093, 60159931", "AffiliationName": "Barts Heart Centre, Barts Health NHS Trust"}, "7202196645": {"Name": "Lowe M.", "AuthorID": "7202196645", "AffiliationID": "60004093, 60159931", "AffiliationName": "Barts Heart Centre, Barts Health NHS Trust"}, "7004204877": {"Name": "Segal O.R.", "AuthorID": "7004204877", "AffiliationID": "60004093, 60159931", "AffiliationName": "Barts Heart Centre, Barts Health NHS Trust"}, "6603130488": {"Name": "Lambiase P.D.", "AuthorID": "6603130488", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60004093", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College of London, Barts Heart Centre"}, "57210507720": {"Name": "Patel K.", "AuthorID": "57210507720", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60004093", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College of London, Barts Heart Centre"}, "16028980200": {"Name": "McCready J.", "AuthorID": "16028980200", "AffiliationID": "60012806, 60003456", "AffiliationName": "Cardiology Department, Royal Sussex County Hospital, Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals NHS Trust"}}}
