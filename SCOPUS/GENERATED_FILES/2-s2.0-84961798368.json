In this work, we present a simple approach to transfer learning using intracranial EEG (also known as electrocorticographic, ECoG) data from three patients. More specifically, we aimed at detecting numerical processing during naturalistic settings based on a model trained with controlled experimental conditions. Our results showed significant prediction accuracy of numerical events in naturalistic settings when considering a priori knowledge of the target task.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Electrocorticography", "Multiple Kernel Learning", "Transfer learning"], "IndexKeywords": ["Electrocorticography", "Experimental conditions", "Machine learning research", "Multiple Kernel Learning", "Numerical processing", "Prediction accuracy", "Priori knowledge", "Transfer learning"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84961798368", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition", "COMP", "1707"], ["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"37097989200": {"Name": "Schrouff J.", "AuthorID": "37097989200", "AffiliationID": "60012708", "AffiliationName": "Stanford Human Intracranial Cognitive Electrophysiology Program (SHICEP)"}, "7003443688": {"Name": "Parvizi J.", "AuthorID": "7003443688", "AffiliationID": "60012708", "AffiliationName": "Stanford Human Intracranial Cognitive Electrophysiology Program (SHICEP)"}, "7403135552": {"Name": "Phillips C.", "AuthorID": "7403135552", "AffiliationID": "60000964", "AffiliationName": "Cyclotron Research Centre, University of Li\u00e8ge"}, "57203998200": {"Name": "Mourao-Miranda J.", "AuthorID": "57203998200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}}}
