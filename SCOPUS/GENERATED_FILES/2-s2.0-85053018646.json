We sought to describe the effect of resting parasympathetic tone on functional brain networks during the anticipation and experience of oesophageal pain. 21 healthy participants had their resting cardiac vagal tone (CVT), a validated measure of the PNS, quantified, and underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging during the anticipation and experience of painful oesophageal distention. The relationship between resting CVT and functional brain networks was examined using 11 hypothesis-driven nodes and network-based statistics. A network comprising all nodes was apparent in individuals with high resting CVT, compared to those with low CVT, during oesophageal pain (family wise error rate (FWER)-corrected p < 0.048). Functional connections included the thalamus-amygdala, thalamus-hypothalamus, hypothalamus-nucleus accumbens, amygdala-pallidum, pallidum-nucleus accumbens and insula-pallidum. A smaller network was seen during pain anticipation, comprising the amygdala, pallidum and anterior insula (FWER-corrected p < 0.049). These findings suggest that PNS tone is associated with functional brain networks during the anticipation and experience of visceral pain. Given the role of these subcortical regions in the descending inhibitory modulation of pain, these networks may represent a potential neurobiological explanation for the anti-nociceptive effect of the PNS.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Brain", "Brain Mapping", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Nerve Net", "Parasympathetic Nervous System", "Visceral Pain"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85053018646", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"56413041200": {"Name": "Ruffle J.K.", "AuthorID": "56413041200", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Neuroscience and Trauma, Blizard Institute, Wingate Institute of Neurogastroenterology, Barts and the London School of Medicine & Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London"}, "57204025969": {"Name": "Aziz Q.", "AuthorID": "57204025969", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Neuroscience and Trauma, Blizard Institute, Wingate Institute of Neurogastroenterology, Barts and the London School of Medicine & Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London"}, "25642315400": {"Name": "Farmer A.D.", "AuthorID": "25642315400", "AffiliationID": "60030210", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Applied Clinical Sciences, University of Keele"}, "17343275900": {"Name": "Coen S.J.", "AuthorID": "17343275900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London"}, "6602160284": {"Name": "Giampietro V.", "AuthorID": "6602160284", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "King\u2019s College London, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience, Department of Neuroimaging"}, "57202809259": {"Name": "Williams S.C.R.", "AuthorID": "57202809259", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "King\u2019s College London, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience, Department of Neuroimaging"}}}
