It suggests that archival thinking and the archival problem space encompasses questions about the nature of consciousness, highlighting how these questions seem to be apparent within the fundamental archival principles of respect des fonds, provenance and original order. It seeks to shift attention back to provenance, not just in the sense of where a given object has come from, but also in the sense of the grounds on which it becomes an object and it suggests that the application of computational methods and tools for archival purposes and the integration of computational with archival thinking may offer a way to maintain awareness of this more philosophical dimension in practice.", "AuthorKeywords": ["consciousness", "ontology", "provenance"], "IndexKeywords": ["consciousness", "Explanatory gaps", "Problem space", "provenance"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85015166351", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"], ["Information Systems", "COMP", "1710"], ["Hardware and Architecture", "COMP", "1708"]], "AuthorData": {"55605817600": {"Name": "Bunn J.", "AuthorID": "55605817600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Information Studies, University College London"}}}
