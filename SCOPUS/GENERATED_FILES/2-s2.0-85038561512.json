Protons deposit most of their energy in a very localised area, the so-called Bragg peak, sparing surrounding healthy tissue and critical organs from radiation. However, secondary neutrons and gamma rays are generated in the beam nozzle and inside the patient. Clinically, it is highly desirable to monitor the neutron dose the patient is exposed to, and this requires a neutron detector sensitive to high energies. EJ299-33 is a solid plastic scintillator capable of discriminating neutrons from gamma rays using pulse shape analysis of scintillation light. EJ299-33 has the potential to detect neutrons with energies up to 100 MeV and does not present leakage and flammability hazards generally associated with liquid scintillators. Experimental measurements with 60Co, 137Cs and 241AmBe sources were performed to calibrate and optimise pulse shape discrimination parameters. We also performed experimental measurements at the Clatterbridge Cancer Centre in a 60 MeV passive scattered beam to detect high energy neutrons.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Flammability hazards", "High-energy neutron", "Liquid scintillator", "Plastic scintillator", "Pulse shape analysis", "Pulse shape discrimination", "Scintillation light", "Secondary neutrons"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85038561512", "SubjectAreas": [["Mathematical Physics", "MATH", "2610"], ["Instrumentation", "PHYS", "3105"]], "AuthorData": {"57199995461": {"Name": "Chung S.", "AuthorID": "57199995461", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "57205908360": {"Name": "Speller R.", "AuthorID": "57205908360", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "57211875186": {"Name": "Gutierrez A.", "AuthorID": "57211875186", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "12760112000": {"Name": "Kacperek A.", "AuthorID": "12760112000", "AffiliationID": "60020939", "AffiliationName": "National Eye Proton Therapy Centre, Clatterbridge Cancer Centre NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
