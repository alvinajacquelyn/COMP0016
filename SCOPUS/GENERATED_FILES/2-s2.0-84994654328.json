The eigenphase sums, resonance features, differential and integral cross sections are computed for each individual conformer. Resonance positions for the low-energy shape resonance are found to vary from 2.6 to 3.1 eV and the resonance widths from 0.3 to 0.5 eV. Averaged cross sections for thermal mixtures of the 9 conformers are presented. Both theoretical and experimental population ratios are considered. Thermally averaged cross sections obtained using the best theoretical estimates give reasonable agreement with the observed thermal cross sections. Excited conformers IIA and IIB make a large contribution to this average due to their large permanent dipole moments.", "AuthorKeywords": ["conformers", "electron collisions", "R-matrix"], "IndexKeywords": ["conformers", "Electron collision", "Electron-collision cross section", "Integral cross-sections", "Permanent dipoles", "R matrices", "Resonance position", "Thermal cross sections"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84994654328", "SubjectAreas": [["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"]], "AuthorData": {"7401866863": {"Name": "Fujimoto M.", "AuthorID": "7401866863", "AffiliationID": "60015043", "AffiliationName": "Departamento de F\u00edsica, Universidade Federal Do Paran\u00e1"}, "56679027100": {"Name": "Lima E.", "AuthorID": "56679027100", "AffiliationID": "60015043", "AffiliationName": "Departamento de F\u00edsica, Universidade Federal Do Paran\u00e1"}, "7101645601": {"Name": "Tennyson J.", "AuthorID": "7101645601", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}}}
