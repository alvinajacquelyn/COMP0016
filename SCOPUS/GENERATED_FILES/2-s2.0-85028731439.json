Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.We present a complete biosensing system that comprises a Thin Film Transistor (TFT)-based nanoribbon biosensor and a low noise, high-performance bioinstrumentation platform, capable of detecting sub-30 mpH unit changes, validated by an enzymatic biochemical reaction. The nanoribbon biosensor was fabricated top-down with an ultra-thin (15 nm) polysilicon semiconducting channel that offers excellent sensitivity to surface potential changes. The sensor is coupled to an integrated circuit (IC), which combines dual switched-capacitor integrators with high precision analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). Throughout this work, we employed both conventional pH buffer measurements as well as urea-urease enzymatic reactions for benchmarking the overall performance of the system. The measured results from the urea-urease reaction demonstrate that the system can detect urea in concentrations as low as 25 \u00b5M, which translates to a change of 27 mpH, according to our initial pH characterisation measurements. The attained accuracy and resolution of our system as well as its low-cost manufacturability, high processing speed and portability make it a competitive solution for applications requiring rapid and accurate results at remote locations; a necessity for Point-of-Care (POC) diagnostic platforms.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Analog-to-digital conversion", "Biosensor", "Nanoribbon", "PH sensing", "Point-of-Care diagnostics", "Switched capacitor", "TFT", "Urea-urease reaction"], "IndexKeywords": ["Analog to digital converters", "Biochemical reactions", "Biosensing platforms", "Nanoribbon", "pH sensing", "Point of care diagnostic", "Switched capacitor", "Switched capacitor integrator", "Biosensing Techniques", "Nanotubes, Carbon", "Point-of-Care Systems", "Transistors, Electronic", "Urea", "Urease"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85028731439", "SubjectAreas": [["Analytical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1602"], ["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"], ["Instrumentation", "PHYS", "3105"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"35209203900": {"Name": "Zeimpekis I.", "AuthorID": "35209203900", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "Nanoelectronics & Nanotechnology Research Group, Electronics and Computer Science, University of Southampton"}, "55357565700": {"Name": "Papadimitriou K.", "AuthorID": "55357565700", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "Nanoelectronics & Nanotechnology Research Group, Electronics and Computer Science, University of Southampton"}, "55250242700": {"Name": "Sun K.", "AuthorID": "55250242700", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "Nanoelectronics & Nanotechnology Research Group, Electronics and Computer Science, University of Southampton"}, "55743707200": {"Name": "Hu C.", "AuthorID": "55743707200", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "Nanoelectronics & Nanotechnology Research Group, Electronics and Computer Science, University of Southampton"}, "57204264146": {"Name": "Ashburn P.", "AuthorID": "57204264146", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "Nanoelectronics & Nanotechnology Research Group, Electronics and Computer Science, University of Southampton"}, "7202309049": {"Name": "Morgan H.", "AuthorID": "7202309049", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "Nanoelectronics & Nanotechnology Research Group, Electronics and Computer Science, University of Southampton"}, "15766131500": {"Name": "Prodromakis T.", "AuthorID": "15766131500", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "Nanoelectronics & Nanotechnology Research Group, Electronics and Computer Science, University of Southampton"}}}
