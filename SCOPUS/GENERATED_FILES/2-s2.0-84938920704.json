Although restoring ionic gradients is energetically costly, a rise in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> acts through multiple pathways to increase ATP synthesis, matching energy supply to demand. Increasing cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> stimulates metabolite transfer across the inner mitochondrial membrane through activation of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-regulated mitochondrial carriers, whereas an increase in matrix Ca<sup>2+</sup> stimulates the citric acid cycle and ATP synthase. The aspartate-glutamate exchanger Aralar/AGC1 (Slc25a12), a component of the malate-aspartate shuttle (MAS), is stimulated by modest increases in cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> and upregulates respiration in cortical neurons by enhancing pyruvate supply into mitochondria. Failure to increase respiration in response to small (carbachol) and moderate (K<sup>+</sup>-depolarization) workloads and blunted stimulation of respiration in response to high workloads (veratridine) in Aralar/AGC1 knockout neurons reflect impaired MAS activity and limited mitochondrial pyruvate supply. In response to large workloads (veratridine), acute stimulation of respiration occurs in the absence of MAS through Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through the mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) and a rise in matrix [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]. Although the physiological importance of the MCU complex in work-induced stimulation of respiration of CNS neurons is not yet clarified, abnormal mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> signalling causes pathology. Indeed, loss of function mutations in MICU1, a regulator of MCU complex, are associated with neuromuscular disease. In patient-derived MICU1 deficient fibroblasts, resting matrix Ca<sup>2+</sup> is increased and mitochondria fragmented. Thus, the fine tuning of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals plays a key role in shaping mitochondrial bioenergetics.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adenosine Triphosphate", "Animals", "Calcium Channels", "Calcium Signaling", "Humans", "Mitochondria", "Neurons"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84938920704", "SubjectAreas": [["Physiology", "BIOC", "1314"]], "AuthorData": {"36449230200": {"Name": "Llorente-Folch I.", "AuthorID": "36449230200", "AffiliationID": "60105312, 60019290", "AffiliationName": "Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria Fundacion Jimenez Diaz IIS-FJD"}, "55627270100": {"Name": "Rueda C.B.", "AuthorID": "55627270100", "AffiliationID": "60105312, 60019290", "AffiliationName": "Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria Fundacion Jimenez Diaz IIS-FJD"}, "56277975700": {"Name": "Pardo B.", "AuthorID": "56277975700", "AffiliationID": "60105312, 60019290", "AffiliationName": "Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria Fundacion Jimenez Diaz IIS-FJD"}, "7005607252": {"Name": "Satrustegui J.", "AuthorID": "7005607252", "AffiliationID": "60105312, 60019290", "AffiliationName": "Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria Fundacion Jimenez Diaz IIS-FJD"}, "6602576918": {"Name": "Szabadkai G.", "AuthorID": "6602576918", "AffiliationID": "60000481, 60021199", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of Padua, Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche Neuroscience Institute"}, "7005847722": {"Name": "Duchen M.R.", "AuthorID": "7005847722", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, Consortium for Mitochondrial Research, University College London"}}}
