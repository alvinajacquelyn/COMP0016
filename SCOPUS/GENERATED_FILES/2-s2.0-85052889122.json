It may be assumed that as grandparents have raised their own children, their capabilities in terms of child care have been achieved through such experience. However, experience does not necessarily equate to expertise. Parenting interventions have beneficial effects for both parent and child outcomes. If such skills can be taught to parents, they may also be of benefit to grandparents. This systematic review explores the evidence base on parenting interventions for grandparents. The aim is to examine the implications of parenting interventions on outcomes for the grandparents, the parents and the child. A keyword data base search generated 191 manuscripts and eight studies met the criteria for inclusion. Overall, this review identifies relatively weak literature on interventions for grandparenting skills. Studies identified predominantly originated from the USA, and focused on the outcomes for the grandparents with sparse information on implications for the child or parent. However, despite such limitations, the studies all seem to report benefits of parenting interventions for grandparents. The interventions identified are varied and range from short to longer courses as well as support groups and home visits. As such, conclusions are limited. However, an enticing range of interventions with a growing evidence base of efficacy is seemingly emerging, laying the foundations for future studies honing the parenting provision for grandparents.", "AuthorKeywords": ["child development", "childcare", "Grandparents", "interventions", "parenting", "systematic review"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85052889122", "SubjectAreas": [["Social Sciences (all)", "SOCI", "3300"]], "AuthorData": {"35847280700": {"Name": "Sherr L.", "AuthorID": "35847280700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Global Health, University College London"}, "57192892025": {"Name": "Roberts K.", "AuthorID": "57192892025", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Global Health, University College London"}, "57203767182": {"Name": "Hothi S.", "AuthorID": "57203767182", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Global Health, University College London"}, "57203761422": {"Name": "Balchin N.", "AuthorID": "57203761422", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Global Health, University College London"}}}
