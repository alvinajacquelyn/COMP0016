It had been reported that young adolescent patients have a higher rate of loosening and fatigue fracture of intramedullary stems because the implant becomes undersized as patients grow. Extracortical bone growth into the grooved hydroxyapatite-coated collar had been shown to reduce failure rates. The stresses in the implant and femur have been calculated from Finite Element models for different stages of bone growth onto the collar. For a small diameter stem without any bone growth, a large stress concentration at the implant shoulder was found, leading to a significant fracture risk under normal walking loads. Bone growth and osseointergration onto the implant collar reduced the stress level in the implant to safe levels. For small bone bridges a risk of bone fracture was observed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bone growth", "Finite Element Analysis", "HA collar", "Orthopaedics", "Prostheses"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aseptic loosening", "Bone growth", "Cancer patients", "Different stages", "Fatigue fracture", "Fracture risks", "HA collar", "Normal walking", "Adolescent", "Bone Development", "Child", "Durapatite", "Elastic Modulus", "Femur", "Finite Element Analysis", "Humans", "Prosthesis Design", "Prosthesis Failure", "Stress, Mechanical"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85009288420", "SubjectAreas": [["Biophysics", "BIOC", "1304"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"]], "AuthorData": {"23977809500": {"Name": "Fromme P.", "AuthorID": "23977809500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "57192942104": {"Name": "Abdoola T.", "AuthorID": "57192942104", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "7004735871": {"Name": "Blunn G.W.", "AuthorID": "7004735871", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60024067", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Orthopaedics and Musculo-Skeletal Science, Division of Surgery & Interventional Science, University College London, Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital"}, "57220314239": {"Name": "Koris J.", "AuthorID": "57220314239", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60024067", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Orthopaedics and Musculo-Skeletal Science, Division of Surgery & Interventional Science, University College London, Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital"}, "6603029220": {"Name": "Coathup M.J.", "AuthorID": "6603029220", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60024067", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Orthopaedics and Musculo-Skeletal Science, Division of Surgery & Interventional Science, University College London, Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital"}, "36763143500": {"Name": "Aston W.J.", "AuthorID": "36763143500", "AffiliationID": "60024067", "AffiliationName": "Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital"}}}
