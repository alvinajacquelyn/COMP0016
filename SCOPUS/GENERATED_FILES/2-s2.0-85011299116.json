Although case series are reported, there are no randomized controlled studies in children. Methods We designed a randomized, crossover, controlled pilot study to determine safety and feasibility of intracoronary stem cell therapy in children. The primary safety end-point was freedom from death and transplantation or any complication that could be considered related to bone marrow injection or anesthesia (e.g., infection, malignancy, anaphylaxis, renal deterioration). Other end-points were magnetic resonance imaging measurements and N-terminal prohormone brain natriuretic peptide. Participants included 10 children (mean age 7.2 years; range, 2.2\u201314.1 years; 6 boys) with cardiomyopathy (New York Heart Association/Ross Classification II\u2013IV). Patients were crossed over at 6 months. Results The original protocol was completed by 9 patients. The safety end-point was achieved in all. Ratio of the geometric means for treatment effect adjusting for baseline was assessed for end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes (EDV, ESV): 0.93 for EDV (95% confidence interval 0.88\u20130.99, p = 0.01), indicating EDV was on average 7% lower in patients after stem cell treatment, and 0.90 for ESV (95% confidence interval 0.82\u20131.00, p = 0.05), indicating ESV was on average 10% lower after stem cell treatment compared with placebo. The primary efficacy end-point ejection fraction was not met. Conclusions Bone marrow mononuclear cell therapy for cardiomyopathy is feasible and safe in children. Left ventricular volumes were significantly reduced 6 months after stem cell injection compared with placebo, which may reflect reverse remodeling.", "AuthorKeywords": ["autologous stem cells", "bone marrow", "heart failure", "intracoronary injection", "pediatric dilated cardiomyopathy"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Bone Marrow Cells", "Bone Marrow Transplantation", "Cardiomyopathy, Dilated", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Cross-Over Studies", "Feasibility Studies", "Female", "Heart Ventricles", "Humans", "Infant", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Cine", "Male", "Pilot Projects", "Stem Cell Transplantation", "Stroke Volume", "Transplantation, Autologous", "Treatment Outcome", "Ventricular Function, Left", "Ventricular Remodeling"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85011299116", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine", "MEDI", "2740"], ["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"], ["Transplantation", "MEDI", "2747"]], "AuthorData": {"36768751700": {"Name": "Pincott E.S.", "AuthorID": "36768751700", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "7102063096": {"Name": "McEwan A.", "AuthorID": "7102063096", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "7801671480": {"Name": "Muthurangu V.", "AuthorID": "7801671480", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "7005588453": {"Name": "Burch M.", "AuthorID": "7005588453", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "6701886920": {"Name": "Ridout D.", "AuthorID": "6701886920", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Population Policy and Practice Programme, UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "17033941100": {"Name": "Brocklesby M.", "AuthorID": "17033941100", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Bone Marrow Laboratory, Great Ormond Street Hospital"}}}
