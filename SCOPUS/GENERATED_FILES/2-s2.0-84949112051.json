The compiled experimental data were transformed into molar solubility ratios, water-to-anhydrous propylene glycol (P) and gas-to-anhydrous propylene glycol (K) using standard thermodynamic relationships. The derived Abraham model correlations described the observed solubility and partition coefficient data of neutral organic compounds and ionic species to within 0.18 log units and 0.18 log units (or less), respectively.", "AuthorKeywords": ["1,2-Propylene glycol", "acid-dissociation constants", "activity coefficients", "ionic species", "partition coefficients", "solubility ratios"], "IndexKeywords": ["Acid dissociation constants", "Chemical literature", "Ionic species", "Organic molecules", "Partition coefficient", "Propylene glycols", "Solute transfer", "Thermodynamic relationships"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84949112051", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"], ["Materials Chemistry", "MATE", "2505"]], "AuthorData": {"7004137043": {"Name": "Stovall D.", "AuthorID": "7004137043", "AffiliationID": "60024438", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of North Texas"}, "56643864800": {"Name": "Dai C.", "AuthorID": "56643864800", "AffiliationID": "60024438", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of North Texas"}, "56643526000": {"Name": "Zhang S.", "AuthorID": "56643526000", "AffiliationID": "60024438", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of North Texas"}, "35496753700": {"Name": "Acree W.", "AuthorID": "35496753700", "AffiliationID": "60024438", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of North Texas"}, "7202901240": {"Name": "Abraham M.", "AuthorID": "7202901240", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}}}
