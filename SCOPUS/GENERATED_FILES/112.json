Semistructured interviews following results from consultations with 10 breast/ovarian cancer patients and 22 relatives were audio-recorded and transcribed. Information provided by the genetics health professional was tracked through the families and coded for accuracy. Accuracy was analysed using the Wilcoxon Signed-Ranks test. Sources of information were tested using Spearman's rank-order correlation coefficient. Fifty-three percent of the information recalled by patients was accurate. Accuracy of recall among relatives was significantly lower than that among patients (P = 0.017). Both groups recalled a lower proportion of information about hereditary cancer than about genetics (P = 0.005). Relatives who learnt the information from the patient alone recalled significantly less accurate information than those informed directly by genetics health professionals (P = 0.001). Following genetic counselling about a BRCA1/2 mutation, accuracy of recall was low among patients and relatives, particularly about hereditary cancer. Multiple sources of information, including direct contact with genetics health professionals, may improve the accuracy of information among relatives.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "BRCA1 Protein", "BRCA2 Protein", "Breast Neoplasms", "Family", "Female", "Genetic Counseling", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Ovarian Neoplasms", "Patient Education as Topic"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84921392197", "SubjectAreas": [["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Genetics (clinical)", "MEDI", "2716"]], "AuthorData": {"7202179356": {"Name": "Jacobs C.", "AuthorID": "7202179356", "AffiliationID": "60005518", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Genetics, Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust"}, "36172483500": {"Name": "Dancyger C.", "AuthorID": "36172483500", "AffiliationID": "60159931", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Psychological Services, Bart's Health NHS Trust"}, "35555232100": {"Name": "Smith J.A.", "AuthorID": "35555232100", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychological Sciences, Birkbeck, University of London"}, "7004779970": {"Name": "Michie S.", "AuthorID": "7004779970", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London"}}}
