The role of the TReg in stress-disease pathways has not yet been investigated. Objectives: The aim of the study was to investigate the association between biological responsivity to acute psychosocial stress and the percentage of TRegs in healthy older adults. The secondary purpose was to measure the associations between TReg percentage and psychological and physical well-being in the participants. Methods: Salivary cortisol and plasma interleukin (IL)-6 samples were obtained from 121 healthy older men and women from the Whitehall II cohort following acute psychophysiological stress testing. Three years later at a follow-up visit, we measured TReg percentages and psychological and physical well-being were recorded using the Short Form 36 Health Survey and the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale. Results: Blunted cortisol responses (p = 0.004) and elevated IL-6 responses (p = 0.027) to acute psychophysiological stress were associated with greater TReg percentage independently of age, sex, BMI, smoking status, employment grade, time of testing, and baseline measures of cortisol and IL-6, respectively. Percentage of TRegs was associated cross-sectionally with lower physical (p = 0.043) and mental health status (p = 0.008), and higher levels of depressive symptoms (p = 0.002), independently of covariates. Conclusions: Increased levels of TRegs may act as a defence against increased inflammation and may be a pre-indication for chronically stressed individuals on the cusp of clinical illness.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Depression", "HPA axis", "Inflammatory response system", "Psychological stress", "Regulatory T cell"], "IndexKeywords": ["Age Factors", "Aged", "Body Mass Index", "Cohort Studies", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Depression", "Female", "Health Status", "Humans", "Hydrocortisone", "Inflammation", "Interleukin-6", "Lymphocyte Count", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Neurosecretory Systems", "Sex Factors", "Smoking", "Stress, Psychological", "T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84922697099", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"]], "AuthorData": {"55926917100": {"Name": "Ronaldson A.", "AuthorID": "55926917100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "56085880600": {"Name": "Zalli A.", "AuthorID": "56085880600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "7102289942": {"Name": "Steptoe A.", "AuthorID": "7102289942", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "55440517500": {"Name": "Carvalho L.", "AuthorID": "55440517500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "55350253500": {"Name": "Gazali A.", "AuthorID": "55350253500", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Academic Rheumatology, Division of Immunology, Infection and Inflammatory Disease, School of Medicine, Kings College London, Guy's Campus"}, "7403233068": {"Name": "Thompson S.", "AuthorID": "7403233068", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Academic Rheumatology, Division of Immunology, Infection and Inflammatory Disease, School of Medicine, Kings College London, Guy's Campus"}, "7102610700": {"Name": "Kaiser F.", "AuthorID": "7102610700", "AffiliationID": "60013985", "AffiliationName": "Department of Microbial Diseases, UCL-Eastman Dental Institute"}, "57202559202": {"Name": "Henderson B.", "AuthorID": "57202559202", "AffiliationID": "60013985", "AffiliationName": "Department of Microbial Diseases, UCL-Eastman Dental Institute"}}}
