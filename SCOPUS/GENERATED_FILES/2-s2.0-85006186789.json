The preparation, based on sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and \u03b2-cyclodextrin (\u03b2-CD) embedded in chitosan gel, was used to successfully deliver the model drug-insulin. The self-assembled SDS/\u03b2-CD vesicles were prepared and characterized by particle size, zeta potential, appearance, microscopic morphology and entrapment efficiency. In addition, both the interaction of insulin with vesicles and the stability of insulin loaded in vesicles in the presence of pepsin were investigated. The vesicles were crosslinked into thermo-sensitive chitosan/\u03b2-glycerol phosphate solution for an in-situ gel to enhance the dilution stability. The in vitro release characteristics of insulin from gels in media at different pH values were investigated. The insulin loaded vesicles\u2013chitosan hydrogel (IVG) improved the dilution stability of the vesicles and provided pH-selective sustained release compared with insulin solution\u2013chitosan hydrogel (ISG). In vitro, IVG exhibited slow release in acidic solution and relatively quick release in neutral solutions to provide drug efficacy. In simulated digestive fluid, IVG showed better sustained release and insulin protection properties compared with ISG. Thus IVG might improve the stability of insulin during its transport in vivo and contribute to the bioavailability and therapeutic effect of insulin.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Gel", "Insulin", "pH-selective release", "Self-assembly", "Vesicles", "\u03b2-Cyclodextrin"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85006186789", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics (all)", "PHAR", "3000"]], "AuthorData": {"56984757000": {"Name": "Li Z.", "AuthorID": "56984757000", "AffiliationID": "60027416, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "Center for Drug Delivery System, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "14067165600": {"Name": "Chen D.", "AuthorID": "14067165600", "AffiliationID": "60007269", "AffiliationName": "School of Pharmacy, Shenyang Pharmaceutical University"}, "36109448200": {"Name": "Zhang J.", "AuthorID": "36109448200", "AffiliationID": "60027416, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "Center for Drug Delivery System, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "56183635900": {"Name": "Li H.", "AuthorID": "56183635900", "AffiliationID": "60027416, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "Center for Drug Delivery System, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "56080275400": {"Name": "Wang C.", "AuthorID": "56080275400", "AffiliationID": "60027416, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "Center for Drug Delivery System, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "57049883800": {"Name": "Xu J.", "AuthorID": "57049883800", "AffiliationID": "60021070", "AffiliationName": "School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Anhui University of Chinese Medicine"}, "57203486696": {"Name": "Singh V.", "AuthorID": "57203486696", "AffiliationID": "60027416, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "Center for Drug Delivery System, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}}}
