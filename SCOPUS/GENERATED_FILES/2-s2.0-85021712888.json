Recent evidence concerning better overall survival for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer challenges the notional assumptions about what survival would be without metastasectomy. Earlier detection of metastases for local treatments has not resulted in a survival benefit. Materials and methods The interpretation of its central graphical display is critically reviewed and the common the limitations of the analysis of registry data and resulting immortal time bias are explored. Results and discussion Recent evidence, including the 2017 CLOCC trial report make the original interpretation of the analysis suspect. Randomised trials are essential to detect a treatment effect of specific interventions among variable disease progression, selection bias, and multiple and repeated treatments that are inherent in the management of advanced cancer.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Colorectal Neoplasms", "Humans", "Kaplan-Meier Estimate", "Liver Neoplasms", "Meta-Analysis as Topic", "Metastasectomy", "Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic", "Registries", "State Medicine", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85021712888", "SubjectAreas": [["Epidemiology", "MEDI", "2713"], ["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Cancer Research", "BIOC", "1306"]], "AuthorData": {"16043420000": {"Name": "Morris E.", "AuthorID": "16043420000", "AffiliationID": "118731122", "AffiliationName": "Section of Epidemiology & Biostatistics (Institute of Cancer & Pathology (LICAP) and Institute of Data Analytics (LIDA))"}, "57196678944": {"Name": "Treasure T.", "AuthorID": "57196678944", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Operational Research Unit, University College London"}}}
