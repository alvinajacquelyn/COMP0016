Methods: We included 88 patients with dementia due to AD from the Amsterdam Dementia Cohort. Mean follow-up was 2 \u00b1 1 years. Linear mixed models were used to determine associations of lower whole brain and regional pseudo-continuous arterial spin labelling measured CBF with rate of cognitive decline as measured with repeated mini-mental state examination (MMSE). Model 1 was adjusted for age, sex, and education. Model 2 was additionally adjusted for normalized gray matter volume, medial temporal lobe atrophy, white matter hyperintensities, microbleeds, and lacunes. Analyses were repeated after partial volume correction (PVC) of CBF. Statistical significance was set at p \u2264 0.05. Results: Patients were 65 \u00b1 7 years old, 44 (50 %) were women, and mean baseline MMSE was 22 \u00b1 4. Annual decline (\u03b2[SE]) on the MMSE was estimated at -2.11 (0.25) points per year. Lower whole brain (\u03b2[SE]-0.50[0.25]; p \u2264 0.05) and parietal (\u03b2[SE]-0.59[0.25]; p < 0.05) CBF were associated with faster cognitive decline. PVC cortical CBF was not associated with cognitive decline. Conclusions: Lower CBF, in particular in the posterior brain regions, may have value as a prognostic marker for rate of cognitive decline in AD. Key points: \u2022 In AD, lower CBF is associated with more rapid cognitive decline. \u2022 Decreasing CBF does not reach a plateau early in AD. \u2022 PcASL-CFB has additive value to conventional structural MRI measures in AD.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alzheimer\u2019s disease", "dementia", "perfusion", "prognosis", "progression"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Alzheimer Disease", "Atrophy", "Brain", "Cerebrovascular Circulation", "Disease Progression", "Female", "Gray Matter", "Humans", "Linear Models", "Longitudinal Studies", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Neuropsychological Tests", "Spin Labels", "Temporal Lobe", "Time Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84975499899", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"55632416800": {"Name": "Benedictus M.", "AuthorID": "55632416800", "AffiliationID": "60001997", "AffiliationName": "Alzheimer Centre & Department of Neurology, Neuroscience Campus Amsterdam, VU University Medical Centre"}, "56809350700": {"Name": "Leeuwis A.", "AuthorID": "56809350700", "AffiliationID": "60001997", "AffiliationName": "Alzheimer Centre & Department of Neurology, Neuroscience Campus Amsterdam, VU University Medical Centre"}, "47661023900": {"Name": "Binnewijzend M.", "AuthorID": "47661023900", "AffiliationID": "60001997", "AffiliationName": "Alzheimer Centre & Department of Neurology, Neuroscience Campus Amsterdam, VU University Medical Centre"}, "7007073571": {"Name": "Scheltens P.", "AuthorID": "7007073571", "AffiliationID": "60001997", "AffiliationName": "Alzheimer Centre & Department of Neurology, Neuroscience Campus Amsterdam, VU University Medical Centre"}, "8548678900": {"Name": "van der Flier W.", "AuthorID": "8548678900", "AffiliationID": "60001997", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology & Biostatistics, Neuroscience Campus Amsterdam, VU University Medical Centre"}, "7004063054": {"Name": "Prins N.", "AuthorID": "7004063054", "AffiliationID": "60001997", "AffiliationName": "Alzheimer Centre & Department of Neurology, Neuroscience Campus Amsterdam, VU University Medical Centre"}, "6602116889": {"Name": "Kuijer J.", "AuthorID": "6602116889", "AffiliationID": "60001997", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Medical Technology, Neuroscience Campus Amsterdam, VU University Medical Centre"}, "7102989379": {"Name": "Barkhof F.", "AuthorID": "7102989379", "AffiliationID": "60001997", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology and Nuclear Medicine, Neuroscience Campus Amsterdam, VU University Medical Centre"}}}
