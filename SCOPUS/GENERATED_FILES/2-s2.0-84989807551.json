During ENS development, the RET receptor tyrosine kinase plays a critical role in the proliferation and survival of ENCCs, their migration along the developing gut, and differentiation into enteric neurons. Mutations in RET and its ligand GDNF cause Hirschsprung disease (HSCR), a complex genetic disorder in which ENCCs fail to colonize variable lengths of the distal bowel. To identify key regulators of ENCCs and the pathways underlying RET signaling, gene expression profiles of untreated and GDNF-treated ENCCs from E14.5 mouse embryos were generated. ENCCs express genes that are involved in both early and late neuronal development, whereas GDNF treatment induced neuronal maturation. Predicted regulators of gene expression in ENCCs include the known HSCR genes Ret and Sox10, as well as Bdnf, App and Mapk10. The regulatory overlap and functional interactions between these genes were used to construct a regulatory network that is underlying ENS development and connects to known HSCR genes. In addition, the adenosine receptor A2a (Adora2a) and neuropeptide Y receptor Y2 (Npy2r) were identified as possible regulators of terminal neuronal differentiation in GDNF-treated ENCCs. The human orthologue of Npy2r maps to the HSCR susceptibility locus 4q31.3-q32.3, suggesting a role for NPY2R both in ENS development and in HSCR.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Enteric nervous system", "Hirschsprung disease", "Transcriptome", "Upstream Regulators"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Antigens, Differentiation", "Cell Separation", "Enteric Nervous System", "Female", "Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental", "Glial Cell Line-Derived Neurotrophic Factor", "Hirschsprung Disease", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Neural Crest", "Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ret", "Signal Transduction", "Transcriptome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84989807551", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Developmental Biology", "BIOC", "1309"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"57191404167": {"Name": "Schriemer D.", "AuthorID": "57191404167", "AffiliationID": "60006027, 60010023", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, section Medical Physiology, University of Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen"}, "7004027805": {"Name": "Eggen B.J.L.", "AuthorID": "7004027805", "AffiliationID": "60006027, 60010023", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, section Medical Physiology, University of Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen"}, "35764806300": {"Name": "Sribudiani Y.", "AuthorID": "35764806300", "AffiliationID": "60069388", "AffiliationName": "Department Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Faculty of Medicine, Universitas Padjadjaran"}, "57191406972": {"Name": "MacKenzie K.C.", "AuthorID": "57191406972", "AffiliationID": "60032114", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Genetics, Erasmus University Medical Center"}, "35483335400": {"Name": "Burns A.J.", "AuthorID": "35483335400", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine, Birth Defects Research Centre, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "7006771436": {"Name": "Hofstra R.M.W.", "AuthorID": "7006771436", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine, Birth Defects Research Centre, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "6507092760": {"Name": "IJpma A.", "AuthorID": "6507092760", "AffiliationID": "60032114", "AffiliationName": "Department of Bioinformatics, Erasmus University Medical Center"}, "7003295303": {"Name": "Natarajan D.", "AuthorID": "7003295303", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine, Birth Defects Research Centre, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "8710016200": {"Name": "Metzger M.", "AuthorID": "8710016200", "AffiliationID": "60032515", "AffiliationName": "Fraunhofer IGB, Wuerzburg branch and Chair Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine, University Hospital Wuerzburg"}, "35309281800": {"Name": "Binder E.", "AuthorID": "35309281800", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine, Birth Defects Research Centre, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "8337607800": {"Name": "Thapar N.", "AuthorID": "8337607800", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Division of Neurogastroenterology and Motility, Department of Gastroenterology, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
