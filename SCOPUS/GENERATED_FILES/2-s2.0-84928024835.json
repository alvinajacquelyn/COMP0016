Melanoma is one of the most rapidly increasing forms of cancer and the precise molecular circadian changes that occur in a melanoma tumor are unknown. Using a melanoma zebrafish model, we have explored the molecular changes that occur to the circadian clock within tumors. We have found disruptions in melanoma clock gene expression due to a major impairment to the light input pathway, with a parallel loss of light-dependent activation of DNA repair genes. Furthermore, the timing of mitosis in tumors is perturbed, as well as the regulation of certain key cell cycle regulators, such that cells divide arhythmically. The inability to co-ordinate DNA damage repair and cell division is likely to promote further tumourigenesis and accelerate melanoma development", "AuthorKeywords": ["cancer", "cell cycle", "circadian clock", "light input", "melanoma", "zebrafish"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Animals, Genetically Modified", "Circadian Clocks", "Cryptochromes", "Cyclin B1", "Disease Models, Animal", "DNA Damage", "DNA Repair", "DNA-Binding Proteins", "Eye Proteins", "Light", "Melanoma", "Microphthalmia-Associated Transcription Factor", "Period Circadian Proteins", "S Phase", "Zebrafish", "Zebrafish Proteins"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84928024835", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Developmental Biology", "BIOC", "1309"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"56597628200": {"Name": "Hamilton N.", "AuthorID": "56597628200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Center for Cell and Molecular Dynamics, Department of Cell and Development Biology, University College London"}, "56598043000": {"Name": "Diaz-De-Cerio N.", "AuthorID": "56598043000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Center for Cell and Molecular Dynamics, Department of Cell and Development Biology, University College London"}, "7006106006": {"Name": "Whitmore D.", "AuthorID": "7006106006", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Center for Cell and Molecular Dynamics, Department of Cell and Development Biology, University College London"}}}
