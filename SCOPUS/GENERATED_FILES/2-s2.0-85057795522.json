Two solutions of Li2S8 in diethylene glycol dimethyl ether (DEGDME), containing either lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) or lithium trifluoromethansulfonate (LiCF3SO3) and lithium nitrate (LiNO3), are studied as catholytes for Li/S cells exploiting the polysulfides electrochemical reaction at about 2.2 V vs. Li+/Li. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and thermal analyses, respectively, reveal composition and high-temperature stability of the catholyte solutions. Ad hoc study conducted by impedance spectroscopy, voltammetry, and galvanostatic techniques suggests well suitable characteristics in terms of Li+-transport ability, electrochemical stability window, and electrode/electrolyte interphase features. Cells with sulfur loading ranging from about 3 to 6 mg cm\u22122 into the solution are successfully studied with remarkable performances in terms of current rates, efficiency and cycle life. Hence, the lithium cells based on the catholyte deliver maximum capacity of the order of 1100 mAh gS\u22121 at C/10 rate and stable capacity of about 800 mAh gS\u22121 at C/3 rate with Coulombic efficiency exceeding 99%. Therefore, the catholyte solutions studied herein are considered as a very promising candidates for high-energy storage in next generation systems, such as the intriguing hybrid and electric vehicles.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Catholyte polysulfide", "DEGDME", "LiCF3SO3", "LiTFSI", "Lithium-sulfur battery", "X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy"], "IndexKeywords": ["Bis(trifluoromethane sulfonyl)imide", "DEGDME", "Electrochemical reactions", "Electrochemical stabilities", "Galvanostatic techniques", "High temperature stability", "LiCF3SO3", "LiTFSI"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85057795522", "SubjectAreas": [["Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment", "ENER", "2105"], ["Energy Engineering and Power Technology", "ENER", "2102"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"56416532600": {"Name": "Di Lecce D.", "AuthorID": "56416532600", "AffiliationID": "60024690", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Ferrara"}, "57193444765": {"Name": "Marangon V.", "AuthorID": "57193444765", "AffiliationID": "60024690", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Ferrara"}, "7102421480": {"Name": "Hassoun J.", "AuthorID": "7102421480", "AffiliationID": "60024690", "AffiliationName": "National Interuniversity Consortium of Materials Science and Technology (INSTM), University of Ferrara Research Unit, University of Ferrara"}, "57221280925": {"Name": "Ben\u00edtez A.", "AuthorID": "57221280925", "AffiliationID": "60003138", "AffiliationName": "Dpto.
