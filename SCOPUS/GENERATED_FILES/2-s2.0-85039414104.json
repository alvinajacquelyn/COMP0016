Toxicity was lower and T cell chimerism was better in the patients receiving fludarabine, but cohort numbers were relatively small and follow-up was short. Here we report outcomes of 160 children who received homogeneous conditioning with treosulfan, fludarabine, and, in most cases, alemtuzumab (n = 124). The median age at transplantation was 1.36 years (range,.09 to 18.25 years). Donors included 73 matched unrelated, 54 1 to 3 antigen-mismatched unrelated, 12 matched sibling, 17 other matched family, and 4 haploidentical donors. Stem cell source was peripheral blood stem cells (PBSCs) in 70, bone marrow in 49, and cord blood in 41. Median duration of follow-up was 4.3 years (range,.8 to 9.4 years). Overall survival was 83%. No patients had veno-occlusive disease. Seventy-four patients (46%) had acute GVHD, but only 14 (9%) greater than grade II. Four patients underwent successful retransplantation for graft loss or poor immune reconstitution. Another patient experienced graft rejection and died. There was no association between T cell chimerism >95% and stem cell source, but a significant association was seen between myeloid chimerism >95% and use of PBSCs without an increased risk of significant GVHD compared with other sources. All 11 patients with severe combined immunodeficiency diagnosed at birth were alive at up to 8.7 years of follow-up. Long-term studies are needed to determine late gonadotoxic effects, and pharmacokinetic studies are needed to identify whether specific targeting is advantageous. The combination of treosulfan, fludarabine, and alemtuzumab is associated with excellent results in HSCT for PID.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Chimerism", "Fludarabine", "Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation", "Primary immunodeficiency", "Treosulfan"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Alemtuzumab", "Allografts", "Busulfan", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Disease-Free Survival", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Graft vs Host Disease", "Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation", "Humans", "Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes", "Infant", "Male", "Risk Factors", "Survival Rate", "Transplantation Conditioning", "United Kingdom", "Vidarabine"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85039414104", "SubjectAreas": [["Hematology", "MEDI", "2720"], ["Transplantation", "MEDI", "2747"]], "AuthorData": {"6507443729": {"Name": "Slatter M.A.", "AuthorID": "6507443729", "AffiliationID": "60001239", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Immunology, Newcastle upon Tyne Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "55925075600": {"Name": "Abd Hamid I.J.", "AuthorID": "55925075600", "AffiliationID": "60111353, 60000906", "AffiliationName": "Regenerative Medicine Cluster, Advanced Medical and Dental Institute, Universiti Sains Malaysia"}, "15820973300": {"Name": "Nademi Z.", "AuthorID": "15820973300", "AffiliationID": "60001239", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Immunology, Newcastle upon Tyne Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7005277422": {"Name": "Flood T.", "AuthorID": "7005277422", "AffiliationID": "60001239", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Immunology, Newcastle upon Tyne Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "55880862200": {"Name": "Abinun M.", "AuthorID": "55880862200", "AffiliationID": "60001239", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Immunology, Newcastle upon Tyne Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "6701543518": {"Name": "Hambleton S.", "AuthorID": "6701543518", "AffiliationID": "60001239", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Immunology, Newcastle upon Tyne Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7006244214": {"Name": "Cant A.J.", "AuthorID": "7006244214", "AffiliationID": "60001239", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Immunology, Newcastle upon Tyne Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7003820184": {"Name": "Gennery A.R.", "AuthorID": "7003820184", "AffiliationID": "60001239", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Immunology, Newcastle upon Tyne Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "8346971800": {"Name": "Rao K.", "AuthorID": "8346971800", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital NHS Trust"}, "55362669500": {"Name": "Chiesa R.", "AuthorID": "55362669500", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital NHS Trust"}, "55645792800": {"Name": "Elfeky R.", "AuthorID": "55645792800", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital NHS Trust"}, "6602889677": {"Name": "Amrolia P.", "AuthorID": "6602889677", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital NHS Trust"}, "12786401200": {"Name": "Worth A.", "AuthorID": "12786401200", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital NHS Trust"}, "11739326500": {"Name": "Qasim W.", "AuthorID": "11739326500", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital NHS Trust"}, "7003891382": {"Name": "Gaspar H.B.", "AuthorID": "7003891382", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital NHS Trust"}, "57203102921": {"Name": "Veys P.", "AuthorID": "57203102921", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital NHS Trust"}, "7102484237": {"Name": "Pearce M.S.", "AuthorID": "7102484237", "AffiliationID": "60026712, 60006222", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Health & Society, Newcastle University"}}}
