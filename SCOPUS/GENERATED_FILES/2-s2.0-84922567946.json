{"Title": "Would raising the total cholesterol diagnostic cut-off from 7.5mmol/L to 9.3mmol/L improve detection rate of patients with monogenic familial hypercholesterolaemia?", "Year": 2015, "Source": "Atherosclerosis", "Volume": "239", "Issue": 2, "Art.No": null, "PageStart": 295, "PageEnd": 298, "CitedBy": 10, "DOI": "10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2015.01.028", "Link": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84922567946&origin=inward", "Abstract": "\u00a9 2015 The Authors.A previous report suggested that 88% of individuals in the general population with total cholesterol (TC)>9.3mmol/L have familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH). We tested this hypothesis in a cohort of 4896 UK civil servants, mean (SD) age 44 (\u00b16) years, using next generation sequencing to achieve a comprehensive genetic diagnosis. 25 (0.5%) participants (mean age 49.2 years) had baseline TC>9.3mmol/L, and overall we found an FH-causing mutation in the LDLR gene in seven (28%) subjects. The detection rate increased to 39% by excluding eight participants with triglyceride levels over 2.3mmol/L, and reached 75% in those with TC>10.4mmol/L. By extrapolation, the detection rate would be ~25% by including all participants with TC>8.6mmol/L (2.5 standard deviations from the mean). Based on the 1/500 FH frequency, 30% of all FH-cases in this cohort would be missed using the 9.3mmol/L cut-off. Given that an overall detection rate of 25% is considered economically acceptable, these data suggest that a diagnostic TC cut-off of 8.6mmol/L, rather than 9.3mmol/L would be clinically useful for FH in the general population.", "AuthorKeywords": ["APOB", "Cholesterol", "Diagnosis", "Familial hypercholesterolaemia", "LDLR"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Cardiology", "Cholesterol", "Cohort Studies", "DNA Mutational Analysis", "Female", "Heterozygote", "High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing", "Humans", "Hyperlipoproteinemia Type II", "Male", "Mass Screening", "Middle Aged", "Mutation", "Receptors, LDL", "Triglycerides"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84922567946", "SubjectAreas": [["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"55446094500": {"Name": "Futema M.", "AuthorID": "55446094500", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60100024", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cardiovascular Genetics, British Heart Foundation Laboratories, Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}, "57217317601": {"Name": "Humphries S.E.", "AuthorID": "57217317601", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60100024", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cardiovascular Genetics, British Heart Foundation Laboratories, Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}, "57189230664": {"Name": "Kumari M.", "AuthorID": "57189230664", "AffiliationID": "60001359", "AffiliationName": "University of Essex, Wivenhoe Park, Colchester"}, "18433631700": {"Name": "Boustred C.", "AuthorID": "18433631700", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "NE Thames Regional Genetics Service"}, "7004391239": {"Name": "Kivimaki M.", "AuthorID": "7004391239", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, UCL Institute of Epidemiology and Health Care, University College London"}}}
