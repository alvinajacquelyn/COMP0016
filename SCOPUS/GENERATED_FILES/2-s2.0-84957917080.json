Our motivating example is a Riemann surface M = \u0393 \\\u210d2 associated with a Fuchsian group of the first kind \u0393 containing parabolic elements. The surface M is then non-compact, and has a finite number of cusps and elliptic singular points, which is regarded as a hyperbolic orbifold. We introduce a class of Riemannian surfaces with conical singularities on its finite part, having cusps and regular ends at infinity, whose metric is asymptotically hyperbolic. By observing solutions of the Helmholtz equation at the cusp, we define a generalized S-matrix. We then show that this generalized S-matrix determines the Riemannian metric and the structure of conical singularities.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84957917080", "SubjectAreas": [["Mathematics (all)", "MATH", "2600"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"35271932700": {"Name": "Isozaki H.", "AuthorID": "35271932700", "AffiliationID": "60014256", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Mathematics, University of Tsukuba"}, "6602606312": {"Name": "Kurylev Y.", "AuthorID": "6602606312", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University College of London"}, "6604064173": {"Name": "Lassas M.", "AuthorID": "6604064173", "AffiliationID": "60002952", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics and Statistics, University of Helsinki"}}}
