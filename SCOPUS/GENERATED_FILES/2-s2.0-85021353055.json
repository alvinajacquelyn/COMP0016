We sought to describe the characteristics of a large cohort of ATTRwt patients to better define the disease. Methods and results Clinical findings of consecutive ATTRwt patients diagnosed at 2 centres were reviewed. ATTRwt was diagnosed histologically or non-invasively (LV hypertrophy \u226512 mm, intense cardiac uptake at 99m Tc-DPD scintigraphy and AL exclusion). Mutations in TTR were excluded in all cases. The study cohort comprised 108 patients (78.6 \u00b1 8 years); 67 (62%) diagnosed invasively and 41 (38%) non-invasively. Twenty patients (19%) were females. An asymmetric hypertrophy pattern was observed in 25 (23%) patients. Mean LVEF was 52 \u00b1 14%, with 39 patients (37%) showing a LVEF < 50%. Atrial fibrillation (56%) and a pseudo-infarct pattern (63%) were the commonest ECG findings. Only 22 patients fulfilled QRS low-voltage criteria while 10 showed LV hypertrophy on ECG. Although heart failure was the most frequent profile leading to diagnosis (68%), 7% of individuals presented with atrioventricular block and 11% were diagnosed incidentally. Almost one third (35; 32%) were previously misdiagnosed. Conclusion The clinical spectrum of ATTRwt is heterogeneous and differs from the classic phenotype: women are affected in a significant proportion; asymmetric LV hypertrophy and impaired LVEF are not rare and only a minority have low QRS voltages. Clinicians should be aware of the broad clinical spectrum of ATTRwt to correctly identify an entity for which a number of disease-modifying treatments are under investigation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["99mTc-DPD", "Cardiac amyloidosis", "Scintigraphy", "Transthyretin", "Wild-type"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Amyloid Neuropathies, Familial", "Cardiomyopathies", "Diagnostic Errors", "Diphosphonates", "Echocardiography", "Electrocardiography", "Female", "Genotyping Techniques", "Humans", "Hypertrophy, Left Ventricular", "Male", "Multimodal Imaging", "Organotechnetium Compounds", "Prospective Studies", "Radiopharmaceuticals", "Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography Computed Tomography"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85021353055", "SubjectAreas": [["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"56453004900": {"Name": "Gonz\u00e1lez-L\u00f3pez E.", "AuthorID": "56453004900", "AffiliationID": "118031183", "AffiliationName": "Centro de Investigaci\u00f3n Biom\u00e9dica en Red en Enfermedades Cardiovasculares (CIBERCV)"}, "56008538500": {"Name": "Dominguez F.", "AuthorID": "56008538500", "AffiliationID": "118031183", "AffiliationName": "Centro de Investigaci\u00f3n Biom\u00e9dica en Red en Enfermedades Cardiovasculares (CIBERCV)"}, "9133166200": {"Name": "Cobo-Marcos M.", "AuthorID": "9133166200", "AffiliationID": "118031183", "AffiliationName": "Centro de Investigaci\u00f3n Biom\u00e9dica en Red en Enfermedades Cardiovasculares (CIBERCV)"}, "6504806611": {"Name": "Alonso-Pulpon L.", "AuthorID": "6504806611", "AffiliationID": "118031183", "AffiliationName": "Centro de Investigaci\u00f3n Biom\u00e9dica en Red en Enfermedades Cardiovasculares (CIBERCV)"}, "57197883068": {"Name": "Garcia-Pavia P.", "AuthorID": "57197883068", "AffiliationID": "60108692", "AffiliationName": "Medical School, Francisco de Vitoria University"}, "6602943432": {"Name": "Lara-Pezzi E.", "AuthorID": "6602943432", "AffiliationID": "118031183", "AffiliationName": "Centro de Investigaci\u00f3n Biom\u00e9dica en Red en Enfermedades Cardiovasculares (CIBERCV)"}, "7005142277": {"Name": "Salas C.", "AuthorID": "7005142277", "AffiliationID": "60025844", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, Hospital Universitario Puerta de Hierro"}, "37109671600": {"Name": "Gagliardi C.", "AuthorID": "37109671600", "AffiliationID": "60028218", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiology, University of Bologna and S Orsola, Malpighi Hospital"}, "56619484400": {"Name": "Quarta C.", "AuthorID": "56619484400", "AffiliationID": "60028218", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiology, University of Bologna and S Orsola, Malpighi Hospital"}, "55227637400": {"Name": "Milandri A.", "AuthorID": "55227637400", "AffiliationID": "60028218", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiology, University of Bologna and S Orsola, Malpighi Hospital"}, "57194632656": {"Name": "Cinelli M.", "AuthorID": "57194632656", "AffiliationID": "60028218", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiology, University of Bologna and S Orsola, Malpighi Hospital"}, "35620484900": {"Name": "Lorenzini M.", "AuthorID": "35620484900", "AffiliationID": "60028218", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiology, University of Bologna and S Orsola, Malpighi Hospital"}, "57194632778": {"Name": "Foffi S.", "AuthorID": "57194632778", "AffiliationID": "60028218", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiology, University of Bologna and S Orsola, Malpighi Hospital"}, "7005883289": {"Name": "Rapezzi C.", "AuthorID": "7005883289", "AffiliationID": "60028218", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiology, University of Bologna and S Orsola, Malpighi Hospital"}, "6504058755": {"Name": "De Haro-Del Moral F.", "AuthorID": "6504058755", "AffiliationID": "60025844", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nuclear Medicine, Hospital Universitario Puerta de Hierro"}}}
