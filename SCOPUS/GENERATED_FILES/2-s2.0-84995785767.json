The aim was to transparently report the development of a smartphone app designed to aid smoking cessation during pregnancy. The development of a smartphone app (\u2018SmokeFree Baby\u2019) to help pregnant women stop smoking was guided by frameworks for developing complex interventions, including the Medical Research Council (MRC), Multiphase Optimization Strategy (MOST) and Behaviour Change Wheel (BCW). Two integrative behaviour change theories provided the theoretical base. Evidence from the scientific literature and behaviour change techniques (BCTs) from the BCT Taxonomy v1 informed the intervention content. The app was developed around five core modules, each with a distinct intervention target (identity change, stress management, health information, promoting use of face-to-face support and behavioural substitution) and available in a \u2018control\u2019 or \u2018full\u2019 version. SmokeFree Baby has been developed as part of a multiphase intervention optimization to identify the optimum combination of intervention components to include in smartphone apps to help pregnant smokers stop smoking.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Behaviour change interventions", "Digital interventions", "Incremental development", "Pregnant smokers", "Smartphone application", "Smoking cessation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Behavior Therapy", "Counseling", "Female", "Humans", "Mobile Applications", "Pregnancy", "Smartphone", "Smoking", "Smoking Cessation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84995785767", "SubjectAreas": [["Applied Psychology", "PSYC", "3202"], ["Behavioral Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2802"]], "AuthorData": {"35575144500": {"Name": "Tombor I.", "AuthorID": "35575144500", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60012754", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Research UK Health Behaviour Research Centre, University College London"}, "55547124591": {"Name": "Brown J.", "AuthorID": "55547124591", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60012754", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Research UK Health Behaviour Research Centre, University College London"}, "7402396010": {"Name": "West R.", "AuthorID": "7402396010", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60012754", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Research UK Health Behaviour Research Centre, University College London"}, "15123109500": {"Name": "Shahab L.", "AuthorID": "15123109500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "56450277800": {"Name": "Crane D.", "AuthorID": "56450277800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London"}, "7004779970": {"Name": "Michie S.", "AuthorID": "7004779970", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London"}}}
