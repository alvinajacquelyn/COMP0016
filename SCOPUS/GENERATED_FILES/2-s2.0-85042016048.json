However, it remains unknown whether such shifts in self-evaluation are due to specific alterations in metacognition and/or a downstream consequence of changes in decision-making processes. Methods: Using perceptual decision making as a model system, we employed a computational psychiatry approach to relate parameters governing both decision formation and metacognitive evaluation to self-reported transdiagnostic symptom dimensions in a large general population sample (N = 995). Results: Variability in psychopathology was unrelated to either speed or accuracy of decision formation. In contrast, leveraging a dimensional approach, we revealed independent relationships between psychopathology and metacognition: a symptom dimension related to anxiety and depression was associated with lower confidence and heightened metacognitive efficiency, whereas a dimension characterizing compulsive behavior and intrusive thoughts was associated with higher confidence and lower metacognitive efficiency. Furthermore, we obtained a robust double dissociation\u2014whereas psychiatric symptoms predicted changes in metacognition but not decision performance, age predicted changes in decision performance but not metacognition. Conclusions: Our findings indicate a specific and pervasive link between metacognition and mental health. Our study bridges a gap between an emerging neuroscience of decision making and an understanding of metacognitive alterations in psychopathology.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cognitive neuroscience", "Computational psychiatry", "Confidence", "Decision making", "Metacognition", "Psychopathology"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Compulsive Behavior", "Decision Making", "Female", "Humans", "Linear Models", "Male", "Metacognition", "Middle Aged", "Models, Theoretical", "Psychomotor Performance", "Self Report", "Task Performance and Analysis", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85042016048", "SubjectAreas": [["Biological Psychiatry", "NEUR", "2803"]], "AuthorData": {"57200631711": {"Name": "Rouault M.", "AuthorID": "57200631711", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60084279, 60022106", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Trust Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging, University College London"}, "57204586863": {"Name": "Seow T.", "AuthorID": "57204586863", "AffiliationID": "60011149", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, Trinity College Dublin"}, "35068005100": {"Name": "Fleming S.", "AuthorID": "35068005100", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60084279", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging, University College London"}, "50161540900": {"Name": "Gillan C.", "AuthorID": "50161540900", "AffiliationID": "60011149", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, Trinity College Dublin"}}}
