Market deregulation and consumer choice are relentless in their erosion of academic autonomy and traditions of independent scholarship. Education as a \u2018positional good\u2019 may be weakened more in the post-1992 higher education sector, where consumer-oriented quality assurance is used strategically to bolster prestige and so improve relative competitive advantage (for student recruitment and external monies), than in the pre-1992 Russell Group of universities, which privileges academic research and autonomy from regulation. The university as an intellectual public domain is subject to suppression by capitalism\u2019s deployment of a putatively enlightened \u2018student voice\u2019. This neo-liberal embrace of \u2018student experience\u2019 is evidenced in the privileging of choice and satisfaction anchored in the envisaging of earning power as a basic touchstone of relevance. Globalisation\u2019s Trojan Horse, the authors argue, is embodied in the positivism of the quantitative metrics of the National Student Survey, designed by global giant Ipsos MORI. The argument that a ranking of universities on the results of the National Student Survey demonstrates excellence begs the question of what the university is for.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Choice", "customer", "markets", "satisfaction", "students", "survey"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85061672280", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"]], "AuthorData": {"55966055500": {"Name": "Holligan C.", "AuthorID": "55966055500", "AffiliationID": "60097343", "AffiliationName": "School of Education, University of the West of Scotland"}, "57206262390": {"Name": "Shah Q.", "AuthorID": "57206262390", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Education, University College London"}}}
