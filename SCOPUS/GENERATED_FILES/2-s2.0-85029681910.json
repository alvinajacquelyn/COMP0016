Infants' immune systems are more plastic and dynamic than older children's or adults', and deserve particular attention. This study aimed to understand the response of the HIV-infected infant immune system to early antiretroviral therapy (ART) and planned ART interruption and restart. Methods: Data from HIV-infected children enrolled the CHER trial, starting ART aged between 6 and 12 weeks, were used to explore the effect of ART on immune reconstitution. We used linear and non-linear regression and mixed-effects models to describe children's CD4 trajectories and to identify predictors of CD4 count during early and interrupted ART. Results: Early treatment arrested the decline in CD4 count but did not fully restore it to the levels observed in HIV-uninfected children. Treatment interruption at 40 or 96 weeks resulted in a rapid decline in CD4 T-cells, which on retreatment returned to levels observed before interruption. Na\u00efve CD4 T-cell count was an important determinant of overall CD4 levels. A strong correlation was observed between thymic output and the stable CD4 count both before and after treatment interruption. Conclusion: Early identification and treatment of HIV-infected infants is important to stabilize CD4 counts at the highest levels possible. Once stabilized, children's CD4 counts appear resilient, with good potential for recovery following treatment interruption. The na\u00efve T-cell pool and thymic production of naive cells are key determinants of children's CD4 levels.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Antiretroviral therapy", "CD4 count", "CD4 T cells", "Children", "HIV", "Planned treatment interruption", "Thymus"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85029681910", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"]], "AuthorData": {"7406376617": {"Name": "Lewis J.", "AuthorID": "7406376617", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Health Protection Research Unit in Modelling Methodology, Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, Imperial College London"}, "7005116699": {"Name": "Callard R.E.", "AuthorID": "7005116699", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "7005709905": {"Name": "Payne H.", "AuthorID": "7005709905", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "7201775981": {"Name": "Klein N.", "AuthorID": "7201775981", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "6503849350": {"Name": "Sarah Walker A.", "AuthorID": "6503849350", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60003108", "AffiliationName": "MRC Clinical Trials Unit, University College London"}, "35495600000": {"Name": "Gibb D.M.", "AuthorID": "35495600000", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60003108", "AffiliationName": "MRC Clinical Trials Unit, University College London"}, "7004544555": {"Name": "Babiker A.G.", "AuthorID": "7004544555", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60003108", "AffiliationName": "MRC Clinical Trials Unit, University College London"}, "8923896500": {"Name": "Otwombe K.", "AuthorID": "8923896500", "AffiliationID": "60016218", "AffiliationName": "Perinatal HIV Research Unit, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of the Witwatersrand"}, "6505631165": {"Name": "Panchia R.", "AuthorID": "6505631165", "AffiliationID": "60016218", "AffiliationName": "Perinatal HIV Research Unit, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of the Witwatersrand"}, "8674786700": {"Name": "Violari A.", "AuthorID": "8674786700", "AffiliationID": "60016218", "AffiliationName": "Perinatal HIV Research Unit, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of the Witwatersrand"}, "36949038700": {"Name": "Cotton M.F.", "AuthorID": "36949038700", "AffiliationID": "60001565", "AffiliationName": "Children's Infectious Diseases Clinical Research Unit, Department of Paediatrics and Child Health, Stellenbosch University"}}}
