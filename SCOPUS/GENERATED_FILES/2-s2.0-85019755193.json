The fading coefficients for the self-interference channels are drawn from the general complex Gaussian distribution with arbitrary mean and variance. It is therefore difficult to directly derive the distribution of the bi-directional channel power gain, involving a sum of non-identically distributed random variables. Here, we employ the method of moments in order to provide a new tight Gamma approximation for the self-interference distribution over FD multi-user MIMO Rician fading channels. The proposed theorem holds under arbitrary linear precoder/decoder design, number of antennas and streams, and self-interference cancellation capabilities.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Bi-directional channels", "Complex Gaussian distribution", "Fading coefficients", "Gamma approximation", "Identically distributed random variables", "Linear precoders", "Rician fading channel", "Self-interferences"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85019755193", "SubjectAreas": [["Engineering (all)", "ENGI", "2200"]], "AuthorData": {"54386020900": {"Name": "Shojaeifard A.", "AuthorID": "54386020900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Communications and Information Systems Group, University College London"}, "7404759940": {"Name": "Wong K.K.", "AuthorID": "7404759940", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Communications and Information Systems Group, University College London"}, "16174747800": {"Name": "Di Renzo M.", "AuthorID": "16174747800", "AffiliationID": "60007136, 60106017, 60122384, 60008134", "AffiliationName": "Laboratoire des Signaux et Syst\u00e9mes, CNRS, CentraleSup\u00e9lec, Univ Paris Sud, Universit\u00e9 Paris-Saclay"}, "8914581700": {"Name": "Hamdi K.A.", "AuthorID": "8914581700", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "Microwave and Communication Systems Group, University of Manchester"}, "56331385900": {"Name": "Tang J.", "AuthorID": "56331385900", "AffiliationID": "60024542", "AffiliationName": "Smart Information Processing Centre, South China University of Technology"}}}
