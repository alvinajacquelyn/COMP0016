HIV targets cells of the immune system, including T lymphocytes and macrophages, and depleting these cells compromises the host's ability to mount effective immune responses, resulting in the pathology of AIDS. Although no cure or vaccine is currently available, our increased understanding of the cellular and viral mechanisms involved in HIV replication has led to the development of drugs that limit the pathological consequences of infection. HIV is a retrovirus, whose RNA genome encodes just 15 proteins. Due to this small repertoire of proteins, the virus is dependent on the host cell for virtually all aspects of its replication. Here we provide a brief overview of the cell biology of HIV-infection and replication. 2016 Elsevier Inc.
