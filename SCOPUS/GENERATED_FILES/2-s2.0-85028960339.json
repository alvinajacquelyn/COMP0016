The primary objective of this study was to assess rates of adherence to 6-MP using two different methods in children and adolescents with ALL. Secondary aim was to identify factors that influence adherence to 6-MP in children with ALL. Methods: All eligible children with ALL who are (\u2264 19) years old and receive 6-MP therapy for at least 1 month were approached to participate in the study. A total of 52 children with ALL and their primary caregivers were recruited. Adherence measures included an objective method (measuring 6-MP metabolites in packed Red Blood Cells (RBCs)) and a subjective method (using parent and child self-report via the Medication Adherence Report Scale; MARS; Adherence was defined as 90% or greater). Results: Rates of adherence varied across the measurement methods. Packed RBCs sample analysis indicated forty-four patients (84.6%) to be adherent. Using the MARS questionnaires, a total of 49 children (94.2%) were classified as being adherent according to the parental MARS questionnaire scores, while all the 15 children (100%) who answered the MARS (child) questionnaire were classified as adherent. Overall adherence rate was 80.8% within the studied population. Conclusion: MARS scale was shown to overestimate adherence compared to measurement of 6-MP metabolites in the blood. A combination of both methods led to increased detection of non-adherence to thiopurine in children with ALL.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["6-Mercaptopurine", "Adolescent", "Child", "Cluster Analysis", "Demography", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Medication Adherence", "Parents", "Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma", "Risk Factors", "Surveys and Questionnaires"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85028960339", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"56940595700": {"Name": "Alsous M.", "AuthorID": "56940595700", "AffiliationID": "60043655", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Pharmacy and Therapeutics, Faculty of Pharmacy, Applied Science Private University"}, "56283149600": {"Name": "Abu Farha R.", "AuthorID": "56283149600", "AffiliationID": "60043655", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Pharmacy and Therapeutics, Faculty of Pharmacy, Applied Science Private University"}, "55631790800": {"Name": "Alefishat E.", "AuthorID": "55631790800", "AffiliationID": "60064180", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biopharmaceutics and Clinical Pharmacy, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Jordan"}, "51161036700": {"Name": "Al Omar S.", "AuthorID": "51161036700", "AffiliationID": "60057457", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Pharmacy Department, King Hussein Cancer Center"}, "57195590729": {"Name": "Momani D.", "AuthorID": "57195590729", "AffiliationID": "60057457", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Pharmacy Department, King Hussein Cancer Center"}, "57195589864": {"Name": "Gharabli A.", "AuthorID": "57195589864", "AffiliationID": "60057457", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Pharmacy Department, King Hussein Cancer Center"}, "7005096115": {"Name": "McElnay J.", "AuthorID": "7005096115", "AffiliationID": "60029738", "AffiliationName": "Clinical and Practice Research Group, School of Pharmacy, Queen\u2019s University Belfast"}, "23012144600": {"Name": "Horne R.", "AuthorID": "23012144600", "AffiliationID": "60016379, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Behavioural Medicine, UCL School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "24740946300": {"Name": "Rihani R.", "AuthorID": "24740946300", "AffiliationID": "60057457", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Oncology, Paediatric Bone Marrow and Stem Cell Transplantation, King Hussein Cancer Center"}}}
