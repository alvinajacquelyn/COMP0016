Five PALs were successfully synthesized from novobiocin in six consecutive steps employing phase transfer catalytic glycosylation. Reactions were monitored and guided by analytical LC/MS which led to different strategies of adding either a PAL precursor or a sugar moiety first. The structures and bonding linkages of these compounds were characterised by various 2D-NMR spectroscopy and MS techniques. Synthetic techniques provide powerful probes for unknown protein binding pockets.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["2D-NMR spectroscopy", "Binding pockets", "C-terminal domains", "Phase transfer", "Protein binding", "Structure activity relationships", "Synthesis and characterizations", "Synthetic techniques", "HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins", "Indicators and Reagents", "Molecular Structure", "Photoaffinity Labels"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85013059413", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"], ["Organic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1605"]], "AuthorData": {"56820896700": {"Name": "Simon B.", "AuthorID": "56820896700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmaceutical and Biological Chemistry, School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "57193341493": {"Name": "Huang X.", "AuthorID": "57193341493", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmaceutical and Biological Chemistry, School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "57193335241": {"Name": "Sun G.", "AuthorID": "57193335241", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmaceutical and Biological Chemistry, School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "55682381100": {"Name": "Yang M.", "AuthorID": "55682381100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmaceutical and Biological Chemistry, School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "7102390695": {"Name": "Ju H.", "AuthorID": "7102390695", "AffiliationID": "60033100", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Analytical Chemistry for Life Science, School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Nanjing University"}}}
