However, its contribution to inequalities in life expectancy has yet to be quantified. Methods: A cohort of 1.1 million English people aged 45 and older were followed up from 2001 to 2010. Multimorbidity was defined as having 2 or more of 30 major chronic diseases. Multi-state models were used to estimate years spent healthy and with multimorbidity, stratified by sex, smoking status and quintiles of small-area deprivation. Results: Unequal rates of multimorbidity onset and subsequent survival contributed to higher life expectancy at age 65 for the least (Q1) compared with most (Q5) deprived: There was a 2-year gap in healthy life expectancy for men [Q1: 7.7 years (95% confidence interval: 6.4-8.5) vs Q5: 5.4 (4.4-6.0)] and a 3-year gap for women [Q1: 8.6 (7.5-9.4) vs Q5: 5.9 (4.8-6.4)]; a 1-year gap in life expectancy with multimorbidity for men [Q1: 10.4 (9.9-11.2) vs Q5: 9.1 (8.7-9.6)] but none for women [Q1: 11.6 (11.1-12.4) vs Q5: 11.5 (11.1-12.2)]. Inequalities were attenuated but not fully attributable to socio-economic differences in smoking prevalence: multimorbidity onset was latest for never smokers and subsequent survival was longer for never and ex smokers. Conclusions: The association between social disadvantage and multimorbidity is complex. By quantifying socio-demographic and smoking-related contributions to multimorbidity onset and subsequent survival, we provide evidence for more equitable allocation of prevention and health-care resources to meet local needs.", "AuthorKeywords": ["health expectancy", "inequalities", "mortality", "multi-state modelling", "Multimorbidity"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Chronic Disease", "Cohort Studies", "England", "Female", "Health Status", "Humans", "Life Expectancy", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Multimorbidity", "Poverty Areas", "Risk Factors", "Smoking", "Socioeconomic Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85070791859", "SubjectAreas": [["Epidemiology", "MEDI", "2713"]], "AuthorData": {"57210472874": {"Name": "Chan M.S.", "AuthorID": "57210472874", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Nuffield Department of Population Health, University of Oxford"}, "7005610240": {"Name": "Raine R.", "AuthorID": "7005610240", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Applied Health Research, University College London"}, "6602280300": {"Name": "Bajekal M.", "AuthorID": "6602280300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Applied Health Research, University College London"}, "6603479955": {"Name": "Van Den Hout A.", "AuthorID": "6603479955", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Statistical Science, University College London"}, "24597908600": {"Name": "Pujades-Rodriguez M.", "AuthorID": "24597908600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Epidemiology, Farr Institute of Health Informatics Research, Institute of Health Informatics, University College London"}, "35724190300": {"Name": "Jones M.M.", "AuthorID": "35724190300", "AffiliationID": "60029950", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Primary Care and Population Health, UCL Medical School"}, "7005722061": {"Name": "Matthews F.E.", "AuthorID": "7005722061", "AffiliationID": "60006222", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Ageing, Newcastle University"}, "7006227898": {"Name": "Jagger C.", "AuthorID": "7006227898", "AffiliationID": "60006222", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Ageing, Newcastle University"}}}
