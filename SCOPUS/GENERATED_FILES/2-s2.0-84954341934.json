Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) has been reported to reduce axonal trauma associated with traumatic brain injury in rodent models. However, the optimal dose in American football athletes is unknown. This study examined the effect of differing doses of DHA on serum NFL over the course of a season of American football. Methods In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel design, 81 National Collegiate Athletic Association Division I American football athletes were assigned to ingest either 2, 4, 6 g\u00b7d -1 of DHA or placebo. Blood was sampled at specific times over the course of 189 d, coincident with changes in intensity, hours of contact, and likely changes in head impacts. Standardized magnitude-based inference was used to define outcomes. Results DHA supplementation increased plasma DHA in a dose-dependent manner (2 g\u00b7d -1: mean difference from baseline; \u00b190% CL; 2 g\u00b7d -1: 1.3; \u00b10.6; 4 g\u00b7d -1: 1.6; \u00b10.7%; 6 g\u00b7d -1: 2.8; \u00b11.2%). Serum NFL increased to a greater extent in starters (area under the curve, 1995 \u00b1 1383 pg\u00b7mL -1) versus nonstarters (1398 \u00b1 581 pg\u00b7mL -1; P = 0.024). Irrespective of dose, supplemental DHA likely attenuated serum NFL coincident with increases in serum NFL by likely small and moderate magnitude (effect size = 0.4-0.7). Conclusions Findings from this study, the first large-scale study examining potential prophylactic use of DHA in American football athletes, include identification of optimal dose of DHA, suggesting a neuroprotective effect of DHA supplementation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["CONCUSSION", "DHA", "HEAD TRAUMA", "NEUROFILAMENT LIGHT"], "IndexKeywords": ["Biomarkers", "Brain Concussion", "Dietary Supplements", "Docosahexaenoic Acids", "Double-Blind Method", "Football", "Humans", "Neurofilament Proteins"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84954341934", "SubjectAreas": [["Orthopedics and Sports Medicine", "MEDI", "2732"], ["Physical Therapy, Sports Therapy and Rehabilitation", "HEAL", "3612"]], "AuthorData": {"53868293200": {"Name": "Oliver J.M.", "AuthorID": "53868293200", "AffiliationID": "60019424", "AffiliationName": "Sports Concussion Research Group, Department of Kinesiology, Texas Christian University"}, "57189329844": {"Name": "Kirk K.M.", "AuthorID": "57189329844", "AffiliationID": "60032357", "AffiliationName": "Department of Sport Medicine, John Peter Smith Hospital"}, "57057421300": {"Name": "Gable D.A.", "AuthorID": "57057421300", "AffiliationID": "60019424", "AffiliationName": "Department of Sport Medicine, Texas Christian University"}, "57057713100": {"Name": "Repshas J.T.", "AuthorID": "57057713100", "AffiliationID": "60019424", "AffiliationName": "Sports Concussion Research Group, Department of Kinesiology, Texas Christian University"}, "57056871000": {"Name": "Johnson T.A.", "AuthorID": "57056871000", "AffiliationID": "60019424", "AffiliationName": "Sports Concussion Research Group, Department of Kinesiology, Texas Christian University"}, "7501849515": {"Name": "Jones M.T.", "AuthorID": "7501849515", "AffiliationID": "60021890", "AffiliationName": "Division of Health and Human Performance, George Mason University"}, "6507640983": {"Name": "Norgren N.", "AuthorID": "6507640983", "AffiliationID": "60112896", "AffiliationName": "UmanDiagnostics"}, "6507790467": {"Name": "Andr\u00e9asson U.", "AuthorID": "6507790467", "AffiliationID": "60016437", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Neurochemistry Laboratory, Institute Of Neuroscience and Physiology, University of Gothenburg"}, "56415176000": {"Name": "Blennow K.", "AuthorID": "56415176000", "AffiliationID": "60016437", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Neurochemistry Laboratory, Institute Of Neuroscience and Physiology, University of Gothenburg"}, "6701454676": {"Name": "Zetterberg H.", "AuthorID": "6701454676", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology"}}}
