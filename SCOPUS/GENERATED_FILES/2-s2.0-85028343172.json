HbF, SpO2 and routine clinical and laboratory measures were available in a Tanzanian cohort of 1175 SCD individuals aged \u2265 5 years and the association with SpO2 (as response variable transformed to a Poisson distribution) was assessed by negative binomial model with age and sex as covariates. Increase in HbF was associated with increased SpO2 (rate ratio, RR = 1.19; 95% confidence intervals [CI] 1.04, 1.37 per natural log unit of HbF; p = 0.0004). In univariable analysis, SpO2 was inversely associated with age, reticulocyte count, and log (total bilirubin) and directly with pulse, SBP, hemoglobin, and log(HbF). In multivariable regression log(HbF) (RR 1.191; 95%CI 1.04, 1.37; p = 0.013), pulse (RR 1.01; 95%CI 1.00, 1.01; p = 0.026), SBP (RR 1.008; 95%CI 1.00, 1.02; p = 0.014), and hemoglobin (1.120; 95%CI 1.05, 1.19; p = 0.001) were positively and independently associated with SpO2 while reticulocyte count (RR 0.985; 95%CI 0.97, 0.99; p = 0.019) was independently inversely associated with SpO2. In SCD, improving SpO2, in part through cardiovascular compensation and associated with reduced reticulocytosis, may be a mechanism by which HbF reduces disease severity.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Fetal hemoglobin (HbF)", "Hypoxia", "Oxygen saturation", "Reticulocytes", "Sickle cell disease"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Anemia, Sickle Cell", "Biomarkers", "Blood Gas Analysis", "Child", "Female", "Fetal Hemoglobin", "Humans", "Hypoxia", "Male", "Odds Ratio", "Oxygen", "Reticulocytes", "Tanzania"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85028343172", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"36984246500": {"Name": "Nkya S.", "AuthorID": "36984246500", "AffiliationID": "60071577", "AffiliationName": "Dar-es-Salaam University College of Education"}, "35488523100": {"Name": "Mgaya J.", "AuthorID": "35488523100", "AffiliationID": "60091726", "AffiliationName": "Sickle Cell Programme, Muhimbili University of Health and Allied Sciences"}, "57190187690": {"Name": "Urio F.", "AuthorID": "57190187690", "AffiliationID": "60091726", "AffiliationName": "Sickle Cell Programme, Muhimbili University of Health and Allied Sciences"}, "54924542500": {"Name": "Makubi A.", "AuthorID": "54924542500", "AffiliationID": "60091726", "AffiliationName": "Sickle Cell Programme, Muhimbili University of Health and Allied Sciences"}, "9943207000": {"Name": "Cox S.E.", "AuthorID": "9943207000", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Epidemiology & Population Health, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"}, "35465836500": {"Name": "Newton C.R.", "AuthorID": "35465836500", "AffiliationID": "60008936, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford"}, "9040027500": {"Name": "Mmbando B.P.", "AuthorID": "9040027500", "AffiliationID": "60071565", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Medical Research"}, "57200801395": {"Name": "Makani J.", "AuthorID": "57200801395", "AffiliationID": "60008936, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford"}, "55954889600": {"Name": "Thein S.L.", "AuthorID": "55954889600", "AffiliationID": "60006577", "AffiliationName": "Sickle Cell Branch, National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, The National Institutes of Health"}, "56844970200": {"Name": "Menzel S.", "AuthorID": "56844970200", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "King's College London, Molecular Haematology, Division of Cancer Studies"}, "26643012600": {"Name": "Kirkham F.J.", "AuthorID": "26643012600", "AffiliationID": "60021722", "AffiliationName": "Southampton Children's Hospital"}}}
