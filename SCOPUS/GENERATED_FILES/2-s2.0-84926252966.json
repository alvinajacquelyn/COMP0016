There is a lack of population-based data on predictors of HRQOL in childhood epilepsy. Methods The Children with Epilepsy in Sussex Schools (CHESS) study is a prospective, population-based study involving school-aged children (5-15 years) with active epilepsy (on one or more AED and/or had a seizure in the last year) in a defined geographical area in the UK. Eighty-five of 115 (74% of eligible population) children underwent comprehensive psychological assessment including measures of cognition, behaviour, and motor functioning. Parents of the children completed the Quality of Life in Childhood Epilepsy (QOLCE).Clinical data on eligible children was extracted using a standardised pro forma. Linear regression analysis was undertaken to identify factors significantly associated with total Quality of Life in this population. Results Factors independently significantly associated (p <.05) with total QOLCE scores were seizures before 24 months, cognitive impairment (IQ < 85), anxiety, and parent reported school attendance difficulty. These factors were also significantly associated with total QOLCE when children with IQ < 50 were excluded from analysis. Conclusions The majority of factors associated with parent reported HRQOL in active childhood epilepsy are related to neurobehavioural and/or psychosocial aspects of the condition.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Behaviour", "Cognition", "Epilepsy", "Quality of life"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Child", "Cognition Disorders", "Epilepsy", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Prospective Studies", "Psychological Tests", "Quality of Life", "Regression Analysis", "Seizures"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84926252966", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"26634364600": {"Name": "Reilly C.", "AuthorID": "26634364600", "AffiliationID": "60016437", "AffiliationName": "Gillberg Neuropsychiatry Centre, University of Gothenburg"}, "7402223872": {"Name": "Das K.B.", "AuthorID": "7402223872", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Trust"}, "6507002035": {"Name": "Burch V.", "AuthorID": "6507002035", "AffiliationID": "60112913", "AffiliationName": "Research Department, Young Epilepsy"}, "24479788300": {"Name": "Neville B.G.R.", "AuthorID": "24479788300", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Neurosciences Unit, Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "23968672700": {"Name": "Atkinson P.", "AuthorID": "23968672700", "AffiliationID": "60011982", "AffiliationName": "Child Development Centre, Crawley Hospital"}, "7101634220": {"Name": "Gillberg C.", "AuthorID": "7101634220", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Neurosciences Unit, Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "7404342499": {"Name": "Scott R.C.", "AuthorID": "7404342499", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Trust"}, "6603729064": {"Name": "Aylett S.E.", "AuthorID": "6603729064", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Trust"}, "16030504100": {"Name": "Chin R.F.M.", "AuthorID": "16030504100", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "Muir Maxwell Epilepsy Centre, Edinburgh Neurosciences, University of Edinburgh"}}}
