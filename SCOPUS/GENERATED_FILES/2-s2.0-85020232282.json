Groundwaters that infiltrated prior to the Holocene have been documented in many aquifers and are widely assumed to be unaffected by modern contamination. However, the global prevalence of these \u00e2 - fossil' groundwaters and their vulnerability to modern-era pollutants remain unclear. Here we analyse groundwater carbon isotope data (12C, 13C, 14C) from 6,455 wells around the globe. We show that fossil groundwaters comprise a large share (42-85%) of total aquifer storage in the upper 1 km of the crust, and the majority of waters pumped from wells deeper than 250 m. However, half of the wells in our study that are dominated by fossil groundwater also contain detectable levels of tritium, indicating the presence of much younger, decadal-age waters and suggesting that contemporary contaminants may be able to reach deep wells that tap fossil aquifers. We conclude that water quality risk should be considered along with sustainable use when managing fossil groundwater resources.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85020232282", "SubjectAreas": [["Earth and Planetary Sciences (all)", "EART", "1900"]], "AuthorData": {"54787707200": {"Name": "Jasechko S.", "AuthorID": "54787707200", "AffiliationID": "60002306", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography, University of Calgary"}, "37561862200": {"Name": "Perrone D.", "AuthorID": "37561862200", "AffiliationID": "60012708", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Stanford University"}, "22940314000": {"Name": "Befus K.M.", "AuthorID": "22940314000", "AffiliationID": "60008827", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil and Architectural Engineering, University of Wyoming"}, "7101944452": {"Name": "Bayani Cardenas M.", "AuthorID": "7101944452", "AffiliationID": "60013372", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geological Sciences, University of Texas at Austin"}, "9333935800": {"Name": "Ferguson G.", "AuthorID": "9333935800", "AffiliationID": "60015186", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil and Geological Engineering, University of Saskatchewan"}, "14055919000": {"Name": "Gleeson T.", "AuthorID": "14055919000", "AffiliationID": "60003122", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil Engineering, School of Earth and Ocean Sciences, University of Victoria"}, "23492837000": {"Name": "Luijendijk E.", "AuthorID": "23492837000", "AffiliationID": "60031514", "AffiliationName": "Geoscience Centre, University of G\u00f6ttingen"}, "7101838542": {"Name": "McDonnell J.J.", "AuthorID": "7101838542", "AffiliationID": "60013402", "AffiliationName": "Department for Forest Engineering, Resources and Management, Oregon State University"}, "8106351700": {"Name": "Taylor R.G.", "AuthorID": "8106351700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography, University College London"}, "57195195518": {"Name": "Wada Y.", "AuthorID": "57195195518", "AffiliationID": "60007989", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physical Geography, Utrecht University"}, "7201671604": {"Name": "Kirchner J.W.", "AuthorID": "7201671604", "AffiliationID": "60025038", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth and Planetary Science, University of California"}}}
