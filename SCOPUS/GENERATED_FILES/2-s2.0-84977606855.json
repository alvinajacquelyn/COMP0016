Rather, many \u2013 if not most \u2013 migrations appear to be temporary. In this paper, therefore, we illustrate the estimation challenges when migrations are temporary. As in an overwhelming share of the selective out-migration literature, our basic structure assumes that the process that determines out-migration is unrelated to other choices that affect wage growth, such as human capital investment or labour supply decisions, which greatly simplifies the analysis. When the choice of whether and when to out-migrate also affects decisions that determine wage growth, the problem becomes inherently dynamic and requires a more structural approach to estimation, which we briefly discuss.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Assimilation", "Earnings profile", "Immigration", "Return migration", "Selection"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84977606855", "SubjectAreas": [["Economics and Econometrics", "ECON", "2002"], ["Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management", "BUSI", "1407"]], "AuthorData": {"7004410022": {"Name": "Dustmann C.", "AuthorID": "7004410022", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Economics, Centre for Research and Analysis of Migration (CReAM), University College London"}, "57188728136": {"Name": "G\u00f6rlach J.", "AuthorID": "57188728136", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Economics, Centre for Research and Analysis of Migration (CReAM), University College London"}}}
