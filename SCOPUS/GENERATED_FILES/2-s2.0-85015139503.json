The aims of the workshop were to (1) discuss our current understanding of the genetic, clinical, and chemical basis of small molecule drug hypersensitivity, (2) highlight the current status of assays that might be developed to predict potential drug immunogenicity, and (3) identify the limitations, knowledge gaps, and challenges that limit the use of these assays and utilize the knowledge gained from the workshop to develop a pathway to establish new and improved assays that better predict drug-induced hypersensitivity reactions during the early stages of drug development. This perspective reviews the clinical and immunological bases of drug hypersensitivity and summarizes various experts' views on the different topics covered during the meeting.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Biological Assay", "Drug Hypersensitivity", "Drug Industry", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Humans", "Major Histocompatibility Complex", "Phenotype", "Risk Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85015139503", "SubjectAreas": [["Toxicology", "PHAR", "3005"]], "AuthorData": {"55389933200": {"Name": "Ogese M.O.", "AuthorID": "55389933200", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Drug Safety Science, Department of Molecular and Clinical Pharmacology, University of Liverpool"}, "16737626000": {"Name": "Betts C.J.", "AuthorID": "16737626000", "AffiliationID": "60004219", "AffiliationName": "Pathology Sciences, Drug Safety and Metabolism, AstraZeneca R and D, Darwin Building"}, "57193601166": {"Name": "Alferivic A.", "AuthorID": "57193601166", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Drug Safety Science, Department of Molecular and Clinical Pharmacology, University of Liverpool"}, "7103404706": {"Name": "Faulkner L.", "AuthorID": "7103404706", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Drug Safety Science, Department of Molecular and Clinical Pharmacology, University of Liverpool"}, "7102564665": {"Name": "French N.", "AuthorID": "7102564665", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Drug Safety Science, Department of Molecular and Clinical Pharmacology, University of Liverpool"}, "57196748222": {"Name": "Gibson A.", "AuthorID": "57196748222", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Drug Safety Science, Department of Molecular and Clinical Pharmacology, University of Liverpool"}, "15136654200": {"Name": "Meng X.", "AuthorID": "15136654200", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Drug Safety Science, Department of Molecular and Clinical Pharmacology, University of Liverpool"}, "56492349500": {"Name": "Norris A.", "AuthorID": "56492349500", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Drug Safety Science, Department of Molecular and Clinical Pharmacology, University of Liverpool"}, "7006669713": {"Name": "Pirmohamed M.", "AuthorID": "7006669713", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Wolfson Centre for Personalised Medicine, Department of Molecular and Clinical Pharmacology, University of Liverpool"}, "35478124100": {"Name": "Park B.K.", "AuthorID": "35478124100", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Drug Safety Science, Department of Molecular and Clinical Pharmacology, University of Liverpool"}, "6603779088": {"Name": "Naisbitt D.J.", "AuthorID": "6603779088", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Drug Safety Science, Department of Molecular and Clinical Pharmacology, University of Liverpool"}, "22633786000": {"Name": "Ahmed S.", "AuthorID": "22633786000", "AffiliationID": "60026712, 60110652, 60006222", "AffiliationName": "Alcyomics Ltd c/o Haematological Sciences, Institute of Cellular Medicine, Newcastle University"}, "57200981717": {"Name": "Dickinson A.", "AuthorID": "57200981717", "AffiliationID": "60026712, 60110652, 60006222", "AffiliationName": "Alcyomics Ltd c/o Haematological Sciences, Institute of Cellular Medicine, Newcastle University"}, "57196427048": {"Name": "Hirschfield G.M.", "AuthorID": "57196427048", "AffiliationID": "60019702, 60172612", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Liver Research, NIHR Birmingham Liver Biomedical Research Unit, Institute of Immunology and Immunotherapy, University of Birmingham"}, "56467241700": {"Name": "Kammuller M.", "AuthorID": "56467241700", "AffiliationID": "60009968", "AffiliationName": "Novartis Institutes for Biomedical Research"}, "55349938700": {"Name": "Martin S.F.", "AuthorID": "55349938700", "AffiliationID": "60025641", "AffiliationName": "Department of Dermatology and Venereology, Allergy Research Group, University of Freiburg"}, "55978981600": {"Name": "Musette P.", "AuthorID": "55978981600", "AffiliationID": "60032922, 60000905", "AffiliationName": "Department of Dermatology and INSERM, University of Rouen"}, "7005219893": {"Name": "Purcell A.W.", "AuthorID": "7005219893", "AffiliationID": "60012932, 60019578", "AffiliationName": "Infection and Immunity Program, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Biomedicine Discovery Institute, Monash University"}, "6602775568": {"Name": "Spraggs C.F.", "AuthorID": "6602775568", "AffiliationID": "60020649", "AffiliationName": "Medicines Research Centre, GlaxoSmithKline"}, "56106019100": {"Name": "Whritenour J.", "AuthorID": "56106019100", "AffiliationID": "60006989", "AffiliationName": "Drug Safety Research and Development"}}}
