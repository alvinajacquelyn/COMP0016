This mass model is derived from the circular power law profile through a rescaling of the axes, similar to the case of a singular isothermal ellipsoid. The resulting deflection can be calculated explicitly and given in terms of the Gaussian hypergeometric function. Analytic expressions for the remaining lensing properties are found as well. Because the power law profile lens contains a number of well-known lens models as special cases, the equivalence of the new expressions with known results is checked. Finally, it is shown how these results naturally lead to a fast and accurate numerical scheme for computing the deflection and other lens quantities, making this method a useful tool for realistically modelling observed lenses.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Gravitational lensing: strong", "Methods: analytical"], "IndexKeywords": ["Analytic expressions", "Gaussian hypergeometric functions", "Gravitational lens", "Gravitational lensing: strong", "Lens model", "Mass modeling", "Methods:analytical", "Numerical scheme"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84938809738", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"56768046600": {"Name": "Tessore N.", "AuthorID": "56768046600", "AffiliationID": "60028218", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, Universit\u00e0 di Bologna"}, "7101983827": {"Name": "Benton Metcalf R.", "AuthorID": "7101983827", "AffiliationID": "60028218", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, Universit\u00e0 di Bologna"}}}
