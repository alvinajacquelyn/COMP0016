Phosphate-substituted methacrylate adhesives were modified with 0\u201320 wt % copper-doped glass microparticles. Two shapes of microparticles were used: regular shaped (microspheres) and irregular shaped (microparticles). The morphology/composition, roughness, monomer conversion (DC%), thermogravimetric analysis, and antibacterial action against S. mutans and P. aeruginosa and ion release were investigated. The results showed that microspheres produced adhesives with a relatively smoother surface than microparticles did. The DC% of adhesives increased with increasing glass filler content. Filled adhesives showed polymer decomposition at ~315 \u00b0C and glass melting at 600\u20131000 \u00b0C. The weight loss percent of adhesives decreased with increasing weight percent of fillers. Glass microparticles at 0\u201320 wt % significantly increased the antibacterial action of adhesives against both bacteria. Glass microspheres at 0\u20135 wt % significantly increased the antibacterial action of adhesives against both bacteria. Only 20 wt % microparticle-filled adhesive showed an inhibition zone similar to tobramycin (positive control). Microparticle-filled adhesives (with >5 wt % filler) significantly reduced S. mutans more than their microsphere counterparts. Microsphere-filled adhesives (with \u22645 wt % filler) significantly reduced P. aeruginosa more than their microparticle counterparts. Microsphere-filled adhesives showed higher Cu release than their microparticle counterparts. Accordingly, phosphate-substituted methacrylate filled with glass could be used as an antibacterial adhesive. \u00a9 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Appl. Polym.
