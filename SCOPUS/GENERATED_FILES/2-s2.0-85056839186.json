BBB disruption or vascular disease may expose the brain parenchyma to \u201cforeign\u201d plasma proteins which subsequently impact on neuronal network integrity through neurotoxicity, synaptic loss and the potentiation of microglial inflammation. Here we show that the blood coagulation factor fibrinogen (FG), implicated in the pathogenesis of dementias such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD), induces an inflammatory microglial phenotype as identified through genetic microarray analysis of a microglial cell line, and proteome cytokine profiling of primary microglia. We also identify a FG-mediated induction of non-cell autonomous ER stress-associated neurotoxicity via a signaling pathway that can be blocked by pharmacological inhibition of microglial TNF\u03b1 transcription or neuronal caspase-12 activity, supporting a disease relevant role for plasma components in neuronal dysfunction.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alzheimer\u2019s disease", "ER stress", "Fibrinogen", "Microglia", "Neurodegeneration"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85056839186", "SubjectAreas": [["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"]], "AuthorData": {"26040961100": {"Name": "Piers T.M.", "AuthorID": "26040961100", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Cell Signalling Laboratory, Department of Neuroinflammation, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "10641117300": {"Name": "East E.", "AuthorID": "10641117300", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Cell Signalling Laboratory, Department of Neuroinflammation, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "55312122900": {"Name": "Villegas-Llerena C.", "AuthorID": "55312122900", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "24377245500": {"Name": "Sevastou I.G.", "AuthorID": "24377245500", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Cell Signalling Laboratory, Department of Neuroinflammation, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "7006476466": {"Name": "Pocock J.M.", "AuthorID": "7006476466", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Cell Signalling Laboratory, Department of Neuroinflammation, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "23492858300": {"Name": "Matarin M.", "AuthorID": "23492858300", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuropsychology, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, University College London Hospitals"}, "56210513900": {"Name": "Hardy J.", "AuthorID": "56210513900", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}}}
