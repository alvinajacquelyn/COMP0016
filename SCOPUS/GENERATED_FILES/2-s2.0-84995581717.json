Design A systematic review and meta-analysis. Data Sources Embase, MEDLINE, CINAHL Plus, PsycINFO, and the Cochrane Library from 2000 to January 2016, and reference lists of relevant articles. Eligibility Criteria Any studies that prospectively examined the incident risks of dementia with frailty among community-dwelling older people without language restriction. Results Of 2565 studies identified through the systematic review, 7 studies were included in this review. Of these, 4 studies reported hazard ratios (HR) of incident dementia for physical frailty defined by Cardiovascular Health Study criteria and were included in a meta-analysis. Frailty was a significant predictor of incident Alzheimer disease (4 studies: pooled HR = 1.28, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) = 1.00\u20131.63, P = .05), vascular dementia (2 studies: pooled HR 2.70, 95% CI 1.40\u20135.23, P = .003), and all dementia (3 studies: pooled HR 1.33, 95% CI 1.07\u20131.67, P = .01). Heterogeneity across the studies was low to modest (I2 = 0%\u201351%). A random-effects meta-regression analysis showed that the female proportion of the cohort primarily mediated the association of frailty with Alzheimer disease (female proportion coefficient = 0.04, 95%CI = 0.01\u20130.08, P = .01). Conclusion This systematic review and meta-analysis suggests that frailty was a significant predictor of Alzheimer disease, vascular dementia, and all dementia among community-dwelling older people. Frail women may have a higher risk of incident Alzheimer disease than frail men.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alzheimer disease", "Community-dwelling older people", "dementia", "Frailty"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Alzheimer Disease", "Dementia, Vascular", "Frail Elderly", "Homes for the Aged", "Humans", "Predictive Value of Tests"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84995581717", "SubjectAreas": [["Nursing (all)", "NURS", "2900"], ["Health Policy", "MEDI", "2719"], ["Geriatrics and Gerontology", "MEDI", "2717"]], "AuthorData": {"55224802200": {"Name": "Kojima G.", "AuthorID": "55224802200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Primary Care and Population Health, University College London"}, "23050302300": {"Name": "Iliffe S.", "AuthorID": "23050302300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Primary Care and Population Health, University College London"}, "8214276000": {"Name": "Walters K.", "AuthorID": "8214276000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Primary Care and Population Health, University College London"}, "55307538800": {"Name": "Taniguchi Y.", "AuthorID": "55307538800", "AffiliationID": "60016421", "AffiliationName": "Research Team for Social Participation and Community Health, Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Gerontology"}}}
