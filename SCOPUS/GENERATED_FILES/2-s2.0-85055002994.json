All rights reserved.Autism spectrum conditions (ASC) are a set of neuro-developmental conditions partly characterised by difficulties with communication. Individuals with ASC can show a variety of atypical speech behaviours, including echolalia or the 'echoing' of another's speech. We herein introduce a new dataset of 15 Serbian ASC children in a human-robot interaction scenario, annotated for the presence of echolalia amongst other ASC vocal behaviours. From this, we propose a four-class classification problem and investigate the suitability of applying a 2D convolutional neural network augmented with a recurrent neural network with bidirectional long short-term memory cells to solve the proposed task of echolalia recognition. In this approach, log Mel-spectrograms are first generated from the audio recordings and then fed as input into the convolutional layers to extract high-level spectral features. The subsequent recurrent layers are applied to learn the long-term temporal context from the obtained features. Finally, we use a feed forward neural network with softmax activation to classify the dataset. To evaluate the performance of our deep learning approach, we use leave-one-subject-out cross-validation. Key results presented indicate the suitability of our approach by achieving a classification accuracy of 83.5 % unweighted average recall.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Autism spectrum conditions", "Convolutional recurrent neural network", "Echolalia", "Vocal abnormalities"], "IndexKeywords": ["Autism spectrum conditions", "Autistic children", "Classification accuracy", "Convolutional neural network", "Echolalia", "Learning approach", "Short term memory", "Vocal abnormalities"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85055002994", "SubjectAreas": [["Language and Linguistics", "ARTS", "1203"], ["Human-Computer Interaction", "COMP", "1709"], ["Signal Processing", "COMP", "1711"], ["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Modeling and Simulation", "MATH", "2611"]], "AuthorData": {"56964296000": {"Name": "Amiriparian S.", "AuthorID": "56964296000", "AffiliationID": "60016060", "AffiliationName": "ZD.B Department of Embedded Intelligence for Health Care and Wellbeing, University of Augsburg"}, "57191860582": {"Name": "Baird A.", "AuthorID": "57191860582", "AffiliationID": "60016060", "AffiliationName": "ZD.B Department of Embedded Intelligence for Health Care and Wellbeing, University of Augsburg"}, "57204210994": {"Name": "Julka S.", "AuthorID": "57204210994", "AffiliationID": "60016060", "AffiliationName": "ZD.B Department of Embedded Intelligence for Health Care and Wellbeing, University of Augsburg"}, "57200084423": {"Name": "Ottl S.", "AuthorID": "57200084423", "AffiliationID": "60016060", "AffiliationName": "ZD.B Department of Embedded Intelligence for Health Care and Wellbeing, University of Augsburg"}, "55350497300": {"Name": "Cummins N.", "AuthorID": "55350497300", "AffiliationID": "60016060", "AffiliationName": "ZD.B Department of Embedded Intelligence for Health Care and Wellbeing, University of Augsburg"}, "6603767415": {"Name": "Schuller B.", "AuthorID": "6603767415", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "GLAM - Group on Language, Audio and Music, Imperial College London"}, "36820116100": {"Name": "Alcorn A.", "AuthorID": "36820116100", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Research in Autism and Education, UCL Institute of Education"}, "57197869504": {"Name": "Ainger E.", "AuthorID": "57197869504", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Research in Autism and Education, UCL Institute of Education"}, "57197867029": {"Name": "Petrovi\u0107 S.", "AuthorID": "57197867029", "AffiliationID": "108276167", "AffiliationName": "Serbian Society of Autism"}}}
