The total concentrations of dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (\u03a3DDT) and hexachlorocyclohexane isomers (\u03a3HCH) were in the range of 0.04\u20131.61 and 0.08\u20131.88 ng/g based on dry weight (dw), while the input fluxes were in the range of 0.3\u2013236 and 0.7\u2013295 pg/cm2/y in the core sediments, respectively. The input fluxes of \u03a3DDT and \u03a3HCH generally peaked in sediment layers corresponding to the 1970s\u20131990s and peaked in top sediment layers. The ratio of \u03b1/\u03b3-HCH decreased in the top layer sediments, implying that the contribution of lindane (pure \u03b3-HCH) has been increasing in recent years. In addition, the ratio of o,p\u2032-DDT/p,p\u2032-DDT increased significantly over the last 15\u201320 years, suggesting that dicofol (characterized by high ratio of o,p\u2032-DDT/p,p\u2032-DDT about 7.0) has recently become a relatively more important source of DDT compared to technical DDT itself. The time trends of OCPs recorded in lake sediments examined the impact on such remote alpine regions by human activities.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alpine lake", "DDT", "HCH", "Historical trend", "Sediment core", "Tibetan Plateau"], "IndexKeywords": ["Chromatography, Gas", "DDT", "Environmental Monitoring", "Geologic Sediments", "Isomerism", "Lakes", "Lindane", "Pesticides", "Tibet", "Time Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85009727892", "SubjectAreas": [["Environmental Engineering", "ENVI", "2305"], ["Environmental Chemistry", "ENVI", "2304"], ["Water Science and Technology", "ENVI", "2312"], ["Environmental Science (all)", "ENVI", "2300"], ["Geochemistry and Petrology", "EART", "1906"]], "AuthorData": {"8898220600": {"Name": "Yang R.", "AuthorID": "8898220600", "AffiliationID": "60010689, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Environmental Chemistry and Ecotoxicology, Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "56293656800": {"Name": "Xie T.", "AuthorID": "56293656800", "AffiliationID": "60010689, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Environmental Chemistry and Ecotoxicology, Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "37035480700": {"Name": "Yang H.", "AuthorID": "37035480700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Environmental Change Research Centre, University College London"}, "7402275188": {"Name": "Turner S.", "AuthorID": "7402275188", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Environmental Change Research Centre, University College London"}, "7404976221": {"Name": "Wu G.", "AuthorID": "7404976221", "AffiliationID": "60019499", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Tibetan Plateau Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}}}
