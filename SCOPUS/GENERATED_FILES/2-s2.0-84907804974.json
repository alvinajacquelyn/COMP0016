We develop three heuristic approaches, i.e.; a genetic algorithm, a tabu search algorithm and a hybridization of these heuristics with a truncated branch-and-bound procedure. This hybridization is made in order to accelerate the search process to near-optimal solutions. The branch-and-bound procedure will check whether the solutions obtained by the meta-heuristics can be scheduled within a tight upper bound. We compare the performances of these heuristics on a standard dataset available in the literature. Moreover, the influence of the different heuristic parameters is examined as well. The computational experiments reveal that the hybrid heuristics are able to compete with the best known results from the literature.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Machine scheduling", "SAT"], "IndexKeywords": ["Branch and bounds", "Hybrid tabu search", "Machine scheduling", "SAT", "Unrelated parallel machines"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84907804974", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"], ["Modeling and Simulation", "MATH", "2611"], ["Management Science and Operations Research", "DECI", "1803"]], "AuthorData": {"37122652000": {"Name": "Sels V.", "AuthorID": "37122652000", "AffiliationID": "60033316", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Economics and Business Administration, Ghent University"}, "6602303040": {"Name": "Vanhoucke M.", "AuthorID": "6602303040", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Management Science and Innovation, University College London"}, "6507772652": {"Name": "Coelho J.", "AuthorID": "6507772652", "AffiliationID": "60022650", "AffiliationName": "Universidade Aberta"}, "57209431398": {"Name": "Manuel Dias A.", "AuthorID": "57209431398", "AffiliationID": "60022650", "AffiliationName": "Universidade Aberta"}}}
