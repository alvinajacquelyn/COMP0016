Adults with SCD manifest both systolic and diastolic cardiac dysfunction, though the age of onset of dysfunction has not been defined. Left ventricular (LV) rotational mechanics have not been studied in children with SCD. The aim of this study was to investigate whether cardiac rotational mechanics differed between children with SCD and age-matched controls. Methods: Basal and apical LV short-axis images were acquired prospectively in 213 patients with SCD (mean age, 14.1 \u00b1 2.6 years) and 49 controls (mean age, 13.3 \u00b1 2.8 years) from the Muhimbili Sickle Cohort in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. The magnitude of basal and apical rotation, net twist angle, torsion, and untwist rate were obtained by two-dimensional speckle-tracking. The timing of events was normalized to aortic valve closure. Results: Mean basal rotation was significantly lower in patients with SCD compared with controls (P = .012), although no difference was observed in apical rotation (P = .37). No statistically significant differences in torsion or net twist angle were detected. Rotation rate at the apex (P = .001) and base (P = .0004) were significantly slower in subjects with SCD compared with controls. Mean peak untwisting rate was also significantly slower in patients with SCD (P = .006). No associations were found between hemoglobin concentration and apical rotation, basal rotation, net twist, and torsion. Conclusion: This study demonstrates alterations in LV rotational mechanics in children with SCD, including lower basal rotation, peak differential twist, and untwist rate. These abnormalities denote subclinical changes in LV systolic and diastolic performance in children with SCD. Future work may reveal an association between rotational metrics and long-term patient outcomes.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Left ventricular torsion", "Left ventricular torsion", "Sickle cell disease", "Sickle cell disease"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Anemia, Sickle Cell", "Causality", "Child", "Comorbidity", "Echocardiography", "Female", "Humans", "Incidence", "Male", "Reproducibility of Results", "Risk Assessment", "Sensitivity and Specificity", "Tanzania", "Torsion Abnormality", "Ventricular Dysfunction, Left", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84933042633", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"], ["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"6602777392": {"Name": "Di Maria M.V.", "AuthorID": "6602777392", "AffiliationID": "60028392, 60092830", "AffiliationName": "University of Colorado, School of Medicine, Children's Hospital Colorado"}, "36142920200": {"Name": "Gruenwald J.", "AuthorID": "36142920200", "AffiliationID": "60028392, 60092830", "AffiliationName": "University of Colorado, School of Medicine, Children's Hospital Colorado"}, "7102111568": {"Name": "Kirby K.S.", "AuthorID": "7102111568", "AffiliationID": "60028392, 60092830", "AffiliationName": "University of Colorado, School of Medicine, Children's Hospital Colorado"}, "6507423984": {"Name": "Younoszai A.K.", "AuthorID": "6507423984", "AffiliationID": "60028392, 60092830", "AffiliationName": "University of Colorado, School of Medicine, Children's Hospital Colorado"}, "56699247800": {"Name": "Hsu H.H.", "AuthorID": "56699247800", "AffiliationID": "60018988", "AffiliationName": "Division of Pediatric Cardiology, Children's Hospital and Medical Center, University of Nebraska"}, "14055584500": {"Name": "Al-Naami G.", "AuthorID": "14055584500", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "26643012600": {"Name": "Kirkham F.J.", "AuthorID": "26643012600", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurosciences, UCL, Institute of Child Health"}, "9943207000": {"Name": "Cox S.E.", "AuthorID": "9943207000", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}}}
