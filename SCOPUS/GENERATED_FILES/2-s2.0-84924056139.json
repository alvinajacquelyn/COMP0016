It is shown that by periodic reprojection of the wave function and dynamically altering the basis set size, the method can account for a wave function which spreads out to cover a large area in phase space while still keeping computational expense low and ensuring the preservation of coherence of the wave function. The HHG spectra obtained show good agreement with those from a time-dependent Schr\u00f6dinger equation solver. We show also that the part of the wave function which is responsible for HHG moves along a periodic orbit which is far from that of classical motion. Although this paper is a proof of principle and therefore focused on a simple one-dimensional system, future generalizations for the multielectron case are discussed.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Classical motion", "Computational expense", "Dinger equation", "Gaussian Wave Packets", "High order harmonic generation", "One-dimensional systems", "Periodic orbits", "Proof of principles"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84924056139", "SubjectAreas": [["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"]], "AuthorData": {"56536333400": {"Name": "Symonds C.", "AuthorID": "56536333400", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, University of Leeds"}, "56995969500": {"Name": "Ronto M.", "AuthorID": "56995969500", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, University of Leeds"}, "6701432464": {"Name": "Shalashilin D.", "AuthorID": "6701432464", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, University of Leeds"}, "56147005000": {"Name": "Wu J.", "AuthorID": "56147005000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "24482504800": {"Name": "Zagoya C.", "AuthorID": "24482504800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "8557426100": {"Name": "Figueira De Morisson Faria C.", "AuthorID": "8557426100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}}}
