(2) Who should do a neuropsychological assessment? (3) When should people with epilepsy be referred for a neuropsychological assessment? and (4) What should be expected from a neuropsychological assessment? The recommendations have been broadly written for health care clinicians in established epilepsy settings as well as those setting up new services. They are based on a detailed survey of neuropsychological assessment practices across international epilepsy centers, and formal ranking of specific recommendations for advancing clinical epilepsy care generated by specialist epilepsy neuropsychologists from around the world. They also incorporate the latest research findings to establish minimum standards for training and practice, reflecting the many roles of neuropsychological assessment in the routine care of children and adults with epilepsy. The recommendations endorse routine screening of cognition, mood, and behavior in new-onset epilepsy, and describe the range of situations when more detailed, formal neuropsychological assessment is indicated. They identify a core set of cognitive and psychological domains that should be assessed to provide an objective account of an individual's cognitive, emotional, and psychosocial functioning, including factors likely contributing to deficits identified on qualitative and quantitative examination. The recommendations also endorse routine provision of feedback to patients, families, and clinicians about the implications of the assessment results, including specific clinical recommendations of what can be done to improve a patient's cognitive or psychosocial functioning and alleviate the distress of any difficulties identified. By canvassing the breadth and depth of scope of neuropsychological assessment, this report demonstrates the pivotal role played by this noninvasive and minimally resource intensive investigation in the care of people with epilepsy.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Adult", "Epilepsy", "Minimum standards", "Neuropsychology", "Pediatric", "Training"], "IndexKeywords": ["Advisory Committees", "Cognition Disorders", "Epilepsy", "Health Care Surveys", "Humans", "International Cooperation", "Neuropsychological Tests", "Neuropsychology", "Reproducibility of Results"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84929327170", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"7404784816": {"Name": "Wilson S.J.", "AuthorID": "7404784816", "AffiliationID": "60005087", "AffiliationName": "Comprehensive Epilepsy Program, Austin Health"}, "7004038207": {"Name": "Baxendale S.", "AuthorID": "7004038207", "AffiliationID": "60024544, 60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Experimental Epilepsy, UCL Institute of Neurology, NIHR University College London Hospitals Biomedical Research Centre"}, "7102231870": {"Name": "Barr W.", "AuthorID": "7102231870", "AffiliationID": "60024541", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Neurology and Psychiatry, NYU School of Medicine"}, "57217604085": {"Name": "Hamed S.", "AuthorID": "57217604085", "AffiliationID": "60000617", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology and Psychiatry, Assiut University Hospital"}, "6603924268": {"Name": "Langfitt J.", "AuthorID": "6603924268", "AffiliationID": "60024746", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Neurology and Psychiatry, University of Rochester Medical Center"}, "7006743915": {"Name": "Samson S.", "AuthorID": "7006743915", "AffiliationID": "60104665", "AffiliationName": "Neuropsychology and Auditory Cognition, University Lille-Nord de France"}, "16318097500": {"Name": "Watanabe M.", "AuthorID": "16318097500", "AffiliationID": "60017451", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, National Center of Neurology and Psychiatry"}, "7403001272": {"Name": "Baker G.A.", "AuthorID": "7403001272", "AffiliationID": "60020921", "AffiliationName": "University Department of Neurosciences, Walton Centre for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "7005566582": {"Name": "Helmstaedter C.", "AuthorID": "7005566582", "AffiliationID": "60007493", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epileptology, University of Bonn"}, "35508201800": {"Name": "Hermann B.P.", "AuthorID": "35508201800", "AffiliationID": "60025553, 60032179", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, University of Wisconsin, School of Medicine and Public Health"}, "55665395100": {"Name": "Smith M.L.", "AuthorID": "55665395100", "AffiliationID": "60030319", "AffiliationName": "Neurosciences and Mental Health Program, Hospital for Sick Children"}}}
