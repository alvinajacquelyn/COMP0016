However adults and children have different usage patterns. A major challenge with research on mobile phone use is the reliability of self-reported phone activity for accurate exposure assessment. We investigated the agreement between self-reported mobile phone use data and objective mobile operator traffic data in a subset of adolescents aged 11\u201312 years participating in the Study of Cognition, Adolescents and Mobile Phones (SCAMP) cohort. We examined self-reported mobile phone use, including call frequency, cumulative call time duration and text messages sent among adolescents from SCAMP and matched these data with records provided by mobile network operators (n = 350). The extent of agreement between self-reported mobile phone use and mobile operator traffic data use was evaluated using Cohen's weighted Kappa (\u0138) statistics. Sensitivity and specificity of self-reported low (< 1 call/day, \u2264 5 min of call/day or \u2264 5 text messages sent/day) and high (\u2265 11 calls/day, > 30 min of call/day or \u2265 11 text messages sent /day) use were estimated. Agreement between self-reported mobile phone use and mobile operator traffic data was highest for the duration spent talking on mobile phones per day on weekdays (38.9%) and weekends (29.4%) compared to frequency of calls and number of text messages sent. Adolescents overestimated their mobile phone use during weekends compared to weekdays. Analysis of agreement showed little difference overall between the sexes and socio-economic groups. Weighted kappa between self-reported and mobile operator traffic data for call frequency during weekdays was \u03ba = 0.12, 95% CI 0.06\u20130.18. Of the three modes of mobile phone use measured in the questionnaire, call frequency was the most sensitive for low mobile phone users on weekdays and weekends (77.1, 95% CI: 69.3\u201483.7 and 72.0, 95% CI: 65.0\u201378.4, respectively). Specificity was moderate to high for high users with the highest for call frequency during weekdays (98.4, 95% CI: 96.4\u201399.5). Despite differential agreement between adolescents\u2019 self-reported mobile phone use and mobile operator traffic data, our findings demonstrate that self-reported usage adequately distinguishes between high and low use. The greater use of mobile smartphones over Wi-Fi networks by adolescents, as opposed to mobile phone networks, means operator data are not the gold standard for exposure assessment in this age group. This has important implications for epidemiologic research on the health effects of mobile phone use in adolescents.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Adolescents", "Exposure measurement error", "Mobile phones", "SCAMP"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cell Phone", "Cell Phone Use", "Child", "Cognition", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Reproducibility of Results", "Self Report", "Smartphone", "Surveys and Questionnaires"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85032380002", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Environmental Science (all)", "ENVI", "2300"]], "AuthorData": {"56613485800": {"Name": "Mireku M.O.", "AuthorID": "56613485800", "AffiliationID": "60111140, 60011520, 60172638, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health Research Health Protection Research Unit in Health Impact of Environmental Hazards at King's College London and Imperial College London in partnership with Public Health England, Imperial College London"}, "57202113702": {"Name": "Mueller W.", "AuthorID": "57202113702", "AffiliationID": "60009663", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Occupational Medicine"}, "57196234848": {"Name": "Fleming C.", "AuthorID": "57196234848", "AffiliationID": "60111140, 60011520, 60172638, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health Research Health Protection Research Unit in Health Impact of Environmental Hazards at King's College London and Imperial College London in partnership with Public Health England, Imperial College London"}, "57195392766": {"Name": "Chang I.", "AuthorID": "57195392766", "AffiliationID": "60111140, 60011520, 60172638, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health Research Health Protection Research Unit in Health Impact of Environmental Hazards at King's College London and Imperial College London in partnership with Public Health England, Imperial College London"}, "26643338400": {"Name": "Elliott P.", "AuthorID": "26643338400", "AffiliationID": "60111140, 60011520, 60172638, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health Research Health Protection Research Unit in Health Impact of Environmental Hazards at King's College London and Imperial College London in partnership with Public Health England, Imperial College London"}, "7005372398": {"Name": "Toledano M.B.", "AuthorID": "7005372398", "AffiliationID": "60111140, 60011520, 60172638, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health Research Health Protection Research Unit in Health Impact of Environmental Hazards at King's College London and Imperial College London in partnership with Public Health England, Imperial College London"}, "12787193300": {"Name": "Dumontheil I.", "AuthorID": "12787193300", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychological Sciences, Birkbeck, University of London"}, "57203520032": {"Name": "Thomas M.S.C.", "AuthorID": "57203520032", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychological Sciences, Birkbeck, University of London"}, "36898240000": {"Name": "Eeftens M.", "AuthorID": "36898240000", "AffiliationID": "60023146", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute"}, "6603273803": {"Name": "R\u00f6\u00f6sli M.", "AuthorID": "6603273803", "AffiliationID": "60023588", "AffiliationName": "University of Basel"}}}
