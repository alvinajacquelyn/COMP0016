The neurobiological basis of the most persistent and severe form, apraxia of speech, remains elusive. Current neuroanatomical models of speech processing in adults propose two parallel streams. The dorsal stream is involved in sound to motor speech transformations, while the ventral stream supports sound/letter to meaning. Data-driven theories on the role of these streams during atypical speech and language development are lacking. Here we provide comprehensive behavioural and neuroimaging data on a large novel family where one parent and 11 children presented with features of childhood apraxia of speech (the same speech disorder associated with FOXP2 variants). The genetic cause of the disorder in this family remains to be identified. Importantly, in this family the speech disorder is not systematically associated with language or literacy impairment. Brain MRI scanning in seven children revealed large grey matter reductions over the left temporoparietal region, but not in the basal ganglia, relative to typically-developing matched peers. In addition, we detected white matter reductions in the arcuate fasciculus (dorsal language stream) bilaterally, but not in the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (ventral language stream) nor in primary motor pathways. Our findings identify disruption of the dorsal language stream as a novel neural phenotype of developmental speech disorders, distinct from that reported in speech disorders associated with FOXP2 variants. Overall, our data confirm the early role of this stream in auditory-to-articulation transformations.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Brain", "Brain Mapping", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Family", "Female", "Humans", "Language", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Nerve Net", "Neural Pathways", "Neuroimaging", "Pedigree", "Speech", "Speech Disorders", "Speech Perception"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85064239603", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"7003352056": {"Name": "Li\u00e9geois F.J.", "AuthorID": "7003352056", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "57191280661": {"Name": "Bonthrone A.F.", "AuthorID": "57191280661", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "7402275686": {"Name": "Turner S.J.", "AuthorID": "7402275686", "AffiliationID": "60026489, 60009102", "AffiliationName": "Speech and Language Group, Murdoch Children's Research Institute, Royal Children's Hospital"}, "6603576169": {"Name": "Mandelstam S.", "AuthorID": "6603576169", "AffiliationID": "60110201", "AffiliationName": "Florey Institute of Neuroscience and Mental Health"}, "34570227500": {"Name": "Hildebrand M.S.", "AuthorID": "34570227500", "AffiliationID": "60026553", "AffiliationName": "University of Melbourne"}, "7006332397": {"Name": "Scheffer I.E.", "AuthorID": "7006332397", "AffiliationID": "60110201", "AffiliationName": "Florey Institute of Neuroscience and Mental Health"}, "7007072426": {"Name": "Connelly A.", "AuthorID": "7007072426", "AffiliationID": "60110201", "AffiliationName": "Florey Institute of Neuroscience and Mental Health"}, "7403139870": {"Name": "Morgan A.T.", "AuthorID": "7403139870", "AffiliationID": "60026489, 60009102", "AffiliationName": "Speech and Language Group, Murdoch Children's Research Institute, Royal Children's Hospital"}, "35068201700": {"Name": "Mayes A.", "AuthorID": "35068201700", "AffiliationID": "60026489, 60009102", "AffiliationName": "Speech and Language Group, Murdoch Children's Research Institute, Royal Children's Hospital"}, "24576281200": {"Name": "Boys A.", "AuthorID": "24576281200", "AffiliationID": "112948410", "AffiliationName": "Victorian Clinical Genetics Services"}, "23494144700": {"Name": "Smith L.", "AuthorID": "23494144700", "AffiliationID": "60026489, 60009102", "AffiliationName": "Speech and Language Group, Murdoch Children's Research Institute, Royal Children's Hospital"}, "26023695900": {"Name": "Spencer-Smith M.", "AuthorID": "26023695900", "AffiliationID": "60019578", "AffiliationName": "Monash University, Scenic Blvd"}, "11539229900": {"Name": "Parry-Fielder B.", "AuthorID": "11539229900", "AffiliationID": "60026489", "AffiliationName": "Royal Children's Hospital"}, "55696911900": {"Name": "Bahlo M.", "AuthorID": "55696911900", "AffiliationID": "60027468", "AffiliationName": "Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research"}, "7801657283": {"Name": "Scerri T.S.", "AuthorID": "7801657283", "AffiliationID": "60027468", "AffiliationName": "Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research"}}}
