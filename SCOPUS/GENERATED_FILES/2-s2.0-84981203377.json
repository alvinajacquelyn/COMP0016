Aims This study explored comorbidity in intellectual disability (ID) and learning disabilities (LD) in children born extremely preterm (EP; < 26+ 0 weeks\u2019 gestation). Subjects and study design A UK national cohort of 161 EP children and 153 term-born controls without neurosensory impairments was assessed at 11 years of age (the EPICure Study). Outcome measures IQ, mathematics and reading attainment, executive function, visuospatial processing and sensorimotor skills were assessed using standardised tests, and curriculum-based attainment and special educational needs (SEN) using teacher reports. Results Overall, 75 (47%) EP children and 7 (4.6%) controls had ID or LD (RR 10.12; 95% CI 4.81, 21.27). Comorbidity in ID/LD was more common among EP children than controls (24% vs. 0%). EP children with comorbid ID/LD had significantly poorer neuropsychological abilities and curriculum-based attainment than EP children with an isolated disability or no disabilities. LD were associated with a 3 times increased risk for SEN. However, EP children with ID alone had poorer neuropsychological abilities and curriculum-based attainment than children with no disabilities, yet there was no increase in SEN provision among this group. Conclusions EP children are at high risk for comorbid intellectual and learning disabilities. Education professionals should be aware of the complex nature of EP children's difficulties and the need for multi-domain assessments to guide intervention.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Academic attainment", "Extremely preterm", "Learning disabilities", "Mathematics", "Reading", "Special educational needs"], "IndexKeywords": ["Child", "Child Development", "Comorbidity", "Female", "Humans", "Infant, Extremely Premature", "Infant, Newborn", "Intellectual Disability", "Learning Disorders", "Male"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84981203377", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Obstetrics and Gynecology", "MEDI", "2729"]], "AuthorData": {"7406331158": {"Name": "Johnson S.", "AuthorID": "7406331158", "AffiliationID": "60033125", "AffiliationName": "Department of Health Sciences, University of Leicester"}, "55427619500": {"Name": "Strauss V.", "AuthorID": "55427619500", "AffiliationID": "60002634", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Statistics in Medicine, Nuffield Department of Orthopaedics, Rheumatology and Musculoskeletal Sciences, University of Oxford"}, "16425477400": {"Name": "Gilmore C.", "AuthorID": "16425477400", "AffiliationID": "60000891", "AffiliationName": "Mathematics Education Centre, Loughborough University"}, "54996406500": {"Name": "Jaekel J.", "AuthorID": "54996406500", "AffiliationID": "60000064, 60022020", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology and Health Sciences Research Institute and Division of Mental Health and Wellbeing, Warwick Medical School, University of Warwick"}, "7003469597": {"Name": "Wolke D.", "AuthorID": "7003469597", "AffiliationID": "60000064, 60022020", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology and Health Sciences Research Institute and Division of Mental Health and Wellbeing, Warwick Medical School, University of Warwick"}, "7006171979": {"Name": "Marlow N.", "AuthorID": "7006171979", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Women's Health, University College London"}}}
