In this work we discuss how domains can contribute to the evolution of new functions. Domains themselves can evolve through various mechanisms, altering their intrinsic function. Domains can also facilitate functional innovations by combining with other domains to make novel proteins. We discuss the mechanisms by which domain and domain combinations support functional innovations. We highlight interesting examples where changes in domain combination promote changes at the domain level.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Humans", "Neoplasms", "Protein Domains", "Proteins"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84973290083", "SubjectAreas": [["Structural Biology", "BIOC", "1315"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"]], "AuthorData": {"9636068500": {"Name": "Lees J.", "AuthorID": "9636068500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, Division of Biosciences, University College London"}, "55638031200": {"Name": "Dawson N.", "AuthorID": "55638031200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, Division of Biosciences, University College London"}, "36913138800": {"Name": "Sillitoe I.", "AuthorID": "36913138800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, Division of Biosciences, University College London"}, "7006781333": {"Name": "Orengo C.", "AuthorID": "7006781333", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, Division of Biosciences, University College London"}}}
