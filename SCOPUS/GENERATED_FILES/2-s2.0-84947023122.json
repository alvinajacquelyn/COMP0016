All rights reserved.The applications of Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) on the study of dynamic interactions and film drainage between deformable bodies dispersed in aqueous solutions are reviewed in this article. Novel experimental designs and recent advances in experimental methodologies are presented, which show the advantage of using AFM as a tool for probing colloidal interactions. The effects of both DLVO and non-DLVO forces on the colloid stabilization mechanism are discussed. Good agreement is found between the force - drop/bubble deformation behaviour revealed by AFM measurements and the theoretical modeling of film drainage process, giving a convincing explanation of the occurrence of certain phenomenon. However, the behaviour and shape of deformable drops as they approach or retract is still not well resolved. In addition, when surfactants are present further research is needed on the absorption of surfactant molecules into the interfaces, their mobility and the effects on interfacial film properties.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Atomic force microscope", "Deformation", "Dynamic forces", "Film drainage process", "Interfacial properties"], "IndexKeywords": ["Colloidal interaction", "Deformation behaviour", "Dynamic forces", "Experimental methodology", "Film drainage process", "Interfacial property", "Stabilization mechanisms", "Theoretical modeling", "Colloids", "Hydrodynamics", "Microscopy, Atomic Force", "Particle Size", "Solutions", "Surface Properties", "Water"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84947023122", "SubjectAreas": [["Surfaces and Interfaces", "PHYS", "3110"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"], ["Colloid and Surface Chemistry", "CENG", "1505"]], "AuthorData": {"55266053400": {"Name": "Wang W.", "AuthorID": "55266053400", "AffiliationID": "60016087", "AffiliationName": "Beijing Key Laboratory of Urban Oil, Gas Distribution Technology, Department of Mechanical and Transportation Engineering, China University of Petroleum"}, "56818172400": {"Name": "Li K.", "AuthorID": "56818172400", "AffiliationID": "60016087", "AffiliationName": "Beijing Key Laboratory of Urban Oil, Gas Distribution Technology, Department of Mechanical and Transportation Engineering, China University of Petroleum"}, "56818372100": {"Name": "Ma M.", "AuthorID": "56818372100", "AffiliationID": "60016087", "AffiliationName": "Beijing Key Laboratory of Urban Oil, Gas Distribution Technology, Department of Mechanical and Transportation Engineering, China University of Petroleum"}, "56818259200": {"Name": "Jin H.", "AuthorID": "56818259200", "AffiliationID": "60016087", "AffiliationName": "Beijing Key Laboratory of Urban Oil, Gas Distribution Technology, Department of Mechanical and Transportation Engineering, China University of Petroleum"}, "8415156800": {"Name": "Gong J.", "AuthorID": "8415156800", "AffiliationID": "60016087", "AffiliationName": "Beijing Key Laboratory of Urban Oil, Gas Distribution Technology, Department of Mechanical and Transportation Engineering, China University of Petroleum"}, "7004488806": {"Name": "Angeli P.", "AuthorID": "7004488806", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}}}
