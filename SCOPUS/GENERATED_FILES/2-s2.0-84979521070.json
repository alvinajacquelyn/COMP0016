These can be remotely sensed where there is a contrast in electromagnetic properties, which reflect variations of the ice density, acidity and fabric orientation. Internal ice layers are assumed to be isochronous, deep beneath the ice surface, and parallel to the direction of ice flow. The distribution of internal layers is related to ice sheet dynamics, such as the basal melt rate, basal elevation variation and changes in ice flow mode, which are important parameters to model the ice sheet. Radar echo sounder is an effective instrument used to study the sedimentology of the Earth and planets. Ice Penetrating Radar (IPR) is specific kind of radar echo sounder, which extends studies of ice sheets from surface to subsurface to deep internal ice sheets depending on the frequency utilised. In this study, we examine a study site where folded ice occurs in the internal ice sheet south of the North Greenland Eemian ice drilling (NEEM) station, where two intersected radar echograms acquired by the Multi-channel Coherent Radar Depth Sounder (MCoRDS) employed in the NASA's Operation IceBridge (OIB) mission imaged this folded ice. We propose a slice processing flow based on a Radon Transform to trace and extract these two sets of curved ice sheet layers, which can then be viewed in 3-D, demonstrating the 3-D structure of the ice folds.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cryosphere", "Ice sheet layering", "NASA IceBridge", "Radar echo sounding", "Sub-glacial ice flow"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cryosphere", "Electromagnetic properties", "Fabric orientation", "Glacial ice", "Ice sheet", "Ice sheet dynamics", "Penetrating radar", "Radar echoes"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84979521070", "SubjectAreas": [["Information Systems", "COMP", "1710"], ["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"]], "AuthorData": {"56009476000": {"Name": "Xiong S.", "AuthorID": "56009476000", "AffiliationID": "60084281, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Imaging Group, Mullard Space Science Laboratory (MSSL), University College London, Department of Space and Climate Physics"}, "7404871794": {"Name": "Muller J.P.", "AuthorID": "7404871794", "AffiliationID": "60084281, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Imaging Group, Mullard Space Science Laboratory (MSSL), University College London, Department of Space and Climate Physics"}}}
