All rights reserved.Particle-level measurements, especially of differential cross-sections, made in fiducial regions of phase-space have a high degree of model-independence and can therefore be used to give information about a wide variety of Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) physics implemented in Monte Carlo generators, using a broad range of final states. The Contur package is used to make such comparisons. We summarise a snapshot of current results for a number of BSM scenarios; a UV complete model in which the global Baryon-number minus Lepton-number symmetry is gauged; several Dark Matter simplified models, and two generic light scalar models.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Baryon number", "Differential cross section", "Final state", "Lepton number", "Model independent", "Monte Carlo generator", "Scalar model", "The standard model"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85071137751", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"56435539400": {"Name": "Butterworth J.", "AuthorID": "56435539400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, UCL, London"}}}
