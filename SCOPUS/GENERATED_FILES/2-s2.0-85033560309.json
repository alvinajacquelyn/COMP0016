The band-gap energies of the C2/c, Pc, and P63/m structures at pressures of 250, 300, and 350 GPa are calculated using the diffusion quantum Monte Carlo (DMC) method. The atomic configurations are obtained from ab initio path-integral molecular dynamics (PIMD) simulations at 300 K and 300 GPa to investigate the impact of zero-point energy and temperature-induced motion of the protons including anharmonic effects. We find that finite temperature and nuclear quantum effects reduce the band-gaps substantially, leading to metallization of the C2/c and Pc phases via band overlap; the effect on the band-gap of the P63/m structure is less pronounced. Our combined DMC-PIMD simulations predict that there are no excitonic or quasiparticle energy gaps for the C2/c and Pc phases at 300 GPa and 300 K. Our results also indicate a strong correlation between the band-gap energy and vibron modes. This strong coupling induces a band-gap reduction of more than 2.46 eV in high-pressure solid molecular hydrogen. Comparing our DMC-PIMD with experimental results available, we conclude that none of the structures proposed is a good candidate for phases III and IV of solid hydrogen. \u00a9 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Car-Parrinello molecular dynamics", "metallic hydrogen", "nuclear quantum effects", "path-integral molecular dynamics", "quantum Monte Carlo"], "IndexKeywords": ["Car-Parrinello molecular-dynamics", "Metallic hydrogen", "Nuclear quantum effects", "Path-integral molecular dynamics", "Quantum monte carlo"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85033560309", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Computational Mathematics", "MATH", "2605"]], "AuthorData": {"14627363100": {"Name": "Azadi S.", "AuthorID": "14627363100", "AffiliationID": "60175885, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials, Royal School of Mines and the Thomas Young Centre, Imperial College London"}, "55389694200": {"Name": "Singh R.", "AuthorID": "55389694200", "AffiliationID": "109494020", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Sri Guru Gobind Singh College, Sector 26"}, "57219972170": {"Name": "K\u00fchne T.D.", "AuthorID": "57219972170", "AffiliationID": "60020238", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry and Paderborn Center for Parallel Computing, University of Paderborn"}}}
