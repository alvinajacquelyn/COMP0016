AD and bvFTD patients had a lower degree, connectivity density, clustering, path length, betweenness centrality, and small world values compared with subjective cognitive decline. AD patients had a lower connectivity density than bvFTD patients (F = 5.79, p = 0.02; mean \u00b1 standard deviation bvFTD 16.10 \u00b1 1.19%; mean \u00b1 standard deviation AD 15.64 \u00b1 1.02%). Lasso logistic regression showed that connectivity differences between bvFTD and AD were specific to 23 anatomical areas, in terms of local GM volume, degree, and clustering. Lower clustering values and lower degree values were specifically associated with worse mini-mental state examination scores and lower performance on the neuropsychological tests. GM showed disease-specific alterations, when comparing bvFTD with AD patients, and these alterations were associated with cognitive deficits.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alzheimer's disease", "Behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia", "Cognition", "Single-subject gray matter networks", "Structural networks"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Alzheimer Disease", "Cognition", "Female", "Frontotemporal Dementia", "Gray Matter", "Humans", "Logistic Models", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Neuropsychological Tests"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85002582427", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Aging", "BIOC", "1302"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Developmental Biology", "BIOC", "1309"], ["Geriatrics and Gerontology", "MEDI", "2717"]], "AuthorData": {"57189217363": {"Name": "Vijverberg E.G.B.", "AuthorID": "57189217363", "AffiliationID": "60070161", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Haga Ziekenhuis"}, "57204782423": {"Name": "Tijms B.M.", "AuthorID": "57204782423", "AffiliationID": "60008734, 60001997", "AffiliationName": "Alzheimer Centre and Department of Neurology, Amsterdam Neuroscience, VU University Medical Centre"}, "57192270305": {"Name": "Dopp J.", "AuthorID": "57192270305", "AffiliationID": "60008734, 60001997", "AffiliationName": "Alzheimer Centre and Department of Neurology, Amsterdam Neuroscience, VU University Medical Centre"}, "57032075800": {"Name": "Hong Y.J.", "AuthorID": "57032075800", "AffiliationID": "60008734, 60001997", "AffiliationName": "Alzheimer Centre and Department of Neurology, Amsterdam Neuroscience, VU University Medical Centre"}, "7007073571": {"Name": "Scheltens P.", "AuthorID": "7007073571", "AffiliationID": "60008734, 60001997", "AffiliationName": "Alzheimer Centre and Department of Neurology, Amsterdam Neuroscience, VU University Medical Centre"}, "6601957110": {"Name": "Pijnenburg Y.A.L.", "AuthorID": "6601957110", "AffiliationID": "60008734, 60001997", "AffiliationName": "Alzheimer Centre and Department of Neurology, Amsterdam Neuroscience, VU University Medical Centre"}, "6701704380": {"Name": "Teunissen C.E.", "AuthorID": "6701704380", "AffiliationID": "60001997", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Chemistry, VU University Medical Center"}, "7102989379": {"Name": "Barkhof F.", "AuthorID": "7102989379", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Institutes of Neurology and Healthcare Engineering, UCL"}}}
