To that end, we present an iron oxide nanoparticle/wax composite capsule coating that protects the capsule contents from the highly variable chemical conditions of the GI tract. It can be triggered using magnetic hyperthermia initiated from an external AC magnetic field. The coating is produced from pharmaceutically approved materials and is applied using a simple dip-coating process using a gelatin drug capsule as a template. We show that the coating is impervious to chemical conditions found within the GI tract, but is completely melted within two minutes of magnetically-induced heating under biologically-relevant conditions of temperature, pH, buffer and external field strength, allowing the delivery and dispersal of the capsule contents. The overall simplicity of action, durability and non-toxic and inexpensive nature of our drug delivery vehicle demonstrated herein are key for successful drug delivery systems for the kinds of focal therapy being sought for modern precision medicine.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Dip-coating process", "Drug delivery system", "Drug delivery vehicles", "Gastrointestinal tract", "Iron oxide nanoparticle", "Magnetic hyperthermia", "Magnetically-induced heating", "On-demand drug delivery"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84959357992", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"]], "AuthorData": {"6507566162": {"Name": "Che Rose L.", "AuthorID": "6507566162", "AffiliationID": "60078085", "AffiliationName": "School of Fundamental Science, Universiti Malaysia Terengganu"}, "35221969500": {"Name": "McNaughter P.D.", "AuthorID": "35221969500", "AffiliationID": "60000112", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, University of East Anglia"}, "7103244120": {"Name": "Mayes A.G.", "AuthorID": "7103244120", "AffiliationID": "60000112", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, University of East Anglia"}, "51160971600": {"Name": "Bear J.C.", "AuthorID": "51160971600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "56217400400": {"Name": "Parkin I.P.", "AuthorID": "56217400400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "26432363000": {"Name": "Southern P.", "AuthorID": "26432363000", "AffiliationID": "60028113, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Healthcare Biomagnetics Laboratories, Royal Institution of Great Britain"}, "6602573031": {"Name": "Piggott R.B.", "AuthorID": "6602573031", "AffiliationID": "60018654", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Food Research"}, "7103371435": {"Name": "Hills B.P.", "AuthorID": "7103371435", "AffiliationID": "60018654", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Food Research"}, "13409440100": {"Name": "Qi S.", "AuthorID": "13409440100", "AffiliationID": "60000112", "AffiliationName": "School of Pharmacy, University of East Anglia"}}}
