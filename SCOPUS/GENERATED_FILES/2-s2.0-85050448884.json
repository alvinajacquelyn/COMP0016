These countries have significant influence in their respective regions and in the world. The changing global environment means greater political and economic role for the BRICS and other emerging countries. BRICS countries are expected to contribute nearly half of all global gross domestic product growth by 2020. For more than a century, the path of Competition Law has been defined by the developed and industrialized countries of the world. Much later, developing countries and emerging economies came on the scene. They experience many of the old competition problems, but they also experience new problems, and experience even the old problems differently. Where are the fora to talk about Competition Law and policy fit for developing and emerging economies? The contributors in this book are well-known academic and practising economists and lawyers from both developed and developing countries. The chapters begin with a brief introduction of the topic, followed by a critical discussion and a conclusion. Accordingly, each chapter is organized around a central argument made by its author(s) in relation to the issue or case study discussed. These arguments are thoughtful, precise, and very different from each another. Each chapter is written to be a valuable freestanding contribution to our collective wisdom. The set of case studies as a whole helps to build a collection of different perspectives on competition policy.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Antritrust", "BRICS", "Competition policy", "Development", "Globalization", "Inequality", "Market power", "Public interest"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85050448884", "SubjectAreas": [["Social Sciences (all)", "SOCI", "3300"]], "AuthorData": {"55253691100": {"Name": "Bonakele T.", "AuthorID": "55253691100", "AffiliationID": "112757848", "AffiliationName": "Competition Commission of South Africa"}, "55253691200": {"Name": "Mncube L.", "AuthorID": "55253691200", "AffiliationID": "112757848", "AffiliationName": "Competition Commission of South Africa"}, "7202093907": {"Name": "Fox E.", "AuthorID": "7202093907", "AffiliationID": "60108324", "AffiliationName": "New York University School of Law"}}}
