Further follow-up of this cohort provided an opportunity to investigate the effect of antenatal multiple micronutrients on subsequent lung function by measuring spirometry at 7-9 years of age in children born during the trial. 841 children (80% of the cohort) were seen at mean\u00b1SD 8.5\u00b10.4 years. Technically successful spirometry results were obtained in 793 (94.3%) children, 50% of whom had been randomised to micronutrient supplementation. Background characteristics, including anthropometry, were similar in the two allocation groups. Lung function was also similar, mean (95% CI) difference in z-scores (supplementation minus control) was -0.08 (-0.19-0.04), -0.05 (-0.17-0.06) and -0.04 (-0.15-0.07) for forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV<inf>1</inf>), forced vital capacity and FEV<inf>1</inf>/FVC, respectively. Compared with healthy white children, FEV<inf>1</inf> and FVC in the \"healthy\" Nepalese children were \u223c1 (\u223c13%) z-score lower, with no difference in FEV<inf>1</inf>/FVC. We conclude that, compared with routine iron and folic acid, multiple micronutrient supplementation during pregnancy has no effect on spirometric lung function in Nepalese children at 8.5 years of age.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Air Pollution", "Birth Weight", "Body Weight", "Child", "Cohort Studies", "Dietary Supplements", "Double-Blind Method", "Female", "Folic Acid", "Follow-Up Studies", "Forced Expiratory Volume", "Humans", "Iron", "Logistic Models", "Lung", "Male", "Micronutrients", "Multivariate Analysis", "Nepal", "Pregnancy", "Prenatal Care", "Spirometry", "Trace Elements", "Vital Capacity", "Vitamins"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84930385701", "SubjectAreas": [["Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine", "MEDI", "2740"]], "AuthorData": {"16300803400": {"Name": "Devakumar D.", "AuthorID": "16300803400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Global Health, University College London"}, "23486721300": {"Name": "Saville N.M.", "AuthorID": "23486721300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Global Health, University College London"}, "54790609700": {"Name": "Costello A.", "AuthorID": "54790609700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Global Health, University College London"}, "6603217003": {"Name": "Osrin D.", "AuthorID": "6603217003", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Global Health, University College London"}, "7102577078": {"Name": "Stocks J.", "AuthorID": "7102577078", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Respiratory, Critical Care and Anaesthesia Section (Portex Unit), Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "57205934792": {"Name": "Kirkby J.", "AuthorID": "57205934792", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}, "35431405200": {"Name": "Ayres J.G.", "AuthorID": "35431405200", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, University of Birmingham"}, "56039368100": {"Name": "Yadav S.K.", "AuthorID": "56039368100", "AffiliationID": "100381402", "AffiliationName": "Mother and Infant Research Activities"}, "12767143700": {"Name": "Manandhar D.S.", "AuthorID": "12767143700", "AffiliationID": "100381402", "AffiliationName": "Mother and Infant Research Activities"}, "7004320700": {"Name": "Devereux G.", "AuthorID": "7004320700", "AffiliationID": "60015875, 60018298", "AffiliationName": "Child Health Dept, University of Aberdeen, Royal Aberdeen Children's Hospital"}, "55603815000": {"Name": "Wells J.C.K.", "AuthorID": "55603815000", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Childhood Nutrition Research Centre, Institute of Child Health, University College London"}}}
