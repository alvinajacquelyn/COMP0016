Published by Oxford University Press for the Infectious Diseases Society of America. All rights reserved.We report the first use of whole viral genome sequencing to identify nosocomial transmission of varicella-zoster virus with fatal outcome. The index case patient, nursed in source isolation, developed disseminated zoster with rash present for 1 day before being transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU). Two patients who had received renal transplants while inpatients in an adjacent ward developed chickenpox and 1 died; neither patient had direct contact with the index patient.", "AuthorKeywords": ["fatal varicella", "nosocomial transmission", "whole genome sequencing"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Chickenpox", "Cross Infection", "Female", "Genome, Viral", "Herpes Zoster", "Herpesvirus 3, Human", "Humans", "Intensive Care Units", "Kidney Transplantation", "Male", "Middle Aged"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84994711552", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"55800090700": {"Name": "Depledge D.P.", "AuthorID": "55800090700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London"}, "55498702100": {"Name": "Breuer J.", "AuthorID": "55498702100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London"}, "56477609700": {"Name": "Brown J.", "AuthorID": "56477609700", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital VZV Reference Laboratory, Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "57191909339": {"Name": "Macanovic J.", "AuthorID": "57191909339", "AffiliationID": "106178555", "AffiliationName": "Wessex Renal and Transplant Services"}, "57198038296": {"Name": "Underhill G.", "AuthorID": "57198038296", "AffiliationID": "60030999", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Clinical Microbiology, Pathology Centre, Queen Alexandra Hospital, Cosham"}}}
