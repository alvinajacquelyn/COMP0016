The biofilm state and intrinsic/acquired bacterial resistance mechanisms contribute to resistance/tolerance to antibiotics that is frequently observed in P.aeruginosa isolates. Here we describe the isolation and characterization of six novel lytic bacteriophages: viruses that infect bacteria, which together efficiently infect and kill a wide range of P.aeruginosa clinical isolates. The phages were used to formulate a cocktail with the potential to eliminate P.aeruginosaPAO1 planktonic cultures. Two biofilm models were studied, one static and one dynamic, and the phage cocktail was assessed for its ability to reduce and disperse the biofilm biomass. For the static model, after 4h of contact with the phage suspension (MOI 10) more than 95% of biofilm biomass was eliminated. In the flow biofilm model, a slower rate of activity by the phage was observed, but 48h after addition of the phage cocktail the biofilm was dispersed, with most cells eliminated (>4logs) comparing with the control. This cocktail has the potential for development as a therapeutic to control P.aeruginosa infections, which are predominantly biofilm centred.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Bacteriophages", "Biofilms", "Humans", "Pseudomonas aeruginosa", "Pseudomonas Infections"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84953363184", "SubjectAreas": [["Biotechnology", "BIOC", "1305"], ["Bioengineering", "CENG", "1502"], ["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology", "IMMU", "2402"]], "AuthorData": {"56123921600": {"Name": "Alves D.", "AuthorID": "56123921600", "AffiliationID": "60030480", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Bath"}, "56125368400": {"Name": "Bean J.", "AuthorID": "56125368400", "AffiliationID": "60030480", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Bath"}, "7202458121": {"Name": "Jenkins A.", "AuthorID": "7202458121", "AffiliationID": "60030480", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Bath"}, "56436812200": {"Name": "Perez-Esteban P.", "AuthorID": "56436812200", "AffiliationID": "60030480", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University of Bath"}, "6602071317": {"Name": "Arnot T.", "AuthorID": "6602071317", "AffiliationID": "60030480", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University of Bath"}, "55675960900": {"Name": "Kot W.", "AuthorID": "55675960900", "AffiliationID": "60029616", "AffiliationName": "Department of Environmental Science, Aarhus Universitet"}, "35465103700": {"Name": "Hansen L.", "AuthorID": "35465103700", "AffiliationID": "60029616", "AffiliationName": "Department of Environmental Science, Aarhus Universitet"}, "35481958800": {"Name": "Enright M.", "AuthorID": "35481958800", "AffiliationID": "60022046", "AffiliationName": "School of Healthcare Sciences, Manchester Metropolitan University"}}}
