In particular,wefocus on see saw models within the minimal setup as well as with extended gauge and/or Higgs sectors, and on supersymmetric neutrino mass models with seesaw mechanism and with R-parity violation. In the simplest type-I seesaw scenario with sterile neutrinos, we summarize and update the current experimental constraints on the sterile neutrino mass and its mixing with the active neutrinos.We also discuss the future experimental prospectsoftesting the seesaw mechanism at colliders and in related low-energy searches for rare processes, such as lepton flavor violation and neutrinoless double beta decay. The implications of the discovery of lepton number violation at the Large Hadron Collider for leptogenesis are also studied.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Beyond the standard model", "Collider physics", "Neutrinos"], "IndexKeywords": ["Large Hadron Collider", "Lepton flavor violation", "Lepton number violations", "Neutrino mass models", "Neutrinoless double-beta decays", "Neutrinos", "Sterile neutrinos", "The standard model"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84980378460", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"8903178300": {"Name": "Deppisch F.F.", "AuthorID": "8903178300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "57195551051": {"Name": "Dev P.S.B.", "AuthorID": "57195551051", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "Consortium for Fundamental Physics, School of Physics and Astronomy, University of Manchester"}, "56066371600": {"Name": "Pilaftsis A.", "AuthorID": "56066371600", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "Consortium for Fundamental Physics, School of Physics and Astronomy, University of Manchester"}}}
