Yet balancing economic gains and environmental consequences induced by trade is still hindered by a lack of quantification of these two factors, especially for the environmental problems those are more locally oriented, such as the atmospheric pollution. Based on an environmental input\u2013output analysis for 2010, we contrast economic gains (value added) against atmospheric pollutant emissions (sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitric oxide (NOx), primary fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOC)) and the widely concerned CO2 emissions associated with international and interprovincial exports from Beijing\u2013Tianjin\u2013Hebei (BTH), the most polluted area in China. Our results show that exports contributed 55\u201362% of BTH's production emissions and 54% of its total value added. BTH's large exports of metals and metal products, nonmetal mineral products, chemical and transportation and warehousing, generated a larger share of pollutant emissions (36\u201346% of BTH's total) than that of value added (17%) along the supply chain. Most of BTH's embodied emissions in exports go to neighboring provinces and the developed east coastal regions in China, although the economic returns are comparatively low. Among BTH, industrial production in Beijing and Tianjin lead to more pollutant emission than value added in Hebei, due to reliance on pollution-intensive product imports from Hebei. Our results call for refocusing and restructuring of BTH's industry and trade structures to balance the economic gains and environmental losses for each region.", "AuthorKeywords": ["BTH", "CO2", "Exports", "Pollutant emissions", "Value added"], "IndexKeywords": ["Atmospheric pollutant emissions", "Environmental consequences", "Environmental problems", "Exports", "Fine particulate matter (PM2.5)", "Non-methane volatile organic compounds", "Pollutant emission", "Value added"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84963860016", "SubjectAreas": [["Building and Construction", "ENGI", "2215"], ["Energy (all)", "ENER", "2100"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"], ["Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law", "ENVI", "2308"]], "AuthorData": {"56447312900": {"Name": "Zhao H.", "AuthorID": "56447312900", "AffiliationID": "60025278, 60001604", "AffiliationName": "Ministry of Education Key Laboratory for Earth System Modeling, Center for Earth System Science, Tsinghua University"}, "55624488227": {"Name": "Zhang Q.", "AuthorID": "55624488227", "AffiliationID": "60025278, 60001604", "AffiliationName": "Ministry of Education Key Laboratory for Earth System Modeling, Center for Earth System Science, Tsinghua University"}, "15839411900": {"Name": "Guan D.", "AuthorID": "15839411900", "AffiliationID": "60000112, 60122652", "AffiliationName": "Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research, School of International Development, University of East Anglia"}, "7202010686": {"Name": "He K.", "AuthorID": "7202010686", "AffiliationID": "60025278", "AffiliationName": "State Key Joint Laboratory of Environment Simulation and Pollution Control, School of Environment, Tsinghua University"}, "23473244400": {"Name": "Huo H.", "AuthorID": "23473244400", "AffiliationID": "60025278", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Energy, Environment and Economy, Tsinghua University"}, "35337041800": {"Name": "Lin J.", "AuthorID": "35337041800", "AffiliationID": "60014966", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory for Climate and Ocean-Atmosphere Studies, Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences, School of Physics, Peking University"}, "57196426525": {"Name": "Liu Z.", "AuthorID": "57196426525", "AffiliationID": "60031581", "AffiliationName": "Resnick Sustainability Institute, California Institute of Technology"}, "15764137000": {"Name": "Wang H.", "AuthorID": "15764137000", "AffiliationID": "60033100", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Pollution Control and Resource Reuse, School of Environment, Nanjing University"}}}
