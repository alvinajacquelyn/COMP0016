Methods: It was a retrospective cohort study. A total of 100 chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients on conservative therapy were included. Pulse wave velocity (PWV), central systolic blood pressure (cSBP), and central pulse pressure (cPP) were measured. A score was assigned to tertiles of PWV (0\u20132), cPP (0\u20132), and cSBP (0 to the first and second and 1 to the third tertile) based on each parameter\u2019s ability to individually predict cardiovascular outcome. The sum of these scores and three ICPS risk categories as predictors were studied. Finally, we compared discrimination of the ICPS risk categories with PWV, cSBP, and cPP. Results: Adjusted for age and sex, patients in high and very high ICPS risk categories had increased cardiovascular risk (HR: 3.52, 95% CI: 1.65\u20137.49; HR: 7.56, 95% CI: 3.20\u201317.85, respectively). High and very high ICPS risk categories remained independent predictors in a model adjusted for multiple CV risk factors (HR: 4.58, 95% CI: 1.65\u20137.49; HR: 8.56, 95% CI: 3.09\u201323.76, respectively). ICPS risk categories (Harrell\u2019s C: 0.723, 95% CI: 0.652\u20130.795) showed better discrimination than PWV (Harrell\u2019s C: 0.659, 95% CI: 0.586\u20130.732, p = 0.028) and cSBP (Harrell\u2019s C: 0.660, 95% CI: 0.584\u20130.735, p = 0.008) and there has been a tendency of significance in case of cPP (Harrell\u2019s C: 0.691, 95% CI: 0.621\u20130.761, p = 0.170). Conclusion: The ICPS score may clinically importantly improve the identification of CKD patients with elevated cardiovascular risk.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cardiovascular outcome", "Central blood pressure", "Central pulse pressure", "Chronic kidney disease", "Pulse wave velocity"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Blood Pressure", "Cardiovascular Diseases", "Cohort Studies", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Pulse Wave Analysis", "Renal Insufficiency, Chronic", "Retrospective Studies", "Risk Assessment", "Risk Factors", "Vascular Stiffness"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85059224585", "SubjectAreas": [["Physiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2737"]], "AuthorData": {"6507058228": {"Name": "Nemcsik J.", "AuthorID": "6507058228", "AffiliationID": "60024812", "AffiliationName": "Department of Family Medicine, Semmelweis University"}, "7003480687": {"Name": "Tab\u00e1k", "AuthorID": "7003480687", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "6603536306": {"Name": "Tisl\u00e9r A.", "AuthorID": "6603536306", "AffiliationID": "60024812", "AffiliationName": "1st Department of Medicine, Semmelweis University"}, "23098961500": {"Name": "Cseprek\u00e1l O.", "AuthorID": "23098961500", "AffiliationID": "60024812", "AffiliationName": "Department of Transplantation and Surgery, Semmelweis University"}, "22134035000": {"Name": "Egresits J.", "AuthorID": "22134035000", "AffiliationID": "110006438", "AffiliationName": "Department of Internal Medicine and Cardiology, Klinikum Klagenfurt"}, "57194034123": {"Name": "Batta D.", "AuthorID": "57194034123", "AffiliationID": "60024812", "AffiliationName": "Department of Family Medicine, Semmelweis University"}}}
