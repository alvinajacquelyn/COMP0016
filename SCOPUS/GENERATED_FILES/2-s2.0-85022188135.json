Materials and methods: We analyzed the neuronal proteins Tau and NFL in umbilical blood of 10 cases of severe-moderate intrapartum asphyxia and in 18 control cases. Results: The levels of both Tau and neurofilament were significantly higher after asphyxia and it appeared to be a correlation between the levels of the biomarkers and the severity of the insult. Discussion: Future studies are warranted to support or refute the value of Tau/NFLin clinical practice. Conclusion: Fetal asphyxia remains a clinical problem resulting in life-long neurological disabilities. We urgently need more accurate early predictive markers to direct the clinician when to provide neuroprotective therapy.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Asphyxia", "biomarkers", "brain injury", "umbilical blood"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Asphyxia Neonatorum", "Biomarkers", "Brain Injuries", "Case-Control Studies", "Female", "Fetal Blood", "Fetal Hypoxia", "Humans", "Infant, Newborn", "Male", "Neurofilament Proteins", "Pregnancy", "tau Proteins", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85022188135", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Obstetrics and Gynecology", "MEDI", "2729"]], "AuthorData": {"57194787062": {"Name": "Toorell H.", "AuthorID": "57194787062", "AffiliationID": "60031699, 60016437, 60027675", "AffiliationName": "Perinatal Center, Institute of Clinical Sciences, University of Gothenburg, Sahlgrenska University Hospital"}, "7102850024": {"Name": "Hagberg H.", "AuthorID": "7102850024", "AffiliationID": "60004111, 60177635", "AffiliationName": "Centre for the Developing Brain, Division of Imaging Sciences and Biomedical Engineering, King\u2019s College London, St. Thomas\u2019 Hospital"}, "6701454676": {"Name": "Zetterberg H.", "AuthorID": "6701454676", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "56415176000": {"Name": "Blennow K.", "AuthorID": "56415176000", "AffiliationID": "101415925", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry and Neurochemistry, Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology"}, "6508349642": {"Name": "S\u00e4vman K.", "AuthorID": "6508349642", "AffiliationID": "60027675, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatrics, Institute of Clinical Sciences, University of Gothenburg"}}}
