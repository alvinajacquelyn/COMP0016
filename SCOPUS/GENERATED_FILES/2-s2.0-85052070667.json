Initially, it was populated primarily by upper-middle class secular-Jewish residents. This group has been steadily diminishing as two other distinct new groups moved into the neighborhood: Ultra-Orthodox Jews and Palestinians. This volatile social mix has caused intense inter-ethnic and intra-ethnic collisions. Based on qualitative and quantitative studies, we argue that the juxtaposition of colonial and neoliberal logics of space reveals a shared, yet fragile, middle-class identity. We suggest that this new geopolitical space of neighboring calls for a discussion of political conflict, housing and current colonial conditions that brings class back to our understanding of the production of contested space.", "AuthorKeywords": ["contested cities", "Geographies of Encounter", "Israel/Palestine", "Jerusalem", "Urban geopolitics"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85052070667", "SubjectAreas": [["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"], ["Urban Studies", "SOCI", "3322"]], "AuthorData": {"57021286000": {"Name": "Shtern M.", "AuthorID": "57021286000", "AffiliationID": "60027161", "AffiliationName": "Department for politics and government, Ben Gurion University of the Negev"}, "8632963600": {"Name": "Yacobi H.", "AuthorID": "8632963600", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Development Planning; The Bartlett School for the Built Environment, University College London"}}}
