We reassessed the psychometric properties of four widely-used scales, namely the Belief in Conspiracy Theories Inventory (BCTI), the Conspiracy Mentality Questionnaire (CMQ), the Generic Conspiracist Beliefs Scale (GCBS), and the One-Item Conspiracy Measure (OICM). Eight-hundred-and-three U. S. adults completed all measures, along with measures of endorsement of 9/11 and antivaccination conspiracy theories. Through both exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis, we found that only the BCTI had acceptable factorial validity. We failed to confirm the factor structures of the CMQ and the GBCS, suggesting these measures had poor factorial validity. Indices of convergent validity were acceptable for the BCTI, but weaker for the other measures. Based on these findings, we provide suggestions for the future refinement in the measurement of conspiracist ideation.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Culture", "Factor Analysis, Statistical", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Politics", "Psychometrics", "Reproducibility of Results", "Thinking", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85013657180", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"10639213000": {"Name": "Swami V.", "AuthorID": "10639213000", "AffiliationID": "100429731", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, HELP University College"}, "55774493300": {"Name": "Barron D.", "AuthorID": "55774493300", "AffiliationID": "60000508", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, University of Westminster"}, "57038480400": {"Name": "Weis L.", "AuthorID": "57038480400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical, Educational, and Health Psychology, University College London"}, "36045985300": {"Name": "Furnham A.", "AuthorID": "36045985300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical, Educational, and Health Psychology, University College London"}, "7003718328": {"Name": "Voracek M.", "AuthorID": "7003718328", "AffiliationID": "60025988", "AffiliationName": "Department of Basic Psychological Research and Research Methods, School of Psychology, University of Vienna"}, "6601987602": {"Name": "Stieger S.", "AuthorID": "6601987602", "AffiliationID": "60025525", "AffiliationName": "Research Methods, Assessment, and iScience, Department of Psychology, University of Konstanz"}}}
