The pH-responsive core of the prepared nanogels was based on poly(L-histidine), the difunctional N-carboxy anhydride of l-cystine (l-Cys-NCA) was used as a reduction-cleavable cross-linking agent, while the outer hydrophilic corona was comprised of a poly(ethylene oxide) block. Extensive molecular characterization studies were conducted in order to confirm the formation of the desired polymeric nanostructures and also to prove their responsiveness to external stimuli within the physiological values of healthy and cancer tissues. Furthermore, the disruption of the disulfide-bond linkages between the polymeric chains was achieved by the presence of the reductive tripeptide glutathione (GSH), leading to size variations that were monitored by dynamic light scattering (DLS) and size-exclusion chromatography (SEC). \"Stealth\" properties of the formed nanostructures were examined by zeta potential measurements. The described nanogels are clearly promising candidates for drug delivery applications.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Nanoparticles", "Poly(L-histidine)", "Polypeptides", "Redox chemistry", "Ring-opening polymerization"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cross linking agents", "Drug delivery applications", "Hydrophilic corona", "Molecular characterization", "Polies (lhistidine)", "Redox chemistry", "Stimuli-responsive", "Zeta potential measurements"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84961841678", "SubjectAreas": [["Polymers and Plastics", "MATE", "2507"], ["Organic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1605"], ["Materials Chemistry", "MATE", "2505"]], "AuthorData": {"11139880300": {"Name": "Bilalis P.", "AuthorID": "11139880300", "AffiliationID": "60028900", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Athens, Panepistimiopolis"}, "57113719900": {"Name": "Varlas S.", "AuthorID": "57113719900", "AffiliationID": "60028900", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Athens, Panepistimiopolis"}, "57188590061": {"Name": "Kiafa A.", "AuthorID": "57188590061", "AffiliationID": "60028900", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Athens, Panepistimiopolis"}, "7004636195": {"Name": "Iatrou H.", "AuthorID": "7004636195", "AffiliationID": "60028900", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Athens, Panepistimiopolis"}, "15752034100": {"Name": "Velentzas A.", "AuthorID": "15752034100", "AffiliationID": "60028900", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell Biology and Biophysics, Faculty of Biology, University of Athens, Panepistimiopolis"}, "6603285712": {"Name": "Stravopodis D.", "AuthorID": "6603285712", "AffiliationID": "60028900", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell Biology and Biophysics, Faculty of Biology, University of Athens, Panepistimiopolis"}}}
