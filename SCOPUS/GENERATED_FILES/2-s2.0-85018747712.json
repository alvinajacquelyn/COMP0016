Whereas the ratio is in tolerable agreement with that found in a high resolution spectrometer experiment, the angular distribution in the final pn rest frame shows that the deviation from the predictions of final state interaction theory must originate primarily from higher partial waves in the pn system. These considerations might also be significant for the determination of the S-wave \u039bp scattering length from data on the pp\u2192K+\u039bp reaction.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Final state interactions", "Pion production"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85018747712", "SubjectAreas": [["Nuclear and High Energy Physics", "PHYS", "3106"]], "AuthorData": {"6701768658": {"Name": "F\u00e4ldt G.", "AuthorID": "6701768658", "AffiliationID": "60003858", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, Uppsala University"}, "7003313816": {"Name": "Wilkin C.", "AuthorID": "7003313816", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Physics and Astronomy Department, UCL"}}}
