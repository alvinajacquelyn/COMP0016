GO accelerates PC hydration, whereas it temporarily retards that of clinker. This difference reflects a twofold behaviour of GO in cement pastes. Retardation is due to the interaction of GO with the surface of hydrating grains, while acceleration results from a seeding effect. Gypsum causes this difference. GO is shown to have little effect on the strength of hardened pastes, and this merely relates to the change of hydration degree, as opposed to reinforcing effect formerly assumed. Overall, GO is not particularly active as a nucleation surface, as it aggregates and behaves in a similar way to inert fillers (e.g. quartz). Polycarboxylate-ether copolymer could make GO an active seed in cement pastes, as it prevents GO from aggregating. Nevertheless, this was found to occur only in alite pastes but not PC pastes.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alite", "Graphene oxide", "Hydration kinetics", "Polycarboxylate-ether copolymer", "Portland cement"], "IndexKeywords": ["Alite", "Hardened paste", "Hydration degree", "Hydration kinetics", "Polycarboxylate ethers", "Portland cement paste", "Reinforcing effects", "Seeding effects"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85047820925", "SubjectAreas": [["Building and Construction", "ENGI", "2215"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"]], "AuthorData": {"57194217102": {"Name": "Ghazizadeh S.", "AuthorID": "57194217102", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Department of Civil, Environmental & Geomatic Engineering"}, "9839608900": {"Name": "Duffour P.", "AuthorID": "9839608900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Department of Civil, Environmental & Geomatic Engineering"}, "55461062100": {"Name": "Bai Y.", "AuthorID": "55461062100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Department of Civil, Environmental & Geomatic Engineering"}, "7003890182": {"Name": "Skipper N.T.", "AuthorID": "7003890182", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "University College London, London Centre for Nanotechnology, Department of Physics and Astronomy"}}}
