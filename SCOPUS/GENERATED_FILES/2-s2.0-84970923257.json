Published by Elsevier Inc.Stimulation of serotonergic neurotransmission by psilocybin has been shown to shift emotional biases away from negative towards positive stimuli. We have recently shown that reduced amygdala activity during threat processing might underlie psilocybin's effect on emotional processing. However, it is still not known whether psilocybin modulates bottom-up or top-down connectivity within the visual-limbic-prefrontal network underlying threat processing. We therefore analyzed our previous fMRI data using dynamic causal modeling and used Bayesian model selection to infer how psilocybin modulated effective connectivity within the visual-limbic-prefrontal network during threat processing. First, both placebo and psilocybin data were best explained by a model in which threat affect modulated bidirectional connections between the primary visual cortex, amygdala, and lateral prefrontal cortex. Second, psilocybin decreased the threat-induced modulation of top-down connectivity from the amygdala to primary visual cortex, speaking to a neural mechanism that might underlie putative shifts towards positive affect states after psilocybin administration. These findings may have important implications for the treatment of mood and anxiety disorders.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Depression", "Dynamic causal modeling", "fMRI", "Psilocybin", "Serotonin"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Amygdala", "Bayes Theorem", "Brain Mapping", "Fear", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Neural Pathways", "Prefrontal Cortex", "Psilocybin", "Serotonin Receptor Agonists", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84970923257", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"], ["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"]], "AuthorData": {"48662266400": {"Name": "Kraehenmann R.", "AuthorID": "48662266400", "AffiliationID": "60012614", "AffiliationName": "Neuropsychopharmacology and Brain Imaging, Department of Psychiatry, Psychotherapy and Psychosomatics, Psychiatric Hospital, University of Zurich"}, "57203074345": {"Name": "Seifritz E.", "AuthorID": "57203074345", "AffiliationID": "60012614", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, Psychotherapy and Psychosomatics, Psychiatric Hospital, University of Zurich"}, "55509561000": {"Name": "Preller K.", "AuthorID": "55509561000", "AffiliationID": "60012614", "AffiliationName": "Neuropsychopharmacology and Brain Imaging, Department of Psychiatry, Psychotherapy and Psychosomatics, Psychiatric Hospital, University of Zurich"}, "56165978600": {"Name": "Vollenweider F.", "AuthorID": "56165978600", "AffiliationID": "60012614", "AffiliationName": "Neuropsychopharmacology and Brain Imaging, Department of Psychiatry, Psychotherapy and Psychosomatics, Psychiatric Hospital, University of Zurich"}, "55616166900": {"Name": "Schmidt A.", "AuthorID": "55616166900", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychosis Studies, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London"}, "36080215500": {"Name": "Friston K.", "AuthorID": "36080215500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Centre for Imaging Neuroscience, University College London"}}}
