The CSF is known to contain a wide range of endogenous neuromodulatory substances, but their collective influence on neuronal activity has been poorly investigated. We show here that replacing artificial CSF (aCSF), routinely used for perfusion of brain slices in vitro, with human CSF (hCSF) powerfully boosts spontaneous firing of CA1, CA3 and layer 5 pyramidal neurons in the rat brain slice. CA1 pyramidal neurons in hCSF display lowered firing thresholds, more depolarized resting membrane potentials and reduced input resistance, mimicking properties of pyramidal neurons recorded in vivo. The increased excitability of CA1 pyramidal neurons was completely occluded by intracellular application of GTP\u03b3S, suggesting that endogenous neuromodulators in hCSF act on G-protein coupled receptors to enhance excitability. We found no increase in spontaneous inhibitory synaptic transmission by hCSF, indicating a differential effect on glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons. Our findings highlight a previously unknown function of the CSF in promoting spontaneous excitatory activity, and may help to explain differences observed in the activity of pyramidal neurons recorded in vivo and in vitro.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Action Potentials", "Animals", "CA1 Region, Hippocampal", "Cerebrospinal Fluid", "Female", "Humans", "In Vitro Techniques", "Male", "Neocortex", "Pyramidal Cells", "Rats, Wistar"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84920168149", "SubjectAreas": [["Physiology", "BIOC", "1314"]], "AuthorData": {"56004647800": {"Name": "Bjorefeldt A.", "AuthorID": "56004647800", "AffiliationID": "60016437", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physiology, Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, University of Gothenburg"}, "26023039800": {"Name": "Daborg J.", "AuthorID": "26023039800", "AffiliationID": "60016437", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physiology, Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, University of Gothenburg"}, "14120083200": {"Name": "Riebe I.", "AuthorID": "14120083200", "AffiliationID": "60016437", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physiology, Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, University of Gothenburg"}, "6701735143": {"Name": "Hanse E.", "AuthorID": "6701735143", "AffiliationID": "60016437", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physiology, Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, University of Gothenburg"}, "6507790467": {"Name": "Andreasson U.", "AuthorID": "6507790467", "AffiliationID": "60016437", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry and Neurochemistry, Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, University of Gothenburg"}, "6701454676": {"Name": "Zetterberg H.", "AuthorID": "6701454676", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "6507176418": {"Name": "Wasling P.", "AuthorID": "6507176418", "AffiliationID": "60016437", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Neuroscience, Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, University of Gothenburg"}}}
