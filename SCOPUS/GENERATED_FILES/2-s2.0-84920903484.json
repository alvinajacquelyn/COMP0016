Electronic databases were searched for observational studies published from January 1946 to June 2014 related to the association between SSRI exposure during pregnancy and ASD in children. Studies relevant to the association between SSRI exposure during pregnancy and ASD in children were extracted and compiled for meta-analysis evaluation. Ninety-five citations were identified and seven observational studies were included. Four case-control studies were eligible for the meta-analysis and two cohort studies were narratively reviewed. The pooled crude and adjusted odds ratios of the case-control studies were 2.13 (95% CI 1.66-2.73) and 1.81 (95% CI 1.47-2.24) respectively. Low heterogeneity was observed between studies. The two population-based cohort studies, utilizing the same Denmark data set, have conflicting results. The findings of this meta-analysis and narrative review support an increased risk of ASD in children of mothers exposed to SSRIs during pregnancy; however, the causality remains to be confirmed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Autism spectrum disorder", "Pregnancy", "Serotonin reuptake inhibitor", "SSRI"], "IndexKeywords": ["Child", "Child Development Disorders, Pervasive", "Female", "Humans", "Observational Study as Topic", "Pregnancy", "Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects", "Risk", "Serotonin Uptake Inhibitors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84920903484", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuropsychology and Physiological Psychology", "PSYC", "3206"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"], ["Behavioral Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2802"]], "AuthorData": {"55883514900": {"Name": "Man K.K.C.", "AuthorID": "55883514900", "AffiliationID": "60103563, 60006541", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Safe Medication Practice and Research, Department of Pharmacology and Pharmacy, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong"}, "24722281500": {"Name": "Tong H.H.Y.", "AuthorID": "24722281500", "AffiliationID": "60072904", "AffiliationName": "School of Health Sciences, Macao Polytechnic Institute"}, "56479873000": {"Name": "Wong L.Y.L.", "AuthorID": "56479873000", "AffiliationID": "60103563, 60006541", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Safe Medication Practice and Research, Department of Pharmacology and Pharmacy, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong"}, "14043219000": {"Name": "Chan E.W.", "AuthorID": "14043219000", "AffiliationID": "60103563, 60006541", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Safe Medication Practice and Research, Department of Pharmacology and Pharmacy, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong"}, "7102513915": {"Name": "Wong I.C.K.", "AuthorID": "7102513915", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, School of Pharmacy"}, "23568462900": {"Name": "Simonoff E.", "AuthorID": "23568462900", "AffiliationID": "60011520, 60171762", "AffiliationName": "Kings College London, Institute of Psychiatry and NIHR Biomedical Research Centre for Mental Health"}}}
