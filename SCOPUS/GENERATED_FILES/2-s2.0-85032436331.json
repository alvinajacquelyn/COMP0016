Methods Participants (N = 51, 49% female) wore ActivPal accelerometers for 24 h/d for seven consecutive days. Time spent sitting, standing, and being physically active and sit-to-stand transitions were derived for each day. Participants also completed a mood inventory each evening. Multilevel models examined within-and between-person associations of daily physical activity with positive and negative affect, adjusting for age, sex, body mass index, education, and sleep duration. Results Within-person associations showed that a 1-hour increase in daily physical activity was associated with a decrease in negative affect over the same day (B =-0.11, 95% confidence interval [CI],-0.21 to-0.01). Between-person associations indicated a borderline significant association between higher average daily physical activity levels and higher positive affect (B = 1.85, 95% CI =-0.25 to 3.94). There were no between-or within-person associations between sitting, standing, and sit-to-stand transitions with affect. Conclusions Promoting physical activity may be a potential intervention strategy to acutely suppress negative affective states.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Mood", "Negative affect", "Physical activity", "Positive affect", "Sedentary behavior"], "IndexKeywords": ["Accelerometry", "Adult", "Affect", "Exercise", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Monitoring, Ambulatory", "Posture", "Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85032436331", "SubjectAreas": [["Applied Psychology", "PSYC", "3202"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"55219956400": {"Name": "Aggio D.", "AuthorID": "55219956400", "AffiliationID": "60029950, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Department of Primary Care and Population Health, UCL Medical School"}, "57196258090": {"Name": "Wallace K.", "AuthorID": "57196258090", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "57196262763": {"Name": "Boreham N.", "AuthorID": "57196262763", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "7102289942": {"Name": "Steptoe A.", "AuthorID": "7102289942", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "8502496600": {"Name": "Hamer M.", "AuthorID": "8502496600", "AffiliationID": "60000891", "AffiliationName": "School of Sport, Exercise and Health Sciences, Loughborough University"}, "16029356900": {"Name": "Shankar A.", "AuthorID": "16029356900", "AffiliationID": "60029329", "AffiliationName": "Population Health Research Institute, St. George's, University of London"}}}
