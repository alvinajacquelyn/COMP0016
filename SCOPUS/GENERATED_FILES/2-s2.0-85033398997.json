We here study their structure-activity relationship upon human melanoma cells for first time. To this end, human melanoma A375 cells were incubated with Justicidin B and its 4-methoxylated or 4-glycosylated derivatives to evaluate their selective cytotoxicity and study their effects on cell cycle distribution, caspase activation, apoptosis induction using Annexin V-FITC/PI staining, cell morphology and western blot analysis. Diphyllin methyl ether (GI50 = 3.66 \u03bcM) and Justicidin B (GI50 = 1.70 \u03bcM) caused an elevation of both early and late apoptosis populations whereas Diphyllin apioside (GI50 = 0.84 \u03bcM) and its acetate (GI50= 0.39 \u03bcM) enhanced late apoptosis population only (Annexin V-positive/PIpositive). All induced cell cycle arrest at S phase and classic morphological indicators of apoptosis (blebbing, apoptotic bodies, and nuclear fragmentation) accompanied with an elevation of cells with low DNA content (sub-G1). All compounds increased the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio by enhancing Bax expression which evidences the involvement of the mitochondria (intrinsic pathway) in the apoptotic process. These caspase-3/7 results evidence that 4-methoxylation or 4-O-glycosylation of Justicidin B -a caspase independent mitochondrial apoptosis-inducer- triggers caspase-3/7 activation at different times (24h vs. 48h, respectively). Interestingly, the methoxylation causes attenuation of Bcl-2 protein expression contrarily to Diphyllin methyl ether or the O-glycosylated derivatives. Finally, the compounds exhibited significantly less toxicity when tested in adult human dermal fibroblasts and their GI50 in melanoma Sk-Mel-5 cells was not influenced by MDR1/Pgp inhibitors. This study may inform the synthesis of future Diphyllin derivatives with different apoptosis mechanism of action towards human melanoma cells.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Apoptosis", "Caspases", "Cell cycle", "Diphyllin", "Melanoma"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85033398997", "SubjectAreas": [["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"]], "AuthorData": {"56733008100": {"Name": "Al-Qathama A.", "AuthorID": "56733008100", "AffiliationID": "60006848", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacognosy, Faculty of Pharmacy, Umm Al-Qura University"}, "56232425600": {"Name": "Gibbons S.", "AuthorID": "56232425600", "AffiliationID": "60016379", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Pharmacognosy and Phytotherapy, University College London School of Pharmacy"}, "7201826721": {"Name": "Prieto J.", "AuthorID": "7201826721", "AffiliationID": "60016379", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Pharmacognosy and Phytotherapy, University College London School of Pharmacy"}}}
