However, as satisfactory trips might improve a person's attitude towards the used mode, persons may be more likely to use that same mode for future trips of the same kind. Hence, a cyclical process between travel mode choice and travel satisfaction might occur. In this paper we begin to analyse this process\u2014using a structural equation modelling approach on cross-sectional data\u2014for people who engage in walking and cycling for leisure trips in the Belgian city of Ghent. The focus on walking and cycling reflects recent studies indicating that active travel is often associated with the highest levels of travel satisfaction. Results of this exploratory analysis offer tentative support for the idea of a cyclical process: the evaluation of walking and cycling trips positively affects the respondents' attitude towards the respective mode, which in turn has a positive effect on choosing that mode.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Active travel", "residential location", "structural equation modelling", "travel mode choice", "travel satisfaction", "travel-related attitudes"], "IndexKeywords": ["Active travel", "Residential locations", "Structural equation modelling", "Travel mode choices", "travel satisfaction", "travel-related attitudes"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85046682812", "SubjectAreas": [["Environmental Engineering", "ENVI", "2305"], ["Civil and Structural Engineering", "ENGI", "2205"], ["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"], ["Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment", "ENER", "2105"], ["Automotive Engineering", "ENGI", "2203"], ["Transportation", "SOCI", "3313"]], "AuthorData": {"54787558100": {"Name": "De Vos J.", "AuthorID": "54787558100", "AffiliationID": "60033316", "AffiliationName": "Geography Department, Ghent University"}, "16835690400": {"Name": "Van Acker V.", "AuthorID": "16835690400", "AffiliationID": "60116751", "AffiliationName": "Urban Development and Mobility Department, Luxembourg Institute of Socio-Economic Research"}, "6602186586": {"Name": "Witlox F.", "AuthorID": "6602186586", "AffiliationID": "60033316", "AffiliationName": "Geography Department, Ghent University"}, "6603601123": {"Name": "Schwanen T.", "AuthorID": "6603601123", "AffiliationID": "60175816", "AffiliationName": "Transport Studies Unit, School of Geography and the Environment, University of Oxford"}}}
