Published by Elsevier B.V.Mathematical modelling and simulation modelling are fundamental tools of engineering, science, and social sciences such as economics, and provide decision-support tools in management. Mathematical models are essentially deployed at all scales, all levels of complexity, and all levels of abstraction. Models are often required to be executable, as a simulation, on a computer. We present some contributions to the process-theoretic and logical foundations of discrete-event modelling with resources and processes. Building on previous work in resource semantics, process calculus, and modal logic, we describe a process calculus with an explicit representation of resources in which processes and resources co-evolve. The calculus is closely connected to a substructural modal logic that may be used as a specification language for properties of models. In contrast to earlier work, we formulate the resource semantics, and its relationship with process calculus, in such a way that we obtain soundness and completeness of bisimulation with respect to logical equivalence for the naturally full range of logical connectives and modalities. We give a range of examples of the use of the process combinators and logical structure to describe system structure and behaviour.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bunched logic", "Modal logic", "Process algebra", "Resource semantics"], "IndexKeywords": ["Bunched logic", "Decision support tools", "Explicit representation", "Mathematical modelling and simulation", "Modal logic", "Process algebras", "Resource semantics", "Soundness and completeness"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84950335697", "SubjectAreas": [["Theoretical Computer Science", "MATH", "2614"], ["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"]], "AuthorData": {"55554180900": {"Name": "Anderson G.", "AuthorID": "55554180900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "57207511534": {"Name": "Pym D.", "AuthorID": "57207511534", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
