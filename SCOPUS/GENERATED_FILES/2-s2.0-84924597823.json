Preparedness for natural disasters has been a continuous agenda in Japan for geographical and meteorological reasons, and disaster education has been practised in both formal and informal settings. Post-war disaster management and education have taken a follow-up approach, which means that clusters of measures have been developed after critical national-scale disasters have occurred. Following this clustering, with a minor amendment, the article discusses continuity and change in disaster education, looking at the different versions of the national curriculum (the Course of Study) at the compulsory school level. It is argued that disaster education has always been delivered at school in post-war Japan - this is the continuity - however, its treatment in the curriculum has changed over the years, from the scientific knowledge model, to the civic participation model, to the multi-hazard model, to the everyday life model within broader economic, political and social contexts - this is the change. Through this historical description, the article sheds light on the complexity of the field \u2018disaster education\u2019, particularly its two-dimensional aspect, namely, \u2018the science of disasters\u2019 on the one hand, and \u2018life skills for disasters\u2019 on the other. Currently, these two dimensions are addressed within the policy framework of School Safety. It is argued, however, that this complexity has been a challenge in the positioning of disaster education in the Japanese system. The article concludes by exploring the direction that disaster education has been taking since the Tohoku earthquake and tsunami of 2011.", "AuthorKeywords": ["disaster education", "Japan", "preparedness", "school safety"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84924597823", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["History and Philosophy of Science", "ARTS", "1207"]], "AuthorData": {"57191926897": {"Name": "Kitagawa K.", "AuthorID": "57191926897", "AffiliationID": "60026116", "AffiliationName": "Cass School of Education and Communities, University of East London"}}}
