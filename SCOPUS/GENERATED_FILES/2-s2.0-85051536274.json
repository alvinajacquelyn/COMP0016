Since the emergence of group behaviour among many agents can undergo phase transitions, and the action space will not in general be smooth, natural evolution strategies were adopted for updating a policy function. We tested the approach using a well-known flocking algorithm as a target model for our system to learn. With the data obtained from this rule-based model, the MARL model was trained, and its acquired behaviour was compared to the original. In the process, we discovered that agents trained by MARL can self-organize flow patterns using only local information. The expressed pattern is robust to changes in the initial positions of agents, whilst being sensitive to the training conditions used.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Deep learning", "Evolution strategies", "Multi-agent systems", "Neural networks", "Reinforcement learning", "Swarm intelligence"], "IndexKeywords": ["Collective behaviour", "Evolution strategies", "Flocking algorithms", "Individual behaviour", "Local information", "Multi-agent reinforcement learning", "Rule-based models", "Training conditions"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85051536274", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Computational Theory and Mathematics", "COMP", "1703"], ["Theoretical Computer Science", "MATH", "2614"]], "AuthorData": {"57203395488": {"Name": "Shimada K.", "AuthorID": "57203395488", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Computer Science Department, University College"}, "24466639300": {"Name": "Bentley P.", "AuthorID": "24466639300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Computer Science Department, University College"}}}
