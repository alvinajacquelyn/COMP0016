The essence of this approach is in counting runs simulated from a multivariate distribution representing the probabilistic forecasts, which enters the negative inflation regime. The marginal distributions of forecasts are estimated using the series of past forecast errors, and the joint distribution is obtained by a multivariate copula approach. This technique is applied for estimating the probability of negative inflation in China and its expected duration, with the marginal distributions computed by fitting weighted skew-normal and two-piece normal distributions to autoregressive moving average ex post forecast errors and using the multivariate Student t copula.", "AuthorKeywords": ["duration forecast", "inflation forecasting", "multivariate copula analysis", "negative inflation", "probabilistic forecasting", "simulation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Inflation forecasting", "Multivariate copula analysis", "Negative inflation", "Probabilistic forecasting", "Simulation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85042152338", "SubjectAreas": [["Modeling and Simulation", "MATH", "2611"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Strategy and Management", "BUSI", "1408"], ["Statistics, Probability and Uncertainty", "DECI", "1804"], ["Management Science and Operations Research", "DECI", "1803"]], "AuthorData": {"6602678904": {"Name": "Charemza W.", "AuthorID": "6602678904", "AffiliationID": "60105805", "AffiliationName": "VCAS, Vistula University"}, "34771720100": {"Name": "Makarova S.", "AuthorID": "34771720100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "SSES, University College London"}, "57200679760": {"Name": "Wu Y.", "AuthorID": "57200679760", "AffiliationID": "120240812", "AffiliationName": "Anhui Provincial Academy of Social Sciences"}}}
