Myofibroblasts, which are specialized fibroblasts with contractile activity, are involved in its pathogenesis. Toll-like receptor 4 stimulation in fibroblasts induces transcription of genes involved in extracellular matrix remodeling and tissue repair; furthermore, it enhances sensitivity to transforming growth factor-\u03b21 and promotes transition to myofibroblasts. 17\u03b2-Estradiol, by binding to its main receptors, \u03b1 and/or \u03b2, increases the expression of toll-like receptor 4 and the production of proinflammatory mediators by macrophages; moreover, it promotes extracellular matrix production and myofibroblasts contraction and differentiation. The aim of the study was to investigate the expression of toll-like receptor 4 in breast implant capsules and its relationship with estrogen receptors. Methods: The study enrolled 30 women who underwent expander removal following breast reconstruction. Specimens were stained with hematoxylin and eosin, Masson trichrome, immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence for toll-like receptor 4, \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (a marker of myofibroblasts), estrogen receptor-\u03b1, and estrogen receptor-\u03b2. Results: Toll-like receptor 4 was expressed by fibroblasts and myofibroblasts of capsular tissue. Its expression positively correlated with estrogen receptor-\u03b2 expression (p = 0.012). A positive correlation was found between estrogen receptor-\u03b2 and \u03b1-smooth muscle actin expression (p = 0.037). Conclusions: This study demonstrates the expression of toll-like receptor 4 in myofibroblasts of capsular tissue and its correlation with estrogen receptor-\u03b2 positivity. Activation of toll-like receptor 4 and estrogen receptor-\u03b2, and their interplay, may be involved in myofibroblast differentiation and in the profibrotic pathogenic process underlying capsular contracture.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Biomarkers", "Biopsy, Needle", "Breast Implants", "Cohort Studies", "Female", "Fibroblasts", "Fluorescent Antibody Technique", "Humans", "Immunohistochemistry", "Implant Capsular Contracture", "Mammaplasty", "Middle Aged", "Myofibroblasts", "Prosthesis Failure", "Receptors, Estrogen", "Retrospective Studies", "Sensitivity and Specificity", "Toll-Like Receptor 4"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84959277518", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"]], "AuthorData": {"36671963300": {"Name": "Segreto F.", "AuthorID": "36671963300", "AffiliationID": "60032350", "AffiliationName": "Department of Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgery, Center for Integrated Biomedical Research, Laboratory of Microscopic and Ultrastructural Anatomy, Campus Bio-Medico di Roma University"}, "8957413200": {"Name": "Carotti S.", "AuthorID": "8957413200", "AffiliationID": "60032350", "AffiliationName": "Department of Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgery, Center for Integrated Biomedical Research, Laboratory of Microscopic and Ultrastructural Anatomy, Campus Bio-Medico di Roma University"}, "55551095000": {"Name": "Tosi D.", "AuthorID": "55551095000", "AffiliationID": "60032350", "AffiliationName": "Department of Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgery, Center for Integrated Biomedical Research, Laboratory of Microscopic and Ultrastructural Anatomy, Campus Bio-Medico di Roma University"}, "57208940637": {"Name": "Pendolino A.L.", "AuthorID": "57208940637", "AffiliationID": "60032350", "AffiliationName": "Department of Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgery, Center for Integrated Biomedical Research, Laboratory of Microscopic and Ultrastructural Anatomy, Campus Bio-Medico di Roma University"}, "6602306113": {"Name": "Marangi G.F.", "AuthorID": "6602306113", "AffiliationID": "60032350", "AffiliationName": "Department of Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgery, Center for Integrated Biomedical Research, Laboratory of Microscopic and Ultrastructural Anatomy, Campus Bio-Medico di Roma University"}, "56417402800": {"Name": "Morini S.", "AuthorID": "56417402800", "AffiliationID": "60032350", "AffiliationName": "Department of Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgery, Center for Integrated Biomedical Research, Laboratory of Microscopic and Ultrastructural Anatomy, Campus Bio-Medico di Roma University"}, "7003544118": {"Name": "Persichetti P.", "AuthorID": "7003544118", "AffiliationID": "60032350", "AffiliationName": "Department of Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgery, Center for Integrated Biomedical Research, Laboratory of Microscopic and Ultrastructural Anatomy, Campus Bio-Medico di Roma University"}}}
