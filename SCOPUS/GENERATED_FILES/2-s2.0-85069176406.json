In particular, there is an increasing prevalence of smartphone-based techniques for collecting data through embedded sensors and efficient in-situ questionnaires. Models are then built to explore the patterns between these data types. In this paper, we study the application of machine learning for the task of predicting mental states of adverse valence, based on the Photographic Affect Meter data. We present a technique for daily aggregation, which is designed to detect significant negative events. A variety of features is used as input, including GPS-based metrics and features assessing social interactions, sleep and phone usage. Experimental evidence is presented, which suggests that machine learning algorithms could successfully be employed for such a prediction task.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Adverse Valence Index", "Behaviour modelling", "Digital mental health", "Mobile sensing"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adverse Valence Index", "Behaviour modelling", "Embedded sensors", "Experimental evidence", "Mental health", "Mobile sensing", "Prediction tasks", "Social interactions"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85069176406", "SubjectAreas": [["Information Systems", "COMP", "1710"], ["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Hardware and Architecture", "COMP", "1708"], ["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"]], "AuthorData": {"35230178500": {"Name": "Mikelsons G.", "AuthorID": "35230178500", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "University of Oxford"}, "56867428600": {"Name": "Shadbolt N.", "AuthorID": "56867428600", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "University of Oxford"}, "56468916300": {"Name": "Mehrotra A.", "AuthorID": "56468916300", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60111768", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Alan Turing Institute"}, "9743656700": {"Name": "Musolesi M.", "AuthorID": "9743656700", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60111768", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Alan Turing Institute"}}}
