Modern recording technology makes it possible to simultaneously record the activity of hundreds of neurons, and technological developments will soon allow recording of thousands or tens of thousands. As with all experimental techniques, these methods are subject to confounds that complicate the interpretation of such recordings, and could lead to erroneous scientific conclusions. Here we discuss methods for assessing and improving the quality of data from these techniques and outline likely future directions in this field.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Action Potentials", "Animals", "Brain", "Data Accuracy", "Electrophysiological Phenomena", "Humans", "Nerve Net", "Neurons", "Optical Imaging"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84984714666", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"]], "AuthorData": {"57211720309": {"Name": "Harris K.", "AuthorID": "57211720309", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Department of Neuroscience,Physiology and Pharmacology, University College London"}, "6602756128": {"Name": "Quiroga R.", "AuthorID": "6602756128", "AffiliationID": "60033125", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Systems Neuroscience, University of Leicester"}, "22940903300": {"Name": "Freeman J.", "AuthorID": "22940903300", "AffiliationID": "60001224", "AffiliationName": "Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Janelia Farm Research Campus"}, "7406652921": {"Name": "Smith S.", "AuthorID": "7406652921", "AffiliationID": "60020469, 60025111", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell Biology and Physiology, UNC, School of Medicine"}}}
