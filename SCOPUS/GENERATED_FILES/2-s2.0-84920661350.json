All rights reserved.We investigate project scheduling with stochastic activity durations to maximize the expected net present value. Individual activities also carry a risk of failure, which can cause the overall project to fail. In the project planning literature, such technological uncertainty is typically ignored and project plans are developed only for scenarios in which the project succeeds. To mitigate the risk that an activity's failure jeopardizes the entire project, more than one alternative may exist for reaching the project's objectives. We propose amodel that incorporates both the risk of activity failure and the possible pursuit of alternative technologies. We find optimal solutions to the scheduling problem by means of stochastic dynamic programming. Our algorithms prescribe which alternatives need to be explored, and how they should be scheduled. We also examine the impact of the variability of the activity durations on the project's value.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alternative technologies", "Net present value", "Project scheduling", "Stochastic activity durations", "Uncertainty"], "IndexKeywords": ["Activity duration", "Alternative technologies", "Net present value", "Project scheduling", "Uncertainty"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84920661350", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"], ["Modeling and Simulation", "MATH", "2611"], ["Management Science and Operations Research", "DECI", "1803"], ["Information Systems and Management", "DECI", "1802"]], "AuthorData": {"26430396000": {"Name": "Creemers S.", "AuthorID": "26430396000", "AffiliationID": "60112582", "AffiliationName": "Management Department, IESEG School of Management"}, "6603375785": {"Name": "De Reyck B.", "AuthorID": "6603375785", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Management Science and Innovation, University College London"}, "6603259644": {"Name": "Leus R.", "AuthorID": "6603259644", "AffiliationID": "60025063", "AffiliationName": "Research Group ORSTAT, Faculty of Economics and Business, KU Leuven"}}}
