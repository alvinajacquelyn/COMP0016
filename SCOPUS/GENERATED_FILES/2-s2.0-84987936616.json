It is debated if this mechanism exists in large-scale cortical networks in humans. We combined transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) with concurrent electroencephalography (EEG) to directly investigate the effects of two paired associative stimulation (PAS) protocols (fronto-parietal and parieto-frontal) of pre and post-synaptic inputs within the human fronto-parietal network. We found evidence that the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) has the potential to form robust STDP. Long-term potentiation/depression of TMS-evoked cortical activity is prompted after that DLPFC stimulation is followed/preceded by posterior parietal stimulation. Such bidirectional changes are paralleled by sustained increase/decrease of high-frequency oscillatory activity, likely reflecting STDP responsivity. The current findings could be important to drive plasticity of damaged cortical circuits in patients with cognitive or psychiatric disorders.", "AuthorKeywords": ["DLPFC", "EEG", "Plasticity", "STDP", "TMS"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Beta Rhythm", "Electroencephalography", "Female", "Gamma Rhythm", "Humans", "Male", "Neuronal Plasticity", "Prefrontal Cortex", "Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84987936616", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"]], "AuthorData": {"55613454600": {"Name": "Casula E.", "AuthorID": "55613454600", "AffiliationID": "60014416", "AffiliationName": "Non Invasive Brain Stimulation Unit, Department of Behavioural and Clinical Neurology, Santa Lucia Foundation IRCCS"}, "6504027566": {"Name": "Pellicciari M.", "AuthorID": "6504027566", "AffiliationID": "60014416", "AffiliationName": "Non Invasive Brain Stimulation Unit, Department of Behavioural and Clinical Neurology, Santa Lucia Foundation IRCCS"}, "55751811700": {"Name": "Picazio S.", "AuthorID": "55751811700", "AffiliationID": "60014416", "AffiliationName": "Non Invasive Brain Stimulation Unit, Department of Behavioural and Clinical Neurology, Santa Lucia Foundation IRCCS"}, "35228717800": {"Name": "Caltagirone C.", "AuthorID": "35228717800", "AffiliationID": "60027509", "AffiliationName": "Department of System Medicine, Tor Vergata University"}, "36866518200": {"Name": "Koch G.", "AuthorID": "36866518200", "AffiliationID": "60005075", "AffiliationName": "Stroke Unit, Tor Vergata Policlinic"}}}
