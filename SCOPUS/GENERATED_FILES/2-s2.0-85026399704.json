We tested two methods to retrieve the concentration changes. The first uses the measured changes in light attenuation and the modified Beer-Lambert law, and the second uses the absorption and scattering estimated by the measured time-point spread function. The system is able to retrieve the concentration changes with both methods, giving similar results. At the end of forearm ischaemia (t = 5 min), we measured an increase in [HHb] of 16.77 \u00b1 2.52 and 16.37 \u00b1 2.33 \u03bcMol, and a decrease in [HbO2] of \u22126.12 \u00b1 1.62 and \u22125.57 \u00b1 2.02 \u03bcMol for method 1 and 2, respectively. At that same time, the changes in [oxCCO] were \u22120.36 \u00b1 0.33 and \u22121.40 \u00b1 1.20 \u03bcMol, for method 1 and 2, respectively. These small changes in [oxCCO], despite a huge change in haemoglobin, demonstrate the absence of cross-talk and are comparable to previous measurements using broadband NIRS.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cuff Occlusion", "Cytochrome-c-oxidase", "Haemoglobin", "NIRS", "TRS"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Cytochromes", "Feasibility Studies", "Female", "Forearm", "Hemoglobins", "Humans", "Ischemia", "Male", "Monitoring, Physiologic", "Muscle, Skeletal", "Spectroscopy, Near-Infrared", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85026399704", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"56803353300": {"Name": "Lange F.", "AuthorID": "56803353300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "56321547900": {"Name": "Dunne L.", "AuthorID": "56321547900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "6507301690": {"Name": "Tachtsidis I.", "AuthorID": "6507301690", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}}}
