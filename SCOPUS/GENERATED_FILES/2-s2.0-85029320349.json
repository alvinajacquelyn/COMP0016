Although it shares similarities with ischaemic priapism, by definition, stuttering priapism has distinct characteristics that advocate for a different management in the clinical setting. Therefore, the management of stuttering priapism aims primarily to prevent recurrence rather than the resolution of spontaneous attacks. A multimodal approach and the individualization of each case are essential because of the diversity of the condition and the plethora of proposed therapeutic strategies. Understanding the underlying pathophysiology and familiarity with contemporary, past and emerging future agents and therapeutic options are required in order to provide an optimal solution for each patient. In addition, patient counselling and the option to combine therapeutic strategies and challenge second-line therapies are essential weapons in the armament of the urologist. Although further clinical trials and studies are mandatory in order to obtain solid data and provide recommendations, all therapeutic options are analysed, with specific interest in the potential advantages and disadvantages. A structured evaluation procedure is also described.", "AuthorKeywords": ["erectile dysfunction", "ischaemic", "priapism", "recurrent", "sickle-cell disease", "stuttering"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85029320349", "SubjectAreas": [["Urology", "MEDI", "2748"]], "AuthorData": {"57045937000": {"Name": "Kousournas G.", "AuthorID": "57045937000", "AffiliationID": "60027403", "AffiliationName": "St Peter's Andrology Centre London, University College Hospital of London"}, "24339107700": {"Name": "Muneer A.", "AuthorID": "24339107700", "AffiliationID": "60027403", "AffiliationName": "St Peter's Andrology Centre London, University College Hospital of London"}, "55781298300": {"Name": "Ralph D.", "AuthorID": "55781298300", "AffiliationID": "60027403", "AffiliationName": "St Peter's Andrology Centre London, University College Hospital of London"}, "24765500600": {"Name": "Zacharakis E.", "AuthorID": "24765500600", "AffiliationID": "60027403", "AffiliationName": "St Peter's Andrology Centre London, University College Hospital of London"}}}
