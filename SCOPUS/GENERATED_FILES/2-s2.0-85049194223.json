All rights reserved.Health-care professionals, patients, and families seek as much information as possible about prognosis for patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD); however, we do not yet have a robust understanding of how demographic factors predict prognosis. We evaluated associations between age at presentation, age of onset, and symptom length with cognitive decline as measured using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Clinical Dementia Rating sum-of-boxes (CDR-SOB) in a large dataset of AD patients. Age at presentation was associated with post-presentation decline in MMSE (p < 0.001), with younger patients showing faster decline. There was little evidence of an association with change in CDR-SOB. Symptom length, rather than age, was the strongest predictor of MMSE and CDR-SOB at presentation, with increasing symptom length associated with worse outcomes. The evidence that younger AD patients have a more aggressive disease course implies that early diagnosis is essential.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Age factors", "age of onset", "Alzheimer's disease", "cognition", "cognitive decline"], "IndexKeywords": ["Age of Onset", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Aging", "Alzheimer Disease", "Cognitive Dysfunction", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Disease Progression", "Female", "Humans", "Longitudinal Studies", "Male", "Mental Status and Dementia Tests", "Neuropsychological Tests", "Risk Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85049194223", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Clinical Psychology", "PSYC", "3203"], ["Geriatrics and Gerontology", "MEDI", "2717"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"35556415800": {"Name": "Barnes J.", "AuthorID": "35556415800", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60020736, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dementia Research Centre, Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, UCL Institute of Neurology, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "15051425400": {"Name": "Bartlett J.W.", "AuthorID": "15051425400", "AffiliationID": "60004219", "AffiliationName": "StatisticalInnovation Group, AstraZeneca"}, "7004383975": {"Name": "Wolk D.A.", "AuthorID": "7004383975", "AffiliationID": "60006297", "AffiliationName": "Penn Memory Center, Department of Neurology, University of Pennsylvania"}, "8548678900": {"Name": "Van Der Flier W.M.", "AuthorID": "8548678900", "AffiliationID": "60001997", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Neuroscience Campus Amsterdam, VU University Medical Center"}, "7101816884": {"Name": "Frost C.", "AuthorID": "7101816884", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Statistics, Faculty of Epidemiology and Population Health, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}}}
