Here we demonstrate that a sulfur-enriching method, comprising sulfur evaporation and cluster annealing under vacuum conditions, significantly enhances their activity towards the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The S-richness (x = 4.9 \u00b1 0.1) and extended crystalline order obtained in the sulfur-treated MoSx nanoclusters lead to consistent 200 mV shifts to lower HER onset potentials, along with two-fold and more-than 30-fold increases in turnover frequency and exchange current density values respectively. The high mass activities (\u223c111 mA mg\u22121 @ 400 mV) obtained at ultra-low loadings (\u223c100 ng cm-2, 5% surface coverage) are comparable to the best reported MoS2 catalysts in the literature.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Hydrogen evolution", "Magnetron sputtering deposition", "Molybdenum sulfide", "Nanoclusters", "Sulfur-rich"], "IndexKeywords": ["Electrocatalytic properties", "Exchange current densities", "Hydrogen evolution", "Hydrogen evolution reactions", "Magnetron-sputtering deposition", "Molybdenum sulfide", "Molybdenum sulfide nanoclusters", "Turnover frequency"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85046808788", "SubjectAreas": [["Catalysis", "CENG", "1503"], ["Environmental Science (all)", "ENVI", "2300"], ["Process Chemistry and Technology", "CENG", "1508"]], "AuthorData": {"56703318900": {"Name": "Escalera-L\u00f3pez D.", "AuthorID": "56703318900", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "Nanoscale Physics Research Laboratory, School of Physics and Astronomy, University of Birmingham"}, "7005875522": {"Name": "Rees N.V.", "AuthorID": "7005875522", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Research, School of Chemical Engineering, University of Birmingham"}, "57190977698": {"Name": "Niu Y.", "AuthorID": "57190977698", "AffiliationID": "60004572", "AffiliationName": "College of Engineering, Swansea University"}, "57191670862": {"Name": "Park S.J.", "AuthorID": "57191670862", "AffiliationID": "60004538", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of Materials Modification by Laser, Ion and Electron Beams, Department of Physics, Dalian University of Technology"}, "7402727310": {"Name": "Palmer R.E.", "AuthorID": "7402727310", "AffiliationID": "60004572", "AffiliationName": "College of Engineering, Swansea University"}, "55771300200": {"Name": "Isaacs M.", "AuthorID": "55771300200", "AffiliationID": "60014551", "AffiliationName": "European Bioenergy Research Institute, Aston University"}, "7403725899": {"Name": "Wilson K.", "AuthorID": "7403725899", "AffiliationID": "60011362", "AffiliationName": "School of Science, RMIT University"}}}
