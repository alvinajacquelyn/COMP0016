However, little research has focused on the role of explainers in other cultural contexts. This study explored interactions between visitors and museum explainers within the setting of Thailand. Two questionnaires were distributed to 600 visitors and 41 museum explainers. The results demonstrated both potential similarities and differences with Western contexts. Explainers appeared to prefer didactic approaches, focussing on factual knowledge rather than encouraging deep learning. Two-way communication, however, appeared to be enhanced by the use of a \u2018pseudo-sibling relationship\u2019 by explainers. Traditional Thai social reserve was reduced through such approaches, with visitors taking on active learning roles. These findings have implications for training museum explainers in non-Western cultures, as well as museum communication practice more generally.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Science and popular culture", "Science communication", "Science museum"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Attitude", "Child", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Museums", "Questionnaires", "Science", "Thailand", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84925282777", "SubjectAreas": [["Communication", "SOCI", "3315"], ["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"], ["Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)", "ARTS", "1201"]], "AuthorData": {"56563989600": {"Name": "Kamolpattana S.", "AuthorID": "56563989600", "AffiliationID": "60019611", "AffiliationName": "University of the West of England"}, "56593834100": {"Name": "Chen G.", "AuthorID": "56593834100", "AffiliationID": "100524864", "AffiliationName": "National Science Museum"}, "6507190406": {"Name": "Sonchaeng P.", "AuthorID": "6507190406", "AffiliationID": "100524864", "AffiliationName": "National Science Museum"}, "57208031017": {"Name": "Wilkinson C.", "AuthorID": "57208031017", "AffiliationID": "60019611", "AffiliationName": "University of the West of England"}, "6602371964": {"Name": "Willey N.", "AuthorID": "6602371964", "AffiliationID": "60019611", "AffiliationName": "University of the West of England"}, "6506746124": {"Name": "Bultitude K.", "AuthorID": "6506746124", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
