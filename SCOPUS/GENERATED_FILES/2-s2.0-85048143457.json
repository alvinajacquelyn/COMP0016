We aimed to evaluate a 2-year longitudinal multicentre TM trial designed for young ventilated NMD patients in terms of feasibility, home management of exacerbations and caregivers\u2019 burden. Methods: The TM trial protocol included patients\u2019 weekly scheduled overnight home-recording of SpO2, heart rate and ventilation and their transmission to each TM centre the following morning. Overnight data were reviewed by non-physicians and calls to families made to assess clinical condition. If clinical conditions (assessed by a scoring system) or overnight parameters worsened, either unscheduled transmissions or calls were activated and managed by non-physicians or medical team according to severity. Hospitalisations were compared with those of TM patients prior to TM start and with those of age-disease-severity-matched controls. Scores from the Caregiver Burden Inventory (CBI) questionnaire pre- and post-TM were compared. Results: Forty-eight patients were enrolled, 30 males, median age 16.4 years (interquartile range (IQR) 8.9\u201322.1), median ventilation/day 10.5 h (IQR 8\u201316). Exacerbations in TM patients did not differ (59 versus 53; p = 0.15) from controls. Hospitalisations were significantly reduced in TM patients when compared with those prior to TM (11 versus 24, p = 0.04) and to controls (11 versus 21, p = 0.03). Median hospitalisation length was significantly lower in TM patients than controls (6 versus 7 days, p = 0.03). Caregivers satisfaction was excellent whereas no significant changes in CBI were seen (32.5 versus 35.5, p = 0.06). Discussion: TM was effective in improving the home management of respiratory exacerbations in young ventilated NMD patients and overall well tolerated.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Home telecare", "telecare", "telerehabilitation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Caregivers", "Case-Control Studies", "Child", "Female", "Heart Rate", "Hospitalization", "Humans", "Longitudinal Studies", "Male", "Neuromuscular Diseases", "Oxygen", "Respiration, Artificial", "Telemetry", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85048143457", "SubjectAreas": [["Health Informatics", "MEDI", "2718"]], "AuthorData": {"23969732600": {"Name": "Trucco F.", "AuthorID": "23969732600", "AffiliationID": "60016041", "AffiliationName": "Paediatric Neurology and Muscle Disease Unit, Istituto Giannina Gaslini"}, "6603727911": {"Name": "Pedemonte M.", "AuthorID": "6603727911", "AffiliationID": "60016041", "AffiliationName": "Paediatric Neurology and Muscle Disease Unit, Istituto Giannina Gaslini"}, "57218677766": {"Name": "D\u2019Agostino A.", "AuthorID": "57218677766", "AffiliationID": "60016041", "AffiliationName": "Paediatric Neurology and Muscle Disease Unit, Istituto Giannina Gaslini"}, "57190950261": {"Name": "Tacchetti P.", "AuthorID": "57190950261", "AffiliationID": "60016041", "AffiliationName": "Paediatric Neurology and Muscle Disease Unit, Istituto Giannina Gaslini"}, "7006089242": {"Name": "Minetti C.", "AuthorID": "7006089242", "AffiliationID": "60016041", "AffiliationName": "Paediatric Neurology and Muscle Disease Unit, Istituto Giannina Gaslini"}, "15851464300": {"Name": "Racca F.", "AuthorID": "15851464300", "AffiliationID": "60042571", "AffiliationName": "Paediatric Intensive Care Unit, Ospedale SS.
