Where prismatic correction is infeasible, the current standard is occlusion, either by a patch or an opaque contact lens. In eliminating one problem- diplopia-occlusive techniques invariably create another: reduced peripheral vision. Crucially, this is often unnecessary, for the reduced spatial resolution in the periphery limits its contribution to the perception of diplopia. Here, we therefore introduce a novel soft contact lens device that instead creates a monocular central scotoma inversely mirroring the physiological variation in spatial acuity across the monocular visual field, thereby suppressing the diplopia with minimal impact on the periphery. We compared the device against standard eye patching in 12 normal subjects with prism-induced binocular diplopia and 12 patients with binocular diplopia of diverse causes. Indexed by self-reported scores and binocular perimetry, the scotogenic contact lens was comparably effective in eliminating the diplopia while significantly superior in acceptability and its impact on the peripheral visual field. This simple, inexpensive, non-invasive device may thus be an effective new tool in the treatment of a familiar but still troublesome clinical problem.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Bandages", "Contact Lenses, Hydrophilic", "Diplopia", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Prosthesis Design", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "Vision, Binocular", "Visual Field Tests", "Visual Fields"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84938741645", "SubjectAreas": [["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"], ["Sensory Systems", "NEUR", "2809"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"]], "AuthorData": {"24544937000": {"Name": "Robert M.P.", "AuthorID": "24544937000", "AffiliationID": "60123796, 60008134", "AffiliationName": "COGNAC-G, UMR 8257, CNRS-IRBA-Universit\u00e9 Paris Descartes"}, "56659359500": {"Name": "Bonci F.", "AuthorID": "56659359500", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London"}, "56659121700": {"Name": "Pandit A.", "AuthorID": "56659121700", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London"}, "7006835856": {"Name": "Ferguson V.", "AuthorID": "7006835856", "AffiliationID": "60111785, 60016550", "AffiliationName": "Western Eye Hospital, Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"}, "6602253325": {"Name": "Nachev P.", "AuthorID": "6602253325", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neurology, UCL"}}}
