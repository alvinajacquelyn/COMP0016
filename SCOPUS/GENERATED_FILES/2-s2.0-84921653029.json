Reaction of 1-formylphenyl-3-benzoyl-thymine with suitable pyrollic species leads to the formation of tetra-(phenylthymine)porphyrin (tetra-TP) or mono-thymine-tri-(3,5-di-tert-butylphenyl)porphyrin (mono-TP). Single crystal X-ray diffraction studies demonstrate the self-association of mono-TP in the solid state through thymine\u22efthymine hydrogen-bonding interactions but in solution this interaction (Kd = 6.1 \u00b1 3.0 M-1) is relatively weak in comparison to the heteromolecular interaction between mono-TP and 9-propyladenine (K = 91.8 \u00b1 20.5 M-1). STM studies of the tetratopic hydrogen-bonding tecton, tetra-TP, deposited on an HOPG substrate reveal the formation of an almost perfectly square self-assembled lattice through thymine\u22efthymine hydrogen-bonding. Co-deposition of tetra-TP with 9-propyladenine leads to the adoption of preferable thymine\u22efadenine interactions leading to the formation of a heteromolecular tetra-TP\u22ef9-propyladenine hydrogen bonded array including both Watson-Crick thymine\u22efadenine interactions and adenine\u22efadenine hydrogen-bonding. The studies demonstrate a pathway for the self-assembly of tetratopic hydrogen-bonding tectons and the use of preferential heteromolecular thymine\u22efadenine interactions for the disruption of the homomolecular tetra-TP array. Studies of the self-assembly of tetra-TP and 9-propyladenine demonstrate a strong dependence on overall concentration and molar ratio of components indicating the importance of kinetic effects in surface self-assembly processes.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Heteromolecular interactions", "Hydrogen bonding interactions", "Kinetic effect", "Self-assembled", "Self-associations", "Single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies", "Strong dependences", "Surface self-assembly"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84921653029", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"]], "AuthorData": {"54396221300": {"Name": "Slater A.", "AuthorID": "54396221300", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, University of Nottingham"}, "55961095400": {"Name": "Yang L.", "AuthorID": "55961095400", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, University of Nottingham"}, "6602821192": {"Name": "Argent S.", "AuthorID": "6602821192", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, University of Nottingham"}, "27167578500": {"Name": "Lewis W.", "AuthorID": "27167578500", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, University of Nottingham"}, "35451377200": {"Name": "Champness N.", "AuthorID": "35451377200", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, University of Nottingham"}, "56491698500": {"Name": "Hu Y.", "AuthorID": "56491698500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London (UCL)"}, "7005204148": {"Name": "Blunt M.", "AuthorID": "7005204148", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London (UCL)"}}}
