For the first time we directly display the formation of striae, at C/2006 P1 McNaught, using data from the SOHO LASCO C3 coronagraph. The nature of this formation suggests both fragmentation and shadowing effects are important in the formation process. Using the SOHO data with STEREO-A and B data from the HI-1 and HI-2 instruments, we display the evolution of these striae for two weeks, with a temporal resolution of two hours or better. This includes a period of morphological change on 2007 January 13\u201314 that we attribute to Lorentz forces caused by the comet's dust tail crossing the heliospheric current sheet. The nature of this interaction also implies a mixing of different sized dust along the striae, implying that fragmentation must be continuous or cascading. To enable this analysis, we have developed a new technique \u2013 temporal mapping \u2013 that displays cometary dust tails directly in the radiation beta (ratio of radiation pressure to gravity) and dust ejection time phase space. This allows for the combination of various data sets and the removal of transient motion and scaling effects.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Comets", "Dust", "Plasma", "Solar wind"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85055084913", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"57204284543": {"Name": "Price O.", "AuthorID": "57204284543", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60162133", "AffiliationName": "The Centre for Planetary Sciences at UCL/Birkbeck"}, "55224172000": {"Name": "Jones G.H.", "AuthorID": "55224172000", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60162133", "AffiliationName": "The Centre for Planetary Sciences at UCL/Birkbeck"}, "7006703928": {"Name": "Morrill J.", "AuthorID": "7006703928", "AffiliationID": "60016296", "AffiliationName": "NASA Headquarters, Heliophysics Division, 300 E ST., SW"}, "23968030600": {"Name": "Battams K.", "AuthorID": "23968030600", "AffiliationID": "60027271", "AffiliationName": "Naval Research Laboratory"}, "24295857400": {"Name": "Owens M.", "AuthorID": "24295857400", "AffiliationID": "60012197", "AffiliationName": "Space and Atmospheric Electricity Group, Department of Meteorology, University of Reading"}, "16039704700": {"Name": "Morgan H.", "AuthorID": "16039704700", "AffiliationID": "60030514", "AffiliationName": "Aberystwyth University"}, "55814447000": {"Name": "Dr\u00fcckmuller M.", "AuthorID": "55814447000", "AffiliationID": "60108596", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Mathematics, Faculty of Mechanical Engineering, Brno University of Technology"}, "14832317600": {"Name": "Deiries S.", "AuthorID": "14832317600", "AffiliationID": "109663038", "AffiliationName": "European Organisation for Astronomical Research in the Southern Hemisphere"}}}
