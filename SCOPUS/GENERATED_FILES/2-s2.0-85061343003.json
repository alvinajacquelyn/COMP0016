Using an experiment with online workers, we find that subjects choose the risky lottery rather than a sure payment significantly more often when responding to a choice list. This behavior can be rationalized by the interaction between nonexpected utility and the random incentive system, as suggested by Karni and Safra ().", "AuthorKeywords": ["C90", "C91", "certainty effect", "D81", "D90", "independence axiom", "isolation", "multiple price list", "preference reversals", "Random incentive system", "reduction of compound lotteries"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85061343003", "SubjectAreas": [["Economics and Econometrics", "ECON", "2002"]], "AuthorData": {"56643995600": {"Name": "Freeman D.J.", "AuthorID": "56643995600", "AffiliationID": "60018491", "AffiliationName": "Department of Economics, Simon Fraser University"}, "6506228931": {"Name": "Halevy Y.", "AuthorID": "6506228931", "AffiliationID": "60016849", "AffiliationName": "Department of Economics, University of Toronto"}, "57221680574": {"Name": "Kneeland T.", "AuthorID": "57221680574", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Economics, University College London"}}}
