This paper uses national data to explore the use of CTOs in England. Results About 5500 patients are subject to CTOs at any one time. Each year, \u223c4500 patients are made subject to a CTO each year and \u223c2500 are fully discharged, usually by the responsible clinician; fewer than half of CTO patients are recalled, and two-thirds of recalls end in revocation. The low rate of CTO discharges by mental health tribunals (below 5%) suggests that they are not used inappropriately. Clinical implications The introduction of CTOs in England has coincided with a reduction in psychiatric service provision due to the economic downturn. Pressures on services might be even more severe if patients currently subject to CTOs instead needed to be detained as in-patients.
