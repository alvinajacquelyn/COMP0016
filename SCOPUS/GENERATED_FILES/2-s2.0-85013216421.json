The system uses a generative model of how (arm and hand) actions are performed to generate hypothesis-specific visual predictions, and directs saccades to the most informative places of the visual scene to test these predictions \u2013 and underlying hypotheses. We test the model using eye movement data from a human action observation study. In both the human study and our model, saccades are proactive whenever context affords accurate action prediction; but uncertainty induces a more reactive gaze strategy, via tracking the observed movements. Our model offers a novel perspective on action observation that highlights its active nature based on prediction dynamics and hypothesis testing.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Action observation", "Active inference", "Active perception", "Hypothesis testing", "Motor prediction"], "IndexKeywords": ["Eye Movements", "Humans", "Intention", "Models, Theoretical", "Motion Perception", "Movement", "Psychomotor Performance", "Theory of Mind"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85013216421", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuropsychology and Physiological Psychology", "PSYC", "3206"], ["Experimental and Cognitive Psychology", "PSYC", "3205"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"]], "AuthorData": {"36665940900": {"Name": "Donnarumma F.", "AuthorID": "36665940900", "AffiliationID": "60012572, 60021199", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cognitive Sciences and Technologies, National Research Council"}, "6508225279": {"Name": "Pezzulo G.", "AuthorID": "6508225279", "AffiliationID": "60012572, 60021199", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cognitive Sciences and Technologies, National Research Council"}, "7102942941": {"Name": "Costantini M.", "AuthorID": "7102942941", "AffiliationID": "60004638", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Advanced Biomedical Technologies \u2013 ITAB, Foundation University G. d'Annunzio"}, "36647283500": {"Name": "Ambrosini E.", "AuthorID": "36647283500", "AffiliationID": "60000481", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, University of Padua"}, "36080215500": {"Name": "Friston K.", "AuthorID": "36080215500", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60084279", "AffiliationName": "The Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, UCL"}}}
