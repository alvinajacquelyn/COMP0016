The dynamic structural response of the laminated glass panel is decoupled into two distinct phases of motion: phase I is controlled by the elastic deformation of the brittle glass plies whilst phase II is dominated by the large inelastic deformation of the Polyvinyl Butyral (PVB) interlayer. Transition between the two phases follows the large scale fragmentation of the glass plies \u2013 this will be captured through a stress-based damage criterion. Following the work of others, the PVB interlayer is idealised as a rigid-perfectly plastic material which allows its large inelastic response to be modelled within the constitutive framework of limit analysis. An interactive yield criterion is adopted to capture the simultaneous influence of bending and membrane stretch that governs plastic flow in the interlayer. Predictions by the analytical model are validated against existing experimental data and they will be shown to be in good agreement. Parametric studies were performed to elucidate the effects of total mass (per unit area) and thickness ratio on the maximum transverse deflection. The efficacy of Youngdahl's technique on desensitising pulse shape effects is also studied.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Crack formulation", "Laminated glass", "Large deformation", "Limit analysis", "Pulse shape"], "IndexKeywords": ["Dynamic structural response", "Inelastic response", "Laminated glass", "Large inelastic deformation", "Limit analysis", "Pulse shape effects", "Stress-based damage", "Transverse deflection"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85030119334", "SubjectAreas": [["Ceramics and Composites", "MATE", "2503"], ["Civil and Structural Engineering", "ENGI", "2205"]], "AuthorData": {"56482540200": {"Name": "Yuan Y.", "AuthorID": "56482540200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "56372976400": {"Name": "Li Y.", "AuthorID": "56372976400", "AffiliationID": "60025278", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Automotive Safety & Energy, Department of Automotive Engineering, Tsinghua University"}, "8347053200": {"Name": "Tan P.J.", "AuthorID": "8347053200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}}}
