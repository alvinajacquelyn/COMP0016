The poem takes scenes from throughout the novel, as well as some of the novel's attributes, and works them into a strange new form: an intimate 'epithalamion' featuring only Daphnis and Chloe, situated in a bubble of time at the novel's close. This article explores Barskova's reception of Longus: the specific moments from the novel which she distorts or magnifies; and how she inscribes Longus' allusiveness and poeticness, his novel's artefactuality, textuality, and antiquity, into the poem. It places Barskova's response to Daphnis and Chloe in 'Dafnis i Khloia' in the context of her four other poems referring to pastoral, half of which also have links with Daphnis and Chloe. This uncovers a markedly ominous aesthetic at work in all Barskova's reception of ancient pastoral. Finally, the article discusses the 'anti-pastoral' tendencies peculiar to Russian literature's reception of Western pastoral, and particularly the pastorals of Joseph Brodsky, which inform the ominous notes of decay in Barskova's pastoral.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85027072453", "SubjectAreas": [["Classics", "ARTS", "1205"], ["Cultural Studies", "SOCI", "3316"], ["Arts and Humanities (all)", "ARTS", "1200"]], "AuthorData": {"57195315861": {"Name": "Barker G.", "AuthorID": "57195315861", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "University of Edinburgh"}}}
