Here, cucurbit[8]uril is used to directly adhere two functionalized mica substrates creating surface-surface interactions that are held together through photoreversible CB[8] heteroternary complexes. Comparison of single-molecule, bulk, and macroscopic adhesion behavior give insight into cooperativity and stress dissipation in dynamic adhesive systems.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adhesion behaviors", "Adhesive systems", "Cucurbit[8]uril", "Macroscopic self-assembly", "Mica substrates", "Single molecule", "Small molecules", "Surface interactions"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85049638841", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Surfaces and Interfaces", "PHYS", "3110"], ["Spectroscopy", "CHEM", "1607"], ["Electrochemistry", "CHEM", "1603"]], "AuthorData": {"55682739400": {"Name": "Williams P.", "AuthorID": "55682739400", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Melville Laboratory for Polymer Synthesis, Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge"}, "57192254450": {"Name": "Walsh-Korb Z.", "AuthorID": "57192254450", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Melville Laboratory for Polymer Synthesis, Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge"}, "55604912200": {"Name": "Jones S.", "AuthorID": "55604912200", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Melville Laboratory for Polymer Synthesis, Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge"}, "55329748300": {"Name": "Lan Y.", "AuthorID": "55329748300", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Melville Laboratory for Polymer Synthesis, Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge"}, "6507768052": {"Name": "Scherman O.", "AuthorID": "6507768052", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Melville Laboratory for Polymer Synthesis, Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge"}}}
