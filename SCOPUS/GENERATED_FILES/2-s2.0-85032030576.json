Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.Simulation theory proposes motor imagery (MI) to be a simulation based on representations also used for motor execution (ME). Nonetheless, it is unclear how far they use the same neural code. We usemultivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) and representational similarity analysis (RSA) to describe the neural representations associated with MI and ME within the frontoparietal motor network. During functionalmagnetic resonance imaging scanning, 20 volunteers imagined or executed 3 different types of right-hand actions. Results of MVPA showed that these actions as well as their modality (MI or ME) could be decoded significantly above chance from the spatial patterns of BOLD signals in premotor and posterior parietal cortices. This was also true for cross-modal decoding. Furthermore, representational dissimilarity matrices of frontal and parietal areas showed that MI and ME representations formed separate clusters, but that the representational organization of action types within these clusters was identical. For most ROIs, this pattern of results best fits with a model that assumes a low-tomoderate degree of similarity between the neural patterns associated with MI and ME. Thus, neural representations of MI and ME are neither the same nor totally distinct but exhibit a similar structural geometry with respect to different types of action.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Action mapping", "Functional equivalence", "Motor imagery", "MVPA", "RSA"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Brain Mapping", "Female", "Humans", "Image Processing, Computer-Assisted", "Imagery (Psychotherapy)", "Imagination", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Movement", "Parietal Lobe", "Psychomotor Performance", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85032030576", "SubjectAreas": [["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"]], "AuthorData": {"57196150870": {"Name": "Zabicki A.", "AuthorID": "57196150870", "AffiliationID": "60017134", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Sports Science, Justus Liebig University Giessen"}, "6508152492": {"Name": "Munzert J.", "AuthorID": "6508152492", "AffiliationID": "60017134", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Sports Science, Justus Liebig University Giessen"}, "56256170100": {"Name": "Kr\u00fcger B.", "AuthorID": "56256170100", "AffiliationID": "60017134", "AffiliationName": "Bender Institute of Neuroimaging, Justus Liebig University Giessen"}, "36143796900": {"Name": "De Haas B.", "AuthorID": "36143796900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Experimental Psychology, University College London"}, "24069636400": {"Name": "Zentgraf K.", "AuthorID": "24069636400", "AffiliationID": "60017134", "AffiliationName": "Bender Institute of Neuroimaging, Justus Liebig University Giessen"}, "57200162171": {"Name": "Stark R.", "AuthorID": "57200162171", "AffiliationID": "60017134", "AffiliationName": "Bender Institute of Neuroimaging, Justus Liebig University Giessen"}}}
