Published by Elsevier Ltd.Effective conservation planning relies on the accurate identification of anthropogenic land cover. However, accessing localized information can be difficult or impossible in developing countries. Additionally, global medium-resolution land use land cover datasets may be insufficient for conservation planning purposes at the scale of a country or smaller. We thus introduce a new tool, GE Grids, to bridge this gap. This tool creates an interactive user-specified binary grid laid over Google Earth's high-resolution imagery. Using GE Grids, we manually identified anthropogenic land conversion across East Africa and compared this against available land cover datasets. Nearly 30% of East Africa is converted to anthropogenic land cover. The two highest-resolution comparative datasets have the greatest agreement with our own at the regional extent, despite having as low as 44% agreement at the country level. We achieved 83% consistency among users. GE Grids is intended to complement existing remote sensing datasets at local scales.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Conservation planning", "East Africa", "GE grids", "Google Earth", "Land conversion", "Land use land cover"], "IndexKeywords": ["Conservation planning", "East Africa", "Google earths", "Land conversion", "Land use/ land covers"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84936870484", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Environmental Engineering", "ENVI", "2305"], ["Ecological Modeling", "ENVI", "2302"]], "AuthorData": {"55252705100": {"Name": "Jacobson A.", "AuthorID": "55252705100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography, University College London"}, "56717781000": {"Name": "Dhanota J.", "AuthorID": "56717781000", "AffiliationID": "60014439", "AffiliationName": "University of California"}, "56717642500": {"Name": "Rossman Z.", "AuthorID": "56717642500", "AffiliationID": "60014439", "AffiliationName": "University of California"}, "14219951500": {"Name": "Walker H.", "AuthorID": "14219951500", "AffiliationID": "60014439", "AffiliationName": "University of California"}, "57075899800": {"Name": "Godfrey J.", "AuthorID": "57075899800", "AffiliationID": "60014439", "AffiliationName": "Graduate Group in Horticulture and Agronomy, University of California"}, "56717302800": {"Name": "Jacobson H.", "AuthorID": "56717302800", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "56717669400": {"Name": "Stanish A.", "AuthorID": "56717669400", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "55503588500": {"Name": "Riggio J.", "AuthorID": "55503588500", "AffiliationID": "60014439", "AffiliationName": "Department of Wildlife, Fish and Conservation Biology, University of California"}}}
