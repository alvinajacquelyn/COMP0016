American Geophysical Union. All Rights Reserved.The late Miocene-early Pliocene was a time of global cooling and the development of modern meridional thermal gradients. Equatorial Pacific sea surface conditions potentially played an important role in this global climate transition, but their evolution is poorly understood. Here we present the first continuous late Miocene-early Pliocene (8.0\u20134.4 Ma) planktic foraminiferal stable isotope records from eastern equatorial Pacific Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Site U1338, with a new astrochronology spanning 8.0\u20133.5 Ma. Mg/Ca analyses on surface dwelling foraminifera Trilobatus sacculifer from carefully selected samples suggest that mean sea surface temperatures (SSTs) are ~27.8 \u00b1 1.1\u00b0C (1\u03c3) between 6.4 and 5.5 Ma. The planktic foraminiferal \u03b418O record implies a 2\u00b0C cooling between 7.2 and 6.1 Ma and an up to 3\u00b0C warming between 6.1 and 4.4 Ma, consistent with observed tropical alkenone paleo-SSTs. Diverging fine-fraction-to-foraminiferal \u03b413C gradients likely suggest increased upwelling between 7.1\u20136.0 and 5.8\u20134.6 Ma, concurrent with the globally recognized late Miocene Biogenic Bloom. This study shows that both warm and asymmetric mean states occurred in the equatorial Pacific during the late Miocene-early Pliocene. Between 8.0\u20136.5 and 5.2\u20134.4 Ma, low east-west \u03b418O and SST gradients and generally warm conditions prevailed. However, an asymmetric mean climate state developed between 6.5 and 5.7 Ma, with larger east-west \u03b418O and SST gradients and eastern equatorial Pacific cooling. The asymmetric mean state suggests stronger trade winds developed, driven by increased meridional thermal gradients associated with global cooling and declining atmospheric pCO2 concentrations. These oscillations in equatorial Pacific mean state are reinforced by Antarctic cryosphere expansion and related changes in oceanic gateways (e.g., Central American Seaway/Indonesian Throughflow restriction).", "AuthorKeywords": ["biogenic bloom", "equatorial Pacific mean state", "late Miocene to early Pliocene", "Mg/Ca sea surface temperature", "planktic foraminifera stable isotope records", "surface ocean conditions"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85045530262", "SubjectAreas": [["Oceanography", "EART", "1910"], ["Atmospheric Science", "EART", "1902"], ["Paleontology", "EART", "1911"]], "AuthorData": {"57078327600": {"Name": "Drury A.J.", "AuthorID": "57078327600", "AffiliationID": "60008293", "AffiliationName": "Now at MARUM \u2013 Center for Marine Environmental Sciences, University of Bremen"}, "57201645905": {"Name": "Lee G.P.", "AuthorID": "57201645905", "AffiliationID": "60000112", "AffiliationName": "Now at Centre for Ocean and Atmospheric Sciences, School of Environmental Sciences, University of East Anglia"}, "8293755000": {"Name": "John C.M.", "AuthorID": "8293755000", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Science and Engineering, Imperial College London"}, "7801659982": {"Name": "Westerhold T.", "AuthorID": "7801659982", "AffiliationID": "60008293", "AffiliationName": "Now at MARUM \u2013 Center for Marine Environmental Sciences, University of Bremen"}, "56202404700": {"Name": "Gray W.R.", "AuthorID": "56202404700", "AffiliationID": "60022132", "AffiliationName": "Now at School of Earth and Environmental Sciences, University of St Andrews"}, "7007037244": {"Name": "Lyle M.", "AuthorID": "7007037244", "AffiliationID": "60013402", "AffiliationName": "College of Earth, Ocean, and Atmospheric Sciences, Oregon State University"}, "6506989282": {"Name": "Shevenell A.E.", "AuthorID": "6506989282", "AffiliationID": "60030822", "AffiliationName": "College of Marine Science, University of South Florida"}}}
