In this paper, we report on these findings and highlight three key features of these small stones, namely their location relative to the dolmen's plan, the distances between them, and their orientations. We suggest the quartzite stones could have been markers used in the planning of this megalithic structure. In addition, we analyse the orientations of the two main structures of the cluster (Dolmen I & Dolmen II), which are reflected by the orientation of the quartzite stones. We tentatively suggest potential landscape and skyscape alignments for their orientations, including three hypotheses for the observed differences in orientation between the two.", "AuthorKeywords": ["archaeoastronomy", "Chalcolithic", "Late Neolithic", "megalithic tombs", "Portugal", "skyscapes", "window of visibility"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85045305106", "SubjectAreas": [["Archeology (arts and humanities)", "ARTS", "1204"], ["Archeology", "SOCI", "3302"]], "AuthorData": {"57206460638": {"Name": "Figueiredo A.", "AuthorID": "57206460638", "AffiliationID": "121980497", "AffiliationName": "Centro de Investiga\u00e7\u00e3o Geoci\u00eancias"}, "57190307032": {"Name": "Vilas-Est\u00e9vez B.", "AuthorID": "57190307032", "AffiliationID": "60105000", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of the Humanities and Performing Arts, University of Wales Trinity Saint David, Lampeter Campus"}, "16246132100": {"Name": "Silva F.", "AuthorID": "16246132100", "AffiliationID": "60022415", "AffiliationName": "\u00c0rea de Prehist\u00f2ria, Universitat Rovira i Virgili (URV)"}}}
