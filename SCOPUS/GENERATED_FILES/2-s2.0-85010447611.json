Published by Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA.A family of silica-supported, magnetite nanoparticle catalysts was synthesised and investigated for continuous-flow acetic acid ketonisation as a model pyrolysis bio-oil upgrading reaction. The physico-chemical properties of Fe3O4/SiO2 catalysts were characterised by using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, X-ray photo-electron spectroscopy, diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis and porosimetry. The acid site densities were inversely proportional to the Fe3O4 particle size, although the acid strength and Lewis character were size-invariant, and correlated with the specific activity for the vapour-phase acetic ketonisation to acetone. A constant activation energy (\u223c110 kJ mol\u22121), turnover frequency (\u223c13 h\u22121) and selectivity to acetone of 60 % were observed for ketonisation across the catalyst series, which implies that Fe3O4 is the principal active component of Red Mud waste.", "AuthorKeywords": ["carboxylic acids", "iron", "nanoparticles", "supported catalysts", "waste prevention"], "IndexKeywords": ["Acid site density", "Active components", "Diffuse reflectance infrared fourier transform spectroscopies", "Physicochemical property", "Pyrolysis bio-oil", "Specific activity", "Turnover frequency", "Waste prevention"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85010447611", "SubjectAreas": [["Catalysis", "CENG", "1503"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"], ["Organic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1605"], ["Inorganic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1604"]], "AuthorData": {"26657895300": {"Name": "Bennett J.", "AuthorID": "26657895300", "AffiliationID": "60014551", "AffiliationName": "European Bioenergy Research Institute, Aston University"}, "37119172200": {"Name": "Parlett C.", "AuthorID": "37119172200", "AffiliationID": "60014551", "AffiliationName": "European Bioenergy Research Institute, Aston University"}, "55771300200": {"Name": "Isaacs M.", "AuthorID": "55771300200", "AffiliationID": "60014551", "AffiliationName": "European Bioenergy Research Institute, Aston University"}, "55758702600": {"Name": "Durndell L.", "AuthorID": "55758702600", "AffiliationID": "60014551", "AffiliationName": "European Bioenergy Research Institute, Aston University"}, "7405628120": {"Name": "Lee A.", "AuthorID": "7405628120", "AffiliationID": "60014551", "AffiliationName": "European Bioenergy Research Institute, Aston University"}, "7403725899": {"Name": "Wilson K.", "AuthorID": "7403725899", "AffiliationID": "60014551", "AffiliationName": "European Bioenergy Research Institute, Aston University"}, "6603252450": {"Name": "Olivi L.", "AuthorID": "6603252450", "AffiliationID": "60033292", "AffiliationName": "Elettra Sincrotrone Trieste"}}}
