However, the use of such algorithms can be a hard task for the software engineer, mainly due to the significant range of parameter and algorithm choices. To help in this task, the use of Hyper-heuristics is recommended. Hyper-heuristics can select or generate low-level heuristics while optimization algorithms are executed, and thus can be generically applied. Despite their benefits, we find only a few works using hyper-heuristics in the SBSE field. Considering this fact, we describe HITO, a Hyper-heuristic for the Integration and Test Order Problem, to adaptively select search operators while MOEAs are executed using one of the selection methods: Choice Function and Multi-Armed Bandit. The experimental results show that HITO can outperform the traditional MOEAs NSGA-II and MOEA/DD. HITO is also a generic algorithm, since the user does not need to select crossover and mutation operators, nor adjust their parameters.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Hyper-heuristic", "Metaheuristic", "Multi-objective algorithm", "Search-Based Software Engineering", "Software testing"], "IndexKeywords": ["Crossover and mutation", "Hyperheuristic", "Metaheuristic", "Multi objective algorithm", "Multi objective evolutionary algorithms", "Optimization algorithms", "Search based software engineering (SBSE)", "Search-based software engineering"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85016714506", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"]], "AuthorData": {"56310164700": {"Name": "Guizzo G.", "AuthorID": "56310164700", "AffiliationID": "60015043", "AffiliationName": "DInf \u2013 Federal University of Parana"}, "6506290092": {"Name": "Vergilio S.", "AuthorID": "6506290092", "AffiliationID": "60015043", "AffiliationName": "DInf \u2013 Federal University of Parana"}, "13404845400": {"Name": "Pozo A.", "AuthorID": "13404845400", "AffiliationID": "60015043", "AffiliationName": "DInf \u2013 Federal University of Parana"}, "57188831644": {"Name": "Fritsche G.", "AuthorID": "57188831644", "AffiliationID": "60015043", "AffiliationName": "DInf \u2013 Federal University of Parana"}}}
