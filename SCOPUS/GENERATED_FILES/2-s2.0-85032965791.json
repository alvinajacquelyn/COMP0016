All rights reserved.\u03b3-Aminobutyric acid receptors (GABA A Rs) are vital for controlling excitability in the brain. This is emphasized by the numerous neuropsychiatric disorders that result from receptor dysfunction. A critical component of most native GABA A Rs is the \u03b1 subunit. Its transmembrane domain is the target for many modulators, including endogenous brain neurosteroids that impact anxiety, stress and depression, and for therapeutic drugs, such as general anesthetics. Understanding the basis for the modulation of GABA A R function requires high-resolution structures. Here we present the first atomic structures of a GABA A R chimera at 2.8-\u00c5 resolution, including those bound with potentiating and inhibitory neurosteroids. These structures define new allosteric binding sites for these modulators that are associated with the \u03b1-subunit transmembrane domain. Our findings will enable the exploitation of neurosteroids for therapeutic drug design to regulate GABA A Rs in neurological disorders.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Binding Sites", "Crystallography, X-Ray", "Mice", "Models, Molecular", "Neurotransmitter Agents", "Protein Conformation", "Receptors, GABA-A", "Recombinant Proteins"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85032965791", "SubjectAreas": [["Structural Biology", "BIOC", "1315"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"]], "AuthorData": {"36016902200": {"Name": "Laverty D.", "AuthorID": "36016902200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology, University College London"}, "57196423309": {"Name": "Thomas P.", "AuthorID": "57196423309", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology, University College London"}, "57196423713": {"Name": "Field M.", "AuthorID": "57196423713", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology, University College London"}, "15048092700": {"Name": "Gold M.G.", "AuthorID": "15048092700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology, University College London"}, "23099664500": {"Name": "Gielen M.", "AuthorID": "23099664500", "AffiliationID": "60001772, 60008134", "AffiliationName": "CNRS UMR 3571, Channel-Receptors Unit, Institut Pasteur"}, "7102576252": {"Name": "Smart T.G.", "AuthorID": "7102576252", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology, University College London"}, "57213102170": {"Name": "Andersen O.J.", "AuthorID": "57213102170", "AffiliationID": "60002634", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemistry, University of Oxford"}, "6603854881": {"Name": "Biggin P.C.", "AuthorID": "6603854881", "AffiliationID": "60002634", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemistry, University of Oxford"}}}
