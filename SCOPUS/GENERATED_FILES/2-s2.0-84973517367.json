Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd.The correct migration and axon extension of neurons in the developing nervous system is essential for the appropriate wiring and function of neural networks. Here, we report that O-sulfotransferases, a class of enzymes that modify heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs), are essential to regulate neuronal migration and axon development. We show that the 6-Osulfotransferases HS6ST1 and HS6ST2 are essential for cranial axon patterning, whilst the 2-O-sulfotransferase HS2ST (also known as HS2ST1) is important to regulate the migration of facial branchiomotor (FBM) neurons in the hindbrain. We have also investigated how HS2ST interacts with other signals in the hindbrain and show that fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signalling regulates FBM neuron migration in an HS2ST-dependent manner.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Axon guidance", "Fibroblast growth factor (FGF)", "Heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG)", "Neuron migration", "Sulfotransferase", "Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Axon Guidance", "Cell Movement", "Fibroblast Growth Factors", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Motor Neurons", "Proteoglycans", "Skull", "Sulfates", "Sulfotransferases", "Trigeminal Ganglion", "Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84973517367", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Developmental Biology", "BIOC", "1309"]], "AuthorData": {"55550167100": {"Name": "Tillo M.", "AuthorID": "55550167100", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}, "55363154600": {"Name": "Charoy C.", "AuthorID": "55363154600", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}, "6506096752": {"Name": "Schwarz Q.", "AuthorID": "6506096752", "AffiliationID": "106796436", "AffiliationName": "Department of Human Immunology, Centre for Cancer Biology"}, "26536208900": {"Name": "Maden C.H.", "AuthorID": "26536208900", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}, "56704478300": {"Name": "Davidson K.", "AuthorID": "56704478300", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}, "23007969000": {"Name": "Fantin A.", "AuthorID": "23007969000", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}, "6602149137": {"Name": "Ruhrberg C.", "AuthorID": "6602149137", "AffiliationID": "60005455", "AffiliationName": "Yale Cardiovascular Research Centre, Yale University"}}}
