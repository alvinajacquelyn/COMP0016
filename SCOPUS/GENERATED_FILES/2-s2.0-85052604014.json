In online forums, autistic individuals commonly report experiencing this phenomenon. Given that approximately half of all autistic individuals experience difficulties identifying their own emotions, the suggestion that object personification may be a feature of autism seems almost paradoxical. Why would a person experience sympathy for objects, when they struggle to understand and verbalise the emotions of other people as well as their own? An online survey was used to assess tendency for personification in 87 autistic and 263 non-autistic adults. Together, our results indicate that object personification occurs commonly among autistic individuals, and perhaps more often (and later in life) than in the general population. Given that in many cases, autistic people report their personification experiences as distressing, it is important to consider the reasons for the increased personification and identify structures for support.", "AuthorKeywords": ["anthropomorphism", "autism spectrum disorders", "cognition (attention, learning, memory)", "perception", "personification"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Autism Spectrum Disorder", "Autistic Disorder", "Humans", "Middle Aged", "Object Attachment", "Social Perception", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85052604014", "SubjectAreas": [["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"]], "AuthorData": {"25628780700": {"Name": "White R.C.", "AuthorID": "25628780700", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "University of Oxford"}, "16403276300": {"Name": "Remington A.", "AuthorID": "16403276300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
