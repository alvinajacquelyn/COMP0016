We examined the cross-sectional/longitudinal associations of height with gait speed (GS) in participants from the Dijon-Three-City cohort study (France) over 11 years. In 4011 participants (65-85 y), we measured usual/fast GS (6 m) up to five times. We examined whether the baseline height-GS association varied with age using linear regression, and whether height influenced GS change using linear mixed models. Taller participants 65 y at baseline walked faster than shorter ones (fast GS difference between top/bottom height quartiles, 0.100 m/s, P < 0.001); this association weakened with age (P-interaction = 0.02), with a 0.012 m/s (P = 0.57) difference at 80 y. Ten-year fast GS decline was 51% greater (P < 0.001) in younger participants in the top height quartile (-0.183 m/s) compared to those in the bottom quartile (-0.121 m/s), leading the GS difference between the two groups to be attenuated by 50% over the follow-up. The height-related difference in fast GS decline was not explained by time-dependent comorbidities or height shrinkage. Analyses for usual GS yielded consistent findings. The height-GS relation is more complex than previously thought, as the height related advantage in GS disappears as persons grow older due to faster decline in taller compared to shorter persons.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Body Height", "Body Weights and Measures", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Female", "Gait", "Geriatric Assessment", "Humans", "Longitudinal Studies", "Male", "Predictive Value of Tests", "Risk Factors", "Walking Speed"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85041048897", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"7003618656": {"Name": "Elbaz A.", "AuthorID": "7003618656", "AffiliationID": "60029937, 60106085, 60106017", "AffiliationName": "Universit\u00e9 Paris-Saclay, Univ.
