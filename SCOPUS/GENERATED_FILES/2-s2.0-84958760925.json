This research note takes a closer look at some of the trends, considering the journal\u2019s 50 most cited papers and using IRaMuTeQ, an open-source computer text analysis technique. The research note presents data that show that the move within public engagement from deficit to dialogue has been followed by a further shift from championing dialogue to criticising its practice. This shift has taken place alongside a continued, but changing, interest in media coverage, surveys and models of public understanding.", "AuthorKeywords": ["dialogue", "IRaMuTeQ", "public engagement", "science communication", "text mining"], "IndexKeywords": ["Bibliometrics", "Community Participation", "Information Dissemination", "Periodicals as Topic", "Science"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84958760925", "SubjectAreas": [["Communication", "SOCI", "3315"], ["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"], ["Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)", "ARTS", "1201"]], "AuthorData": {"15837941700": {"Name": "Smallman M.", "AuthorID": "15837941700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
