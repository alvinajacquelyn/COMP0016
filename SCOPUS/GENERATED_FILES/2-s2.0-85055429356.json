While efforts to reduce opioid use exist, little study has been done on opioid utilization and its impact across surgical approaches. Our goal was to evaluate the impact of opioid utilization on quality measures and costs after open and laparoscopic colorectal surgery. Methods: The Premier database was reviewed for inpatient colorectal procedures from January 01, 2014, to September 30, 2015. Procedures were stratified into open and laparoscopic approaches, then \u201copioid\u201d and \u201copioid-free\u201d groups within each approach. Univariate analysis compared demographics, outcomes, and cost by opioid use and surgical approach. In the \u201copioid\u201d groups, opioid consumption and duration were assessed across platforms. Multivariate regression analyzed the association between opioid use and surgical approach on costs and quality outcomes. Results: 50,098 procedures were evaluated\u201440.4% laparoscopic and 59.6% open. 6.6% of laparoscopic and 5.3% of open cases were \u201copioid free.\u201d Across both approaches, patients over 65 were most likely opioid free, while the obese and cancer patients were most likely to use opioids. Length of stay was shorter, and post-discharge nursing needs and total costs were lower in the \u201copioid-free\u201d group in both approaches (all p < 0.001). The median daily and total opioid consumption were lower with a laparoscopic approach (p < 0.001), which also had a shorter duration of use versus open cases (p < 0.001). Opioids were 20% more likely in open cases. Total costs were 16% greater with opioids and 24% greater in open surgery. Complications were 89% more likely in open surgery. Readmissions were increased by 14% with both opioid use and open surgery. Conclusions: Opioid-free colorectal surgery results in improved outcomes, and laparoscopy further improves these results. Continued efforts to increase laparoscopy are key for reducing opioids and improving outcomes as we transition to value-based care.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Complications", "Healthcare costs", "Healthcare outcomes", "Laparoscopic colorectal surgery", "Opioid-free pain management", "Opioids", "Readmissions"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Analgesics, Opioid", "Colorectal Surgery", "Female", "Humans", "Laparoscopy", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Outcome Assessment, Health Care", "Pain Management", "Pain, Postoperative", "Retrospective Studies"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85055429356", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"]], "AuthorData": {"55559681100": {"Name": "Keller D.S.", "AuthorID": "55559681100", "AffiliationID": "60027565", "AffiliationName": "Division of Colon and Rectal Surgery, Department of Surgery, NewYork-Presbyterian, Columbia University Medical Center"}, "57204397828": {"Name": "Zhang J.", "AuthorID": "57204397828", "AffiliationID": "60000723", "AffiliationName": "Minimally Invasive Therapies Group, Medtronic, Inc"}, "35609458500": {"Name": "Chand M.", "AuthorID": "35609458500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "GENIE Centre, University College London"}}}
