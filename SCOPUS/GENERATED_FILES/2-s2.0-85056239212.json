SPW-Rs are characterized by several spectral components: a slow (5\u201315 Hz) sharp-wave, a high-frequency \u201cripple\u201d oscillation (150\u2013200 Hz), and a slow \u201cgamma\u201d oscillation (20\u201340 Hz). Using laminar hippocampal recordings and optogenetic manipulations, we dissected the origin of these spectral components. We show that increased power in the 20\u201340 Hz band does not reflect an entrainment of CA1 and CA3 neurons at gamma frequency but the power envelope of overlapping ripples. Spike-local field potential coupling between unit firing in CA1 and CA3 regions during SPW-Rs is lowest in the gamma band. Longer SPW-Rs are preceded by increased firing in the entorhinal cortex. Thus, fusion of SPW-Rs leads to lengthening of their duration associated with increased power in the slow gamma band without the presence of true oscillation. SWRs are thought to support memory consolidation and planning. They are characterized by several spectral components: a slow-frequency wave (sharp-wave), a high-frequency oscillation (ripple), and a slow \u201cgamma\u201d band. Here, we report a mechanism, involving the concatenation of several SWRs, which explains the generation of the \u201cgamma\u201d frequency band.", "AuthorKeywords": ["entorhinal cortex", "gamma", "hippocampus", "memory consolidation", "optogenetics", "oscillations", "sharp-wave ripples"], "IndexKeywords": ["Action Potentials", "Animals", "Gamma Rhythm", "Hippocampus", "Male", "Optogenetics", "Rats, Long-Evans"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85056239212", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"57190582716": {"Name": "Oliva A.", "AuthorID": "57190582716", "AffiliationID": "60030162", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Zuckerman Mind Brain Behavior Institute, Columbia University"}, "55179305800": {"Name": "Fern\u00e1ndez-Ruiz A.", "AuthorID": "55179305800", "AffiliationID": "60024541", "AffiliationName": "New York University Neuroscience Institute"}, "57204577034": {"Name": "Fermino de Oliveira E.", "AuthorID": "57204577034", "AffiliationID": "60001430", "AffiliationName": "Center for Mathematics, Computing and Cognition, Universidade Federal do ABC, S\u00e3o Bernardo do Campo"}, "7006676856": {"Name": "Buzs\u00e1ki G.", "AuthorID": "7006676856", "AffiliationID": "60021784", "AffiliationName": "Center for Neural Science, New York University"}}}
