All rights reserved.Despite their benign histology, craniopharyngiomas are the archetypal suprasellar tumour for causing hypothalamo-pituitary endocrine dysfunction both from tumour- and treatment-related effects. Endocrine deficits are frequently present at diagnosis but are often under-recognised; thus a detailed pre-treatment endocrine assessment is essential, particularly to exclude adrenocorticotrophic hormone deficiency and central diabetes insipidus prior to any surgery. Management of fluid balance in the perioperative period is particularly complex and requires the expertise of a paediatric endocrinologist familiar in managing patients with multiple endocrinopathies. Post-operatively, virtually all survivors face a lifetime risk of evolving endocrine deficits that may be extremely complex to manage, therefore requiring careful long-term follow-up and monitoring into adulthood with appropriate plans for transition between paediatric and adult care.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Craniopharyngioma", "diabetes insipidus", "hypopituitarism", "hypothalamic disease"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85033355475", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"56066475600": {"Name": "Gan H.W.", "AuthorID": "56066475600", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "The London Centre for Paediatric Endocrinology and Diabetes, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7003534902": {"Name": "Dattani M.T.", "AuthorID": "7003534902", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "The London Centre for Paediatric Endocrinology and Diabetes, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}, "6603200582": {"Name": "Spoudeas H.A.", "AuthorID": "6603200582", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "The London Centre for Paediatric Endocrinology and Diabetes, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
