The introduction of neighbourhood planning (NP) in England under the Localism Act (2011) is claimed by proponents to be a step change in the way that local communities are involved in planning their own areas. However, little empirical evidence has yet emerged to substantiate such claims, or provide details about the practices and experiences of NP. The paper highlights that there are numerous parties involved in the co-production of Neighbourhood Development Plans and there are numerous instances where ideas, policies and priorities that emerge from within neighbourhoods are being 'rescripted' to ensure conformity to a bounded form of collaboration.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Co-production", "Governance", "Instrumentality", "Localism", "Neighbourhood"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84948441853", "SubjectAreas": [["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"], ["Urban Studies", "SOCI", "3322"]], "AuthorData": {"7402344042": {"Name": "Parker G.", "AuthorID": "7402344042", "AffiliationID": "60012197", "AffiliationName": "University of Reading, School of Real Estate and Planning, HBS Building"}, "56979055200": {"Name": "Lynn T.", "AuthorID": "56979055200", "AffiliationID": "60012197", "AffiliationName": "University of Reading, School of Real Estate and Planning, HBS Building"}, "56979401800": {"Name": "Wargent M.", "AuthorID": "56979401800", "AffiliationID": "60001881", "AffiliationName": "University of Sheffield, Department of Sociological Studies"}}}
