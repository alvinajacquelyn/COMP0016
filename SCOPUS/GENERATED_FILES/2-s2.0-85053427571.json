This questionnaire-based survey looked at GDPs currently practising in the UK. Methods A total of 170 questionnaires were distributed. The questionnaire enquired about demographic information, postgraduate training in MID, number of years in clinical practice, the working environment, perceptions of the methods and rationale for their choice of restorative materials in clinical practice, and tested their knowledge of MID. Results Of the 170 distributed questionnaires, 87.6% (N = 149) were completed. The results showed that only 28% of the respondents scored all the basic MID knowledge questions correctly, illustrating a general lack of basic contemporary understanding of MID among the GDPs. Logistic regression analysis of the data revealed a true correlation between the knowledge in MID and the perception of knowing. The analysis also showed that knowledge in MID, application of G. V. Black\u2019s concepts and change in MID approach since qualification were significant (p <0.05). There were no significant relationships between the knowledge score on studied scenarios and country of education, working environment, caries risk assessment, effect of caries risk assessment on treatment planning, effect of caries risk assessment on choice of restorative material, dietary assessment and fluoride usage. Conclusions This study demonstrated that the knowledge of MID among UK GDPs is generally poor. There is a need for further education in the field of MID.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Attitude of Health Personnel", "Chi-Square Distribution", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Dental Caries", "Dentistry", "Dentistry, Operative", "Dentists", "Female", "General Practice, Dental", "Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice", "Humans", "Male", "Multivariate Analysis", "Pilot Projects", "Regression Analysis", "Risk Assessment", "Statistics, Nonparametric", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "United Kingdom", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85053427571", "SubjectAreas": [["Dentistry (all)", "DENT", "3500"]], "AuthorData": {"57203885360": {"Name": "Mirsiaghi F.", "AuthorID": "57203885360", "AffiliationID": "60013985", "AffiliationName": "UCL Eastman Dental Institute"}, "35339593400": {"Name": "Leung A.", "AuthorID": "35339593400", "AffiliationID": "60013985", "AffiliationName": "UCL Eastman Dental Institute"}, "56448156300": {"Name": "Fine P.", "AuthorID": "56448156300", "AffiliationID": "60013985", "AffiliationName": "UCL Eastman Dental Institute"}, "57191596271": {"Name": "Blizard R.", "AuthorID": "57191596271", "AffiliationID": "60013985", "AffiliationName": "UCL Eastman Dental Institute"}, "6506781394": {"Name": "Louca C.", "AuthorID": "6506781394", "AffiliationID": "60025475", "AffiliationName": "University of Portsmouth Dental Academy"}}}
