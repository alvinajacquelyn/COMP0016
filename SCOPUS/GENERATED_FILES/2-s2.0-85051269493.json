Suppose that the government has to finance public expenditures using linear consumption taxes and/or a lump-sum tax on profits redistributed to the consumer. We show that, if the tax rate on profits cannot exceed 100 % , one cannot improve upon the second-best optimum of an economy with constant returns to scale by using a less efficient profit-generating decreasing returns to scale technology.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85051269493", "SubjectAreas": [["Social Sciences (miscellaneous)", "SOCI", "3301"], ["Economics and Econometrics", "ECON", "2002"]], "AuthorData": {"56224109600": {"Name": "Gauthier S.", "AuthorID": "56224109600", "AffiliationID": "60012327", "AffiliationName": "Sciences-Po, Institute for Fiscal Studies"}, "6603798855": {"Name": "Laroque G.", "AuthorID": "6603798855", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
