Owing to the use of the single-source precursor, highly crystalline and stoichiometric films were grown at a relatively low deposition temperature of 450 \u00b0C. Core level XPS depth profiling studies showed some partial oxidation of the film surface, however this was self-limiting and disappeared on etch profiles. Valence band XPS analysis matched well with the simulated density of state spectrum. Hall effect measurements performed on the films showed that the films were n-type with promising resistivity (3.6 \u00d7 10-3 \u03a9 cm) and carrier mobility (410 cm2 V-1 s-1) values despite growth on amorphous glass substrates.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Aerosol-assisted chemical vapour depositions", "Hall effect measurement", "Low deposition temperature", "Partial oxidations", "Single-source precursor", "Solution-processed", "Stoichiometric films", "XPS depth profiling"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84979019878", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Materials Chemistry", "MATE", "2505"]], "AuthorData": {"55243347800": {"Name": "Marchand P.", "AuthorID": "55243347800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Materials Chemistry Centre, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "37081732100": {"Name": "Sathasivam S.", "AuthorID": "37081732100", "AffiliationID": "60112905", "AffiliationName": "Bio Nano Consulting Ltd, Gridiron Building"}, "56217400400": {"Name": "Parkin I.", "AuthorID": "56217400400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Materials Chemistry Centre, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "7003437916": {"Name": "Carmalt C.", "AuthorID": "7003437916", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Materials Chemistry Centre, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "56924712400": {"Name": "Williamson B.", "AuthorID": "56924712400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Kathleen Lonsdale Materials Chemistry, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "16647397400": {"Name": "Scanlon D.", "AuthorID": "16647397400", "AffiliationID": "60104663", "AffiliationName": "Diamond Light Source Ltd., Diamond House, Harwell Science and Innovation Campus Didcot"}, "57197043008": {"Name": "Pugh D.", "AuthorID": "57197043008", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Imperial College London"}, "14062876800": {"Name": "Bawaked S.", "AuthorID": "14062876800", "AffiliationID": "60004582", "AffiliationName": "Surface Chemistry and Catalytic Studies Group, King Abdulaziz University"}, "55411212800": {"Name": "Basahel S.", "AuthorID": "55411212800", "AffiliationID": "60004582", "AffiliationName": "Surface Chemistry and Catalytic Studies Group, King Abdulaziz University"}, "35581165800": {"Name": "Obaid A.", "AuthorID": "35581165800", "AffiliationID": "60004582", "AffiliationName": "Surface Chemistry and Catalytic Studies Group, King Abdulaziz University"}}}
