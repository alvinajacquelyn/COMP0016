All rights reserved.The most significant concentration of surviving vernacular mudwall structures in Scotland is found in and around the town of Errol in the Carse of Gowrie. Mudwall, or cob, is particularly susceptible to climate-related impacts such as water ingress and freeze-thaw cycles. A lack of recognition can exacerbate the effects of these factors significantly. Using two sites as representative case studies, this paper considers the issues typically encountered. The procedures used in monitoring the performance of each building within a regional climate context are outlined. Using climate models and current weather data, the local climatic context within which these structures exist is considered. Climate-related impacts can then be considered for future scenarios. Temperature and humidity data were collected concurrently from targeted areas within the walls of both structures for over a year from April 2012, a period that exhibited a range of extreme weather events in the Carse of Gowrie. The system of datalogging at each structure is discussed and results considered against external weather conditions using decomposed time series statistical analysis. Recommendations are offered considering how an integrated approach to the analysis of historic mudwall structures can be achieved.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Conservation", "Environment", "Weather"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84924414748", "SubjectAreas": [["Engineering (miscellaneous)", "ENGI", "2201"]], "AuthorData": {"55840223500": {"Name": "Parkin S.J.", "AuthorID": "55840223500", "AffiliationID": "60025200", "AffiliationName": "School of Natural Sciences, University of Stirling"}, "6603185093": {"Name": "Adderley W.P.", "AuthorID": "6603185093", "AffiliationID": "60025200", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Environmental History and Policy, School of Natural Sciences, University of Stirling"}, "7402165008": {"Name": "Kennedy C.J.", "AuthorID": "7402165008", "AffiliationID": "60019656", "AffiliationName": "School of the Built Environment, Heriot-Watt University"}, "56254804900": {"Name": "Aktas Y.D.", "AuthorID": "56254804900", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60012808", "AffiliationName": "Epicentre Research Group, Civil, Environmental and Geomatic Engineering, University College London"}, "57211644046": {"Name": "D\u2019Ayala D.", "AuthorID": "57211644046", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60012808", "AffiliationName": "Epicentre Research Group, Civil, Environmental and Geomatic Engineering, University College London"}, "23970176900": {"Name": "Erkal A.", "AuthorID": "23970176900", "AffiliationID": "60104489", "AffiliationName": "Civil Engineering Department, Istanbul Kemerburgaz University"}}}
