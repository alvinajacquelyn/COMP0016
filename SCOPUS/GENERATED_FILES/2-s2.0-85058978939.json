The English context entails several contradictions (antinomies) at ontological, epistemological and axiological levels, and is heavily influenced by an ideological struggle concerning the value of play within the sector as opposed to a climate of child performativity. Moreover, the predominately female workforce (a factor itself) has faced relentless changes in terms of qualifications and curriculum reforms in recent years. With the introduction of the graduate leader qualification (Early Years Teacher Status), a vast body of research has been seeking to conceptualise what leadership means for early childhood education and care. In this article, the authors argue that these attempts are helpful and contribute to this discourse of leadership, but it needs to be thought of not only abstractly, but also practically. Thus, the authors conclude, the (re)conceptualisation of leadership should locate it as pedagogical praxis after evaluating the inherent deep dispositions of leaders in conjunction with their history, surrounding culture and subjective perspectives/realities.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Early childhood education and care", "leadership", "pedagogical leadership", "pedagogy", "praxis"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85058978939", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"]], "AuthorData": {"36089232800": {"Name": "Palaiologou I.", "AuthorID": "36089232800", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Institute of Education"}, "6602662694": {"Name": "Male T.", "AuthorID": "6602662694", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Institute of Education"}}}
