Consequently, new methods deciphering the spatial and temporal interactions between individuals and their environments are vital. Network analyses offer a powerful suite of tools to disentangle the complexity within these dynamic systems, and we review these tools, their application, and how they have generated new ecological and behavioural insights. We suggest that network theory can be used to model and predict the influence of ecological and environmental parameters on animal movement, focusing on spatial and social connectivity, with fundamental implications for conservation. Refining how we construct and randomise spatial networks at different temporal scales will help to establish network theory as a prominent, hypothesis-generating tool in movement ecology.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Animal tracking", "Connectivity", "Graph theory", "Social behaviour", "Spatial networks", "Telemetry"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animal Migration", "Animals", "Ecology", "Locomotion", "Models, Biological", "Social Behavior", "Spatial Behavior"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84957637872", "SubjectAreas": [["Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics", "AGRI", "1105"]], "AuthorData": {"36162010000": {"Name": "Jacoby D.", "AuthorID": "36162010000", "AffiliationID": "60005453, 60009498", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Zoology, Zoological Society of London"}, "56079348600": {"Name": "Freeman R.", "AuthorID": "56079348600", "AffiliationID": "60005453, 60009498", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Zoology, Zoological Society of London"}}}
