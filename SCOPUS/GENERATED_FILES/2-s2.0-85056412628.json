Tip pulses on the 'as-prepared' surface induce local surface reconstruction and removal of surface hydroxyls in a region around the reconstruction. A defocused beam from an electron gun as well as tip pulses have been used to generate a number of oxygen deficient surfaces. All tip pulse features display an oval profile, which can be attributed to the anisotropic conductivity of the TiO2(110) surface. A novel oxygen deficient phase with well-ordered defective 'nano-cracks' has been identified, which can be produced by either electron beam irradiation or low flash anneal temperatures (\u223c570 K). Annealing such surfaces to moderate temperatures (\u223c850 K) leads to mixed 1 \u00d71 and 1 \u00d72 surfaces, until now only achievable by annealing in oxygen or ageing by repeated sputter/anneal cycles. Heating to normal preparation temperatures (1000 K) reforms the clean, well-ordered 1 \u00d71 surface termination. Our results demonstrate the potential of electron induced processes to modify the oxygen composition and structure of the TiO2(110) surface in a controllable and reversible way for selective surface patterning and surface reactivity modification.", "AuthorKeywords": ["electron beam", "point defects", "reconstruction", "STM", "surface structure", "TiO2", "tip pulse"], "IndexKeywords": ["Anisotropic conductivity", "Electron beam irradiation", "Electron-induced process", "Moderate temperature", "Nanoscale engineering", "Preparation temperatures", "TiO2", "tip pulse"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85056412628", "SubjectAreas": [["Bioengineering", "CENG", "1502"], ["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Mechanics of Materials", "ENGI", "2211"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"15759892400": {"Name": "Humphrey D.S.", "AuthorID": "15759892400", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "London Centre for Nanotechnology, Chemistry Department, University College London"}, "7201425162": {"Name": "Pang C.L.", "AuthorID": "7201425162", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Surface Science Research Centre, Department of Chemistry, Liverpool University"}, "8258825400": {"Name": "Chen Q.", "AuthorID": "8258825400", "AffiliationID": "60017317", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Sussex"}, "57196232691": {"Name": "Thornton G.", "AuthorID": "57196232691", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "London Centre for Nanotechnology, Chemistry Department, University College London"}}}
