Using an orthonormal polynomial basis, we efficiently fit the polynomials to the underlying signed distance function on each cell. The proposed error-driven construction algorithm is globally adaptive and iteratively refines the SDFs using either spatial subdivision (h-refinement) following an octree scheme or by cell-wise adaption of the polynomial approximation's degree (p-refinement). We further introduce a novel decision criterion based on an error-estimator in order to decide whether to apply p- or h-refinement. We demonstrate that our method is able to construct more accurate SDFs at significantly lower memory consumption compared to previous approaches. While the cell-wise polynomial approximation will result in highly accurate SDFs, it can not be guaranteed that the piecewise approximation is continuous over cell interfaces. Therefore, we propose an optimization-based post-processing step in order to weakly enforce continuity. Finally, we apply our generated SDFs as collision detector to the physically-based simulation of geometrically highly complex solid objects in order to demonstrate the practical relevance and applicability of our method.", "AuthorKeywords": ["adaptive discretization", "collision detection", "higher-order polynomials", "physically based simulation", "Signed distance field"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adaptation models", "Collision detection", "Computational model", "Discretizations", "Higher-order polynomials", "Memory management", "Octrees", "Physically-based simulation", "Signed distance fields"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85028821950", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Signal Processing", "COMP", "1711"], ["Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition", "COMP", "1707"], ["Computer Graphics and Computer-Aided Design", "COMP", "1704"]], "AuthorData": {"56315477100": {"Name": "Koschier D.", "AuthorID": "56315477100", "AffiliationID": "60016653", "AffiliationName": "Computer Animation Group, RWTH Aachen University"}, "57195565228": {"Name": "Brand M.", "AuthorID": "57195565228", "AffiliationID": "60016653", "AffiliationName": "Computer Animation Group, RWTH Aachen University"}, "22933788400": {"Name": "Bender J.", "AuthorID": "22933788400", "AffiliationID": "60016653", "AffiliationName": "Computer Animation Group, RWTH Aachen University"}, "55806777200": {"Name": "Deul C.", "AuthorID": "55806777200", "AffiliationID": "60011226", "AffiliationName": "Graduate School CE, TU Darmstadt"}}}
