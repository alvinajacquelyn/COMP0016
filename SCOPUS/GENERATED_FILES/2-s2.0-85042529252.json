KGaA, WeinheimThe authors regret that incorrect data was presented in Figure, Figure, and Table of this Communication. The corrected Figures and Table entries are shown below. The hydrogen evolution rates were incorrectly calculated, but by a common scaling factor. Hence, the trends observed between materials and the overall conclusions made in the Communication remain valid. The correct H2 evolution rate for the most active polymer, P7, under visible light (>420 nm) should be 37.3 \u03bcmol h\u22121 (1492 \u03bcmol g\u22121 h\u22121), not 92.0 \u03bcmol h\u22121 as initially reported. The apparent quantum yields at 420 nm for P1K, P6, and P7 should be corrected to 0.4 % (\u00b10.1 %), 2.2 % (\u00b10.2 %), and 7.2 % (\u00b10.3 %), respectively. Figure (Figure presented.)

Each measurement was performed with 25 mg catalyst in water/MeOH/triethylamine mixture under broad-spectrum irradiation (\u03bb>295 nm; see Table for visible light HERs).

(Table presented.) \u2026 [c] Reaction conditions: 25 mg polymer was suspended in water/MeOH/triethylamine solution, irradiated by 300 W Xe lamp for 5 hours using a suitable filter. The most active polymer, P7, was studied independently by another research group, who reported an apparent quantum yield of 6.61 %, close to the corrected value of 7.2 %. The precise value of the apparent quantum yield and hence the H2 evolution rate will depend on the details of the experimental set up and the irradiation intensity.", "AuthorKeywords": ["conjugated polymer", "extended conjugation", "photocatalysis", "planarization", "water splitting"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85042529252", "SubjectAreas": [["Catalysis", "CENG", "1503"], ["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"]], "AuthorData": {"36657600800": {"Name": "Sprick R.", "AuthorID": "36657600800", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "23099464700": {"Name": "Bonillo B.", "AuthorID": "23099464700", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "23491285200": {"Name": "Clowes R.", "AuthorID": "23491285200", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "55805566600": {"Name": "Guiglion P.", "AuthorID": "55805566600", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "56926651800": {"Name": "Brownbill N.", "AuthorID": "56926651800", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "57203048898": {"Name": "Slater B.", "AuthorID": "57203048898", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "57213368290": {"Name": "Blanc F.", "AuthorID": "57213368290", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "6507121537": {"Name": "Zwijnenburg M.", "AuthorID": "6507121537", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "55015893700": {"Name": "Adams D.", "AuthorID": "55015893700", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "7401832651": {"Name": "Cooper A.", "AuthorID": "7401832651", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
