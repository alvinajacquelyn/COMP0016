We find that the peak of the 3-\u03bcm CH4 northern bright spot is located at ~200\u00b0 (SysIII) longitude, ~20\u00b0 west of the center of the 8-\u03bcm north-polar bright spot, and does not coincide with the 3-\u03bcm H3+ bright spot. We derive high temperatures (500-850K) from CH4 rotational lines on the bright spots of both polar regions, above the 1-\u03bcbar pressure level, while we find cooler temperatures (<350K) over the 8-\u03bcm spot. The intensity ratios of the various 3-\u03bcm vibrational bands of CH4 are roughly constant, indicating that the upper states of these bands are mostly populated by non-thermal excitation mechanisms, such as auroral particle precipitation and/or Joule heating, in contrast with the 8-\u03bcm thermal emission.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Atmospheres, composition", "Aurorae", "Infrared observations", "Jupiter", "Spectroscopy"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84934873708", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"16201105500": {"Name": "Kim S.J.", "AuthorID": "16201105500", "AffiliationID": "60001873", "AffiliationName": "School of Space Research, Kyung Hee University"}, "37261887800": {"Name": "Sim C.K.", "AuthorID": "37261887800", "AffiliationID": "60001873", "AffiliationName": "School of Space Research, Kyung Hee University"}, "7403072974": {"Name": "Ho J.", "AuthorID": "7403072974", "AffiliationID": "60001873", "AffiliationName": "School of Space Research, Kyung Hee University"}, "55617202700": {"Name": "Geballe T.R.", "AuthorID": "55617202700", "AffiliationID": "60033467", "AffiliationName": "Gemini Observatory"}, "7005973015": {"Name": "Yung Y.L.", "AuthorID": "7005973015", "AffiliationID": "60086312, 60031581", "AffiliationName": "Division of Geological and Planetary Sciences, Caltech"}, "35500387500": {"Name": "Miller S.", "AuthorID": "35500387500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "55699648100": {"Name": "Kim Y.H.", "AuthorID": "55699648100", "AffiliationID": "60022417", "AffiliationName": "Department of Astronomy and Space Science, Chungnam National University"}}}
