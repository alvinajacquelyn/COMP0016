Specifically, a 13-fold increment in the linear absorption coefficient is attained at 1.85 eV, along with an 8-fold enhancement of the two-photon absorption coefficient at 1.65 eV, which is attributed to exciton\u2013plasmon coupling resonance and plasmonic hot electron transfer. The exciton\u2013plasmon coupling effect is characterized by stable photoluminescence experiments. Furthermore, the exciton recombination time is extracted from the pump\u2013probe measurement, whose value in the hybrid structure is shortened from 18.5 ps (pure MoS2) to 1.84 ps. Our findings facilitate a new perspective to modulate the nonlinear optical response and to promote the performance of nonlinear photonic devices.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Exciton recombination", "Hot electron transfer", "Linear absorption coefficient", "Nonlinear absorptions", "Nonlinear optical response", "Nonlinear photonic devices", "Saturable absorption", "Two photon absorption"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85068250867", "SubjectAreas": [["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"]], "AuthorData": {"57205134193": {"Name": "Miao R.", "AuthorID": "57205134193", "AffiliationID": "60024350", "AffiliationName": "College of Advanced Interdisciplinary Studies, National University of Defense Technology"}, "57221204270": {"Name": "Hu Y.", "AuthorID": "57221204270", "AffiliationID": "60024350", "AffiliationName": "College of Advanced Interdisciplinary Studies, National University of Defense Technology"}, "57203747260": {"Name": "Tang Y.", "AuthorID": "57203747260", "AffiliationID": "60024350", "AffiliationName": "College of Advanced Interdisciplinary Studies, National University of Defense Technology"}, "7401753972": {"Name": "Cheng X.", "AuthorID": "7401753972", "AffiliationID": "60024350", "AffiliationName": "College of Advanced Interdisciplinary Studies, National University of Defense Technology"}, "35590198700": {"Name": "Jiang T.", "AuthorID": "35590198700", "AffiliationID": "60024350", "AffiliationName": "College of Advanced Interdisciplinary Studies, National University of Defense Technology"}, "57208679238": {"Name": "Shu Z.", "AuthorID": "57208679238", "AffiliationID": "60032356, 60123353", "AffiliationName": "College of Mechanical and Vehicle Engineering, State Key Laboratory of Advanced Design and Manufacturing for Vehicle Body, Hunan University"}, "16033106200": {"Name": "Duan H.", "AuthorID": "16033106200", "AffiliationID": "60032356, 60123353", "AffiliationName": "College of Mechanical and Vehicle Engineering, State Key Laboratory of Advanced Design and Manufacturing for Vehicle Body, Hunan University"}, "57209619106": {"Name": "Hao H.", "AuthorID": "57209619106", "AffiliationID": "60024350", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of High Performance Computing, College of Computer, National University of Defense Technology"}, "55792104600": {"Name": "You J.", "AuthorID": "55792104600", "AffiliationID": "60069719", "AffiliationName": "National Innovation Institute of Defense Technology, Academy of Military Sciences PLA China"}, "36571054700": {"Name": "Zheng X.", "AuthorID": "36571054700", "AffiliationID": "60069719", "AffiliationName": "National Innovation Institute of Defense Technology, Academy of Military Sciences PLA China"}}}
