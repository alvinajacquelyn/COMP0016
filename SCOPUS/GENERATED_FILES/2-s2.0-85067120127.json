More recent best practice guidelines from the Care Quality Commission included the need for all children's units to have access to a senior learning disability nurse who can support staff and help them manage difficult situations. However, little evidence exists of the extent of learning disability nurse provision in children's hospitals or the nature and impact of this role. Here we report selected findings from a national mixed methods study of hospital care for children and young people with and without learning disabilities in England. The extent of learning disability nurse provision in children's hospitals is described and perceptions of staff working in hospitals with and without such provision is compared. Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with senior staff across 15 children's hospitals and an anonymous survey was sent to clinical and non-clinical staff with patient (children and young people) contact within these hospitals. The survey focused on six different elements of care for those with and without learning disability, with additional questions concerning identifying and tracking those with learning disabilities and two open-ended questions. Results: Forty-eight senior staff took part in interviews, which included a subset of nine nurses and one allied health professional employed in a dedicted learning disability nurse role, or similar. Surveys were completed by 1681, of whom 752 worked in a hospital with dedicated learning disability nurse provision. We found evidence of limited and varied learning disability nurse provision which was valued by hospital staff and shown to positively impact their perceptions of being capable to care for children and young people with learning disabilities, but not shown to increase staff perceptions of capacity or confidence, or how children and young people are valued within the hospital, their safety or access to appointments. Conclusion: Further consideration must be given to how learning disability nurse roles within children's hospitals are best operationalised in practice to have the greatest impact on staff and families, as well as how we monitor and evaluate them to ensure they are being utilised effectively and efficiently. Trial registration: The study has been registered on the NIHR CRN portfolio 20,461 (Phase 1), 31,336 (Phases 2-4).", "AuthorKeywords": ["Health services research", "Intellectual disability", "Learning disability nurse provision", "Mixed methods", "Workforce planning"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Attitude of Health Personnel", "Child", "Data Analysis", "England", "Hospitals, Pediatric", "Humans", "Interviews as Topic", "Learning Disabilities", "Nurse's Role", "Personnel Staffing and Scheduling", "Qualitative Research", "Social Determinants of Health", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85067120127", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"]], "AuthorData": {"16241855700": {"Name": "Oulton K.", "AuthorID": "16241855700", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Outcomes and Experience Research in Children's Health, Illness and Disability (ORCHID), Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust, Level 4, Barclay House"}, "57203081145": {"Name": "Wray J.", "AuthorID": "57203081145", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Outcomes and Experience Research in Children's Health, Illness and Disability (ORCHID), Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust, Level 4, Barclay House"}, "36240503300": {"Name": "Kenten C.", "AuthorID": "36240503300", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Outcomes and Experience Research in Children's Health, Illness and Disability (ORCHID), Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust, Level 4, Barclay House"}, "57199399530": {"Name": "Russell J.", "AuthorID": "57199399530", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Outcomes and Experience Research in Children's Health, Illness and Disability (ORCHID), Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust, Level 4, Barclay House"}, "7101616129": {"Name": "Gibson F.", "AuthorID": "7101616129", "AffiliationID": "60021097", "AffiliationName": "School of Health Sciences, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Surrey"}, "6701753786": {"Name": "Hassiotis A.", "AuthorID": "6701753786", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Division of Psychiatry London, Maple House"}, "14034906600": {"Name": "Tuffrey-Wijne I.", "AuthorID": "14034906600", "AffiliationID": "60029329, 60172339, 60033359", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Health, Social Care and Education, Cranmer Terrace, Kingston University and St George's, University of London"}, "7101675308": {"Name": "Whiting M.", "AuthorID": "7101675308", "AffiliationID": "60032760", "AffiliationName": "Health Research Building, University of Hertfordshire, College Lane Campus, Hatfield"}}}
