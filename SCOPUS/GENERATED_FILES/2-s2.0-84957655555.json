Standardized interview, observational and questionnaire measures of maternal wellbeing, mother-child relationships and child adjustment were administered to mothers, children and teachers. There were no differences in parenting quality between family types apart from lower mother-child conflict in solo mother families. Neither were there differences in child adjustment. Perceived financial difficulties, child's gender, and parenting stress were associated with children's adjustment problems in both family types. The findings suggest that solo motherhood, in itself, does not result in psychological problems for children.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Child adjustment", "Parenting", "Single mothers by choice", "Solo mothers"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Child", "Emotional Adjustment", "Female", "Humans", "Interviews as Topic", "Male", "Maternal Behavior", "Mother-Child Relations", "Mothers", "Single Parent", "Single-Parent Family", "Socioeconomic Factors", "Surveys and Questionnaires"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84957655555", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychology (all)", "PSYC", "3200"]], "AuthorData": {"7006221075": {"Name": "Golombok S.", "AuthorID": "7006221075", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Family Research, University of Cambridge"}, "57052627600": {"Name": "Zadeh S.", "AuthorID": "57052627600", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Family Research, University of Cambridge"}, "55547958300": {"Name": "Imrie S.", "AuthorID": "55547958300", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Family Research, University of Cambridge"}, "24168523400": {"Name": "Freeman T.", "AuthorID": "24168523400", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Family Research, University of Cambridge"}, "57052122200": {"Name": "Smith V.", "AuthorID": "57052122200", "AffiliationID": "101475895", "AffiliationName": "London Women's Clinic"}}}
