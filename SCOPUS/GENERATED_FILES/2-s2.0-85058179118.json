The Born-Oppenheimer (BO) ab initio grid points of Pavanello et al. [J. Chem. Phys.136, 184303 (2012)] are refitted as BOPES75K, which reproduces the energies below dissociation with a root mean square deviation of 0.05 cm\u22121; points between dissociation and 75,000 cm\u22121 are reproduced with the average accuracy of a few wavenumbers. The new PES75K+ potential combines BOPES75K with adiabatic, relativistic and quantum electrodynamics (QED) surfaces to provide the most accurate representation of the H+3 global potential to date, overcoming the limitations on previous high accuracy H+3 PESs near and above dissociation. PES75K+ can be used to provide predictions of bound rovibrational energy levels with an accuracy of approaching 0.1 cm\u22121. Calculation of rovibrational energy levels within PES75K+ suggests that the non-adiabatic correction remains a limiting factor. The PES is also constructed to give the correct asymptotic limit making it suitable for use in studies of the H++H2 prototypical chemical reaction. An improved dissociation energy for H+3 is derived as D0=35,076 \u00b1 2cm\u22121.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Ab initio", "dissociation", "potential energy surface", "spectroscopy"], "IndexKeywords": ["Ab initio", "Asymptotic limits", "Born-Oppenheimer", "Dissociation energies", "Global potential energy surfaces", "Quantum electrodynamics", "Ro-vibrational energies", "Root mean square deviations"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85058179118", "SubjectAreas": [["Biophysics", "BIOC", "1304"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"]], "AuthorData": {"54891364400": {"Name": "Mizus I.I.", "AuthorID": "54891364400", "AffiliationID": "60011774", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Applied Physics, Russian Academy of Sciences"}, "7006554518": {"Name": "Polyansky O.L.", "AuthorID": "7006554518", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "35583085500": {"Name": "Zobov N.F.", "AuthorID": "35583085500", "AffiliationID": "60011774", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Applied Physics, Russian Academy of Sciences"}, "26423856700": {"Name": "McKemmish L.K.", "AuthorID": "26423856700", "AffiliationID": "60028333", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of New South Wales"}, "7101645601": {"Name": "Tennyson J.", "AuthorID": "7101645601", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "6701573471": {"Name": "Alijah A.", "AuthorID": "6701573471", "AffiliationID": "60019394, 60008134", "AffiliationName": "Groupe de Spectrom\u00e9trie Mol\u00e9culaire et Atmosph\u00e9rique, GSMA, UMR CNRS 7331, Universit\u00e9 de Reims Champagne-Ardenne"}}}
