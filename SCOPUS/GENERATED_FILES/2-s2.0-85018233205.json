A limitation of CAR technology is on-target off-tumor toxicity caused by target antigen expression on normal cells. Using GD2 as a model cancer antigen, we hypothesized that this could be minimized by using T cells expressing V\u03b39V\u03b42 TCR, which recognizes transformed cells in a major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-unrestricted manner, in combination with a co-stimulatory CAR that would function independently of the TCR. An anti-GD2 CAR containing a solitary endodomain derived from the NKG2D adaptor DAP10 was expressed in V\u03b39V\u03b42+ T cells. Differential ligation of the CAR and/or TCR using antibody-coated beads showed that pro-inflammatory cytokine response depended on activation of both receptors. Moreover, in killing assays, GD2-expressing neuroblastoma cells that engaged the V\u03b39V\u03b42 TCR were efficiently lysed, whereas cells that expressed GD2 equivalently but did not engage the V\u03b39V\u03b42 TCR were untouched. Differentiation between X-on tumor and X-off tumor offers potential for safer immunotherapy and broader target selection.", "AuthorKeywords": ["chimeric antigen receptor", "toxicity", "\u03b3\u03b4T cell"], "IndexKeywords": ["Antigens, Neoplasm", "CD28 Antigens", "CD3 Complex", "Cell Line, Tumor", "Coculture Techniques", "Cytotoxicity, Immunologic", "Gangliosides", "Gene Expression", "Humans", "Immunotherapy", "Lymphocyte Activation", "Mutant Chimeric Proteins", "Neurons", "Protein Engineering", "Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell", "T-Lymphocytes"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85018233205", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Medicine", "BIOC", "1313"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"], ["Drug Discovery", "PHAR", "3002"]], "AuthorData": {"56108105900": {"Name": "Fisher J.", "AuthorID": "56108105900", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "56151198400": {"Name": "Abramowski P.", "AuthorID": "56151198400", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "57194103567": {"Name": "Wisidagamage Don N.D.", "AuthorID": "57194103567", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "12770706300": {"Name": "Flutter B.", "AuthorID": "12770706300", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "36624967100": {"Name": "Capsomidis A.", "AuthorID": "36624967100", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "56884070200": {"Name": "Cheung G.W.K.", "AuthorID": "56884070200", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "7005333544": {"Name": "Gustafsson K.", "AuthorID": "7005333544", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "55731054400": {"Name": "Anderson J.", "AuthorID": "55731054400", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Child Health, University College London"}}}
