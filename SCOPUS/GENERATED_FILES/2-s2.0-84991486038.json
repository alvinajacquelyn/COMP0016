In particular, it provides upper bounds (sufficient conditions) on the number of measurements required to drive the probability of misclassification to zero in the low-noise regime, both for random measurements and designed ones. Such bounds reveal two important operational regimes that are a function of the characteristics of the source: 1) when the number of classes is less than or equal to the dimension of the space spanned by signals in each class, reliable classification is possible in the low-noise regime by using a one-vs-all measurement design; 2) when the dimension of the spaces spanned by signals in each class is lower than the number of classes, reliable classification is guaranteed in the low-noise regime by using a simple random measurement design. Simulation results both with synthetic and real data show that our analysis is sharp, in the sense that it is able to gauge the number of measurements required to drive the misclassification probability to zero in the low-noise regime.", "AuthorKeywords": ["classification", "Compressed sensing", "compressive classification", "dimensionality reduction", "Gaussian mixture models", "measurement design", "phase transitions", "random measurements"], "IndexKeywords": ["Dimensionality reduction", "Gaussian Mixture Model", "Linear measurements", "Measurement designs", "Misclassification probability", "Probability of misclassification", "Random measurement", "Synthetic and real data"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84991486038", "SubjectAreas": [["Signal Processing", "COMP", "1711"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"43762288300": {"Name": "Reboredo H.", "AuthorID": "43762288300", "AffiliationID": "60007249, 60017375", "AffiliationName": "Instituto de Telecomunica\u00e7\u00f5es, Departamento de Ci\u00eancia de Computadores da, Faculdade de Ci\u00eancias da, Universidade Do Porto"}, "24802572900": {"Name": "Renna F.", "AuthorID": "24802572900", "AffiliationID": "60119937, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics, University of Cambridge"}, "35586083000": {"Name": "Calderbank R.", "AuthorID": "35586083000", "AffiliationID": "60008724", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Duke University"}, "57210526627": {"Name": "Rodrigues M.R.D.", "AuthorID": "57210526627", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}}}
