Methods: We recruited 43 FAD mutation carriers-36 PSEN1, 7 APP (20 symptomatic, 23 presymptomatic)-and 42 healthy controls to a longitudinal clinical and MRI study. T1-weighted MRI scans were acquired at baseline in all participants; 55 individuals (33 mutation carriers; 22 controls) had multiple (mean 2.9) follow-up scans approximately annually. Cortical thickness was measured using FreeSurfer. A cortical thinning signature was identified from symptomatic FAD participants. We then examined cortical thickness changes in this signature region in presymptomatic carriers and assessed associations with cognitive performance. Results: The cortical signature included 6 regions: entorhinal cortex, inferior parietal cortex, precuneus, superior parietal cortex, superior frontal cortex, and supramarginal gyrus. There were significant differences in mean cortical signature thickness between mutation carriers and controls 3 years before predicted symptom onset. The earliest significant difference in a single region, detectable 4 years preonset, was in the precuneus. Rate of change in cortical thickness became significantly different in the cortical signature at 5 years before predicted onset, and in the precuneus at 8 years preonset. Baseline mean signature thickness predicted rate of subsequent thinning and correlated with presymptomatic cognitive change. Conclusions: The FAD cortical signature appears to be similar to that described for sporadic AD. All component regions showed significant presymptomatic thinning. A composite signature may provide more robust results than a single region and have utility as an outcome measure in presymptomatic trials.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Alzheimer Disease", "Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor", "Asymptomatic Diseases", "Cerebral Cortex", "Disease Progression", "Family Health", "Female", "Humans", "Image Processing, Computer-Assisted", "Longitudinal Studies", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Neuropsychological Tests", "Presenilin-1", "PubMed"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84994895710", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"56702191000": {"Name": "Weston P.S.J.", "AuthorID": "56702191000", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dementia Research Centre, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "25630004900": {"Name": "Nicholas J.M.", "AuthorID": "25630004900", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "57195292229": {"Name": "Lehmann M.", "AuthorID": "57195292229", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dementia Research Centre, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "33467902600": {"Name": "Ryan N.S.", "AuthorID": "33467902600", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dementia Research Centre, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "55561994700": {"Name": "Liang Y.", "AuthorID": "55561994700", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dementia Research Centre, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "56982721600": {"Name": "Macpherson K.", "AuthorID": "56982721600", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dementia Research Centre, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "24376919100": {"Name": "Modat M.", "AuthorID": "24376919100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Transitional Imaging Group, Centre for Medical Image Computing, University College London"}, "7103182857": {"Name": "Rossor M.N.", "AuthorID": "7103182857", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dementia Research Centre, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "7103177641": {"Name": "Schott J.M.", "AuthorID": "7103177641", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dementia Research Centre, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "7201444328": {"Name": "Fox N.C.", "AuthorID": "7201444328", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dementia Research Centre, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "6602233595": {"Name": "Ourselin S.", "AuthorID": "6602233595", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Transitional Imaging Group, Centre for Medical Image Computing, University College London"}}}
