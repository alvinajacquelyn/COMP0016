Although a clear trend towards personalised fabrication is perceived, here we accentuate the merits and shortcomings of each technology, providing insights into aspects such as the efficiency of production, global supply, and logistics. Contemporary opportunities for 3DP in drug discovery and pharmaceutical development and manufacturing are unveiled, offering a forward-looking view on its potential uses as a digitised tool for personalised dispensing of drugs.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Drug Compounding", "Drug Discovery", "Humans", "Molecular Structure", "Pharmaceutical Preparations", "Printing, Three-Dimensional", "Structure-Activity Relationship"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85048231796", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"], ["Drug Discovery", "PHAR", "3002"]], "AuthorData": {"57197865403": {"Name": "Awad A.", "AuthorID": "57197865403", "AffiliationID": "60016379, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "57190062563": {"Name": "Trenfield S.", "AuthorID": "57190062563", "AffiliationID": "60016379, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "6602683597": {"Name": "Gaisford S.", "AuthorID": "6602683597", "AffiliationID": "60118373", "AffiliationName": "FabRx Ltd"}, "7003826707": {"Name": "Basit A.", "AuthorID": "7003826707", "AffiliationID": "60118373", "AffiliationName": "FabRx Ltd"}, "37037477300": {"Name": "Goyanes A.", "AuthorID": "37037477300", "AffiliationID": "60118373", "AffiliationName": "FabRx Ltd"}}}
