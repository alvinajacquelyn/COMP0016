We take into account finite measurement efficiencies and, in order to quantify the advantage granted by monitoring, we analyse the quantum Fisher information associated with such a diffusion parameter, identify optimal measurements in limiting cases, and assess the performance of such measurements in more realistic conditions.", "AuthorKeywords": ["quantum control", "quantum estimation", "stochastic master equation", "wave-function collapse models"], "IndexKeywords": ["Continuous measurements", "Continuous monitoring", "Measurement efficiency", "Optimal measurements", "Quantum control", "Realistic conditions", "Stochastic master equations", "Wave-function collapse model"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84992698973", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"8977729200": {"Name": "Genoni M.", "AuthorID": "8977729200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "57197327212": {"Name": "Duarte O.", "AuthorID": "57197327212", "AffiliationID": "60008088", "AffiliationName": "Sao Carlos Institute of Physics, University of Sao Paulo"}, "7006026939": {"Name": "Serafini A.", "AuthorID": "7006026939", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}}}
