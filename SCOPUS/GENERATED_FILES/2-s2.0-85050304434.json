One hundred and fifty-five university staff and students were randomly allocated to a 2-week, self-guided, online MBI with or without mindfulness meditation practice, or a wait list control. Measures of mindfulness, perceived stress, perseverative thinking and anxiety/depression symptoms within were administered before and after the intervention period. Intention to treat analysis identified significant differences between groups on change over time for all measured outcomes. Participation in the MBIs was associated with significant improvements in all measured domains (all ps < 0.05), with effect sizes in the small to medium range (0.25 to 0.37, 95% CIs 0.11 to 0.56). No significant changes on these measures were found for the control group. Change in perseverative thinking was found to mediate the relationship between condition and improvement on perceived stress and anxiety/depression symptom outcomes. Contrary to our hypotheses, no differences between the intervention conditions were found. Limitations of the study included reliance on self-report data, a relatively high attrition rate and absence of a longer-term follow-up. This study provides evidence in support of the feasibility and effectiveness of brief, self-guided MBIs in a non-clinical population and suggests that reduced perseverative thinking may be a mechanism of change. Our findings provide preliminary evidence for the effectiveness of a mindfulness psychoeducation condition, without an invitation to formal mindfulness meditation practice. Further research is needed to confirm and better understand these results and to test the potential of such interventions.", "AuthorKeywords": ["E-mental health", "Internet intervention", "Mediation", "Meditation", "Mindfulness", "Self-help"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85050304434", "SubjectAreas": [["Social Psychology", "PSYC", "3207"], ["Health (social science)", "SOCI", "3306"], ["Experimental and Cognitive Psychology", "PSYC", "3205"], ["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"], ["Applied Psychology", "PSYC", "3202"]], "AuthorData": {"7004494055": {"Name": "Cavanagh K.", "AuthorID": "7004494055", "AffiliationID": "60017317", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, University of Sussex"}, "56602889400": {"Name": "Churchard A.", "AuthorID": "56602889400", "AffiliationID": "60017317", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, University of Sussex"}, "57191057258": {"Name": "O\u2019Hanlon P.", "AuthorID": "57191057258", "AffiliationID": "60017317", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, University of Sussex"}, "57203025280": {"Name": "Mundy T.", "AuthorID": "57203025280", "AffiliationID": "60017317", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, University of Sussex"}, "57203013499": {"Name": "Votolato P.", "AuthorID": "57203013499", "AffiliationID": "60017317", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, University of Sussex"}, "56515836600": {"Name": "Gu J.", "AuthorID": "56515836600", "AffiliationID": "60017317", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, University of Sussex"}, "37038599500": {"Name": "Strauss C.", "AuthorID": "37038599500", "AffiliationID": "60170299", "AffiliationName": "Sussex Partnership NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7401454540": {"Name": "Jones F.", "AuthorID": "7401454540", "AffiliationID": "60019444", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, Politics and Sociology, Canterbury Christ Church University"}}}
