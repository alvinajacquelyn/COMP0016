We use a unique dataset from Poland which contains information on the academic outcomes of students in the humanities, science and mathematics lower secondary school exams as well as the position students occupy in their classroom register. We find that students whose names are recorded near the end of the class list have lower performance than those students whose names are recorded near the beginning of the list. The effect appears to be larger for performance in the humanities exam, and for low-achieving boys who attend large classes.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Academic Performance", "Achievement", "Cohort Studies", "Female", "Humanities", "Humans", "Male", "Mathematics", "Poland", "Science", "Students"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85047838815", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"35613910500": {"Name": "Borgonovi F.", "AuthorID": "35613910500", "AffiliationID": "60009357", "AffiliationName": "Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), Directorate for Education and Skills"}, "15848170800": {"Name": "Jakubowski M.", "AuthorID": "15848170800", "AffiliationID": "60013756", "AffiliationName": "University of Warsaw, Faculty of Economic Sciences"}, "45561420300": {"Name": "Pokropek A.", "AuthorID": "45561420300", "AffiliationID": "60082549, 60014383", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Philosophy and Sociology, Polish Academy of Science"}}}
