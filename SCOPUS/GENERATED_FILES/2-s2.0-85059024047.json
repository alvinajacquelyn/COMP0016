Material and methods: Patients with a pathologically confirmed stage III non-anaplastic WT at nephrectomy (Group A) or with an \u2018inoperable\u2019 tumour at diagnosis managed by biopsy and pre-operative chemotherapy (Actinomycin D-Vincristine-Doxorubicin) but stage I or II at subsequent nephrectomy (Group B) were included. Results: The 4-year overall (OS)/event free survival (EFS) for Group A (n = 117) patients was 90%(95%CI:83\u201394)/81%(CI:73\u201387) and for Group B (n = 32) 94%(CI:77\u201398)/88%(CI:70\u201395). The 4-year OS/EFS of patients with pathological stage III WT according to whether they received flank/abdominal radiotherapy (95 patients) or not (37 patients, 22 from UKW3 pooled with 17 patients from UKW2) were 91%(CI:83\u201395)/82%(CI:73\u201389), and 84%(CI:67\u201392)/78%(CI:61\u201389), respectively. The 4-year OS/EFS for patients having one reason to be stage III versus two or three was 92%(CI:84\u201396)/83%(CI:73\u201390) and 85%(CI:70\u201393)/78%(CI:61\u201388), respectively. Conclusion: Our findings question the inclusion of biopsy or pre-operative chemotherapy as sole criterion for assigning a tumour stage III. Selected patients with pathological stage III WT can survive without radiotherapy. Whilst cautious interpretation is needed due to the post hoc nature of these analyses, further biological studies may better characterise those who could benefit from reduced therapy.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Radiotherapy", "Stage III", "Wilms tumour"], "IndexKeywords": ["Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols", "Biopsy", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Dactinomycin", "Disease-Free Survival", "Doxorubicin", "Female", "Humans", "Infant", "Kidney Neoplasms", "Male", "Neoplasm Staging", "Nephrectomy", "Preoperative Care", "Treatment Outcome", "Vincristine", "Wilms Tumor"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85059024047", "SubjectAreas": [["Hematology", "MEDI", "2720"], ["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"6505794712": {"Name": "Irtan S.", "AuthorID": "6505794712", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Section, Developmental Biology & Cancer Programme, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "7005535741": {"Name": "Pritchard-Jones K.", "AuthorID": "7005535741", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Section, Developmental Biology & Cancer Programme, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "8639911200": {"Name": "Messahel B.", "AuthorID": "8639911200", "AffiliationID": "60017488, 60016390", "AffiliationName": "Pediatric Hematology-Oncology Department, Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge University Hospitals"}, "55347231700": {"Name": "Moroz V.", "AuthorID": "55347231700", "AffiliationID": "60019702, 60012754", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Research UK Clinical Trials Unit (CRCTU), School of Cancer Sciences, University of Birmingham"}, "56648644400": {"Name": "Taylor R.E.", "AuthorID": "56648644400", "AffiliationID": "60004572", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Oncology, Swansea University"}, "23993457700": {"Name": "Grundy R.", "AuthorID": "23993457700", "AffiliationID": "60030816", "AffiliationName": "Paediatric Oncology, Queen's Medical Centre"}, "7006020338": {"Name": "Kelsey A.", "AuthorID": "7006020338", "AffiliationID": "60023969", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, Royal Manchester Children's Hospital"}, "7005591155": {"Name": "Vujanic G.", "AuthorID": "7005591155", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, Cardiff University"}, "null": {"Name": null, "AuthorID": null, "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
