The layered MoS 2 has recently attracted significant attention for its excellent nonlinear optical properties. Here, the ultrafast nonlinear optical (NLO) absorption and excited carrier dynamics of layered MoS 2 (monolayer, 3\u20134 layers, and 6\u20138 layers) are investigated via Z-scan and transient absorption spectra. Our experimental results reveal that NLO absorption coefficients of these MoS 2 increase from\u201327 \u00d7 10 3 cm/GW to\u201311 \u00d7 10 3 cm/GW with more layers at 400-nm laser excitation, while the values decrease from 2.0 \u00d7 10 3 cm/GW to 0.8 \u00d7 10 3 cm/GW at 800 nm. In addition, at high pump fluence, when the NLO response occurs, the results show that not only the reformation of the excitonic bands, but also the recovery time of NLO response decreases from 150 ps to 100 ps with an increasing number of layers, while the reductive energy of A excitonic band decreases from 191.7 meV to 51.1 meV. The intriguing NLO response of MoS 2 provides excellent potentials for the next-generation optoelectronic and photonic devices.", "AuthorKeywords": ["two-dimensional materials", "Ultrafast optics", "ultrafast photonic devices"], "IndexKeywords": ["Absorption co-efficient", "Excited carriers", "Non-linear optical properties", "Transient absorption spectra", "Two-dimensional materials", "Ultrafast nonlinear", "Ultrafast optics", "Ultrafast photonic devices"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85059776539", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"]], "AuthorData": {"57205367033": {"Name": "Wang Y.", "AuthorID": "57205367033", "AffiliationID": "60024350", "AffiliationName": "College of Advanced Interdisciplinary Studies, National University of Defense Technology"}, "7401753972": {"Name": "Cheng X.", "AuthorID": "7401753972", "AffiliationID": "60024350", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of High Performance Computing, National University of Defense Technology"}, "57202644684": {"Name": "Guo Z.", "AuthorID": "57202644684", "AffiliationID": "60024350", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of High Performance Computing, National University of Defense Technology"}, "55792104600": {"Name": "You J.", "AuthorID": "55792104600", "AffiliationID": "60069719", "AffiliationName": "National Innovation Institute of Defense Technology, Academy of Military Sciences PLA China"}, "36571054700": {"Name": "Zheng X.", "AuthorID": "36571054700", "AffiliationID": "60069719", "AffiliationName": "National Innovation Institute of Defense Technology, Academy of Military Sciences PLA China"}, "55629802300": {"Name": "Zhang Z.", "AuthorID": "55629802300", "AffiliationID": "60069750", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Laser Interaction with Matter, Northwest Institute of Nuclear Technology"}}}
