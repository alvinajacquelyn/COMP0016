Scholars have argued that frameworks attempting to measure the use-value of knowledge production could end up influencing the selection of research topics, limiting research agendas, and privileging linear over complex research designs. Our article responds to these concerns by calling upon insights from anthropology to reconceptualise impact. We argue that, to conduct socially beneficial studies, impact needs to be turned from a product to an inclusive process of engagement. Anthropology\u2019s epistemologically and methodologically rich tradition of ethnography offers a particularly apposite set of tools to achieve this goal. We present three concrete examples of how we have used ethnography to impact on the work we carry out, particularly in shaping multidisciplinary team-based research approaches.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Anthropology", "Ethnography", "Healthcare", "Impact", "Participatory research", "Process", "REF2014", "Reflexivity"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84940551467", "SubjectAreas": [["Anthropology", "SOCI", "3314"]], "AuthorData": {"56601350100": {"Name": "Baim-Lance A.", "AuthorID": "56601350100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "DAHR at UCL"}, "37075880600": {"Name": "Vindrola-Padros C.", "AuthorID": "37075880600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "DAHR at UCL"}}}
