They have demonstrated that CRISPR-mediated knockout of the native T-cell receptor (TCR) b chain dramatically improves the expression of inserted therapeutic ab and gd TCRs in comparison with the same TCRs inserted without endogenous TCR-b chain knockout. Although insertion of TCRs or chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) into the TCR locus has been reported previously, the significant improvement in functional avidity of TCR modified T cells shown here is novel.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats", "Gene Editing", "Genetic Engineering", "Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell", "T-Lymphocytes"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85040819617", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"], ["Hematology", "MEDI", "2720"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"8747891100": {"Name": "Morris E.", "AuthorID": "8747891100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
