We have synthesised and characterised a novel organic-inorganic hybrid crystal, [(CH 3 ) 2 NH 2 ] 2 KCr(CN) 6 . The thermal DSC, TMA, DTG and DTA analyses indicate two solid-to-solid structural phase transitions (PTs). According to the X-ray diffraction experiments, the first PT at 220 K is isostructural, since it does not involve a change of the space group. This transition occurs between the states, where the (CH 3 ) 2 NH 2 + cations are orientationally disordered and ordered (frozen). The other reversible PT at 481 K leads to a melt-like phase similar to the one observed in plastic crystals or polar liquids. Dielectric spectroscopy has been used to characterise the switching properties of the dipole moments in the vicinity of the PTs. Continuous-wave electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy was employed to investigate the effect of ordering on the local environment of the Cr 3+ ions. We have also applied the quasielastic neutron scattering (QENS) technique as well as 1 H NMR spectroscopy to measure the dynamics of the (CH 3 ) 2 NH 2 + cations residing in the inorganic framework.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["1H NMR spectroscopy", "Electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy", "Local environments", "Organic-inorganic hybrid crystals", "Plastic crystals", "Quasi elastic neutron scattering", "Structural phase transition", "Switching properties"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85063464625", "SubjectAreas": [["Inorganic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1604"]], "AuthorData": {"56001747700": {"Name": "Rok M.", "AuthorID": "56001747700", "AffiliationID": "60016147", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Chemistry, University of Wroclaw"}, "56276803900": {"Name": "Bator G.", "AuthorID": "56276803900", "AffiliationID": "60016147", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Chemistry, University of Wroclaw"}, "57207990405": {"Name": "Repe\u0107 J.", "AuthorID": "57207990405", "AffiliationID": "60016147", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Chemistry, University of Wroclaw"}, "8358289000": {"Name": "Zarychta B.", "AuthorID": "8358289000", "AffiliationID": "60004700", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Chemistry, University of Opole"}, "56309920100": {"Name": "Dziuk B.", "AuthorID": "56309920100", "AffiliationID": "60004700", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Chemistry, University of Opole"}, "7003514165": {"Name": "Medycki W.", "AuthorID": "7003514165", "AffiliationID": "60011405, 60014383", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Molecular Physics, Polish Academy of Sciences"}, "10041962400": {"Name": "Zamponi M.", "AuthorID": "10041962400", "AffiliationID": "60007774", "AffiliationName": "Forschungszentrum J\u00fclich GmbH, J\u00fclich Centre for Neutron Science (JCNS), Heinz Maier-Leibnitz Zentrum (MLZ)"}, "57201988424": {"Name": "Usevi\u010dius G.", "AuthorID": "57201988424", "AffiliationID": "60059987", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Physics, Vilnius University"}, "55865561500": {"Name": "\u0160imenas M.", "AuthorID": "55865561500", "AffiliationID": "60059987", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Physics, Vilnius University"}, "7003687871": {"Name": "Banys J.", "AuthorID": "7003687871", "AffiliationID": "60059987", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Physics, Vilnius University"}}}
