Methods: A population-based cross-sectional study was conducted with 746 community-dwelling older adults aged \u2265 60 years living in the rural areas of Kegalle district of Sri Lanka in 2016. A three-stage probability sampling design was used to recruit participants. Frailty and QoL were assessed using the Fried phenotype and Older People\u2019s Quality of Life Questionnaire, respectively. Multivariable linear regression was used to estimate the association of frailty with QoL after accounting for the complex sampling design. Results: The median (IQR) age of the sample was 68 (64:75) years and comprised of 56.7% women. 15.2% (95% CI 12.4%, 18.7%) were frail and 48.5% (95% CI 43.9%, 53.2%) were pre-frail. The unadjusted means (SE) of the total QoL score for the robust, pre-frail and frail groups were 139.2 (0.64), 131.8 (1.04) and 119.2 (1.35), respectively. After adjusting for covariates in the final multivariable model, the estimated differences in mean QoL were lower for both frail and pre-frail groups versus robust. The estimated reduction in the total QoL score was 7.3% for those frail and 2.1% for those pre-frail. All QoL domains apart from \u2018social relationships and participation\u2019, \u2018home and neighbourhood\u2019 and \u2018financial circumstances\u2019 were associated with frailty. Conclusions: Frailty was associated with a small but significant lower quality of life in this rural Sri Lankan population, which appears largely explained by \u2018health\u2019 and \u2018independence, control over life and freedom\u2019 QoL domains. Interventions aiming to improve quality of life in frail older adults should consider targeting these aspects.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Community-dwelling older adults", "Frailty", "Quality of life", "Sri Lanka", "WHO South-East Asia region"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Female", "Frail Elderly", "Frailty", "Geriatric Assessment", "Humans", "Independent Living", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Quality of Life", "Residence Characteristics", "Rural Population", "Sri Lanka", "Surveys and Questionnaires"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85062597891", "SubjectAreas": [["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"57201030779": {"Name": "Siriwardhana D.D.", "AuthorID": "57201030779", "AffiliationID": "60071104", "AffiliationName": "Department of Disability Studies, Faculty of Medicine, University of Kelaniya"}, "6602151058": {"Name": "Rait G.", "AuthorID": "6602151058", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Primary Care and Population Health, University College London"}, "57203175207": {"Name": "Walters K.R.", "AuthorID": "57203175207", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Primary Care and Population Health, University College London"}, "15844556600": {"Name": "Weerasinghe M.C.", "AuthorID": "15844556600", "AffiliationID": "60071075, 60071074", "AffiliationName": "Department of Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Colombo"}, "35363010600": {"Name": "Scholes S.", "AuthorID": "35363010600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}}}
