The discovery of the genetic defect underlying Familial Mediterranean fever in 1997 has proved exceptionally informative about the innate immune system and the regulation of pro inflammatory cytokines particularly IL-1. Although extremely rare, systemic autoinflammatory diseases are important to recognise as many can now be completely controlled by long term drug therapies. Diagnosis relies on clinical suspicion followed by genetic testing. This review will focus on the main systemic autoinflammatory diseases.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Autoinflammation", "Cryopyrin associated periodic syndrome (CAPS)", "Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF)", "Interleukin 1 (IL-1)", "Mevalonate kinase deficiency (MKD)", "Systemic autoinflammatory syndromes", "Tumour necrosis factor receptor associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS)"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Female", "Hereditary Autoinflammatory Diseases", "Humans", "Infant", "Male", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84959134791", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"]], "AuthorData": {"22635508400": {"Name": "Pepper R.J.", "AuthorID": "22635508400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre For Nephrology, and Centre for Amyloidosis and Acute Phase Proteins, Division of Medicine, University College London"}, "7004915734": {"Name": "Lachmann H.J.", "AuthorID": "7004915734", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre For Nephrology, and Centre for Amyloidosis and Acute Phase Proteins, Division of Medicine, University College London"}}}
