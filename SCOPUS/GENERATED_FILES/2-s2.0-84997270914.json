The crystallizations are comparatively rapid with fully crystalline material resulting in 1\u20133 days at 443 K. In contrast to many recipes reported for pure silica materials, the synthesis is performed without the use of HF or without the need to alter the properties of the SDA, while significantly lower amounts of both ionic liquid and mineralizing agent are required. The results obtained indicate that effective phase control can be achieved from a primary gel composition by minor changes to either the silica source or the water/sodium content, with a strong specificity in the formation of topologies with interconnected 10-rings.", "AuthorKeywords": ["10-ring", "Imidazolium", "Ionic liquid", "Synthesis", "Zeolite"], "IndexKeywords": ["10-ring", "Gel compositions", "Imidazolium", "Imidazolium-based ionic liquid", "Mineralizing agents", "Silica sources", "Structure directing agents", "Zeolitic structure"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84997270914", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Mechanics of Materials", "ENGI", "2211"]], "AuthorData": {"16401902100": {"Name": "Lezcano-Gonz\u00e1lez I.", "AuthorID": "16401902100", "AffiliationID": "60023254", "AffiliationName": "Research Complex at Harwell, Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, Harwell Science and Innovation Campus"}, "57206612883": {"Name": "O'Brien M.G.", "AuthorID": "57206612883", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Department of Chemistry"}, "8889480300": {"Name": "Beale A.M.", "AuthorID": "8889480300", "AffiliationID": "60023254", "AffiliationName": "Research Complex at Harwell, Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, Harwell Science and Innovation Campus"}, "56563020600": {"Name": "Po\u010dkaj M.", "AuthorID": "56563020600", "AffiliationID": "60031106", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Chemistry and Chemical Technology, University of Ljubljana"}, "15763667700": {"Name": "S\u00e1nchez-S\u00e1nchez M.", "AuthorID": "15763667700", "AffiliationID": "60021246", "AffiliationName": "Instituto de Cat\u00e1lisis y Petroleoqu\u00edmica, ICP-CSIC"}}}
