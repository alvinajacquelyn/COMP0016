Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.There is a lack of scientific evidence to support the best management of neonatal seizures. Current strategies for neonatal seizure management were investigated by analysis of all surveys published during the time period 2000-2012. Methods for seizure diagnosis and availability of electroencephalogram (EEG), including monitoring, varied. Phenobarbital was the drug of first choice, and the use of off-label drugs and treatment times varied. Conclusion: We conclude that there is an urgent need for more evidence-based studies to guide neonatal seizure management.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Anti-epileptic drugs", "Electroencephalogram", "Newborn", "Phenobarbital", "Status epilepticus"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84921596832", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"]], "AuthorData": {"7003626592": {"Name": "Hellstr\u00f6m-Westas L.", "AuthorID": "7003626592", "AffiliationID": "60015216", "AffiliationName": "Department of Women's and Children's Health, Uppsala University Hospital"}, "7004954304": {"Name": "\u00c5gren J.", "AuthorID": "7004954304", "AffiliationID": "60015216", "AffiliationName": "Department of Women's and Children's Health, Uppsala University Hospital"}, "6602292136": {"Name": "Boylan G.", "AuthorID": "6602292136", "AffiliationID": "60025160", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatrics and Child Health, University College Cork"}}}
