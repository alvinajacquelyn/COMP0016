The ageing process is highly heterogeneous with several possible phenotypes ranging from healthy ageing to frailty. While in healthy old individuals, cardiovascular diseases can be treated following suggestions derived from international guidelines, treatment of pre-frail and frail elderly patients is extremely complicated and very frequently recommended standard treatments in these patients cannot be applied. Objective: In the present review, we will discuss the management and treatment of cardiovascular diseases in the elderly. Methods: This review was based on searches of the PubMed database using the following terms: \u201celderly\u201d, \u201caging\u201d, \u201cfrailty\u201d, \u201cheart failure\u201d, \u201chypertension\u201d, \u201catrial fibrillation\u201d, \u201cstroke prevention\u201d, \u201cguidelines\u201d, \u201ctherapy\u201d, \u201cmanagement\u201d. Results: we have summarized the current therapies for elderly patients with cardiovascular disease, focusing our attention on heart failure, hypertension and atrial fibrillation that are very common and often coexisting diseases in the elderly. Conclusion: new studies involving frail elderly patients are needed in order to provide evidence-based treatment strategies and to allow more personalized medical approaches.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Atrial fibrillation", "Cardiovascular diseases", "Elderly", "Frailty", "Heart failure", "Hypertension", "Therapy"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85025109442", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Medicine", "BIOC", "1313"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"], ["Genetics (clinical)", "MEDI", "2716"]], "AuthorData": {"57194680251": {"Name": "Bencivenga L.", "AuthorID": "57194680251", "AffiliationID": "60017293", "AffiliationName": "Division of Geriatrics, Department of Translational Medical Sciences, Federico II University of Naples"}, "57194687421": {"Name": "Grieco F.V.", "AuthorID": "57194687421", "AffiliationID": "60017293", "AffiliationName": "Division of Geriatrics, Department of Translational Medical Sciences, Federico II University of Naples"}, "56196018200": {"Name": "Femminella G.D.", "AuthorID": "56196018200", "AffiliationID": "60017293", "AffiliationName": "Division of Geriatrics, Department of Translational Medical Sciences, Federico II University of Naples"}, "6505895452": {"Name": "de Lucia C.", "AuthorID": "6505895452", "AffiliationID": "60013936, 60030398", "AffiliationName": "Center for Translational Medicine, Department of Pharmacology, Lewis Katz School of Medicine, Temple University"}, "55391030100": {"Name": "Komici K.", "AuthorID": "55391030100", "AffiliationID": "60017293", "AffiliationName": "Division of Geriatrics, Department of Translational Medical Sciences, Federico II University of Naples"}, "7004156543": {"Name": "Rengo C.", "AuthorID": "7004156543", "AffiliationID": "60017293", "AffiliationName": "Division of Geriatrics, Department of Translational Medical Sciences, Federico II University of Naples"}, "35414915500": {"Name": "Ferrara N.", "AuthorID": "35414915500", "AffiliationID": "60172257", "AffiliationName": "Istituti Clinici Scientifici Maugeri SpA Societ\u00e0 Benefit, Telese Terme Institute (BN)"}, "16031800600": {"Name": "Rengo G.", "AuthorID": "16031800600", "AffiliationID": "60172257", "AffiliationName": "Istituti Clinici Scientifici Maugeri SpA Societ\u00e0 Benefit, Telese Terme Institute (BN)"}}}
