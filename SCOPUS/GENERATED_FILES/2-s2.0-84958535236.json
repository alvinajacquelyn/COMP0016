Accordingly, this paper first discusses urban design as art, then uses Fokt\u2019s framework for defining art and Lalo\u2019s classification of arts to suggest fresh interpretations of urban design as an art. The paper then relates urban design to other arts, drawing attention to urban design\u2019s affinity with architecture, landscape architecture, interior and garden design. The paper suggests that urban design can be richer for being an art, without neglecting the possibility for it to be functional or participatory. Advancing urban design as an art implies attention towards suitable means of distilling and instilling collective urban meaning.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84958535236", "SubjectAreas": [["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"], ["Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)", "ARTS", "1201"], ["Urban Studies", "SOCI", "3322"]], "AuthorData": {"7401823365": {"Name": "Marshall S.", "AuthorID": "7401823365", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Bartlett School of Planning, University College London"}}}
