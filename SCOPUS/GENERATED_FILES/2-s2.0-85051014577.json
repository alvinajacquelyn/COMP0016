Design: a qualitative approach of semi-structured interviews was used to capture information on how LCAV has been disseminated in its early stages from the perspective of key stakeholders and partners. This also included looking at how it might be embedded into everyday practice. Methods: data collection took place over a 3-month period between January and March 2017. Twenty semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted with key LCAV partners and stakeholders from across health and social care. Perceptions were sought as to how LCAV has been, and may be, used by frontline staff following initial dissemination and any potential barriers and enablers to taking the framework forward. Results: a thematic framework analysis of data identified a three-theme paradigm to evaluate LCAV: past where has this come from? Present-where is it now? Future-where is this going?. Conclusion: a programme of dissemination events and examples of good practice in the form of case studies have been valuable tools to engage nursing, midwifery and care staff across health and social care. Continuing to establish networks of frontline staff engaging with LCAV and supporting each other will help facilitate best practice sharing, and multi-professional and cross-boundary working.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Five Year Forward View", "Leading Change, Adding Value", "Process evaluation", "Triple aim outcomes", "Unwarranted variation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Evaluation Studies as Topic", "Leadership", "Organizational Innovation", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85051014577", "SubjectAreas": [["Nursing (all)", "NURS", "2900"]], "AuthorData": {"55794243600": {"Name": "Zubairu K.", "AuthorID": "55794243600", "AffiliationID": "60162382, 60022506", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nurse Education, Faculty of Health and Social Care, Edge Hill University"}, "57203239300": {"Name": "Lievesley K.", "AuthorID": "57203239300", "AffiliationID": "124779745", "AffiliationName": "Nursing and Midwifery Team NHS England"}, "56513389800": {"Name": "Carey L.", "AuthorID": "56513389800", "AffiliationID": "124779745", "AffiliationName": "Nursing and Midwifery Team NHS England"}, "57202956994": {"Name": "Silverio S.A.", "AuthorID": "57202956994", "AffiliationID": "60162382, 60022506", "AffiliationName": "Evidence-based Practice Research Centre, Faculty of Health and Social Care, Edge Hill University"}, "56494185400": {"Name": "McCann S.", "AuthorID": "56494185400", "AffiliationID": "115688907", "AffiliationName": "Nursing and Midwifery Team, NHS England"}, "56426135400": {"Name": "Fillingham J.", "AuthorID": "56426135400", "AffiliationID": "115688907", "AffiliationName": "NHS England, Quarry House"}, "8207930100": {"Name": "Aitkenhead S.", "AuthorID": "8207930100", "AffiliationID": "115688907", "AffiliationName": "NHS England, Quarry House"}, "26635266300": {"Name": "Kaehne A.", "AuthorID": "26635266300", "AffiliationID": "60162382, 60022506", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Education, Evidence-based Practice Research Centre, Postgraduate Medical Institute, Faculty of Health and Social Care, Edge Hill University"}, "8906523700": {"Name": "Sandars J.", "AuthorID": "8906523700", "AffiliationID": "121056796", "AffiliationName": "Belong Ltd"}, "55724443700": {"Name": "Brown J.", "AuthorID": "55724443700", "AffiliationID": "121056796", "AffiliationName": "Belong Ltd"}}}
