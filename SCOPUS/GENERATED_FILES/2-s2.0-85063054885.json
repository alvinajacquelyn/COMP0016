Within academia, a comprehensive understanding of the impacts on how business can serve sustainability transformation is still lacking as diverging holistic approaches and reductive approaches cloud academic thinking. The authors take a science-policy interface perspective to cover the role of cognitive proximity, matching and coordination of scientific knowledge from diverse stakeholders for effective policy making and implementation. We show through a literature review that temporal and spatial scales, soil and land degradation, institutions and ecosystem, and the role of human behavior and narrative are not adequately emphasized in sustainability research. A scale-based picture, focusing on landscapes, institutions and practices is proposed which can be used to align diverse fields by acting as \u201cbridge\u201d for improved science policy interface and decision making, facilitated through cognitive proximity, matching, and coordination. A case study on a business association from South India is used to demonstrate the scales based approach in practice. A scale-based approach can play a key role in connecting human behaviour, a social science thematic topic, with ecosystems, a natural science thematic topic.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Business association", "Corporate responsibility", "Ecosystems", "Scale-based approach", "Sustainability science"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85063054885", "SubjectAreas": [["Environmental Science (all)", "ENVI", "2300"], ["Economics and Econometrics", "ECON", "2002"]], "AuthorData": {"57193955357": {"Name": "Asokan V.A.", "AuthorID": "57193955357", "AffiliationID": "60025272", "AffiliationName": "Graduate Program in Sustainability Science (GPSS), Division of Environmental Studies, Graduate School of Frontier Sciences, The University of Tokyo"}, "7007032725": {"Name": "Onuki M.", "AuthorID": "7007032725", "AffiliationID": "60025272", "AffiliationName": "Graduate Program in Sustainability Science (GPSS), Division of Environmental Studies, Graduate School of Frontier Sciences, The University of Tokyo"}, "23037745200": {"Name": "Yarime M.", "AuthorID": "23037745200", "AffiliationID": "60025272", "AffiliationName": "Graduate School of Public Policy, The University of Tokyo"}}}
