Gamma and beta oscillations in the subthalamic nucleus (STN) vary with the effort of sustained muscle activity. We recorded local field potentials in Parkinson's disease patients and investigated if similar changes can be observed during imagined gripping at three different \u2018forces\u2019. We found that beta activity decreased significantly only for imagined grips at the two stronger force levels. Additionally, gamma power significantly scaled with increasing imagined force. Thus, in combination, these two spectral features can provide information about the intended force of an imaginary grip even in the absence of sensory feedback. Modulations in the two frequency bands during imaginary movement may explain the rehabilitating benefit of motor imagery to improve motor performance. The results also suggest that STN LFPs may provide useful information for brain-machine interfaces.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Basal ganglia", "Beta suppression", "Brain computer interface", "Brain machine interface", "Force decoding", "Gamma oscillations", "Imagined force", "Motor imagery", "Neuro-feedback", "STN"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Beta Rhythm", "Cues", "Deep Brain Stimulation", "Electroencephalography", "Female", "Gamma Rhythm", "Hand Strength", "Humans", "Imagination", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Movement", "Parkinson Disease", "Photic Stimulation", "Subthalamic Nucleus"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85016415934", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Developmental Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2806"]], "AuthorData": {"56806121800": {"Name": "Fischer P.", "AuthorID": "56806121800", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851, 60008323", "AffiliationName": "Nuffield Department of Clinical Neurosciences, John Radcliffe Hospital, University of Oxford"}, "8644218200": {"Name": "Pogosyan A.", "AuthorID": "8644218200", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851, 60008323", "AffiliationName": "Nuffield Department of Clinical Neurosciences, John Radcliffe Hospital, University of Oxford"}, "57196955203": {"Name": "Brown P.", "AuthorID": "57196955203", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851, 60008323", "AffiliationName": "Nuffield Department of Clinical Neurosciences, John Radcliffe Hospital, University of Oxford"}, "25722845200": {"Name": "Tan H.", "AuthorID": "25722845200", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851, 60008323", "AffiliationName": "Nuffield Department of Clinical Neurosciences, John Radcliffe Hospital, University of Oxford"}, "14041109100": {"Name": "Cheeran B.", "AuthorID": "14041109100", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851, 60008323", "AffiliationName": "Nuffield Department of Clinical Neurosciences, John Radcliffe Hospital, University of Oxford"}, "7404024088": {"Name": "Green A.L.", "AuthorID": "7404024088", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851, 60008323", "AffiliationName": "Nuffield Department of Clinical Neurosciences, John Radcliffe Hospital, University of Oxford"}, "7102677271": {"Name": "Aziz T.Z.", "AuthorID": "7102677271", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851, 60008323", "AffiliationName": "Nuffield Department of Clinical Neurosciences, John Radcliffe Hospital, University of Oxford"}, "15072861200": {"Name": "Hyam J.", "AuthorID": "15072861200", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Unit of Functional Neurosurgery, Sobell Department of Motor Neuroscience and Movement Disorders, University College London Institute of Neurology"}, "55209995700": {"Name": "Little S.", "AuthorID": "55209995700", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Unit of Functional Neurosurgery, Sobell Department of Motor Neuroscience and Movement Disorders, University College London Institute of Neurology"}, "8984550100": {"Name": "Foltynie T.", "AuthorID": "8984550100", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Unit of Functional Neurosurgery, Sobell Department of Motor Neuroscience and Movement Disorders, University College London Institute of Neurology"}, "7003880315": {"Name": "Limousin P.", "AuthorID": "7003880315", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Unit of Functional Neurosurgery, Sobell Department of Motor Neuroscience and Movement Disorders, University College London Institute of Neurology"}, "17136524800": {"Name": "Zrinzo L.", "AuthorID": "17136524800", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Unit of Functional Neurosurgery, Sobell Department of Motor Neuroscience and Movement Disorders, University College London Institute of Neurology"}, "7005641179": {"Name": "Hariz M.", "AuthorID": "7005641179", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Unit of Functional Neurosurgery, Sobell Department of Motor Neuroscience and Movement Disorders, University College London Institute of Neurology"}, "57200001689": {"Name": "Samuel M.", "AuthorID": "57200001689", "AffiliationID": "60021923, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Neurology and Neurosurgery, King's College Hospital, King's College London"}, "55894283800": {"Name": "Ashkan K.", "AuthorID": "55894283800", "AffiliationID": "60021923, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Neurology and Neurosurgery, King's College Hospital, King's College London"}}}
