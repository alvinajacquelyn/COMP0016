Recent Findings: CSF concentrations of neurogranin are increased in Alzheimer\u2019s disease, but not in other neurodegenerative disorder such as Parkinson\u2019s disease, frontotemporal dementia, and Lewy body dementia. Adults with HIV-associated dementia have been found to have decreased levels of neurogranin in the frontal cortex, which at least to some extent, may be mediated by the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1\u03b2 and IL-8. Summary: CSF neurogranin concentrations were in the same range for all groups of HIV-infected individuals and uninfected controls. This either indicates thsat synaptic injury is not an important part of HIV neuropathogenesis or that CSF neurogranin is not sensitive to the type of synaptic impairment present in HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cerebrospinal fluid", "HIV", "Neurogranin"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "AIDS Dementia Complex", "Alzheimer Disease", "Biomarkers", "Female", "Frontal Lobe", "Frontotemporal Dementia", "HIV Infections", "Humans", "Interleukin-1beta", "Interleukin-8", "Lewy Body Disease", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Neurogranin", "Parkinson Disease"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85060140084", "SubjectAreas": [["Virology", "IMMU", "2406"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"7101627980": {"Name": "Yilmaz A.", "AuthorID": "7101627980", "AffiliationID": "60079626, 60016437, 60027675", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infectious Diseases, Institute of Biomedicine, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg"}, "57201969798": {"Name": "Gissl\u00e9n M.", "AuthorID": "57201969798", "AffiliationID": "60079626, 60016437, 60027675", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infectious Diseases, Institute of Biomedicine, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg"}, "35414205100": {"Name": "Fuchs D.", "AuthorID": "35414205100", "AffiliationID": "60008222", "AffiliationName": "Division of Biological Chemistry, Biocenter, Innsbruck Medical University"}, "57213628929": {"Name": "Price R.", "AuthorID": "57213628929", "AffiliationID": "60023691", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, University of California San Francisco"}, "9278487100": {"Name": "Spudich S.", "AuthorID": "9278487100", "AffiliationID": "60005455", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Yale University"}, "56415176000": {"Name": "Blennow K.", "AuthorID": "56415176000", "AffiliationID": "60031699", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Neurochemistry Laboratory, Sahlgrenska University Hospital"}, "6701454676": {"Name": "Zetterberg H.", "AuthorID": "6701454676", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UK Dementia Research Institute at UCL"}}}
