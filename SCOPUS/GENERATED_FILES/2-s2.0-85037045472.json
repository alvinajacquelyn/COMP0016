The most recently efforts include CIBSE latest release of Design Summer Year (DSY) weather using multiple complete weather years and a newly proposed composite DSY. This research aims to assess how various single zone offices respond to these new definitions of near extreme weathers. Parametric studies were carried out on single zone offices through which four sampling sets of models were employed to examine the thermal responses of dry bulb temperature, global solar radiation & wind speed collectively. London weather data from 1976 to 1995 were used and the overheating assessments were made based on CIBSE Guide A & BS EN 15251. The research discovers that solar radiation and wind both influence the predicted indoor warmth with solar radiation has obvious stronger impacts than wind. No perfect correlation was found from observation and Spearman\u2019s rank order analysis on the ranks between the weather warmth and the predicted indoor warmth. The ranks made using multiple weather parameters show better correlation than some of the dry bulb temperature only metrics. The research also discovers that the Test Reference Year weather behaves warmer than expected. It is also found that a single complete year can not represent the near-extreme consistently and there is no evidence a composite DSY is better statistically. These findings support the notion of using multiple complete warm weather years for overheating assessments.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Design Summer Year", "EnergyPlus", "overheating in buildings", "parametric study", "Test Reference Year"], "IndexKeywords": ["Design summer years", "Dry bulb temperature", "EnergyPlus", "Free running buildings", "Global solar radiation", "In-buildings", "Parametric study", "Weather parameters"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85037045472", "SubjectAreas": [["Building and Construction", "ENGI", "2215"], ["Energy (miscellaneous)", "ENER", "2101"]], "AuthorData": {"20433386000": {"Name": "Ji Y.", "AuthorID": "20433386000", "AffiliationID": "60008250", "AffiliationName": "School of the Built Environment, University of Salford"}, "36619453100": {"Name": "Korolija I.", "AuthorID": "36619453100", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Energy Institute, University College London"}, "55907797700": {"Name": "Zhang Y.", "AuthorID": "55907797700", "AffiliationID": "117633931", "AffiliationName": "Energy Simulation Solutions Ltd"}}}
