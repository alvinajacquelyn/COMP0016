The optic nerve is the most accessible part of the central nervous system, so optic neuritis also represents an important paradigm to help decipher mechanisms of damage and recovery in the central nervous system. Important developments include the advent of optical coherence tomography as a biomarker of central nervous system axonal loss, the discovery of new pathological antibodies, notably against aquaporin-4 and, more recently, myelin oligodendrocyte protein, and emerging evidence for sodium channel blockade as a novel therapeutic approach to address energy failure in neuroinflammatory disease. Recent findings We will present a practical approach to assessment of optic neuritis, highlighting the role of optical coherence tomography, when to test for new antibodies and the results of recent trials of sodium channel blockers. Summary Optic neuritis remains a clinical diagnosis; increasingly optical coherence tomography is a key ancillary investigation. Patients with 'typical' optic neuritis, commonly a first presentation of multiple sclerosis, must be distinguished from 'atypical' optic neuritis, who require testing for new pathological antibodies and require more aggressive-targeted treatment. Sodium channel blockade is an emerging and novel potential therapeutic pathway in neuroinflammatory disease.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Multiple sclerosis", "Neuromyelitis optica", "Optic neuritis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Axons", "Brain", "Humans", "Optic Nerve", "Optic Neuritis", "Tomography, Optical Coherence"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85000977722", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"16417242200": {"Name": "Jenkins T.M.", "AuthorID": "16417242200", "AffiliationID": "60006444, 60008750", "AffiliationName": "Sheffield Institute for Translational Neuroscience, Royal Hallamshire Hospital"}, "6602459234": {"Name": "Toosy A.T.", "AuthorID": "6602459234", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Queen Square MS Centre, Department of Neuroinflammation, UCL Institute of Neurology"}}}
