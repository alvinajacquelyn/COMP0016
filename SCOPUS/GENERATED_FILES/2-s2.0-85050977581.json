Methods and analysis SARON is a large, randomised controlled, multicentre, phase III trial for patients with oligometastatic EGFR, ALK and ROS1 mutation negative NSCLC (1-3 sites of synchronous metastatic disease, one of which must be extracranial). 340 patients will be recruited over 3 years from approximately 30 UK sites and randomised to receive either standard platinum-doublet chemotherapy only (control arm) or standard chemotherapy followed by RRT/SABR to their primary tumour and then SABR/SRS to all other metastatic sites (investigational arm). The primary endpoint is OS; the study is powered to detect an improvement in median survival from 9.9 months in the control arm to 14.3 months in the investigational arm with 85% power and two-sided 5% significance level. The secondary endpoints are LC, progression-free survival, new distant metastasis-free survival, toxicity and quality of life. An early feasibility review will take place after 50 randomised patients. Patients requiring both conventional thoracic RT to the primary and SABR to a thoracic metastasis will be included in a thoracic SABR safety substudy to assess toxicity and planning issues in this subgroup of patients more thoroughly. Ethics and dissemination All participants are given a SARON patient information sheet and required to give written informed consent. Results will be submitted for presentation at local and international conferences and expected to be published in a peer-reviewed journal.", "AuthorKeywords": ["adult oncology", "adult radiotherapy", "clinical trials", "radiation oncology", "radiotherapy", "respiratory tract tumours"], "IndexKeywords": ["Antineoplastic Agents", "Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung", "Combined Modality Therapy", "England", "Humans", "Lung Neoplasms", "Multicenter Studies as Topic", "Positron Emission Tomography Computed Tomography", "Quality of Life", "Radiosurgery", "Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85050977581", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"54794902800": {"Name": "Conibear J.", "AuthorID": "54794902800", "AffiliationID": "60004093", "AffiliationName": "St Bartholomew's Hospital"}, "57204763182": {"Name": "Chia B.", "AuthorID": "57204763182", "AffiliationID": "60004093", "AffiliationName": "St Bartholomew's Hospital"}, "55388344300": {"Name": "Ngai Y.", "AuthorID": "55388344300", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60012754", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Research UK, UCL Cancer Trials Centre"}, "14422144300": {"Name": "Counsell N.", "AuthorID": "14422144300", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60012754", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Research UK, UCL Cancer Trials Centre"}, "57204344178": {"Name": "Bates A.T.", "AuthorID": "57204344178", "AffiliationID": "60000703", "AffiliationName": "University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57193391172": {"Name": "Patel R.", "AuthorID": "57193391172", "AffiliationID": "60006776", "AffiliationName": "National Radiotherapy Trials QA Group (RTTQA), Mount Vernon Hospital"}, "7201566386": {"Name": "Eaton D.", "AuthorID": "7201566386", "AffiliationID": "60006776", "AffiliationName": "National Radiotherapy Trials QA Group (RTTQA), Mount Vernon Hospital"}, "22940516500": {"Name": "Faivre-Finn C.", "AuthorID": "22940516500", "AffiliationID": "60003771, 60028784", "AffiliationName": "University of Manchester, Christie NHS Foundation Trust"}, "35766390500": {"Name": "Fenwick J.", "AuthorID": "35766390500", "AffiliationID": "60002634", "AffiliationName": "Department of Oncology, University of Oxford"}, "57189580188": {"Name": "Forster M.", "AuthorID": "57189580188", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "University College London Hospital"}, "37063598300": {"Name": "Moinuddin S.", "AuthorID": "37063598300", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "University College London Hospital"}, "23492187200": {"Name": "Hanna G.G.", "AuthorID": "23492187200", "AffiliationID": "60029738", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cancer Research and Cell Biology, Queen's University of Belfast"}, "57193354987": {"Name": "Harden S.", "AuthorID": "57193354987", "AffiliationID": "60017488", "AffiliationName": "Addenbrooke's Hospital"}, "6508033030": {"Name": "Mayles P.", "AuthorID": "6508033030", "AffiliationID": "60020939", "AffiliationName": "Clatterbridge Cancer Centre"}, "23479629300": {"Name": "Landau D.", "AuthorID": "23479629300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Oncology, University College London"}}}
