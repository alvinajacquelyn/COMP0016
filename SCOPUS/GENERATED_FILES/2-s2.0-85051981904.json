After it came to the attention of members of La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019Horticulture de Paris, the tree gained enormous fame as a potential instance of the much sought-after \u2018graft hybrid\u2019, a hypothetical idea that by grafting one plant onto another, a mixture of the two could be produced. As I show in this paper, many eminent botanists and gardeners, including Charles Darwin, both experimented with Adam\u2019s laburnum and argued over how it might have been produced and what light, if any, it shed on the laws of heredity. Despite Jean-Louis Adam\u2019s position and status as a nurseryman active within the Parisian plant trade, a surprising degree of doubt and scepticism was attached to his testimony on how the tree had been produced in his nursery. This doubt, I argue, helps us to trace the complex negotiations of authority that constituted debates over plant heredity in the early 19th century and that were introduced with a new generation of gardening and horticultural periodicals.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Botany", "Darwin", "Heredity", "Horticulture", "Pangenesis", "Periodicals"], "IndexKeywords": ["Botany", "Cytisus", "Gardening", "History, 19th Century"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85051981904", "SubjectAreas": [["History", "ARTS", "1202"], ["Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)", "ARTS", "1201"], ["History and Philosophy of Science", "ARTS", "1207"]], "AuthorData": {"57203499014": {"Name": "Lidwell-Durnin J.", "AuthorID": "57203499014", "AffiliationID": "101526252", "AffiliationName": null}}}
