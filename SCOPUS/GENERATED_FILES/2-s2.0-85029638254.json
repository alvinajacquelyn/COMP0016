The disposable quartz biochip, based on microelectronic components found in every consumer smartphone, is extremely fast because no complex labelling, amplification or wash steps are needed. A pocket-sized control box reads out the SAW signal and displays results electronically. High analytical sensitivity and specificity are found with model and real patient blood samples. The findings presented here open up the potential of consumer electronics to cut lengthy test waiting times, giving patients on the spot access to potentially life-saving treatment and supporting more timely public health interventions to prevent disease transmission.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Biosensing Techniques", "HIV Infections", "Humans", "Point-of-Care Systems", "Sensitivity and Specificity", "Smartphone", "Time"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85029638254", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"57194871514": {"Name": "Turb\u00e9 V.", "AuthorID": "57194871514", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "London Centre for Nanotechnology, Faculty of Maths and Physical Sciences, University College London"}, "36730986800": {"Name": "Gray E.R.", "AuthorID": "36730986800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London"}, "15821926400": {"Name": "Brookes J.C.", "AuthorID": "15821926400", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "London Centre for Nanotechnology, Faculty of Maths and Physical Sciences, University College London"}, "7006090296": {"Name": "McKendry R.A.", "AuthorID": "7006090296", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Medicine, University College London"}, "57203616316": {"Name": "Weiss R.A.", "AuthorID": "57203616316", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London"}, "7201727367": {"Name": "Pillay D.", "AuthorID": "7201727367", "AffiliationID": "60138826", "AffiliationName": "Africa Health Research Institute"}, "57195727508": {"Name": "Lawson V.E.", "AuthorID": "57195727508", "AffiliationID": "60006924", "AffiliationName": "OJ-Bio, International Centre for Life"}, "6602675970": {"Name": "Athey D.", "AuthorID": "6602675970", "AffiliationID": "60006924", "AffiliationName": "OJ-Bio, International Centre for Life"}, "16310245000": {"Name": "Nastouli E.", "AuthorID": "16310245000", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Population, Policy and Practice, UCL GOS Institute of Child Health"}, "7102404974": {"Name": "Emery V.C.", "AuthorID": "7102404974", "AffiliationID": "60021097", "AffiliationName": "Department of Microbial and Cellular Sciences, University of Surrey"}, "7007110694": {"Name": "Verrips C.T.", "AuthorID": "7007110694", "AffiliationID": "118416569", "AffiliationName": "QVQ Holding B.V."}, "6701920833": {"Name": "Yatsuda H.", "AuthorID": "6701920833", "AffiliationID": "60104123", "AffiliationName": "Japan Radio Co.
