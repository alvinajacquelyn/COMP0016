All rights reserved.Objective it is intuitive to suggest that knowledge of the variation in the anatomy of the aortic root may influence the outcomes of transcatheter implantation of the aortic valve (taVi). We have now assessed such variation. Methods We used 26 specimens of normal hearts and 78 ct data sets of adults with a mean age of 64\u00b115 years to measure the dimensions of the membranous septum and to assess any influence played by rotation of the aortic root, inferring the relationship to the atrioventricular conduction axis. results the aortic root was positioned centrally in the majority of both cohorts, although with significant variability. For the cadaveric hearts, 14 roots were central (54%), 4 clockwise-rotated (15%) and 8 counterclockwise-rotated (31%). in the adult ct cohort, 44 were central (56%), 21 clockwise-rotated (27%) and 13 counterclockwise-rotated (17%). a mean angle of 15.5\u00b0 was measured relative to the right fibrous trigone in the adult ct cohort, with a range of \u221232\u00b0 to 44.7\u00b0. the dimensions of the membranous septum were independent of rotation. Fibrous continuity between the membranous septum and the right fibrous trigone increased with counterclockwise to clockwise rotation, implying variation in the relationship to the atrioventricular conduction axis. Conclusions the central fibrous body is wider, providing greater fibrous support, in the setting of clockwise rotation of the aortic root. individuals with this pattern may be more vulnerable to conduction damage following taVi. Knowledge of such variation may prove invaluable for risk stratification.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aortic Valve", "Biological Variation, Population", "Cadaver", "Computed Tomography Angiography", "Coronary Angiography", "Female", "Heart Septum", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Predictive Value of Tests", "Sinus of Valsalva", "Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement", "United States"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85058023367", "SubjectAreas": [["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"55940194400": {"Name": "Tretter J.T.", "AuthorID": "55940194400", "AffiliationID": "60030440", "AffiliationName": "Heart institute, cincinnati children\u2019s hospital Medical center"}, "56689619000": {"Name": "Loomba R.S.", "AuthorID": "56689619000", "AffiliationID": "60030440", "AffiliationName": "Heart institute, cincinnati children\u2019s hospital Medical center"}, "36503627100": {"Name": "Alsaied T.", "AuthorID": "36503627100", "AffiliationID": "60030440", "AffiliationName": "Heart institute, cincinnati children\u2019s hospital Medical center"}, "55455136800": {"Name": "Mori S.", "AuthorID": "55455136800", "AffiliationID": "60179043", "AffiliationName": "Division of cardiovascular Medicine, Department of internal Medicine, Kobe University graduate school of Medicine"}, "23020070600": {"Name": "Saremi F.", "AuthorID": "23020070600", "AffiliationID": "60029311", "AffiliationName": "Department of radiology, University of southern California"}, "56993933800": {"Name": "Chikkabyrappa S.", "AuthorID": "56993933800", "AffiliationID": "60015481, 60138686", "AffiliationName": "Division of Pediatric cardiology, seattle children\u2019s hospital, University of Washington"}, "15926451700": {"Name": "Thomas K.", "AuthorID": "15926451700", "AffiliationID": "60032105", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, New York University langone Medical center"}, "36747055700": {"Name": "Bu F.", "AuthorID": "36747055700", "AffiliationID": "60032105", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, New York University langone Medical center"}, "16643657100": {"Name": "Spicer D.E.", "AuthorID": "16643657100", "AffiliationID": "60013959", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatric cardiology, University of Florida"}, "55574190847": {"Name": "Anderson R.H.", "AuthorID": "55574190847", "AffiliationID": "60006222", "AffiliationName": "Institute of genetics, newcastle University"}}}
