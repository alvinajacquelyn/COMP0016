Compared to the standard operators with moderate contrast, they exhibit a number of new effects due to the underlying nonuniform ellipticity of the family. The effective behavior of such media in the vanishing period limit also differs notably from that of multidimensional models investigated thus far by other authors, due to the fact that neither component of the composite forms a connected set. We then discuss a modified problem, where the equation coefficient is set to a positive constant on an interval that is independent of the period. Formal asymptotic analysis and numerical tests with finite elements suggest the existence of localized eigenfunctions (\"defect modes\"), whose eigenvalues are situated in the gaps of the limit spectrum for the unperturbed problem.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Elliptic differential equations", "Homogenization", "Spectrum"], "IndexKeywords": ["Electromagnetic response", "Elliptic differential equations", "Equation coefficients", "Formal asymptotic analysis", "High-contrast coefficients", "Multi-dimensional model", "Periodic coefficients", "Spectrum"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84925077948", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Modeling and Simulation", "MATH", "2611"], ["Ecological Modeling", "ENVI", "2302"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"]], "AuthorData": {"6507202947": {"Name": "Cherednichenko K.", "AuthorID": "6507202947", "AffiliationID": "60030480", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematical Sciences, University of Bath"}, "56531294200": {"Name": "Cooper S.", "AuthorID": "56531294200", "AffiliationID": "60108553", "AffiliationName": "Laboratoire de M\u00e9canique et G\u00e9nie Civil de Montpellier"}, "6602839290": {"Name": "Guenneau S.", "AuthorID": "6602839290", "AffiliationID": "60107031, 60008134, 60102127", "AffiliationName": "Aix-Marseille Universit\u00e9, CNRS, Institut Fresnel"}}}
