Single-sideband subcarrier modulation (SSB SCM) signaling with DD has the potential to achieve high information spectral density (ISD) but its performance can be significantly degraded by signal-signal beat interference (SSBI). The recently proposed Kramers-Kronig (KK) digital signal processing scheme is effective in eliminating the SSBI penalty. Through the use of the KK scheme, we achieved 4 \u00d7 168 Gb/s wavelength division multiplexing DD SSB 64-QAM Nyquist-SCM signal transmission over 80 km of uncompensated standard single-mode fiber at a net ISD of up to 4.61 (b/s)/Hz. The joint optimization of the optical carrier-to-signal power ratio and the KK algorithm sampling rate is described.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Data center interconnect", "digital linearization", "direct detection", "Kramers-Kronig receiver", "metro networks", "Nyquist-pulse shaped subcarrier modulation", "receiver-based electronic dispersion compensation", "signal-signal beat interference", "spectrally efficient wavelength division multiplexing"], "IndexKeywords": ["Data centers", "Direct detection", "Electronic dispersion compensation", "Kramers-Kronig", "Metro networks", "Sub-carrier modulations"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85040075395", "SubjectAreas": [["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"]], "AuthorData": {"56703765300": {"Name": "Li Z.", "AuthorID": "56703765300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Optical Networks Group, Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "37028187400": {"Name": "Erkilin\u00e7 M.S.", "AuthorID": "37028187400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Optical Networks Group, Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "57110425500": {"Name": "Sillekens E.", "AuthorID": "57110425500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Optical Networks Group, Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "36192836100": {"Name": "Galdino L.", "AuthorID": "36192836100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Optical Networks Group, Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "7005053644": {"Name": "Bayvel P.", "AuthorID": "7005053644", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Optical Networks Group, Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "7003479201": {"Name": "Killey R.I.", "AuthorID": "7003479201", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Optical Networks Group, Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "36140432900": {"Name": "Shi K.", "AuthorID": "36140432900", "AffiliationID": "60098463", "AffiliationName": "Microsoft Research Ltd"}, "7006614570": {"Name": "Thomsen B.C.", "AuthorID": "7006614570", "AffiliationID": "60098463", "AffiliationName": "Microsoft Research Ltd"}, "7401627190": {"Name": "Xu T.", "AuthorID": "7401627190", "AffiliationID": "60022020", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering, University of Warwick"}}}
