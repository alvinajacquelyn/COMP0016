From scanning tunnelling spectroscopy (STS) studies, we find that this atomically-thin layered silicon has distinctly different electronic properties. Angle resolved photoelectron spectroscopy (ARPES) reveals that, in sharp contrast to epitaxial silicene, the layered silicon exhibits significantly enhanced density of states at the Fermi level resulting from newly formed metallic bands. The 2D growth of this material could allow for direct contacting to the silicene surface and demonstrates the dramatic changes in electronic structure that can occur by the addition of even a single monolayer amount of material in 2D systems.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Low energy electron diffraction (LEED)", "Scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM)", "Silicene", "Silicon nanostructures supplementary material for this article is available online"], "IndexKeywords": ["Angle resolved photoelectron spectroscopy", "Density of state", "Epitaxially grown", "Metallic bands", "Scanning tunnelling spectroscopy", "Silicon crystal", "Silicon nano structures", "Two Dimensional (2 D)"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85021181509", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Mechanics of Materials", "ENGI", "2211"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"]], "AuthorData": {"55676448000": {"Name": "Gill T.G.", "AuthorID": "55676448000", "AffiliationID": "60011375", "AffiliationName": "School of Materials Science, Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology"}, "56496397600": {"Name": "Warner B.", "AuthorID": "56496397600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, UCL"}, "37014784400": {"Name": "Pr\u00fcser H.", "AuthorID": "37014784400", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "London Centre for Nanotechnology, University College London (UCL)"}, "6603182361": {"Name": "Hirjibehedin C.F.", "AuthorID": "6603182361", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, UCL"}, "23049720300": {"Name": "Fleurence A.", "AuthorID": "23049720300", "AffiliationID": "60011375", "AffiliationName": "School of Materials Science, Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology"}, "6603668238": {"Name": "Friedlein R.", "AuthorID": "6603668238", "AffiliationID": "60175948", "AffiliationName": "Meyer Burger (Germany) AG"}, "8713796000": {"Name": "Yamada-Takamura Y.", "AuthorID": "8713796000", "AffiliationID": "60011375", "AffiliationName": "School of Materials Science, Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology"}, "35254217000": {"Name": "Sadowski J.T.", "AuthorID": "35254217000", "AffiliationID": "60006221", "AffiliationName": "Center for Functional Nanomaterials, Brookhaven National Laboratory"}}}
