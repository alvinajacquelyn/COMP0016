Several mutations in SPT are associated with the hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy type I (HSAN1). The current hypothesis is that these mutations induce a permanent shift in the affinity from l-serine toward l-alanine which results in a pathologically increased 1-deoxySL formation in HSAN1 patients. Also, wild-type SPT forms 1-deoxySL under certain conditions, and elevated levels were found in individuals with the metabolic syndrome and diabetes. However, the molecular mechanisms which control the substrate shift of the wild-type enzyme are not understood. Here, we report a novel SPTLC2\u2013S384F variant in two unrelated HSAN1 families. Affected patients showed elevated plasma 1-deoxySL levels and expression of the S384F mutant in HEK293 cells increased 1-deoxySL formation. Previously, S384 has been reported as one of the two (S384 and Y387) putative phosphorylation sites in SPTLC2. The phosphorylation of wild-type SPTLC2 was confirmed by isoelectric focusing. The impact of an S384 phosphorylation on SPT activity was tested by creating mutants mimicking either a constitutively phosphorylated (S384D, S384E) or non-phosphorylated (S384A, Y387F, Y387F+S384A) protein. The S384D but not the S384E variant was associated with increased 1-deoxySL formation. The other mutations had no influence on activity and substrate affinity. In summary, our data show that S384F is a novel mutation in HSAN1 and that the substrate specificity of wild-type SPT might by dynamically regulated by a phosphorylation at this position.", "AuthorKeywords": ["1-Deoxysphingolipids", "HSAN1", "Sensory neuropathy", "Serine palmitoyltransferase", "Sphingolipids"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Amino Acid Sequence", "Amino Acid Substitution", "Conserved Sequence", "Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional", "Female", "HEK293 Cells", "Hereditary Sensory and Autonomic Neuropathies", "Heterozygote", "Homozygote", "Humans", "Isoelectric Focusing", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Models, Molecular", "Molecular Sequence Data", "Neural Conduction", "Pedigree", "Phosphorylation", "Phosphoserine", "Protein Processing, Post-Translational", "Recombinant Fusion Proteins", "Sequence Alignment", "Sequence Homology, Amino Acid", "Serine C-Palmitoyltransferase", "Species Specificity", "Sphingolipids", "Substrate Specificity"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84925490117", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Medicine", "BIOC", "1313"], ["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"]], "AuthorData": {"35219859200": {"Name": "Ernst D.", "AuthorID": "35219859200", "AffiliationID": "60012614", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Physiology and Zurich Center for Integrative Human Physiology (ZIHP), University of Zurich"}, "7404094477": {"Name": "Wei Y.", "AuthorID": "7404094477", "AffiliationID": "60019619", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Clinical Chemistry, University Hospital Zurich"}, "36463917000": {"Name": "Othman A.", "AuthorID": "36463917000", "AffiliationID": "60103077", "AffiliationName": "Competence Center for Systems Physiology and Metabolic Diseases"}, "6507546322": {"Name": "Hornemann T.", "AuthorID": "6507546322", "AffiliationID": "60007493", "AffiliationName": "Life and Medical Sciences (LIMES) Institute, University of Bonn"}, "55839166100": {"Name": "Murphy S.M.", "AuthorID": "55839166100", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neurosciences, MRC Centre for Neuromuscular Diseases, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "7201880572": {"Name": "Blake J.", "AuthorID": "7201880572", "AffiliationID": "60017129", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Neurophysiology, Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital"}, "7004952245": {"Name": "Donaghy M.", "AuthorID": "7004952245", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851, 60008323", "AffiliationName": "Nuffield Department of Clinical Neuroscience, University of Oxford, John Radcliffe Hospital"}, "56327966500": {"Name": "Sathiyanadan K.", "AuthorID": "56327966500", "AffiliationID": "60069907, 60020486", "AffiliationName": "Theodor Kocher Institute, University of Bern"}, "25936698500": {"Name": "Penno A.", "AuthorID": "25936698500", "AffiliationID": "60007493", "AffiliationName": "Life and Medical Sciences (LIMES) Institute, University of Bonn"}, "8237857300": {"Name": "Liu Y.T.", "AuthorID": "8237857300", "AffiliationID": "60003525", "AffiliationName": "National Yang-Ming University School of Medicine"}, "22951097700": {"Name": "Laur\u00e1 M.", "AuthorID": "22951097700", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neurosciences, MRC Centre for Neuromuscular Diseases, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "7003363686": {"Name": "Houlden H.", "AuthorID": "7003363686", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neurosciences, MRC Centre for Neuromuscular Diseases, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "57203175311": {"Name": "Reilly M.M.", "AuthorID": "57203175311", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neurosciences, MRC Centre for Neuromuscular Diseases, UCL Institute of Neurology"}}}
