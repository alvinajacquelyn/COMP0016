The aim of this review was to synthesize the evidence on travel needs and experiences during cancer treatment from the point of view of patients and their families. Methods: This is a systematic review of the literature. The PRISMA statement was used to guide the reporting of the methods and findings. We searched for peer-reviewed articles in MEDLINE, CINAHL PLUS, and Web of Science and selected articles based on the following criteria: focused on patients and their families; presented findings from empirical studies; and examined travel and transport experiences for cancer screening, treatment, and related care. The MMAT was used to assess the quality of the studies. Results: A total of 16 articles were included in the review. Most of the studies used a qualitative design, were carried out in high-income countries and were conducted more than 10 years ago. Several problems were reported regarding travel and relocation: social and physical demands of transport, travel, and relocation; life disruption and loss of daily routines; financial impact; and anxieties and support needs when returning home. Conclusions: Patients and carers consistently reported lack of support when traveling, relocating, and returning home. Future research needs to explore patient experiences under current treatment protocols and healthcare delivery models, in a wider range of geographical contexts, and different stages of the patient pathway.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cancer", "Experience of care", "Systematic review", "Transport", "Travel"], "IndexKeywords": ["Caregivers", "Humans", "Neoplasms", "Qualitative Research", "Travel"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85047242738", "SubjectAreas": [["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"]], "AuthorData": {"37075880600": {"Name": "Vindrola-Padros C.", "AuthorID": "37075880600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Applied Health Research, University College London (UCL)"}, "55547838000": {"Name": "Brage E.", "AuthorID": "55547838000", "AffiliationID": "60001563, 60004518", "AffiliationName": "Instituto de Ciencias Antropol\u00f3gicas, Secci\u00f3n Antropolog\u00eda Social, Facultad de Filosof\u00eda y Letras, Universidad de Buenos Aires"}, "36834881500": {"Name": "Chambers P.", "AuthorID": "36834881500", "AffiliationID": "60016379", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Practice and Policy, UCL School of Pharmacy"}}}
