Patients underwent full ophthalmic examination, electrophysiological testing, and retinal imaging.ResultsMinimum duration of follow-up was 8 years. At last review, visual acuity ranged from 0.22 to 1.20 logMAR (6/9.5-6/95 Snellen) at a mean age of 10.5 years (median 9.5 years, range 9-14 years). Refractive error ranged from a spherical equivalent of -7.40 D to -24.00 D. Three had convergent squint. Fundus examination and imaging demonstrated bilateral macular atrophy in all patients that varied from mild atrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) to well-demarcated, punched-out atrophic lesions of retina, RPE, and choroid. Flash ERG was normal under photopic and scotopic conditions in all patients. Pattern ERG, performed in three patients, was consistent with mild to severe macular dysfunction. Progression of the area of atrophy was evident in one patient and of the myopia in two patients but all patients had stable visual acuity.ConclusionsPatients with congenital high myopia and macular atrophy present in infancy with reduced visual acuity and nystagmus. The macular atrophic lesions vary in size and severity but electrophysiological testing is consistent with dysfunction confined to the macula. There was no deterioration in visual acuity over 8-10 years of monitoring.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Child", "Corneal Dystrophies, Hereditary", "Electroretinography", "Fluorescein Angiography", "Follow-Up Studies", "Humans", "Male", "Myopia, Degenerative", "Nystagmus, Pathologic", "Phenotype", "Photic Stimulation", "Retina", "Siblings", "Vision Disorders", "Visual Acuity", "Visual Fields"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84953873186", "SubjectAreas": [["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"], ["Sensory Systems", "NEUR", "2809"]], "AuthorData": {"56426814400": {"Name": "Hull S.", "AuthorID": "56426814400", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "26221216300": {"Name": "Kalhoro A.", "AuthorID": "26221216300", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "7102202117": {"Name": "Holder G.E.", "AuthorID": "7102202117", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "57203259026": {"Name": "Robson A.G.", "AuthorID": "57203259026", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "56573251100": {"Name": "Moore A.T.", "AuthorID": "56573251100", "AffiliationID": "60023691", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, University of California"}, "7102754475": {"Name": "Marr J.", "AuthorID": "7102754475", "AffiliationID": "60002869", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, Sheffield Children's Hospital"}, "7404935216": {"Name": "Thompson D.A.", "AuthorID": "7404935216", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, Great Ormond Street Hospital"}}}
