To obtain a power-efficient beamforming at the base station (BS), we utilize the constructive multi-user interference (MUI) as a source of green signal power. The proposed beamforming design mainly focuses on two optimization problems, i.e., transmit power minimization for BS and interference minimization for radar, subject to given performance requirements of the two systems. We further consider the impact of the proposed methods on radar, where the detection probability for MIMO radar in the presence of the interference from BS is analytically derived, and important trade-offs are revealed. Numerical results show that the proposed approach outperforms the conventional beamforming designs by achieving a significant performance gain under the discussed coexistence scenario.", "AuthorKeywords": ["constructive interference", "MU-MISO downlink", "radar-communication coexistence", "spectrum sharing"], "IndexKeywords": ["Constructive interference", "Conventional beamforming", "Interference minimizations", "MU-MISO downlink", "Multi input single outputs", "Multi-input multi-output radars", "Radar communication", "Spectrum sharing"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85046442262", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"], ["Hardware and Architecture", "COMP", "1708"], ["Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality", "ENGI", "2213"]], "AuthorData": {"57211818673": {"Name": "Liu F.", "AuthorID": "57211818673", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "23009493900": {"Name": "Masouros C.", "AuthorID": "23009493900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "56453725100": {"Name": "Li A.", "AuthorID": "56453725100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "16069472900": {"Name": "Ratnarajah T.", "AuthorID": "16069472900", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Digital Communications, School of Engineering, University of Edinburgh"}}}
