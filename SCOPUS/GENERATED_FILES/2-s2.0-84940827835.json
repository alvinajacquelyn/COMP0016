Increased mechanical stiffness in the involved fibrotic tissues is a hallmark clinical feature and a cause of disabling symptoms. Myocardin Related Transcription Factor-A (MRTF-A) is a transcriptional co-activator that is sequestered in the cytoplasm and translocates to the nucleus under mechanical stress or growth factor stimulation. Our objective was to determine if MRTF-A is activated in the disease microenvironment to produce more extracellular matrix in progressive SSc. Immunohistochemistry studies demonstrate that nuclear translocation of MRTF-A in scleroderma tissues occurs in keratinocytes, endothelial cells, infiltrating inflammatory cells, and dermal fibroblasts, consistent with enhanced signaling in multiple cell lineages exposed to the stiff extracellular matrix. Inhibition of MRTF-A nuclear translocation or knockdown of MRTF-A synthesis abolishes the SSc myofibroblast enhanced basal contractility and synthesis of type I collagen and inhibits the matricellular profibrotic protein, connective tissue growth factor (CCN2/CTGF). In MRTF-A null mice, basal skin and lung stiffness was abnormally reduced and associated with altered fibrillar collagen. MRTF-A has a role in SSc fibrosis acting as a central regulator linking mechanical cues to adverse remodeling of the extracellular matrix.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Cell Lineage", "Collagen Type I", "Connective Tissue Growth Factor", "Drug Resistance", "Extracellular Matrix", "Fibrosis", "Humans", "Mice", "Mice, Knockout", "Myofibroblasts", "Scleroderma, Systemic", "Signal Transduction", "Trans-Activators"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84940827835", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"6602460726": {"Name": "Shiwen X.", "AuthorID": "6602460726", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Rheumatology and Connective Tissue Diseases, University College London"}, "7006263741": {"Name": "Stratton R.", "AuthorID": "7006263741", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Rheumatology and Connective Tissue Diseases, University College London"}, "56282891800": {"Name": "Nikitorowicz-Buniak J.", "AuthorID": "56282891800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Rheumatology and Connective Tissue Diseases, University College London"}, "57103796300": {"Name": "Ahmed-Abdi B.", "AuthorID": "57103796300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Rheumatology and Connective Tissue Diseases, University College London"}, "6602769002": {"Name": "Ponticos M.", "AuthorID": "6602769002", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Rheumatology and Connective Tissue Diseases, University College London"}, "7006031021": {"Name": "Denton C.", "AuthorID": "7006031021", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Rheumatology and Connective Tissue Diseases, University College London"}, "57203195982": {"Name": "Abraham D.", "AuthorID": "57203195982", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Rheumatology and Connective Tissue Diseases, University College London"}, "7402799552": {"Name": "Takahashi A.", "AuthorID": "7402799552", "AffiliationID": "60019674", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Boston University"}, "7005193754": {"Name": "Suki B.", "AuthorID": "7005193754", "AffiliationID": "60019674", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Boston University"}, "7003460118": {"Name": "Layne M.", "AuthorID": "7003460118", "AffiliationID": "60006385", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemistry, Boston University School of Medicine"}, "7501691303": {"Name": "Smith B.", "AuthorID": "7501691303", "AffiliationID": "60006385", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemistry, Boston University School of Medicine"}, "7004308591": {"Name": "Lafyatis R.", "AuthorID": "7004308591", "AffiliationID": "60006385", "AffiliationName": "Rheumatology Department, Boston University School of Medicine"}}}
