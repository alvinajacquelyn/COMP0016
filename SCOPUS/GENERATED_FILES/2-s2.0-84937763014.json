In particular, catalytic reaction stages are highly sensitive to specific trace contaminants (e.g. PAHs, thiophenes, etc.), necessitating the use of additional cleaning operations to remove these residues to levels where the catalyst degradation is acceptable. In this work, the use of thermal plasma (coupled with primary waste treatment) to completely reform tars and organic sulphur compounds to simple gaseous products (predominantly H2 and CO) is assessed. To this end, a 20-hour waste gasification run was performed on a two-stage fluid bed-plasma demonstration plant to investigate the tar evolution in the syngas, with special attention on the chemistry of generic and sulphur-substituted aromatics within the plasma stage. The organic fraction in the gas phase was found to be completely reformed under plasma conditions, leaving essentially CO, H2 and H2S as ultimate products. In particular, reduction efficiencies typically exceeded 96%v/v for complex organics (e.g. PAH) and thiophenes were observed. The syngas, after a tertiary simplified gas cleaning process, is suitable for high efficiency power generation, or conversion to a fuel gas capable of injection into national or industrial supply grids.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Fluidized bed", "Plasma", "Sulphur", "Tar", "Waste gasification"], "IndexKeywords": ["Catalyst degradation", "Demonstration plants", "High efficiency power generation", "Plasma assisted process", "Reduction efficiency", "Substituted aromatic", "Synthetic natural gas", "Waste gasification"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84937763014", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"], ["Fuel Technology", "ENER", "2103"], ["Energy Engineering and Power Technology", "ENER", "2102"]], "AuthorData": {"55623473200": {"Name": "Materazzi M.", "AuthorID": "55623473200", "AffiliationID": "60112883", "AffiliationName": "Advanced Plasma Power, South Marston Business Park"}, "35572355100": {"Name": "Lettieri P.", "AuthorID": "35572355100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "11939698500": {"Name": "Mazzei L.", "AuthorID": "11939698500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "56196096800": {"Name": "Taylor R.", "AuthorID": "56196096800", "AffiliationID": "60112883", "AffiliationName": "Advanced Plasma Power, South Marston Business Park"}, "7403167306": {"Name": "Chapman C.", "AuthorID": "7403167306", "AffiliationID": "60112883", "AffiliationName": "Advanced Plasma Power, South Marston Business Park"}}}
