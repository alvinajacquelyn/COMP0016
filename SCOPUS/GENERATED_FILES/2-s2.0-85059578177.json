Panoiu et al., published by De Gruyter, Berlin/Boston 2018.In this review, we survey the recent advances in nonlinear optics and the applications of two-dimensional (2D) materials. We briefly cover the key developments pertaining to research in the nonlinear optics of graphene, the quintessential 2D material. Subsequently, we discuss the linear and nonlinear optical properties of several other 2D layered materials, including transition metal chalcogenides, black phosphorus, hexagonal boron nitride, perovskites, and topological insulators, as well as the recent progress in hybrid nanostructures containing 2D materials, such as composites with dyes, plasmonic particles, 2D crystals, and silicon integrated structures. Finally, we highlight a few representative current applications of 2D materials to photonic and optoelectronic devices.", "AuthorKeywords": ["2D materials", "experimental techniques", "nonlinear optics", "numerical algorithms"], "IndexKeywords": ["Experimental techniques", "Hexagonal boron nitride", "Hybrid nanostructures", "Linear and nonlinear optical properties", "Non-linear optical properties", "Numerical algorithms", "Topological insulators", "Transition metal chalcogenides"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85059578177", "SubjectAreas": [["Biotechnology", "BIOC", "1305"], ["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"7004097868": {"Name": "Panoiu N.C.", "AuthorID": "7004097868", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London, Torrington Place"}, "55487309400": {"Name": "You J.W.", "AuthorID": "55487309400", "AffiliationID": "60000937, 60133266", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of Optoelectronic Devices and Systems of Ministry of Education and Guangdong Province, College of Electronic Science and Technology, Shenzhen University"}, "56338024500": {"Name": "Bongu S.R.", "AuthorID": "56338024500", "AffiliationID": "60170544, 60019578", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials Science and Engineering, And ARC Centre of Excellence in Future Low-Energy Electronics Technologies (FLEET) Monash University"}, "12141879200": {"Name": "Bao Q.", "AuthorID": "12141879200", "AffiliationID": "60170544, 60019578", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials Science and Engineering, And ARC Centre of Excellence in Future Low-Energy Electronics Technologies (FLEET) Monash University"}}}
