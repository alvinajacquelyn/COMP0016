Chlamydia trachomatis (CT), Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG), and Trichomonas vaginalis (TV) are curable sexually transmitted infections (STIs) that can cause adverse maternal and birth outcomes. Most countries do not conduct routine testing during antenatal care. We present data on the acceptability and feasibility of testing and treating pregnant women for STIs in an antenatal clinic in Gaborone, Botswana. Materials and Methods. We offered CT, NG, and TV testing using self-collected vaginal swabs to eligible pregnant women. Participants received same-day test results. Those who tested positive were given treatment. Results. Among the 225 women who were eligible and recruited, 200 (89%) agreed to participate. The median age of our study sample was 30 years; most were unmarried (77%), with a median gestational age of 27 weeks and a 23% HIV prevalence. All participants received their results with at least 72% (n=143) on the same day. Thirty participants (15%) tested positive for an STI, all were treated, and 24 (80%) were treated on the same day. Conclusion. The acceptability of STI testing was high, and the intervention was feasible. This study provides support for continued research into STI prevalence, cost-effectiveness, and the association of STIs with adverse maternal and infant outcomes.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Botswana", "Chlamydia trachomatis", "Female", "Humans", "Neisseria gonorrhoeae", "Pregnancy", "Pregnancy Complications, Infectious", "Risk Factors", "Sexually Transmitted Diseases", "Trichomonas vaginalis", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84971402164", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Immunology and Microbiology (all)", "IMMU", "2400"]], "AuthorData": {"56581652600": {"Name": "Wynn A.", "AuthorID": "56581652600", "AffiliationID": "60029270", "AffiliationName": "Department of Health Policy and Management, Fielding School of Public Health, University of California"}, "38862654100": {"Name": "Ramogola-Masire D.", "AuthorID": "38862654100", "AffiliationID": "60021221", "AffiliationName": "University of Botswana"}, "6602708669": {"Name": "Morroni C.", "AuthorID": "6602708669", "AffiliationID": "60016218", "AffiliationName": "Wits Reproductive Health and HIV Institute, University of Witwatersrand"}, "57189487431": {"Name": "Moshashane N.", "AuthorID": "57189487431", "AffiliationID": "60021221", "AffiliationName": "University of Botswana"}, "57003367300": {"Name": "Gaolebale P.", "AuthorID": "57003367300", "AffiliationID": "100320711", "AffiliationName": "Princess Marina Hospital, Phologolo Extension 9"}, "57189496555": {"Name": "Agatha Offorjebe O.", "AuthorID": "57189496555", "AffiliationID": "60005247, 60027550", "AffiliationName": "David Geffen School of Medicine, University of California"}, "57189487473": {"Name": "Arena K.", "AuthorID": "57189487473", "AffiliationID": "60005247, 60027550", "AffiliationName": "David Geffen School of Medicine, University of California"}, "26643627500": {"Name": "Klausner J.D.", "AuthorID": "26643627500", "AffiliationID": "60005247, 60029270, 60027550", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Epidemiology, David Geffen School of Medicine and Fielding School of Public Health, University of California, Los Angeles"}}}
