All rights reserved.Labour market liberalization is certainly one of the most important structural reforms but it is also one of the least well-understood. In part, this is because empirical evidence is largely confined to OECD countries and to the post-1990 period. This chapter introduces a new index of labour market regulation rigidity covering 140 countries from 1960 to 2005. We find that trade liberalization and development level are more powerful explanations for the dynamics of labour market reform than the more conventional 'legal origins'. We also find that the rigidity of employment protection legislation reduces income inequality but its effects on economic growth are ambiguous.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Employment protection legislation", "Growth", "Inequality", "Labour market institutions", "Structural reforms"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85059502694", "SubjectAreas": [["Economics, Econometrics and Finance (all)", "ECON", "2000"], ["Business, Management and Accounting (all)", "BUSI", "1400"]], "AuthorData": {"7006704860": {"Name": "Campos N.", "AuthorID": "7006704860", "AffiliationID": "60025858", "AffiliationName": "ETH-Z\u00fcrich"}, "7005380780": {"Name": "Nugent J.", "AuthorID": "7005380780", "AffiliationID": "60029311", "AffiliationName": "University of Southern California"}}}
