Cross-sectional findings on factors associated with diet and physical activity outcomes provide limited information on what predicts changes or long-term outcomes in lifestyle behaviours in people with severe mental illness. A systematic review was therefore conducted to identify prospective studies with quantitative data on baseline factors associated with follow-up diet or physical activity related outcomes. MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL Plus and grey literature databases were searched from inception to March 2018. From 6921 studies, 5 were eligible for physical activity related outcomes and 2 for diet related outcomes. The follow-up duration was 4 weeks to 24 months and participants were mostly diagnosed with schizophrenia. Older age was commonly related to better physical activity related outcomes, whilst higher negative symptoms were related to poorer-related outcomes. Physical activity intentions and gender were unrelated to physical activity outcomes. There was a lack of data on factors influencing dietary outcomes. Although there were some common factors predictive of physical activity including older age and negative symptoms, more high-quality research is needed to determine the effect of sociodemographic, mental health, social, clinical, lifestyle and other factors on both physical activity and dietary outcomes.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bipolar", "Cohort", "Diet", "Exercise", "Prospective", "Quantitative", "Schizophrenia"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Diet", "Exercise", "Female", "Humans", "Life Style", "Longitudinal Studies", "Male", "Mental Disorders", "Outcome Assessment, Health Care", "Prospective Studies"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85059871748", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"], ["Biological Psychiatry", "NEUR", "2803"]], "AuthorData": {"57201367608": {"Name": "Hassan S.", "AuthorID": "57201367608", "AffiliationID": "60029950, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Research Department of Primary Care and Population Health"}, "57200906069": {"Name": "Ross J.", "AuthorID": "57200906069", "AffiliationID": "60029950, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Research Department of Primary Care and Population Health"}, "6603627308": {"Name": "Marston L.", "AuthorID": "6603627308", "AffiliationID": "60029950, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Research Department of Primary Care and Population Health"}, "57203175207": {"Name": "Walters K.", "AuthorID": "57203175207", "AffiliationID": "60029950, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Research Department of Primary Care and Population Health"}, "57189923687": {"Name": "Osborn D.", "AuthorID": "57189923687", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, UCL Division of Psychiatry"}}}
