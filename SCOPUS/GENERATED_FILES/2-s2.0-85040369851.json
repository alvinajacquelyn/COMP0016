All rights reserved.Background: The development of high-intensity magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided focused ultrasound (MRIgFUS) ablation has widened the spectrum of interventional techniques for stereotactic functional neurosurgery of lesions. This has resulted in novel incisionless intervention approaches for the therapy of tremor disorders. The safety and efficacy is documented by recent study data. Objectives: This article encompasses a description of the technological basis and typical course of MRIgFUS interventions, a comparison to alternative open or incisionless surgical techniques as well as a review of the current evidence base for MRIgFUS ablation in the context of lesional interventions to treat tremor. Material and methods: Narrative literature review and comparison. Results: Depending on the surgical target and tremor etiology published trials of MRIgFUS ablation report a reduction of tremor intensity of up to 80% after 6\u201312 months follow-up without the disadvantages of open brain surgery. Conclusion: The MRIgFUS functional neurosurgery is conducted only at a limited number of treatment sites. First data on lesions of the thalamic ventral intermediary nucleus (V.im.) as well as subthalamic fiber tracts have been published. These results indicate an effective and safe treatment of tremor disorders by MRIgFUS ablation. Incisionless lesional surgery using MRIgFUS is a significant addition to the interventional armamentarium for functional stereotactic neurosurgery and a potentially valuable alternative to established interventional therapy options for tremor disorders.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Essential tremor", "Parkinson\u2019s disease", "Radiofrequency ablation", "Subthalamotomy", "Thalamotomy"], "IndexKeywords": ["Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Neurosurgical Procedures", "Tremor", "Ultrasonic Therapy"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85040369851", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"53867273100": {"Name": "Schreglmann S.", "AuthorID": "53867273100", "AffiliationID": "60022646", "AffiliationName": "Klinik f\u00fcr Neurologie, Kantonsspital St. Gallen"}, "55263499200": {"Name": "H\u00e4gele-Link S.", "AuthorID": "55263499200", "AffiliationID": "60022646", "AffiliationName": "Klinik f\u00fcr Neurologie, Kantonsspital St. Gallen"}, "57190871612": {"Name": "K\u00e4gi G.", "AuthorID": "57190871612", "AffiliationID": "60022646", "AffiliationName": "Klinik f\u00fcr Neurologie, Kantonsspital St. Gallen"}, "7101814646": {"Name": "Werner B.", "AuthorID": "7101814646", "AffiliationID": "60020992", "AffiliationName": "Zentrum f\u00fcr MR-Forschung, Universit\u00e4ts-Kinderkliniken Z\u00fcrich"}, "7404092660": {"Name": "Martin E.", "AuthorID": "7404092660", "AffiliationID": "60020992", "AffiliationName": "Zentrum f\u00fcr MR-Forschung, Universit\u00e4ts-Kinderkliniken Z\u00fcrich"}}}
