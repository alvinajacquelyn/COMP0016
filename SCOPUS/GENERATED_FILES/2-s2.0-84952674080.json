Given the localization of the protein Dp71 around the retinal vessels in adult mice and its role in maintaining retinal homeostasis, the aim of this study was to determine if Dp71 was involved in astrocyte and vascular development regulation. An experimental study in mouse retinas was conducted. Using a dual immunolabeling with antibodies to Dp71 and anti-GFAP for astrocytes on retinal sections and isolated astrocytes, it was found that Dp71 was expressed in wild-type (WT) mouse astrocytes from early developmental stages to adult stage. In Dp71-null mice, a reduction in GFAP-immunopositive astrocytes was observed as early as postnatal day 6 (P6) compared with WT mice. Using real-time PCR, it was showed that Dp71 mRNA was stable between P1 and P6, in parallel with post-natal vascular development. Regarding morphology in Dp71-null and WT mice, a significant decrease in overall astrocyte process number in Dp71-null retinas at P6 to adult age was found. Using fluorescence-conjugated isolectin Griffonia simplicifolia on whole mount retinas, subsequent delay of developing vascular network at the same age in Dp71-null mice was found. An evidence that the Dystrophin Dp71, a membrane-associated cytoskeletal protein and one of the smaller Duchenne muscular dystrophy gene products, regulates astrocyte morphology and density and is associated with subsequent normal blood vessel development was provided.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Angiogenesis", "Astrocytes", "Dystrophin Dp71", "Retinal vascular development"], "IndexKeywords": ["Age Factors", "Animals", "Animals, Newborn", "Astrocytes", "Cadherins", "Cell Count", "Cytoskeletal Proteins", "Dystrophin", "Gene Expression Regulation", "Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein", "In Vitro Techniques", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Mice, Knockout", "Retina", "Retinal Vessels", "RNA, Messenger", "Statistics, Nonparametric", "Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84952674080", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"]], "AuthorData": {"48861326600": {"Name": "Giocanti-Auregan A.", "AuthorID": "48861326600", "AffiliationID": "60008134", "AffiliationName": "CNRS, UMR-7210"}, "55980019000": {"Name": "Vacca O.", "AuthorID": "55980019000", "AffiliationID": "60008134", "AffiliationName": "CNRS, UMR-7210"}, "55559603700": {"Name": "B\u00e9nard R.", "AuthorID": "55559603700", "AffiliationID": "60008134", "AffiliationName": "CNRS, UMR-7210"}, "57031160700": {"Name": "Cao S.", "AuthorID": "57031160700", "AffiliationID": "60008134", "AffiliationName": "CNRS, UMR-7210"}, "57031877300": {"Name": "Siqueiros L.", "AuthorID": "57031877300", "AffiliationID": "60008134", "AffiliationName": "CNRS, UMR-7210"}, "7005188041": {"Name": "Paques M.", "AuthorID": "7005188041", "AffiliationID": "60004689, 60000905", "AffiliationName": "Centre Hospitalier National D'ophtalmologie Des Quinze-Vingts"}, "7101991490": {"Name": "Sahel J.A.", "AuthorID": "7101991490", "AffiliationID": "60031184", "AffiliationName": "Fondation Ophtalmologique Rothschild"}, "6603045217": {"Name": "Sennlaub F.", "AuthorID": "6603045217", "AffiliationID": "60008134", "AffiliationName": "CNRS, UMR-7210"}, "6603121127": {"Name": "Guillonneau X.", "AuthorID": "6603121127", "AffiliationID": "60008134", "AffiliationName": "CNRS, UMR-7210"}, "7007138111": {"Name": "Rendon A.", "AuthorID": "7007138111", "AffiliationID": "60008134", "AffiliationName": "CNRS, UMR-7210"}, "6602700022": {"Name": "Tadayoni R.", "AuthorID": "6602700022", "AffiliationID": "60021374, 60123796, 60021567", "AffiliationName": "Ophthalmology Department, H\u00f4pital Lariboisi\u00e8re, AP-HP, University Paris 7"}, "7004894517": {"Name": "Monta\u00f1ez C.", "AuthorID": "7004894517", "AffiliationID": "60019176", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genetics and Molecular Biology, Research Centre for Advanced Studies, IPN"}}}
