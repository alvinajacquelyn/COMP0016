We aimed to identify factors associated with elevated cardiovascular risk in bronchiectasis, measured using aortic stiffness and cardiac biomarkers. In addition, we sought to compare these direct measures against calculated QRISK2 scores.Aortic stiffness, cardiac biomarkers and systemic inflammation were measured in 101 adults with stable bronchiectasis. In addition, clinical and demographic data were collected to allow calculation of QRISK2 score and the bronchiectasis severity index (BSI) for each patient.The BSI score correlated with measured cardiovascular risk assessments, partly due to greater exacerbation frequency and lower forced expiratory volume in 1 s. Pulse-wave velocity was significantly higher in frequent exacerbators (\u22653 events\u00b7year-1) than infrequent exacerbators (<3 events\u00b7year-1; 10.5 versus 9.2 m\u00b7s-1, p=0.01). In addition, frequent exacerbators had elevated serum C-reactive protein concentration, suggesting increased systemic inflammation (4.8 versus 2.2 mg\u00b7L-1, p=0.005). QRISK2 systematically underestimated cardiovascular risk in this population (median change in relative risk 1.29). Underestimation was associated with frequent exacerbations and male sex.Patients with bronchiectasis have greater cardiovascular risk than published reference populations. Excess cardiovascular risk is associated with exacerbation frequency and impaired lung function. Cardiovascular risk assessment in bronchiectasis should be individualised, as calculation tools are likely to underestimate the risk in this population.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Bronchiectasis", "Cardiovascular Diseases", "Disease Progression", "Female", "Forced Expiratory Volume", "Humans", "Inflammation", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Multivariate Analysis", "Pulse Wave Analysis", "Regression Analysis", "Risk Assessment", "Risk Factors", "Severity of Illness Index", "Sex Factors", "Sputum", "Vascular Stiffness"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85045265652", "SubjectAreas": [["Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine", "MEDI", "2740"]], "AuthorData": {"55810716600": {"Name": "Saleh A.", "AuthorID": "55810716600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Inflammation and Tissue Repair, UCL Respiratory Medicine, University College London"}, "57203001571": {"Name": "Kwok B.", "AuthorID": "57203001571", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Inflammation and Tissue Repair, UCL Respiratory Medicine, University College London"}, "35553480100": {"Name": "Brown J.", "AuthorID": "35553480100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Inflammation and Tissue Repair, UCL Respiratory Medicine, University College London"}, "57201513306": {"Name": "Hurst J.", "AuthorID": "57201513306", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Inflammation and Tissue Repair, UCL Respiratory Medicine, University College London"}}}
