The best donor is one matched for 10/10 HLA alleles, however studies have shown an additional survival benefit when considering other genetic factors. It has been shown that a six-nucleotide insertion/deletion polymorphism in the CASP8 gene promoter results in reduced susceptibility of T lymphocytes to undergo apoptosis. In 186 SCT recipients, we found a significantly better OS in those who received a transplant from a WT/WT donor compared with donors with a deletion (3 years: 52 vs 34%; P=0.03; multivariate analysis; RR 0.61; 95% CI 0.38-0.98, P=0.04). This was more marked when both the patient and the donor had a deletion (3 years OS: 62% compared with 36%, P=0.01). As the majority of these patients received Alemtuzumab during conditioning, we went on to analyze the in vitro effect of the polymorphism on Alemtuzumab-induced apoptosis. We showed statistically significantly higher percentages of apoptotic na\u00efve CD4 (P<0.0005) and CD8 (P<0.0005) T cells in WT/WT donors in comparison with donors with a deletion. These data imply an unrecognized role for the CASP8 promoter polymorphism on survival following unrelated SCT particularly in the context of T-cell depletion with Alemtuzumab.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Allografts", "Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized", "Antineoplastic Agents", "Apoptosis", "Caspase 8", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Female", "Hematologic Neoplasms", "Humans", "Lymphocyte Depletion", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Polymorphism, Genetic", "Stem Cell Transplantation", "T-Lymphocytes", "Transplantation Conditioning"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84922410096", "SubjectAreas": [["Hematology", "MEDI", "2720"], ["Transplantation", "MEDI", "2747"]], "AuthorData": {"7202493348": {"Name": "Shaw B.E.", "AuthorID": "7202493348", "AffiliationID": "60017166", "AffiliationName": "Section of Haemato-Oncology, Royal Marsden Hospital"}, "57220840803": {"Name": "Lee F.", "AuthorID": "57220840803", "AffiliationID": "60109234", "AffiliationName": "UCL Cancer Institute, Royal Free Campus"}, "6603144775": {"Name": "Mayor N.P.", "AuthorID": "6603144775", "AffiliationID": "60109234", "AffiliationName": "UCL Cancer Institute, Royal Free Campus"}, "14066484800": {"Name": "Maldonado-Torres H.", "AuthorID": "14066484800", "AffiliationID": "60109234", "AffiliationName": "UCL Cancer Institute, Royal Free Campus"}, "7004019930": {"Name": "Saudemont A.", "AuthorID": "7004019930", "AffiliationID": "60109234", "AffiliationName": "UCL Cancer Institute, Royal Free Campus"}, "55942654100": {"Name": "Marsh S.G.E.", "AuthorID": "55942654100", "AffiliationID": "60109234", "AffiliationName": "UCL Cancer Institute, Royal Free Campus"}, "57201015291": {"Name": "Madrigal J.A.", "AuthorID": "57201015291", "AffiliationID": "60109234", "AffiliationName": "UCL Cancer Institute, Royal Free Campus"}, "57206311745": {"Name": "Krishnamurthy S.", "AuthorID": "57206311745", "AffiliationID": "60023346", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, Northampton General Hospital"}, "35427082900": {"Name": "Byrne J.L.", "AuthorID": "35427082900", "AffiliationID": "60025016", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Clinical Haematology, Nottingham University Hospital"}, "7201812899": {"Name": "Russell N.H.", "AuthorID": "7201812899", "AffiliationID": "60025016", "AffiliationName": "Academic Haematology, Nottingham University Hospitals"}, "6603494619": {"Name": "Seedhouse C.", "AuthorID": "6603494619", "AffiliationID": "60025016", "AffiliationName": "Academic Haematology, Nottingham University Hospitals"}}}
