There is clearly a need to develop more effective anti-cancer drugs in dogs. SG2000 (SJG-136) is a sequence selective DNA minor groove cross-linking agent. Based on its in vitro potency, the spectrum of in vivo and clinical activity against human tumours, and its tolerability in human patients, SG2000 has potential as a novel therapeutic against spontaneously occurring canine malignancies. Results: In vitro cytotoxicity was assessed using SRB and MTT assays, and in vivo activity was assessed using canine tumour xenografts. DNA interstrand cross-linking (ICL) was determined using a modification of the single cell gel electrophoresis (comet) assay. Effects on cell cycle distribution were assessed by flow cytometry and measurement of \u03b3-H2AX by immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry. SG2000 had a multi-log differential cytotoxic profile against a panel of 12 canine tumour cell lines representing a range of common tumour types in dogs. In the CMeC-1 melanoma cell line, DNA ICLs increased linearly with dose following a 1 h treatment. Peak ICL was achieved within 1 h and no removal was observed over 48 h. A relationship between DNA ICL formation and cytotoxicity was observed across cell lines. The formation of \u03b3-H2AX foci was slow, becoming evident after 4 h and reaching a peak at 24 h. SG2000 exhibited significant anti-tumour activity against two canine melanoma tumour models in vivo. Anti-tumour activity was observed at 0.15 and 0.3 mg/kg given i.v. either once, or weekly x 3. Dose-dependent DNA ICL was observed in tumours (and to a lower level in peripheral blood mononuclear cells) at 2 h and persisted at 24 h. ICL increased following the second and third doses in a repeated dose schedule. At 24 h, dose dependent \u03b3-H2AX foci were more numerous than at 2 h, and greater in tumours than in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. SG2000-induced H2AX phosphorylation measured by immunohistochemistry showed good correspondence, but less sensitivity, than measurement of foci. Conclusions: SG2000 displayed potent activity in vitro against canine cancer cell lines as a result of the formation and persistence of DNA ICLs. SG2000 also had significant in vivo antitumour activity against canine melanoma xenografts, and the comet and \u03b3-H2AX foci methods were relevant pharmacodynamic assays. The clinical testing of SG2000 against spontaneous canine cancer is warranted.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Anticancer drug", "Cancer chemotherapy", "Canine cancer", "DNA interstrand cross-linking", "Pyrrolobenzodiazepine dimer", "SG2000 (SJG-136)"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Antineoplastic Agents", "Benzodiazepinones", "Cell Line, Tumor", "Cross-Linking Reagents", "DNA", "Dog Diseases", "Dogs", "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug", "Drug Administration Schedule", "Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor", "Female", "Flow Cytometry", "Mice", "Mice, Nude", "Pyrroles", "Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84939481591", "SubjectAreas": [["Veterinary (all)", "VETE", "3400"]], "AuthorData": {"55579395700": {"Name": "Mellinas-Gomez M.", "AuthorID": "55579395700", "AffiliationID": "60026530", "AffiliationName": "Royal Veterinary College"}, "6602269126": {"Name": "Spanswick V.J.", "AuthorID": "6602269126", "AffiliationID": "60109234, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "CR-UK Drug-DNA Interactions Research Group, UCL Cancer Institute, University College London"}, "56786510200": {"Name": "Paredes-Moscosso S.R.", "AuthorID": "56786510200", "AffiliationID": "60109234, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "CR-UK Drug-DNA Interactions Research Group, UCL Cancer Institute, University College London"}, "35599970900": {"Name": "Hartley J.A.", "AuthorID": "35599970900", "AffiliationID": "60109234, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "CR-UK Drug-DNA Interactions Research Group, UCL Cancer Institute, University College London"}, "15623625300": {"Name": "Robson M.", "AuthorID": "15623625300", "AffiliationID": "60109234", "AffiliationName": "UCL Cancer Institute"}, "7006757998": {"Name": "Pedley R.B.", "AuthorID": "7006757998", "AffiliationID": "60109234", "AffiliationName": "UCL Cancer Institute"}, "7005776849": {"Name": "Thurston D.E.", "AuthorID": "7005776849", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Pharmaceutical Science, King's College London"}, "7005592796": {"Name": "Baines S.J.", "AuthorID": "7005592796", "AffiliationID": "107970048", "AffiliationName": "Willows Referral Service"}, "6603826803": {"Name": "Stell A.", "AuthorID": "6603826803", "AffiliationID": "60026530", "AffiliationName": "Royal Veterinary College"}}}
