This collection of landforms, termed viscous flow features (VFFs), is composed primarily of H2O ice and shows evidence of viscous deformation. Recent work has hypothesised that VFFs are the diminishing remains of once larger ice masses, formed during one or more previous ice ages, and the landscape therefore records evidence of polyphase glaciation. However, debate persists concerning the former extent and volume of ice, and style of former glaciations. The accompanying map (1:100,000 scale) presents a geomorphic and structural assessment of a glacial landscape in eastern Hellas Planitia, Mars. Here, we present a description of the features identified, comprising four geomorphic units (plains, lobate debris apron, degraded glacial material, and glacier-like form) and 16 structures (craters, moraine-like ridges, flow unit boundaries, arcuate transvers structures, longitudinal surface structures, ring-mold craters, terraces, medial moraine-like ridges, raised textured areas, flow-parallel and flow-transverse lineations, crevasses and crevasse traces, and ridge clusters).", "AuthorKeywords": ["climate change", "glaciation", "glacier-like form", "ice", "lobate debris apron", "Mars", "mid-latitude"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84961214671", "SubjectAreas": [["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"], ["Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)", "EART", "1901"]], "AuthorData": {"56406219500": {"Name": "Brough S.", "AuthorID": "56406219500", "AffiliationID": "60030514", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography and Earth Sciences, Aberystwyth University"}, "7006784679": {"Name": "Hubbard B.", "AuthorID": "7006784679", "AffiliationID": "60030514", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography and Earth Sciences, Aberystwyth University"}, "36651779700": {"Name": "Souness C.", "AuthorID": "36651779700", "AffiliationID": "60030514", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography and Earth Sciences, Aberystwyth University"}, "7004901554": {"Name": "Grindrod P.M.", "AuthorID": "7004901554", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences, Birkbeck, University of London"}, "57207171088": {"Name": "Davis J.", "AuthorID": "57207171088", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, University College London"}}}
