Friedrich\u2019s contemporary, the novelist and dramatist Heinrich von Kleist, intuited precisely this in his scintillating comments on the painting at the time it appeared. Invoking the shocking idea that looking at The Monk by the Sea is like seeing through eyes whose lids have been cut off, he recognized that Friedrich had transformed the canvas into the locus not so much of narration and signification as of sensation. This article leans on the terms devised by Gilles Deleuze to explain the paintings of Francis Bacon in order to explore the seminal shift in the relationship between spectator and composition that Friedrich\u2019s canvas dramatizes with such compelling power.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Caspar david friedrich", "Enlightenment vision", "Gilles deleuze", "Heinrich von kleist", "Sensation", "The sublime"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85058395268", "SubjectAreas": [["Cultural Studies", "SOCI", "3316"], ["Philosophy", "ARTS", "1211"], ["Literature and Literary Theory", "ARTS", "1208"]], "AuthorData": {"26033058300": {"Name": "Beaumont M.", "AuthorID": "26033058300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of English Literature, University College London"}}}
