Based on the two-step spin-coating method, we designed a screening method to search for an effective solvent annealing process for PbI2. PbI2 films were annealed in diverse solvent atmospheres, including DMF, DMSO, acetone, and isopropanol (IPA). We found that the solvent annealing of PbI2 in the DMF, acetone, and IPA atmospheres resulted in dense PbI2 films, which impeded the complete conversion of PbI2 to CH3NH3PbI3. Surprisingly, employing the DMSO solvent annealing process for PbI2 led to porous PbI2, which facilitated the complete conversion of PbI2 to perovskite with larger grain sizes. Solar cells fabricated using the DMSO solvent annealing process exhibited the best efficiency of 18.5%, with a fill factor of 76.5%. This unique solvent annealing method presents a new way of controlling the perovskite film quality for highly efficient solar cells.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Diverse solvents", "Fill factor", "High quality", "Iso-propanols", "Perovskite films", "Screening methods", "Solvent annealing", "Spin-coating method"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85000607451", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"]], "AuthorData": {"55733853200": {"Name": "Wang Y.", "AuthorID": "55733853200", "AffiliationID": "60005465", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Electronic Thin Films and Integrated Devices, School of Optoelectronic Information, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC)"}, "54079892300": {"Name": "Li S.", "AuthorID": "54079892300", "AffiliationID": "60005465", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Electronic Thin Films and Integrated Devices, School of Optoelectronic Information, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC)"}, "57219324275": {"Name": "Zhang P.", "AuthorID": "57219324275", "AffiliationID": "60005465", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Electronic Thin Films and Integrated Devices, School of Optoelectronic Information, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC)"}, "57192198429": {"Name": "Liu D.", "AuthorID": "57192198429", "AffiliationID": "60005465", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Electronic Thin Films and Integrated Devices, School of Optoelectronic Information, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC)"}, "57192201099": {"Name": "Gu X.", "AuthorID": "57192201099", "AffiliationID": "60005465", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Electronic Thin Films and Integrated Devices, School of Optoelectronic Information, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC)"}, "56178016000": {"Name": "Ye Z.", "AuthorID": "56178016000", "AffiliationID": "60015941", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Center for Nanoscale Science and Engineering, University of Kentucky"}, "57216471973": {"Name": "Chen Z.D.", "AuthorID": "57216471973", "AffiliationID": "60015941", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Center for Nanoscale Science and Engineering, University of Kentucky"}, "36538012200": {"Name": "Sarvari H.", "AuthorID": "36538012200", "AffiliationID": "60015941", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Center for Nanoscale Science and Engineering, University of Kentucky"}, "10141185300": {"Name": "Wu J.", "AuthorID": "10141185300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London Torrington Place"}, "54780880800": {"Name": "Wang Z.", "AuthorID": "54780880800", "AffiliationID": "60005465", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Fundamental and Frontier Sciences, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China"}}}
