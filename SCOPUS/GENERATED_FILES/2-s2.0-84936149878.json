DRS technique was proven a suitable technique for the detection of the phase transitions that take place in the systems under investigation, as it follows from the comparison with Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) technique, which is traditionally used. Regarding molecular mobility, molecular motions of both the main chain and the sf side chains were followed, while different dynamics was recorded depending on the structure of the copolymers.", "AuthorKeywords": ["dielectric relaxation spectroscopy", "molecular mobility", "phase transitions", "random copolymers", "Semifluorinated methacrylates"], "IndexKeywords": ["Dielectric relaxation spectroscopy", "Methyl methacrylates", "Molar content", "Molecular mobility", "Molecular motions", "Random copolymer", "Semifluorinated methacrylates", "Side chain lengths"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84936149878", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"]], "AuthorData": {"6507001894": {"Name": "Kripotou S.", "AuthorID": "6507001894", "AffiliationID": "60002947", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, School of Applied Mathematical and Physical Sciences, National Technical University of Athens"}, "18936516600": {"Name": "Pandis C.", "AuthorID": "18936516600", "AffiliationID": "60002947", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, School of Applied Mathematical and Physical Sciences, National Technical University of Athens"}, "7006878274": {"Name": "Kyritsis A.", "AuthorID": "7006878274", "AffiliationID": "60002947", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, School of Applied Mathematical and Physical Sciences, National Technical University of Athens"}, "35514385600": {"Name": "Pissis P.", "AuthorID": "35514385600", "AffiliationID": "60002947", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, School of Applied Mathematical and Physical Sciences, National Technical University of Athens"}, "7003282308": {"Name": "Pospiech D.", "AuthorID": "7003282308", "AffiliationID": "60008583", "AffiliationName": "Leibniz Institute of Polymer Research Dresden"}, "7004459828": {"Name": "Jehnichen D.", "AuthorID": "7004459828", "AffiliationID": "60008583", "AffiliationName": "Leibniz Institute of Polymer Research Dresden"}}}
