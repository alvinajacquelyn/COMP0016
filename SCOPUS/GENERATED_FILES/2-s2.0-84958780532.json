As these differ in cost and technical requirements, determining comparative efficacy is important particularly where resources are limited. Design We performed a randomised, controlled, equivalence trial of CPAP systems. We specified the margin of equivalence as 2 days. We analysed binary variables by logistical regression adjusted for gestation, and log transformed continuous variables by multiple linear regression adjusted for gestation, sex and antenatal steroids. Setting A neonatal unit with no blood gas analyser or surfactant availability and limited X-ray and laboratory facilities Patients Neonates <37 weeks of gestation. Interventions We provided CPAP at delivery followed by randomisation to FD or bubble (B). Outcomes Primary outcome included total days receiving CPAP; secondary outcomes included days receiving CPAP, supplemental oxygen, ventilation, death, pneumothorax and nasal excoriation. Results We randomised 125 infants (B 66, FD 59). Differences in infant outcomes on B and FD were not statistically significant. The median (range) for CPAP days for survivors was B 0.8 (0.04 to 17.5), FD 0.5 (0.04 to 5.3). B:FD (95% CI) ratios were CPAP days 1.3 (0.9 to 2.1), CPAP plus supplementary oxygen days 1.2 (0.7 to 1.9). B:FD (95% CI) ORs were death 2.3 (0.2 to 28), ventilation 2.1 (0.5 to 9), nasal excoriation 1.2 (0.2 to 8) and pneumothorax 2.4 (0.2 to 26). Conclusions In a resource-limited setting we found B CPAP equivalent to FD CPAP in the total number of days receiving CPAP within a margin of 2 days.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Continuous Positive Airway Pressure", "Female", "Health Resources", "Humans", "Infant, Newborn", "Infant, Premature", "Logistic Models", "Male", "Poverty", "Prospective Studies", "Pulmonary Surfactants", "Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Newborn", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84958780532", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Obstetrics and Gynecology", "MEDI", "2729"]], "AuthorData": {"55800071800": {"Name": "Mazmanyan P.", "AuthorID": "55800071800", "AffiliationID": "102032458", "AffiliationName": "Scientific Research Centre of Maternal and Child Health Protection"}, "56803702600": {"Name": "Mellor K.", "AuthorID": "56803702600", "AffiliationID": "116775353", "AffiliationName": "BirthLink"}, "16941587100": {"Name": "Dore C.", "AuthorID": "16941587100", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council Clinical Trials Unit, University College London"}, "57208140301": {"Name": "Modi N.", "AuthorID": "57208140301", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Section of Neonatal Medicine Chelsea and Westminster Campus, Imperial College London"}}}
