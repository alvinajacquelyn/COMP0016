Information on experimentally validated functional TFBSs is limited and consequently there is a need for accurate prediction of TFBSs for gene annotation and in applications such as evaluating the effects of single nucleotide variations in causing disease. TFBSs are generally recognized by scanning a position weight matrix (PWM) against DNA using one of a number of available computer programs. Thus we set out to evaluate the best tools that can be used locally (and are therefore suitable for large-scale analyses) for creating PWMs from high-throughput ChIP-Seq data and for scanning them against DNA. Results: We evaluated a set of de novo motif discovery tools that could be downloaded and installed locally using ENCODE-ChIP-Seq data and showed that rGADEM was the best-performing tool. TFBS prediction tools used to scan PWMs against DNA fall into two classes-those that predict individual TFBSs and those that identify clusters. Our evaluation showed that FIMO and MCAST performed best respectively. Conclusions: Selection of the best-performing tools for generating PWMs from ChIP-Seq data and for scanning PWMs against DNA has the potential to improve prediction of precise transcription factor binding sites within regions identified by ChIP-Seq experiments for gene finding, understanding regulation and in evaluating the effects of single nucleotide variations in causing disease.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Motif discovery", "Motif scanning tools", "Performance evaluation", "PWMs"], "IndexKeywords": ["Accurate prediction", "Large-scale analysis", "Motif discovery", "Performance evaluation", "Scanning tool", "Single nucleotides", "Transcription factor binding sites", "Transcriptional regulation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85031128668", "SubjectAreas": [["Structural Biology", "BIOC", "1315"], ["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"55372726200": {"Name": "Jayaram N.", "AuthorID": "55372726200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, Division of Biosciences, University College London"}, "57211469717": {"Name": "Usvyat D.", "AuthorID": "57211469717", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, Division of Biosciences, University College London"}, "55708401700": {"Name": "Martin A.", "AuthorID": "55708401700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, Division of Biosciences, University College London"}}}
