NAATs are now widely used, and have become the preferred tools for detecting and screening for STIs. This is largely due to their enhanced sensitivity and specificity over more traditional methods, and the ability to process non-invasive test samples such as urine samples or self-collected vaginal swabs. However, in order to provide accurate diagnostic results NAATs must be rigorously evaluated for specificity, reproducibility, analytic and clinical validity, and cost before they can be recommended for screening of general populations. \u00a9 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bacteria", "Clinical", "Diagnosis", "Nucleic acid amplification test", "Protocol", "Sexually transmitted infection", "Virus"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84900082414", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Microbiology (all)", "IMMU", "2400"]], "AuthorData": {"7102220459": {"Name": "Garland S.", "AuthorID": "7102220459", "AffiliationID": "60009102", "AffiliationName": "Murdoch Children's Research Institute"}, "7006745677": {"Name": "Tabrizi S.", "AuthorID": "7006745677", "AffiliationID": "60032679", "AffiliationName": "Microbiology and Infectious Diseases Department, Royal Women's Hospital"}, "57212224400": {"Name": "Smith D.", "AuthorID": "57212224400", "AffiliationID": "60031806", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Life and Physical Sciences and Faculty of Medicine, University of Western Australia"}, "6602156523": {"Name": "Whiley D.", "AuthorID": "6602156523", "AffiliationID": "100478059", "AffiliationName": "Queensland Paediatric Infectious Diseases Laboratory, Queensland Children's Medical Research Institute, Children's Health Service District Sir Albert Sakzewski Virus Research Centre"}}}
