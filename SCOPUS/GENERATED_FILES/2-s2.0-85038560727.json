Then the experiments evolved and needed to find ways to visualize their data. With the availability of computer graphics, software packages to display event data and the detector geometry started to be developed. Here, an overview of the usage of event display tools in HEP is presented. Then the case of the ATLAS experiment is considered in more detail and two widely used event display packages are presented, Atlantis and VP1, focusing on the software technologies they employ, as well as their strengths, differences and their usage in the experiment: from physics analysis to detector development, and from online monitoring to outreach and communication. Towards the end, the other ATLAS visualization tools will be briefly presented as well. Future development plans and improvements in the ATLAS event display packages will also be discussed.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["ATLAS experiment", "Detector development", "Detector geometry", "Development plans", "Online monitoring", "Outreach and communications", "Software technology", "Visualization tools"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85038560727", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"44460933500": {"Name": "Bianchi R.M.", "AuthorID": "44460933500", "AffiliationID": "60015543", "AffiliationName": "University of Pittsburgh, Department of Physics and Astronomy"}, "35227012000": {"Name": "Boudreau J.", "AuthorID": "35227012000", "AffiliationID": "60015543", "AffiliationName": "University of Pittsburgh, Department of Physics and Astronomy"}, "35314835800": {"Name": "Konstantinidis N.", "AuthorID": "35314835800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Department of Physics and Astronomy"}, "56978943400": {"Name": "Martyniuk A.C.", "AuthorID": "56978943400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Department of Physics and Astronomy"}, "14824389500": {"Name": "Waugh B.M.", "AuthorID": "14824389500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Department of Physics and Astronomy"}, "57193697134": {"Name": "Yallup D.P.", "AuthorID": "57193697134", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Department of Physics and Astronomy"}, "24758923500": {"Name": "Moyse E.", "AuthorID": "24758923500", "AffiliationID": "60014313", "AffiliationName": "University of Massachusetts Amherst, Physics Department"}, "57202477088": {"Name": "Thomas J.", "AuthorID": "57202477088", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "University of Birmingham, School of Physics and Astronomy"}}}
