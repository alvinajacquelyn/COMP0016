It can also happen spontaneously through cross-sensitisation from infection and pro-inflammatory events. Patients who are highly sensitised face longer waiting times on organ allocation programmes, more graft rejection and therefore more side effects of immunosuppression, and poorer graft outcomes. In this review, we discuss these issues, along with the limitations of modern HLA detection methods, and potential ways of decreasing HLA antibody development. We do not discuss the removal of antibodies after they have developed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["HLA antibodies", "Red blood cell transfusion", "Renal transplantation", "Sensitisation", "Transplant waiting times"], "IndexKeywords": ["Blood Donors", "Child", "Erythrocyte Transfusion", "Histocompatibility Testing", "HLA Antigens", "Humans", "Isoantibodies", "Kidney Transplantation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84939886705", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Nephrology", "MEDI", "2727"]], "AuthorData": {"16146771300": {"Name": "Rees L.", "AuthorID": "16146771300", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "56337055200": {"Name": "Kim J.J.", "AuthorID": "56337055200", "AffiliationID": "60009797, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Transplantation, Guy\u2019s Hospital"}}}
