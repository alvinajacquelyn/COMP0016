Published by BMJ.Background The risk of reinjury and other sequelae following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) remains high. Lack of knowledge regarding factors contributing to these risks limits our ability to develop sensitive return to play (RTP) tests. Using a running task, we evaluate whether fatigue induces alterations in foot progression angle (FPA), a proposed biomechanical risk factor and could be used to enhance RTP test sensitivity. Method Transverse plane foot kinematics (FPA) were assessed for 18 post-ACLR subjects during a treadmill running task, before and after a generalised lower limb fatigue protocol. Subject's contralateral limbs were used as a control group. Results A small but significant difference between FPA for ACLR and contralateral limbs was observed before but not after fatigue. When confounding variables were considered, there was a significant difference in FPA change between ACLR and contralateral limbs from the prefatigue to postfatigue state. Conclusions Following ACLR athletes may develop a knee-protective movement strategy that delays the progression of osteoarthritis in the ACL-injured knee. This may, however, increase the risk of ACL reinjury. Following the onset of fatigue this proposed movement strategy, and thus osteoarthritis protection, is lost.", "AuthorKeywords": ["anterior cruciate ligament", "biomechanics", "rehabilitation", "return to play"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85062422605", "SubjectAreas": [["Orthopedics and Sports Medicine", "MEDI", "2732"], ["Physical Therapy, Sports Therapy and Rehabilitation", "HEAL", "3612"]], "AuthorData": {"57207295893": {"Name": "Connell R.", "AuthorID": "57207295893", "AffiliationID": "108342370", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Sport, Exercise and Health"}, "36604939600": {"Name": "Paton B.", "AuthorID": "36604939600", "AffiliationID": "108342370", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Sport, Exercise and Health"}, "57207300512": {"Name": "Milne R.", "AuthorID": "57207300512", "AffiliationID": "108342370", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Sport, Exercise and Health"}}}
