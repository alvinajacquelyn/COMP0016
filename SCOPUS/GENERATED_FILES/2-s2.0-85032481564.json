It forms part of a phase-sensitive frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radar system to measure the horizontal position of a borehole with depth. To distinguish the transponder response from stationary clutter, the transponder modulates the received signal before re-transmission to the surface radars. The transponder operates from 292 to 492 MHz with a gain around 18 dB. The transponder employs two novel antennas optimized for deployment within a 15 cm diameter borehole. The simulation and indoor laboratory measurement results of the transponder design are presented.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Folded crossed plate monopole", "Frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radar", "Transponder", "Ultrawideband (UWB) antenna"], "IndexKeywords": ["Folded crossed plate monopole", "Frequency modulated continuous wave radars", "Laboratory measurements", "Received signals", "Stationary clutter", "Transponder design", "UHF transponders", "Ultra-wideband antennas"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85032481564", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiation", "PHYS", "3108"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"55486961200": {"Name": "Amiri A.", "AuthorID": "55486961200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering"}, "35087329300": {"Name": "Brennan P.", "AuthorID": "35087329300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering"}, "57198996462": {"Name": "Lok L.", "AuthorID": "57198996462", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering"}}}
