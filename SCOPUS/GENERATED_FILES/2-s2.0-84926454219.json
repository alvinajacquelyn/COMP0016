Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of Association for Child and Adolescent Mental Health.Background The quality of the early environment is hypothesized to be an influence on morphological development in key neural areas related to affective responding, but direct evidence to support this possibility is limited. In a 22-year longitudinal study, we examined hippocampal and amygdala volumes in adulthood in relation to early infant attachment status, an important indicator of the quality of the early caregiving environment. Methods Participants (N = 59) were derived from a prospective longitudinal study of the impact of maternal postnatal depression on child development. Infant attachment status (24 Secure; 35 Insecure) was observed at 18 months of age, and MRI assessments were completed at 22 years. Results In line with hypotheses, insecure versus secure infant attachment status was associated with larger amygdala volumes in young adults, an effect that was not accounted for by maternal depression history. We did not find early infant attachment status to predict hippocampal volumes. Conclusions Common variations in the quality of early environment are associated with gross alterations in amygdala morphology in the adult brain. Further research is required to establish the neural changes that underpin the volumetric differences reported here, and any functional implications.", "AuthorKeywords": ["amygdala", "Attachment", "brain development", "longitudinal", "maternal depression"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Amygdala", "Child Development", "Depression, Postpartum", "Female", "Humans", "Infant", "Longitudinal Studies", "Male", "Mother-Child Relations", "Object Attachment", "Stress, Psychological", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84926454219", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"26039358500": {"Name": "Moutsiana C.", "AuthorID": "26039358500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychology and Language Sciences, University College London"}, "7003273958": {"Name": "Fearon P.", "AuthorID": "7003273958", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychology and Language Sciences, University College London"}, "7004015430": {"Name": "Johnstone T.", "AuthorID": "7004015430", "AffiliationID": "60012197", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology and CLS, University of Reading"}, "7202252529": {"Name": "Murray L.", "AuthorID": "7202252529", "AffiliationID": "113467997", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Stellenbosch University"}, "7402087714": {"Name": "Cooper P.", "AuthorID": "7402087714", "AffiliationID": "113467997", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Stellenbosch University"}, "55151169800": {"Name": "Pliatsikas C.", "AuthorID": "55151169800", "AffiliationID": "60010818", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, University of Kent"}, "7005728308": {"Name": "Goodyer I.", "AuthorID": "7005728308", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, University of Cambridge"}, "7006081489": {"Name": "Halligan S.", "AuthorID": "7006081489", "AffiliationID": "60030480", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, University of Bath"}}}
