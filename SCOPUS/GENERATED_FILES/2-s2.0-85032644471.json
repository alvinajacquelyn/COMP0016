We sought to examine the relationship between estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and objective physical performance in older adults. Methods Cross-sectional analysis of 4,562 participants from The Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing, a national cohort of community-dwelling adults aged \u226550 years. We used multivariable linear or quantile regression to model the association between categories of cystatin C (eGFR cys) or creatinine eGFR (eGFR cr) and the following outcomes: gait speed, timed-up-and-go (TUG) and grip strength. Relationships were further explored using natural eGFR splines. We examined effect modification by age in the relationship between eGFR and gait speed. Results Mean (SD) age was 61.8 (8.3) years, 53.6% were female and median (IQR) eGFR cys was 82 (70-94) mL/min/1.73m 2. In multivariable-adjusted models, participants in the lowest eGFR cys category (< 45 mL/min/1.73m 2) had 3.32 cm/s (95% confidence interval [95%CI] 0.02-6.62) slower mean gait speed, 1.32 kg (95%CI 0.20-2.44) lower mean grip strength, and 0.31 seconds (95% CI -'0.04 to 0.65) longer median TUG versus the reference group (eGFR cys \u2265 90 mL/min/1.73m 2). The relationship between eGFR cys and outcomes appeared linear but varied by age. The association between eGFR cr and outcomes tended towards a U-shape. Conclusions Cystatin C eGFR was linearly related to poorer physical performance beyond middle age among community-dwelling adults. The non-linear relationships observed with eGFR cr underscore the limitations of creatinine as a predictor of frailty outcomes in older individuals.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Chronic kidney disease", "Gait speed", "Grip strength", "Population study", "Timed-up-and-go"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Aging", "Creatinine", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Cystatin C", "Female", "Glomerular Filtration Rate", "Humans", "Kidney", "Kidney Function Tests", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Motor Activity", "Renal Insufficiency, Chronic", "Risk Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85032644471", "SubjectAreas": [["Aging", "BIOC", "1302"], ["Geriatrics and Gerontology", "MEDI", "2717"]], "AuthorData": {"6506149463": {"Name": "Canney M.", "AuthorID": "6506149463", "AffiliationID": "60011149", "AffiliationName": "Trinity Health Kidney Centre, Trinity Centre for Health Sciences, Tallaght Hospital"}, "9243776400": {"Name": "Sexton D.J.", "AuthorID": "9243776400", "AffiliationID": "60011149", "AffiliationName": "Trinity Health Kidney Centre, Trinity Centre for Health Sciences, Tallaght Hospital"}, "9532868400": {"Name": "O'Connell M.D.", "AuthorID": "9532868400", "AffiliationID": "60011149", "AffiliationName": "Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing, Department of Medical Gerontology, Trinity College Dublin"}, "57214210019": {"Name": "Kenny R.A.", "AuthorID": "57214210019", "AffiliationID": "60011149", "AffiliationName": "Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing, Department of Medical Gerontology, Trinity College Dublin"}, "26643059400": {"Name": "Little M.A.", "AuthorID": "26643059400", "AffiliationID": "60011149", "AffiliationName": "Trinity Health Kidney Centre, Trinity Centre for Health Sciences, Tallaght Hospital"}, "11639106300": {"Name": "O'Seaghdha C.M.", "AuthorID": "11639106300", "AffiliationID": "60000718", "AffiliationName": "Department of Renal Medicine, Beaumont Hospital"}}}
