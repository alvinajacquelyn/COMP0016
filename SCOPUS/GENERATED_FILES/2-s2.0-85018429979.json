This article demonstrates that governments respond to domestic public opinion even when acting at the international level. Specifically, we examine conflict in the European Union\u2019s primary legislative body, the Council of the European Union (EU). We argue that domestic electoral incentives compel governments to react to public opinion. Analyzing a unique data set on all legislative decisions adopted in the Council since 1999, we show that governments are more likely to oppose legislative proposals that extend the level and scope of EU authority when their domestic electorates are skeptical about the EU. We also find that governments are more responsive when the issue of European integration is salient in domestic party politics. Our findings demonstrate that governments can use the international stage to signal their responsiveness to public concerns and that such signals resonate in the domestic political debate.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Council", "European Union", "legislative behavior", "public opinion", "responsiveness"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85018429979", "SubjectAreas": [["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"]], "AuthorData": {"25635767100": {"Name": "Hagemann S.", "AuthorID": "25635767100", "AffiliationID": "60003059", "AffiliationName": "London School of Economics and Political Science"}, "9634821200": {"Name": "Hobolt S.B.", "AuthorID": "9634821200", "AffiliationID": "60003059", "AffiliationName": "London School of Economics and Political Science"}, "56487997200": {"Name": "Wratil C.", "AuthorID": "56487997200", "AffiliationID": "60003059", "AffiliationName": "London School of Economics and Political Science"}}}
