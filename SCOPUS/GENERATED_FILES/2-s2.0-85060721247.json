This Debates paper examines the current state of liveability discourse. Liveability is unpacked to consider the rhetorical work that it does to frame urban problems, select and order concepts and build narratives that shape policy action. Liveability discourse has a dual role: it defines normative goals for a city and also reifies and demands particular forms of expert knowledge to justify and maintain its discursive power. This power is created by connecting the vague rhetoric of the \u2018liveable city\u2019 to expertise represented in liveability rankings and indicators. The experiences of apparently \u2018liveable\u2019 cities show how liveability discourse creates a representation of the city that is in contrast to the experience of many residents. The use of aggregate metrics and reliance on indices generated from undisclosed data sources and \u2018expert judgement\u2019 obscures the differentiated quality of life and everyday experience for urban populations. Therefore, liveability discourse has exerted and maintained stronger discursive power to undermine urban livelihoods than to improve them, due to the phenomena and qualities that it conceals. Liveability\u2019s distinct type of discursive power must be recognised and mobilised to support a counter-narrative that reconnects urban policy with everyday urban life.", "AuthorKeywords": ["discourse", "knowledge production", "liveability", "policy mobilities", "urban governance"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85060721247", "SubjectAreas": [["Environmental Science (miscellaneous)", "ENVI", "2301"], ["Urban Studies", "SOCI", "3322"]], "AuthorData": {"57193488696": {"Name": "McArthur J.", "AuthorID": "57193488696", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "57191071720": {"Name": "Robin E.", "AuthorID": "57191071720", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
