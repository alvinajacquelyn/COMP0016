We aimed to evaluate moment ratios and abbreviated LCI in school-aged children with mild-to-moderate CF lung disease. Methods: Using existing data from three studies we assessed the sensitivity of moment ratios and abbreviated LCIs to (i) detect mild-to-moderate CF lung disease and (ii) detect treatment effects after 4 weeks of hypertonic saline or dornase alfa inhalation. MBW was measured by respiratory mass spectrometry using 4% \"\"sulphur hexafluoride as a tracer gas. Results: Compared to the traditional LCI, moment ratios and abbreviated LCIs were similarly sensitive to detect CF lung disease. Moment ratios consistently demonstrated treatment effects, whereas abbreviated LCIs were less sensitive. Conclusions: Both moment ratios and abbreviated LCI are suitable to differentiate health from disease. Sensitivity is decreased for abbreviated LCIs in interventional studies in mild CF lung disease.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Clinical trials", "Cystic fibrosis", "Multiple breath washout"], "IndexKeywords": ["Administration, Inhalation", "Adolescent", "Breath Tests", "Child", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Cystic Fibrosis", "Deoxyribonuclease I", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Outcome Assessment (Health Care)", "Recombinant Proteins", "Respiratory Function Tests", "Saline Solution, Hypertonic", "Sensitivity and Specificity"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84937630466", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine", "MEDI", "2740"]], "AuthorData": {"22636433100": {"Name": "Stanojevic S.", "AuthorID": "22636433100", "AffiliationID": "60016849", "AffiliationName": "University of Toronto"}, "57210815792": {"Name": "Jensen R.", "AuthorID": "57210815792", "AffiliationID": "60030319", "AffiliationName": "Division of Respiratory Medicine, Department of Pediatrics, Hospital for Sick Children"}, "56471851300": {"Name": "Sundaralingam D.", "AuthorID": "56471851300", "AffiliationID": "60030319", "AffiliationName": "Division of Respiratory Medicine, Department of Pediatrics, Hospital for Sick Children"}, "46661972400": {"Name": "Salazar J.", "AuthorID": "46661972400", "AffiliationID": "60030319", "AffiliationName": "Division of Respiratory Medicine, Department of Pediatrics, Hospital for Sick Children"}, "24467293800": {"Name": "Amin R.", "AuthorID": "24467293800", "AffiliationID": "60016849", "AffiliationName": "University of Toronto"}, "6701725842": {"Name": "Subbarao P.", "AuthorID": "6701725842", "AffiliationID": "60016849", "AffiliationName": "University of Toronto"}, "56214449500": {"Name": "Ratjen F.", "AuthorID": "56214449500", "AffiliationID": "60016849", "AffiliationName": "University of Toronto"}, "55326981200": {"Name": "Yammine S.", "AuthorID": "55326981200", "AffiliationID": "60000908", "AffiliationName": "University Children's Hospital Bern"}, "37098203500": {"Name": "Singer F.", "AuthorID": "37098203500", "AffiliationID": "60002695", "AffiliationName": "University Children's Hospital Zurich"}, "16203004400": {"Name": "Latzin P.", "AuthorID": "16203004400", "AffiliationID": "60006655", "AffiliationName": "University Children's Hospital Basel, UKBB"}, "34770872300": {"Name": "Gustafsson P.", "AuthorID": "34770872300", "AffiliationID": "60052788", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatrics, Central Hospital"}}}
