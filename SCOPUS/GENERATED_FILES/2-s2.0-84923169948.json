In old age, maximal isometric force production (MIF) decreases and BLD increases indicating the need for training interventions to mitigate this impact in seniors. In a cross-sectional approach, we examined age-related differences in MIF and BLD in young (age: 20-30 years) and old adults (age: >65 years). In addition, a randomized-controlled trial was conducted to investigate training-specific effects of resistance vs. balance training on MIF and BLD of the leg extensors in old adults. Subjects were randomly assigned to resistance training (n = 19), balance training (n = 14), or a control group (n = 20). Bilateral heavy-resistance training for the lower extremities was performed for 13 weeks (3 x / week) at 80% of the one repetition maximum. Balance training was conducted using predominately unilateral exercises on wobble boards, soft mats, and uneven surfaces for the same duration. Pre- and post-tests included uni- and bilateral measurements of maximal isometric leg extension force. At baseline, young subjects outperformed older adults in uni- and bilateral MIF (all p < .001; d = 2.61-3.37) and in measures of BLD (p < .001; d = 2.04). We also found significant increases in uni- and bilateral MIF after resistance training (all p < .001, d = 1.8-5.7) and balance training (all p < .05, d = 1.3-3.2). In addition, BLD decreased following resistance (p < .001, d = 3.4) and balance training (p < .001, d = 2.6). It can be concluded that both training regimens resulted in increased MIF and decreased BLD of the leg extensors (HRT-group more than BAL-group), almost reaching the levels of young adults.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Age Factors", "Aged", "Humans", "Leg", "Male", "Muscle Strength", "Muscle, Skeletal", "Postural Balance", "Resistance Training"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84923169948", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"36621715700": {"Name": "Beurskens R.", "AuthorID": "36621715700", "AffiliationID": "60021763", "AffiliationName": "University of Potsdam, Division of Training and Movement Sciences, Research Focus Cognition Sciences"}, "26534649300": {"Name": "Muehlbauer T.", "AuthorID": "26534649300", "AffiliationID": "60021763", "AffiliationName": "University of Potsdam, Division of Training and Movement Sciences, Research Focus Cognition Sciences"}, "15044232800": {"Name": "Granacher U.", "AuthorID": "15044232800", "AffiliationID": "60021763", "AffiliationName": "University of Potsdam, Division of Training and Movement Sciences, Research Focus Cognition Sciences"}, "55851165900": {"Name": "Gollhofer A.", "AuthorID": "55851165900", "AffiliationID": "60025641", "AffiliationName": "Albert-Ludwigs-University of Freiburg, Institute of Sport and Sport Science"}, "7003493917": {"Name": "Cardinale M.", "AuthorID": "7003493917", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Institute of Sports Exercise and Health"}}}
