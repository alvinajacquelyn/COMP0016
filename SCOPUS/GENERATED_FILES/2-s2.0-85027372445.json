The technique relies on upper bound estimates for the number of edge traversals, proved in a different context by Cotar and Limic [Ann. Appl. Probab. 19 (2009) 1972-2007] for finite graphs with edge reinforcement. We apply our new method both to edge- and to vertex-reinforced random walks with super-linear reinforcement on arbitrary infinite connected graphs of bounded degree. We stress that, unlike all previous results for processes with super-linear reinforcement, we make no other assumption on the graphs. For edge-reinforced random walks, we complete the results of Limic and Tarr\u00e8s [Ann. Probab. 35 (2007) 1783-1806] and we settle a conjecture of Sellke (1994) by showing that for any reciprocally summable reinforcement weight function w, the walk traverses a random attracting edge at all large times. For vertex-reinforced random walks, we extend results previously obtained on Z by Volkov [Ann. Probab. 29 (2001) 66-91] and by Basdevant, Schapira and Singh [Ann. Probab. 42 (2014) 527-558], and on complete graphs by Benaim, Raimond and Schapira [ALEA Lat. Am. J. Probab. Math. Stat. 10 (2013) 767-782]. We show that on any infinite connected graph of bounded degree, with reinforcement weight function w taken from a general class of reciprocally summable reinforcement weight functions, the walk traverses two random neighbouring attracting vertices at all large times.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Attraction set", "Bipartite graphs", "Edge-reinforced random walk", "Order statistics", "Rubin's construction", "Superlinear (strong) reinforcement", "Vertex-reinforced random walk"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85027372445", "SubjectAreas": [["Statistics and Probability", "MATH", "2613"], ["Statistics, Probability and Uncertainty", "DECI", "1804"]], "AuthorData": {"24485082800": {"Name": "Cotar C.", "AuthorID": "24485082800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Statistical Science Department, University College London"}, "55766996600": {"Name": "Thacker D.", "AuthorID": "55766996600", "AffiliationID": "60029170", "AffiliationName": "Mathematical Statistics, Centre For Mathematical Sciences, Lund University"}}}
