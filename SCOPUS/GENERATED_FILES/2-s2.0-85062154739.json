This led to the development and current popularity of cementless revision stems, which have shown good results. However, there are still circumstances when cemented femoral revision can provide immediate, reliable fixation with comparatively good results, and this technique remains an important part of the arthroplasty surgeon's armamentarium. In this review, we will discuss the role of cemented stems in revision total hip arthroplasty, focusing on cement-in-cement revision, and impaction bone grafting of the femur.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cemented stems", "femoral revision", "total hip arthroplasty"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85062154739", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Orthopedics and Sports Medicine", "MEDI", "2732"]], "AuthorData": {"57202732543": {"Name": "Roussot M.A.", "AuthorID": "57202732543", "AffiliationID": "60000356", "AffiliationName": "Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, University of Cape Town"}, "24073814800": {"Name": "Vles G.F.", "AuthorID": "24073814800", "AffiliationID": "60027403", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Fellow in Trauma and Orthopaedics, University College Hospital"}, "7203033976": {"Name": "Haddad F.S.", "AuthorID": "7203033976", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Professor of Orthopaedic and Sports Surgery, University College London"}}}
