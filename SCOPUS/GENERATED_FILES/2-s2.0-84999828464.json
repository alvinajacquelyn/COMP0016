Materials and Methods: Pseudocontinuous 3.0-T ASL images were acquired in 100 patients with probable AD; 60 patients with MCI, of whom 12 remained stable, 12 were converted to a diagnosis of AD, and 36 had no follow-up; 100 subjects with SCD; and 26 healthy control subjects. The AD, MCI, and SCD groups were divided into a sex- and age-matched training set (n = 130) and an independent prediction set (n = 130). Standardized perfusion scores adjusted for age and sex (W scores) were computed per voxel for each participant. Training of a support vector machine classifier was performed with diagnostic status and perfusion maps. Discrimination maps were extracted and used for singlesubject classification in the prediction set. Prediction performance was assessed with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis to generate an area under the ROC curve (AUC) and sensitivity and specificity distribution. Results: Single-subject diagnosis in the prediction set by using the discrimination maps yielded excellent performance for AD versus SCD (AUC, 0.96; P <01), good performance for AD versus MCI (AUC, 0.89; P <01), and poor performance for MCI versus SCD (AUC, 0.63; P = .06). Application of the AD versus SCD discrimination map for prediction of MCI subgroups resulted in good performance for patients with MCI diagnosis converted to AD versus subjects with SCD (AUC, 0.84; P <01) and fair performance for patients with MCI diagnosis converted to AD versus those with stable MCI (AUC, 0.71; P >.05). Conclusion: With automated methods, age- and sex-adjusted ASL perfusion maps can be used to classify and predict diagnosis of AD, conversion of MCI to AD, stable MCI, and SCD with good to excellent accuracy and AUC values.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Alzheimer Disease", "Area Under Curve", "Cognitive Dysfunction", "Early Diagnosis", "Female", "Humans", "Machine Learning", "Magnetic Resonance Angiography", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Pattern Recognition, Visual", "Spin Labels"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84999828464", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"57192180298": {"Name": "Collij L.", "AuthorID": "57192180298", "AffiliationID": "60001997", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology and Nuclear Medicine, VU University Medical Centre"}, "57192180582": {"Name": "Heeman F.", "AuthorID": "57192180582", "AffiliationID": "60001997", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology and Nuclear Medicine, VU University Medical Centre"}, "6602116889": {"Name": "Kuijer J.", "AuthorID": "6602116889", "AffiliationID": "60001997", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Medical Technology, VU University Medical Centre"}, "24777266900": {"Name": "Sanz-Arigita E.", "AuthorID": "24777266900", "AffiliationID": "60001997", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology and Nuclear Medicine, VU University Medical Centre"}, "6603412407": {"Name": "Van Berckel B.", "AuthorID": "6603412407", "AffiliationID": "60001997", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology and Nuclear Medicine, VU University Medical Centre"}, "7102989379": {"Name": "Barkhof F.", "AuthorID": "7102989379", "AffiliationID": "60001997", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology and Nuclear Medicine, VU University Medical Centre"}, "6601993367": {"Name": "Wink A.", "AuthorID": "6601993367", "AffiliationID": "60001997", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology and Nuclear Medicine, VU University Medical Centre"}, "40462134000": {"Name": "Ossenkoppele R.", "AuthorID": "40462134000", "AffiliationID": "60001997", "AffiliationName": "Alzheimer Centre, Department of Neurology, VU University Medical Centre"}, "55632416800": {"Name": "Benedictus M.", "AuthorID": "55632416800", "AffiliationID": "60001997", "AffiliationName": "Alzheimer Centre, Department of Neurology, VU University Medical Centre"}, "55620597800": {"Name": "M\u00f6ller C.", "AuthorID": "55620597800", "AffiliationID": "60001997", "AffiliationName": "Alzheimer Centre, Department of Neurology, VU University Medical Centre"}, "55237599500": {"Name": "Verfaillie S.", "AuthorID": "55237599500", "AffiliationID": "60001997", "AffiliationName": "Alzheimer Centre, Department of Neurology, VU University Medical Centre"}, "8548678900": {"Name": "Van Der Flier W.", "AuthorID": "8548678900", "AffiliationID": "60001997", "AffiliationName": "Alzheimer Centre, Department of Neurology, VU University Medical Centre"}, "7007073571": {"Name": "Scheltens P.", "AuthorID": "7007073571", "AffiliationID": "60001997", "AffiliationName": "Alzheimer Centre, Department of Neurology, VU University Medical Centre"}}}
