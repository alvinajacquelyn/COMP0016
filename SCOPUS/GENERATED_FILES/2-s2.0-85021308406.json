Published by Oxford University Press for the Infectious Diseases Society of America.Background. Increasing numbers of children infected perinatally with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are surviving to adolescence and transitioning to adult care, yet there are scarce data on their clinical status at transfer. Methods. We analyzed prospective cohort data from the UK/Ireland national Collaborative HIV Pediatric Study (CHIPS). Clinical status at last pediatric clinic visit prior to transfer was described. Factors associated with higher CD4 cell count and viral load (VL) suppression<400 c/mL among patients on antiretroviral therapy (ART) at transfer were assessed using linear and logistic regression, respectively. Data were matched with the UK HIV Drug Resistance Database (UKHIVDRB) to assess cumulative resistance profiles at transfer. Results. Of 1,907 children followed in CHIPS from 1996 to November 2014, 644 (34%) transferred to adult care: 53% were female, 62% born outside the UK/Ireland, 75% black African. At last pediatric follow-up, median age was 17.4 years [interquartile range 16.5,18.1], 27% had previous AIDS diagnosis, CD4 was 444 cells/mm3 [280, 643], 76% were on ART, 13% off-ART, and 11% ART-naive. Among patients on ART, 74% had VL<400 c/mL. In multivariable analysis, higher CD4 at transfer was associated with younger age, higher CD4 at ART initiation and lower VL at transfer (P \u2264 .001). Predictors of viral suppression include no AIDS diagnosis and later year of transfer (P \u2264 .05). Of 291 patients with resistance data, 82% had resistance to \u22651 drug class, 56% to \u22652 classes and 12% had triple-class resistance. Conclusion. Three-quarters of adolescents were on stable ART at transfer, of whom 74% were virologically suppressed. The prevalence of triple-class resistance was relatively low at 12%.", "AuthorKeywords": ["adolescents", "antiretroviral therapy", "children", "HIV", "UK"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Anti-HIV Agents", "CD4 Lymphocyte Count", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Drug Resistance, Viral", "Female", "HIV", "HIV Infections", "Humans", "Infant", "Infant, Newborn", "Ireland", "Male", "Prospective Studies", "Transition to Adult Care", "United Kingdom", "Viral Load"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85021308406", "SubjectAreas": [["Microbiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2726"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"33867508100": {"Name": "Collins I.J.", "AuthorID": "33867508100", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60003108", "AffiliationName": "MRC Clinical Trials Unit at UCL, Institute of Clinical Trials and Methodology, University College London"}, "57220477489": {"Name": "Gibb D.", "AuthorID": "57220477489", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60003108", "AffiliationName": "MRC Clinical Trials Unit at UCL, Institute of Clinical Trials and Methodology, University College London"}, "19434501100": {"Name": "Judd A.", "AuthorID": "19434501100", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60003108", "AffiliationName": "MRC Clinical Trials Unit at UCL, Institute of Clinical Trials and Methodology, University College London"}, "55432677400": {"Name": "Foster C.", "AuthorID": "55432677400", "AffiliationID": "60111785", "AffiliationName": "Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"}, "57191913967": {"Name": "Tostevin A.", "AuthorID": "57191913967", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Infection and Population Health, University College London"}, "56595739700": {"Name": "Dunn D.", "AuthorID": "56595739700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Infection and Population Health, University College London"}, "7003314073": {"Name": "Tookey P.", "AuthorID": "7003314073", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "7004527320": {"Name": "Riordan A.", "AuthorID": "7004527320", "AffiliationID": "60024857", "AffiliationName": "Alder Hey Children's NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
