This article explores the contexts and implications of the much-used concept of potential in educational discourses. We claim that many of the popular, political and educational uses of the term in relation to childhood have a problematic blind spot: interpersonality, and the necessary coexistence for the concept to be receivable of all children\u2019s \u2018potentials\u2019. Rather than advocating abandoning the term\u2014a futile gesture given its emotive force\u2014we argue that the concept of children\u2019s potential must be profoundly rethought to be workable as a philosophical notion in education. In an era marked by the unspoken assumption that \u2018unlimited potential\u2019 is always a good thing, we argue that it might be necessary to think about the limitations of the notion of individual potential; namely, the moment when it comes into contact with other people\u2019s projects.
