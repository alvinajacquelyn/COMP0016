Relatively few prospective studies have assessed return to sporting activity and impact of gender and age on this. Materials and Methods: Seventy-nine consecutive patients treated with HRA were included. Patients were reviewed clinically and radiologically. Function was assessed using the modified University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) activity score. The Oxford, Harris and WOMAC hip scores were calculated. Results: Average age at the time of surgery was 54.9 years (range 34.5-73.6 years). Average preoperative and postoperative UCLA scores were 4 and 7.6 respectively. Patients were involved in 2 (0-4) sporting activities preoperatively and 2 (0-5) postoperatively. Preoperative and postoperative Oxford Hip Scores, Harris Hip Score and WOMAC scores were 40, 46 and 51 and 16, 94 and 3 respectively (P < 0.0001). Patients returned to sports at an average of 3 months postoperatively. Conclusion: Patients were able to return to sports by 3 months and perform the same number of activities at preoperative intensity. Activity levels are maintained up to the medium term with few complications.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Activity", "arthritis", "gender", "hip", "hip", "replacement", "resurfacing", "sport MeSH terms: Arthroplasty"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84948390273", "SubjectAreas": [["Orthopedics and Sports Medicine", "MEDI", "2732"]], "AuthorData": {"24482367200": {"Name": "Sandiford N.", "AuthorID": "24482367200", "AffiliationID": "100666954", "AffiliationName": "Limb Reconstruction Unit, London Hip Unit"}, "6602542456": {"Name": "Muirhead-Allwood S.K.", "AuthorID": "6602542456", "AffiliationID": "60024067", "AffiliationName": "Limb Reconstruction and Tumor Unit, Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital"}, "8281611700": {"Name": "Skinner J.A.", "AuthorID": "8281611700", "AffiliationID": "60024067", "AffiliationName": "Limb Reconstruction and Tumor Unit, Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital"}}}
