We develop a general empirical framework for relating any neural observable to choice prediction and propose a means of benchmarking their predictive power. In a previous study, measurements of neural activity were made while subjects considered consumer goods. Here, we find that neural activity predicts choice behavior with the degree of stochasticity in choice related to the cardinality of the measurement. However, we also find that current methods have a significant degree of measurement error which severely limits their inferential and predictive performance.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Choice prediction", "Measurement error", "Stochastic choice", "Valuation"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85063154965", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuropsychology and Physiological Psychology", "PSYC", "3206"], ["Business, Management and Accounting (miscellaneous)", "BUSI", "1401"], ["Experimental and Cognitive Psychology", "PSYC", "3205"], ["Applied Psychology", "PSYC", "3202"], ["Economics, Econometrics and Finance (miscellaneous)", "ECON", "2001"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"], ["Behavioral Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2802"]], "AuthorData": {"56006216300": {"Name": "Webb R.", "AuthorID": "56006216300", "AffiliationID": "60112541, 60016849", "AffiliationName": "Rotman School of Management, University of Toronto"}, "7103255374": {"Name": "Levy I.", "AuthorID": "7103255374", "AffiliationID": "60017994", "AffiliationName": "Department of Comparative Medicine, Yale School of Medicine"}, "35364370400": {"Name": "Lazzaro S.", "AuthorID": "35364370400", "AffiliationID": "60109771, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, University College London"}, "7101911123": {"Name": "Rutledge R.", "AuthorID": "7101911123", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60084279", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, University College London"}, "6603900600": {"Name": "Glimcher P.", "AuthorID": "6603900600", "AffiliationID": "60024541, 60021784", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience and Physiology, Langone School of Medicine, New York University"}}}
