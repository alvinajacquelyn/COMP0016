Based on a radial golden-angle acquisition trajectory, our method enables a multidimensional self-gating signal to be extracted from the k-space data for more accurate motion representation. The k-space radial profiles are evenly divided into a number of overlapping groups based on their radial angles. MA is then used to simultaneously learn and align the low dimensional manifolds of all groups, and embed them into a common manifold. In the manifold, k-space profiles that represent similar respiratory positions are close to each other. Image reconstruction is performed by combining radial profiles with evenly distributed angles that are close in the manifold. Our method was evaluated on both 2-D and 3-D synthetic and in vivo data sets. On the synthetic data sets, our method achieved high correlation with the ground truth in terms of image intensity and virtual navigator values. Using the in vivo data, compared with a state-of-the-art approach based on the center of k-space gating, our method was able to make use of much richer profile data for self-gating, resulting in statistically significantly better quantitative measurements in terms of organ sharpness and image gradient entropy.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reconstruction", "manifold alignment (MA)", "MRI self-gating", "respiratory motion"], "IndexKeywords": ["Low-dimensional manifolds", "Manifold alignments", "Overlapping groups", "Quantitative measurement", "Respiratory motions", "Self-gating", "State-of-the-art approach", "Temporal resolution", "Abdomen", "Humans", "Image Enhancement", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Respiration", "Retrospective Studies"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85018517296", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Radiological and Ultrasound Technology", "HEAL", "3614"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"57133952200": {"Name": "Chen X.", "AuthorID": "57133952200", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Division of Imaging Sciences and Biomedical Engineering, King's College London"}, "56224406300": {"Name": "Balfour D.R.", "AuthorID": "56224406300", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Division of Imaging Sciences and Biomedical Engineering, King's College London"}, "7201783960": {"Name": "Marsden P.K.", "AuthorID": "7201783960", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Division of Imaging Sciences and Biomedical Engineering, King's College London"}, "7005446767": {"Name": "Reader A.J.", "AuthorID": "7005446767", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Division of Imaging Sciences and Biomedical Engineering, King's College London"}, "35337695700": {"Name": "Prieto C.", "AuthorID": "35337695700", "AffiliationID": "60029681", "AffiliationName": "Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile, Escuela de Ingenieria"}, "24344292700": {"Name": "King A.P.", "AuthorID": "24344292700", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Division of Imaging Sciences and Biomedical Engineering, King's College London"}, "57203046078": {"Name": "Usman M.", "AuthorID": "57203046078", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "55786845100": {"Name": "Baumgartner C.F.", "AuthorID": "55786845100", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Biomedical Image Analysis Group, Imperial College London"}}}
