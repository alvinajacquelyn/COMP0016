All rights reserved.Objective: Alexithymia has been considered a personality trait characterized by difficulties identifying and describing feelings and an externally oriented thinking style. A high rate of alexithymia is reported among patients with psychiatric and psychosomatic disorders. In this review, the authors examined the literature regarding the prevalence and importance of alexithymia in patients with neurological disorders. Methods: A systematic search of the computerized databases MEDLINE and PubMed was conducted in order to identify papers on alexithymia in neurological disease. Key search terms used included \u201ctraumatic brain injury,\u201d \u201chead trauma,\u201d \u201chead injury,\u201d \u201cstroke,\u201d \u201cepilepsy,\u201d \u201cbrain tumor,\u201d \u201cmultiple sclerosis,\u201d \u201cAlzheimer\u2019s disease,\u201d \u201cParkinson\u2019s disease,\u201d \u201cHuntington\u2019s disease,\u201d \u201cGilles de la Tourette syndrome,\u201d \u201cdystonia,\u201d \u201cpsychogenic movement disorders,\u201d \u201cfunctional movement disorders,\u201d \u201cnonepileptic attacks,\u201d and \u201cnonepileptic seizures.\u201d These search terms were paired with \u201calexithymia.\u201d Results: Alexithymia seems to be a common feature of neurological disease, with most evidence available for patients with traumatic brain injury, stroke, and epilepsy. However, it is not clear how independent it is from affective disorders such as depression and anxiety, which are themselves very common in neurological conditions. Conclusions: Identification of alexithymia could be relevant for prognosis and therapeutic decisions in patients with neurological disease and is certainly worthy of further study. Tools with which to measure alexithymia and delineation from affective disorders and apathy are important methodological issues for future work.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Affective Symptoms", "Humans", "Nervous System Diseases"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84933559610", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"36167347400": {"Name": "Ricciardi L.", "AuthorID": "36167347400", "AffiliationID": "60011576", "AffiliationName": "Dept.Of clinical and experimental medicine, University of Messina"}, "36439073200": {"Name": "Demartini B.", "AuthorID": "36439073200", "AffiliationID": "60030318, 60016182", "AffiliationName": "Dept.
