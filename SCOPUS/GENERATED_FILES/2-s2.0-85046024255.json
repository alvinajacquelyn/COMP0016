We tested 57 participants (22 interpreters, 23 translators and 12 controls) while respeaking 5-minute videos with two parameters: speech rate (fast/slow) and number of speakers (one/many). Having measured the quality of the respeaking performance using two independent methods: the NER model and rating, we found that interpreters consistently achieved higher scores than the other two groups. The findings are discussed in the context of transfer of skills, expert performance and respeaking training.", "AuthorKeywords": ["audiovisual translation", "competence; NER", "interpreting", "live subtitling", "Respeaking"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85046024255", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["Language and Linguistics", "ARTS", "1203"], ["Linguistics and Language", "SOCI", "3310"]], "AuthorData": {"54416458200": {"Name": "Szarkowska A.", "AuthorID": "54416458200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Translation Studies, University College London"}, "57190034357": {"Name": "Dutka \u0141.", "AuthorID": "57190034357", "AffiliationID": "60110610, 60013756", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Applied Linguistics, University of Warsaw"}, "56018914300": {"Name": "Pilipczuk O.", "AuthorID": "56018914300", "AffiliationID": "60110610, 60013756", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Applied Linguistics, University of Warsaw"}, "55258716700": {"Name": "Krejtz K.", "AuthorID": "55258716700", "AffiliationID": "60031620", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, SWPS University of Social Sciences and Humanities"}}}
