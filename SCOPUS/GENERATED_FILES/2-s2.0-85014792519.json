Surprisingly, the fundamental question of how memories of complex temporal dynamics of movement are stored across the brain is still unresolved. This review outlines the constraints that determine whether and how the timing of skilled movements is represented in the central nervous system and introduces different computational and neural mechanisms that can be harnessed for temporal encoding. It concludes by proposing a schematic model of how these different mechanisms may complement and interact with each other in fast feedback loops to achieve skilled motor timing.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cortico-subcortical loops", "Modular representation", "Motor timing", "Sequence learning", "Spatiotemporal control"], "IndexKeywords": ["Brain", "Humans", "Learning", "Movement", "Psychomotor Performance"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85014792519", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"35303078100": {"Name": "Kornysheva K.", "AuthorID": "35303078100", "AffiliationID": "60025779", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, Bangor University"}}}
