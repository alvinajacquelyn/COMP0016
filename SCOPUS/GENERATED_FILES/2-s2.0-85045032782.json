Drawing on an inductive analysis of 20 in-depth interviews with Israeli migrant mothers in the United Kingdom who constitute a specific fraction of the GMC, this article examines families\u2019 identity constructions and how these shape their educational practices. The participants constitute a growing phenomenon\u2013highly educated, mobile middle-class families who live and move around the world, and position themselves using global frames of references. We emphasise how country of origin acts as a symbolic object in the cultivation of their children\u2019s identity and how different types of attachment to \u2018home nation\u2019 are perceived as offering valuable capital for the GMC. The article therefore contributes much-needed empirical analyses on education strategies within the GMC, and challenges the suggestion that critical to the definition of the GMC is that they are \u2018rootless\u2019.", "AuthorKeywords": ["cultivation strategies", "Global middle classes", "national identity"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85045032782", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"]], "AuthorData": {"8667142200": {"Name": "Yemini M.", "AuthorID": "8667142200", "AffiliationID": "60005681", "AffiliationName": "School of Education, Tel Aviv University"}, "13613645600": {"Name": "Maxwell C.", "AuthorID": "13613645600", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Education, University College London"}}}
