Iterative reconstructions can incorporate regularization terms to improve the image quality of periodically rotated overlapping parallel lines with enhanced reconstruction (PROPELLER) MRI. However, the large amount of calculations required for full FOV iterative reconstructions has posed a huge computational challenge for clinical usage. By subdividing the entire problem into smaller rFOVs, the iterative reconstruction can be accelerated on a desktop with a single graphic processing unit (GPU). Methods: This rFOV strategy divides the iterative reconstruction into blocks, based on the blockdiagonal dominant structure. A near real-time reconstruction system was developed for the clinical MR unit, and parallel computing was implemented using the object-oriented model. In addition, the Toeplitz method was implemented on the GPU to reduce the time required for full interpolation. Using the data acquired from the PROPELLER MRI, the reconstructed images were then saved in the digital imaging and communications in medicine format. Results: The proposed rFOV reconstruction reduced the gridding time by 97%, as the total iteration time was 3 s even with multiple processes running. A phantom study showed that the structure similarity index for rFOV reconstruction was statistically superior to conventional density compensation (p >0.001). In vivo study validated the increased signal-to-noise ratio, which is over four times higher than with density compensation. Image sharpness index was improved using the regularized reconstruction implemented. Conclusions: The rFOV strategy permits near real-time iterative reconstruction to improve the image quality of PROPELLER images. Substantial improvements in image quality metrics were validated in the experiments. The concept of rFOV reconstruction may potentially be applied to other kinds of iterative reconstructions for shortened reconstruction duration.", "AuthorKeywords": ["iterative reconstruction", "PROPELLER", "rFOV reconstruction", "split-Bregman method", "Toeplitz method", "total variation denoising"], "IndexKeywords": ["Clinical environments", "Computational challenges", "De-noising", "Graphic processing unit(GPU)", "Image quality metrics", "Iterative reconstruction", "Split bregman methods", "Toeplitz", "Computer Graphics", "Humans", "Image Processing, Computer-Assisted", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Phantoms, Imaging", "Rotation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84941340335", "SubjectAreas": [["Biophysics", "BIOC", "1304"], ["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"56768277200": {"Name": "Lin J.M.", "AuthorID": "56768277200", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, University of Cambridge"}, "35375530400": {"Name": "Gillard J.H.", "AuthorID": "35375530400", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, University of Cambridge"}, "24473404800": {"Name": "Patterson A.J.", "AuthorID": "24473404800", "AffiliationID": "60016390", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Cambridge University Hospitals, NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7102446723": {"Name": "Graves M.J.", "AuthorID": "7102446723", "AffiliationID": "60016390", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Cambridge University Hospitals, NHS Foundation Trust"}, "35168673100": {"Name": "Chang H.C.", "AuthorID": "35168673100", "AffiliationID": "60103563, 60006541", "AffiliationName": "Department of Diagnostic Radiology, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, University of Hong Kong, LG3, Hong Kong Jockey Club for Interdisciplinary Research"}}}
