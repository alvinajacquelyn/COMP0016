All rights reserved.OBJECTIVES: Antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) is a well-recognized adverse reaction to oral penicillins. This review analyzed the literature to determine the incidence of AAD following amoxicillin, amoxicillin/ clavulanate, and penicillin V oral therapy in pediatric clinical trials. METHODS: An advanced search was conducted in MEDLINE and Embase databases for articles in any language reporting the incidence of AAD following oral penicillin therapy for any indicated infection in children (0-17 years). The search was limited to clinical trials. Articles were excluded if treatment was related to chronic conditions, involved concomitant antimicrobials, or if the dose or number of patients was not specified. RESULTS: Four hundred thirty-five articles relating to clinical trials were identified (307 from Embase; 128 from MEDLINE). Thirty-five articles reporting on 42 studies were included for analysis. The indications included acute otitis media, sinusitis, pharyngitis, and pneumonia. Thirty-three trials reported on amoxicillin/clavulanate, 6 on amoxicillin, and 3 on penicillin V. In total, the 42 trials included 7729 children who were treated with an oral penicillin. On average, 17.2% had AAD. Data were pooled for each penicillin. The AAD incidence was 19.8% for amoxicillin/clavulanate, 8.1% for amoxicillin, and 1.2% for penicillin V. The amoxicillin/clavulanate data were analyzed according to formulation: pooled-average. The incidence of ADD was 24.6% for the 4:1 formulation, 12.8% for the 7:1 formulation, 19.0% for the 8:1 formulation, and 20.2% for the 14:1 formulation. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate substantially increased incidence of AAD following use of amoxicillin/clavulanate, compared to use of amoxicillin and penicillin V, as well as varying AAD rates with different amoxicillin/clavulanate formulations. These findings warrant consideration when prescribing. The underlying mechanisms of AAD in children remain unclear.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Amoxicillin", "Amoxicillin/clavulanate", "Antibiotic", "Antibiotic-associated diarrhea", "Oral penicillins", "Penicillin V"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85011253033", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"57188555318": {"Name": "Kuehn J.", "AuthorID": "57188555318", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "57203106412": {"Name": "Sharland M.", "AuthorID": "57203106412", "AffiliationID": "60029329", "AffiliationName": "Paediatric Infectious Diseases Research Group, St George\u2019s University of London"}, "56118358000": {"Name": "Ismael Z.", "AuthorID": "56118358000", "AffiliationID": "60177635", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Pharmaceutical Science & Department of Chemistry, King\u2019s College, University of London"}, "57203079576": {"Name": "Long P.F.", "AuthorID": "57203079576", "AffiliationID": "60177635", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Pharmaceutical Science & Department of Chemistry, King\u2019s College, University of London"}, "54895018200": {"Name": "Barker C.I.S.", "AuthorID": "54895018200", "AffiliationID": "60029329", "AffiliationName": "Paediatric Infectious Diseases Research Group, St George\u2019s University of London"}}}
