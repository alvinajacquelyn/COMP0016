However, it was shown that ECG and subsequently Instantaneous Heart Rate can be heavily corrupted by artefacts which have to be manually removed. This work analyses a set of features to assess their sensitivity to normal and corrupted ECG in newborns. Specifically, the IHR signal is obtained by detecting R-Peaks using the Pan-Tompkins algorithm. Four features are extracted from both ECG and IHR signal using various temporal resolutions to discriminate normal and corrupted signal. The performance of these features in discrimination is then assessed using statistical tests.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Algorithms", "Artifacts", "Electrocardiography", "Heart Rate", "Humans", "Infant, Newborn"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84953313125", "SubjectAreas": [["Signal Processing", "COMP", "1711"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"], ["Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition", "COMP", "1707"], ["Health Informatics", "MEDI", "2718"]], "AuthorData": {"55796414600": {"Name": "Gholinezhadasnefestani S.", "AuthorID": "55796414600", "AffiliationID": "60113732, 60025160", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Neonatal Brain Research Group, Irish Center for Fetal and Neonatal Translational Research (INFANT), University College Cork"}, "12143283200": {"Name": "Temko A.", "AuthorID": "12143283200", "AffiliationID": "60113732, 60025160", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Neonatal Brain Research Group, Irish Center for Fetal and Neonatal Translational Research (INFANT), University College Cork"}, "7003406304": {"Name": "Lightbody G.", "AuthorID": "7003406304", "AffiliationID": "60113732, 60025160", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Neonatal Brain Research Group, Irish Center for Fetal and Neonatal Translational Research (INFANT), University College Cork"}, "36832339300": {"Name": "Marnane W.", "AuthorID": "36832339300", "AffiliationID": "60113732, 60025160", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Neonatal Brain Research Group, Irish Center for Fetal and Neonatal Translational Research (INFANT), University College Cork"}, "15924307900": {"Name": "Stevenson N.", "AuthorID": "15924307900", "AffiliationID": "60113732, 60025160", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatrics and Child Health, Neonatal Brain Research Group, INFANT Center, University College Cork"}, "6602292136": {"Name": "Boylan G.", "AuthorID": "6602292136", "AffiliationID": "60113732, 60025160", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatrics and Child Health, Neonatal Brain Research Group, INFANT Center, University College Cork"}}}
