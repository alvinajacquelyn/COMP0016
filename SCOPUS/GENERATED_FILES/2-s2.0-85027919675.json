Biopsy revealed low-grade pituitary carcinoma. PET/CT scan showed multiple foci of increased Ga DOTATATE activity including pituitary and posterior fossa lesions. After 3 fractions of Lu DOTATATE therapy, the tumor remained stable over 4 years on MRI and Ga DOTATATE scans. This case illustrates the benefit of Ga DOTATATE PET/CT in malignant pituitary disease to assess potential for somatostatin receptor therapy with Lu DOTATATE and monitor treatment.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Carcinoma", "Humans", "Male", "Multimodal Imaging", "Octreotide", "Organometallic Compounds", "Pituitary Neoplasms", "Positron-Emission Tomography", "Radiopharmaceuticals", "Tomography, X-Ray Computed"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85027919675", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"37021676300": {"Name": "Novruzov F.", "AuthorID": "37021676300", "AffiliationID": "60027403, 60019953, 60022148, 60090043", "AffiliationName": "From the *Institute of Nuclear Medicine, University College Hospital, United Kingdom; \u2020Azerbaijan National Center of Oncology, Azerbaijan; and \u2021Division of Neuropathology, Institute of Neurology, UCL"}, "8375562300": {"Name": "Aliyev J.A.", "AuthorID": "8375562300", "AffiliationID": "60027403, 60019953, 60022148, 60090043", "AffiliationName": "From the *Institute of Nuclear Medicine, University College Hospital, United Kingdom; \u2020Azerbaijan National Center of Oncology, Azerbaijan; and \u2021Division of Neuropathology, Institute of Neurology, UCL"}, "54083212800": {"Name": "Jaunmuktane Z.", "AuthorID": "54083212800", "AffiliationID": "60027403, 60019953, 60022148, 60090043", "AffiliationName": "From the *Institute of Nuclear Medicine, University College Hospital, United Kingdom; \u2020Azerbaijan National Center of Oncology, Azerbaijan; and \u2021Division of Neuropathology, Institute of Neurology, UCL"}, "7005791371": {"Name": "Bomanji J.B.", "AuthorID": "7005791371", "AffiliationID": "60027403, 60019953, 60022148, 60090043", "AffiliationName": "From the *Institute of Nuclear Medicine, University College Hospital, United Kingdom; \u2020Azerbaijan National Center of Oncology, Azerbaijan; and \u2021Division of Neuropathology, Institute of Neurology, UCL"}, "8960246500": {"Name": "Kayani I.", "AuthorID": "8960246500", "AffiliationID": "60027403, 60019953, 60022148, 60090043", "AffiliationName": "From the *Institute of Nuclear Medicine, University College Hospital, United Kingdom; \u2020Azerbaijan National Center of Oncology, Azerbaijan; and \u2021Division of Neuropathology, Institute of Neurology, UCL"}}}
