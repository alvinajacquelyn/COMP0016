Design: Prospective, longitudinal, observational study. Participants: Consecutive patients with drusen and pigmentary changes in the study eye and exudative neovascular AMD in the fellow eye. Methods: In this prospective observational study, participants underwent spectral-domain OCTA (AngioVue; Optovue, Inc, Fremont, CA), clinical examination, and structural OCT at baseline and 6-month intervals for 2 years. OCT angiography images were exported for custom processing to remove projection artifact and calculate CNV vessel area. Main Outcome Measures: Rate of developing exudation in eyes with and without nonexudative CNV as detected by OCTA on regular follow-up. Results: Sixty-three study participants were followed up every 6 months and 48 completed the 2-year study. Mean age was 78 years and 60.3% were female. On the baseline visit, 5 eyes (7.9%) were found to have nonexudative CNV by OCTA, and 3 of them demonstrated exudation. Of 58 eyes with a normal OCTA on baseline visit, 5 eyes developed nonexudative CNV during a follow-up visit. All 5 of these nonexudative CNV went on to develop exudation in subsequent visits. Overall, 8 of the 10 eyes with nonexudative CNV developed exudation with a mean time of 8 months and mean CNV area growth rate of 20% per month (P = 0.014, exponential model). Initiation of antiangiogenic treatment halted their growth. In comparison, exudation occurred in only 6 of the 53 eyes (11%) that lacked a precursor nonexudative CNV. Cox proportional hazard analysis showed that having nonexudative CNV detected was associated with an 18.1-fold increase in the rate of exudation subsequently developing (P < 0.0001). Conclusions: Nonexudative CNV frequently is detected by OCTA in the fellow eyes of those with exudative CNV. These lesions carry a high risk of exudation developing within the first year after detection and could benefit from close monitoring. The high risk of progression may justify prophylactic treatment; further studies are needed.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85069889788", "SubjectAreas": [["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"]], "AuthorData": {"57205269144": {"Name": "Bailey S.T.", "AuthorID": "57205269144", "AffiliationID": "60016733", "AffiliationName": "Casey Eye Institute, Oregon Health & Science University"}, "57210199928": {"Name": "Thaware O.", "AuthorID": "57210199928", "AffiliationID": "60016733", "AffiliationName": "Casey Eye Institute, Oregon Health & Science University"}, "56441774900": {"Name": "Wang J.", "AuthorID": "56441774900", "AffiliationID": "60016733", "AffiliationName": "Casey Eye Institute, Oregon Health & Science University"}, "57195265940": {"Name": "Hagag A.M.", "AuthorID": "57195265940", "AffiliationID": "60016733", "AffiliationName": "Casey Eye Institute, Oregon Health & Science University"}, "36193533700": {"Name": "Zhang X.", "AuthorID": "36193533700", "AffiliationID": "60016733", "AffiliationName": "Casey Eye Institute, Oregon Health & Science University"}, "57205269409": {"Name": "Flaxel C.J.", "AuthorID": "57205269409", "AffiliationID": "60016733", "AffiliationName": "Casey Eye Institute, Oregon Health & Science University"}, "57206433459": {"Name": "Lauer A.K.", "AuthorID": "57206433459", "AffiliationID": "60016733", "AffiliationName": "Casey Eye Institute, Oregon Health & Science University"}, "12774344900": {"Name": "Hwang T.S.", "AuthorID": "12774344900", "AffiliationID": "60016733", "AffiliationName": "Casey Eye Institute, Oregon Health & Science University"}, "7403225315": {"Name": "Lin P.", "AuthorID": "7403225315", "AffiliationID": "60016733", "AffiliationName": "Casey Eye Institute, Oregon Health & Science University"}, "57209707801": {"Name": "Huang D.", "AuthorID": "57209707801", "AffiliationID": "60016733", "AffiliationName": "Casey Eye Institute, Oregon Health & Science University"}, "57207085446": {"Name": "Jia Y.", "AuthorID": "57207085446", "AffiliationID": "60016733", "AffiliationName": "Casey Eye Institute, Oregon Health & Science University"}}}
