By positing that the individual components of the mixed signals as well as the corresponding side information signals follow a joint Gaussian mixture model, we characterise necessary and sufficient conditions for reliable separation in the asymptotic regime of low-noise as a function of the geometry of the underlying signals and their interaction. In particular, we show that if the subspaces spanned by the innovation components of the source signals with respect to the side information signals have zero intersection, provided that we observe a certain number of measurements from the mixture, then we can reliably separate the sources, otherwise we cannot. We also provide a number of numerical results on synthetic data that validate our theoretical findings.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Asymptotic regimes", "Gaussian Mixture Model", "Individual components", "Linear superpositions", "Numerical results", "Separation problems", "Side information", "Synthetic data"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85063104399", "SubjectAreas": [["Information Systems", "COMP", "1710"], ["Signal Processing", "COMP", "1711"]], "AuthorData": {"57205378931": {"Name": "Sabetsarvestani Z.", "AuthorID": "57205378931", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "54380389800": {"Name": "Kiraly F.", "AuthorID": "54380389800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "57210526627": {"Name": "Rodrigues M.", "AuthorID": "57210526627", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "24802572900": {"Name": "Renna F.", "AuthorID": "24802572900", "AffiliationID": "60007249, 60017375", "AffiliationName": "Instituto de Telecomunica\u00e7\u00f5es, Faculdade de Ci\u00eancias da Universidade Do Porto"}}}
