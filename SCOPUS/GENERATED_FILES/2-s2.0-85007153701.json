In order to achieve this, the thermal, dynamic and magnetic properties of the solar plasma must be probed over many scale heights and at intrinsic scales, requiring the use of multi wavelength spectroscopy and spectropolarimetry at high spatial, spectral and temporal resolution. In this paper we describe some of the over-arching science questions that EST will address and briefly outline the main features of the proposed telescope design and the associated instrumentation package.", "AuthorKeywords": ["High resolution imaging", "High resolution spectroscopy", "Solar spectropolarimetry", "Solar telescopes"], "IndexKeywords": ["High-resolution imaging", "High-resolution spectroscopy", "Instrumentation packages", "Multi-wavelength spectroscopy", "Solar magnetic fields", "Solar telescope", "Spectropolarimetry", "Temporal resolution"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85007153701", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"7201477393": {"Name": "Matthews S.A.", "AuthorID": "7201477393", "AffiliationID": "60084281", "AffiliationName": "UCL-Mullard Space Science Laboratory"}, "55843347000": {"Name": "Collados M.", "AuthorID": "55843347000", "AffiliationID": "60011125", "AffiliationName": "Instituto de Astrofisica de Canarias"}, "56235607700": {"Name": "Mathioudakis M.", "AuthorID": "56235607700", "AffiliationID": "60029738", "AffiliationName": "Astrophysics Research Centre, School of Mathematics and Physics, Queen's University Belfast"}, "7006627750": {"Name": "Erdelyi R.", "AuthorID": "7006627750", "AffiliationID": "60027811, 60022319", "AffiliationName": "Debrecen Heliophysical Observatory (DHO), Research Centre for Astronomy and Earth Sciences, Hungarian Academy of Science"}}}
