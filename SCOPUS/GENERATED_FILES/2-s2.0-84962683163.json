Here we demonstrate that subjective estimates of uncertainty predict the dynamics of subjective and physiological stress responses. Subjects learned a probabilistic mapping between visual stimuli and electric shocks. Salivary cortisol confirmed that our stressor elicited changes in endocrine activity. Using a hierarchical Bayesian learning model, we quantified the relationship between the different forms of subjective task uncertainty and acute stress responses. Subjective stress, pupil diameter and skin conductance all tracked the evolution of irreducible uncertainty. We observed a coupling between emotional and somatic state, with subjective and physiological tuning to uncertainty tightly correlated. Furthermore, the uncertainty tuning of subjective and physiological stress predicted individual task performance, consistent with an adaptive role for stress in learning under uncertain threat. Our finding that stress responses are tuned to environmental uncertainty provides new insight into their generation and likely adaptive function.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Bayes Theorem", "Humans", "Learning", "Models, Biological", "Stress, Psychological", "Task Performance and Analysis", "Uncertainty"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84962683163", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"55901527400": {"Name": "De Berker A.O.", "AuthorID": "55901527400", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60084279, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "55342655500": {"Name": "Marshall L.", "AuthorID": "55342655500", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Sobell Department of Motor Neuroscience and Movement Disorders, UCL Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "57218666851": {"Name": "Bestmann S.", "AuthorID": "57218666851", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Sobell Department of Motor Neuroscience and Movement Disorders, UCL Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "7101911123": {"Name": "Rutledge R.B.", "AuthorID": "7101911123", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60122566", "AffiliationName": "Max Planck University College, London Centre for Computational Psychiatry and Ageing Research"}, "24068820700": {"Name": "Mathys C.", "AuthorID": "24068820700", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60122566", "AffiliationName": "Max Planck University College, London Centre for Computational Psychiatry and Ageing Research"}, "55027467100": {"Name": "Dolan R.J.", "AuthorID": "55027467100", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60122566", "AffiliationName": "Max Planck University College, London Centre for Computational Psychiatry and Ageing Research"}, "55891914200": {"Name": "Cross G.F.", "AuthorID": "55891914200", "AffiliationID": "60021923", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Biochemistry, King's College Hospital"}}}
