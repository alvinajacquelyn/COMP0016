We determined the concentrations of biomarkers that discriminate cases from controls and combinations that predict the progression to dementia in a Brazilian cohort. Methods: Concentrations of amyloid-beta peptide (A\u03b21-42), total tau (T-tau), and 181Thr-phosphorylated-tau (P-tau) were determined in CSF samples from 184 older adults (68 mild cognitive impairment, 41 AD, 34 non-AD cognitive impairment, and 41 controls) by the INNO-BIA AlzBio3 assay. Results: Cutoff values discriminating AD from controls are as follows: A\u03b21-42: 416.0 pg/mL (sensitivity [SE]: 83%, specificity (SP): 70%); T-tau: 76.7 pg/mL (SE: 82%, SP: 67%); P-tau: 36.1 pg/mL (SE: 83%, SP: 49%); A\u03b21-42/P-tau <9.53 (SE: 88%, SP: 78%); and A\u03b21-42/T-tau <4.13 (SE: 80%; SP: 80%). Combining values A\u03b21-42 <416.5 pg/mL and A\u03b21-42/P-tau <9.5 best predicted the conversion in 2 years (Cox regression: hazard ratio 7.24 [2.09-25.06], P =.002, SE: 74%, Sp: 73%). Discussion: Our findings are in line with most of the available evidence in this field; yet, our cutoff values are different from those derived from other laboratories.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alzheimer's disease", "Amyloid-\u03b2", "Biomarkers", "Cerebrospinal fluid", "Mild cognitive impairment", "Tau protein"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84949551565", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"6603840032": {"Name": "Forlenza O.", "AuthorID": "6603840032", "AffiliationID": "60008088", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Neuroscience (LIM-27), Department and Institute of Psychiatry, Faculty of Medicine, University of Sao Paulo"}, "6603911368": {"Name": "Radanovic M.", "AuthorID": "6603911368", "AffiliationID": "60008088", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Neuroscience (LIM-27), Department and Institute of Psychiatry, Faculty of Medicine, University of Sao Paulo"}, "6506267691": {"Name": "Talib L.", "AuthorID": "6506267691", "AffiliationID": "60008088", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Neuroscience (LIM-27), Department and Institute of Psychiatry, Faculty of Medicine, University of Sao Paulo"}, "56588793000": {"Name": "Aprahamian I.", "AuthorID": "56588793000", "AffiliationID": "60008088", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Neuroscience (LIM-27), Department and Institute of Psychiatry, Faculty of Medicine, University of Sao Paulo"}, "34569066200": {"Name": "Gattaz W.", "AuthorID": "34569066200", "AffiliationID": "60008088", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Neuroscience (LIM-27), Department and Institute of Psychiatry, Faculty of Medicine, University of Sao Paulo"}, "56210884900": {"Name": "Diniz B.", "AuthorID": "56210884900", "AffiliationID": "60030074", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mental Health, Faculty of Medicine, Federal University of Minas Gerais"}, "6701454676": {"Name": "Zetterberg H.", "AuthorID": "6701454676", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Neurology"}}}
