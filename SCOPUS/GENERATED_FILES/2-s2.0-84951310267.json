The objective of this investigation was to assess quantitatively the differences in the QTc prolonging effects of moxifloxacin between cynomolgus monkeys, dogs and humans. The impact of interspecies differences is also illustrated for a new candidate molecule. Experimental Approach: Pharmacokinetic data and ECG recordings from pre-clinical protocols in monkeys and dogs and from a phase I trial in healthy subjects were identified for the purpose of this analysis. A previously established Bayesian model describing the combined effect of heart rate, circadian variation and drug effect on the QT interval was used to describe the pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationships. The probability of a \u226510 ms increase in QT was derived as measure of the pro-arrhythmic effect. Key Results: For moxifloxacin, the concentrations associated with a 50% probability of QT prolongation \u226510 ms (Cp50) varied from 20.3 to 6.4 and 2.6 \u03bcM in dogs, monkeys and humans, respectively. For NCE05, these values were 0.4 \u03bcM vs 2.0 \u03bcM for monkeys and humans, respectively. Conclusions and Implications: Our findings reveal significant interspecies differences in the QT-prolonging effect of moxifloxacin. In addition to the dissimilarity in pharmacokinetics across species, it is likely that differences in pharmacodynamics also play an important role. It appears that, regardless of the animal model used, a translation function is needed to predict concentration-effect relationships in humans.", "AuthorKeywords": ["cardiovascular safety", "drug development", "interspecies differences", "PKPD modelling", "QT interval prolongation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Algorithms", "Animals", "Anti-Bacterial Agents", "Clinical Trials, Phase I as Topic", "Dogs", "Electrocardiography", "Female", "Fluoroquinolones", "Humans", "Long QT Syndrome", "Macaca fascicularis", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic", "Risk Assessment", "Species Specificity", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84951310267", "SubjectAreas": [["Biotechnology", "BIOC", "1305"], ["Molecular Medicine", "BIOC", "1313"], ["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"], ["Pharmaceutical Science", "PHAR", "3003"], ["Organic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1605"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"55913017600": {"Name": "Dubois V.", "AuthorID": "55913017600", "AffiliationID": "60019816", "AffiliationName": "Leiden Academic Centre for Drug Research, Division of Pharmacology, Leiden University"}, "56916050300": {"Name": "De Witte W.", "AuthorID": "56916050300", "AffiliationID": "60019816", "AffiliationName": "Leiden Academic Centre for Drug Research, Division of Pharmacology, Leiden University"}, "7101741871": {"Name": "Danhof M.", "AuthorID": "7101741871", "AffiliationID": "60019816", "AffiliationName": "Leiden Academic Centre for Drug Research, Division of Pharmacology, Leiden University"}, "8536932300": {"Name": "Della Pasqua O.", "AuthorID": "8536932300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics, University College London"}, "36815439400": {"Name": "Visser S.", "AuthorID": "36815439400", "AffiliationID": "60008043", "AffiliationName": "Global DMPK, AstraZeneca RandD"}}}
