Materials and Methods: One hundred consecutive CT-guided cryoablation procedures to treat small renal tumours under general anaesthesia were evaluated\u201450 with standard IPPV and 50 after the introduction of HFJV as standard practice. Anaesthesia and procedural times, ionising radiation dose, complications, and 1-month post-treatment outcomes were collected. Results: HFJV was feasible and safe in all cases. Mean procedure time and total anaesthetic time were shorter with HFJV (p = <0.0001). The number of required CT acquisitions (p = 0.0002) and total procedure patient radiation dose (p = 0.0027) were also lower in the HFJV group compared with the IPPV group. There were a total of four complications of Clavien\u2013Dindo classification 3 or above\u2014three in the IPPV group and one in the HFJV group. At 1-month follow-up, two cases (both in the IPPV group) demonstrated subtotal treatment. Both cases were subsequently successfully retreated with cryoablation. Conclusion: By reducing target tumour motion during CT-guided renal cryoablation, HFJV can reduce procedure times and exposure to ionising radiation. HFJV provides an important adjunct to complex image-guided interventions, with potential to improve safety and treatment outcomes.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cancer", "Computed Tomography", "Cryoablation", "Kidney", "Ventilation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Cryosurgery", "Female", "High-Frequency Jet Ventilation", "Humans", "Kidney", "Kidney Neoplasms", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Operative Time", "Radiation Dosage", "Radiography, Interventional", "Retrospective Studies", "Tomography, X-Ray Computed", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85042906593", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"], ["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"57201033026": {"Name": "Buchan T.", "AuthorID": "57201033026", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Imaging Department, University College London Hospital"}, "25422679800": {"Name": "Walkden M.", "AuthorID": "25422679800", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Imaging Department, University College London Hospital"}, "57201023974": {"Name": "Jenkins K.", "AuthorID": "57201023974", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anaesthesia, University College London Hospital"}, "57202730910": {"Name": "Sultan P.", "AuthorID": "57202730910", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anaesthesia, University College London Hospital"}, "35775945600": {"Name": "Bandula S.", "AuthorID": "35775945600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Imaging, University College London"}}}
