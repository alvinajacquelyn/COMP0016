This report describes a regional service improvement initiative to increase the identification of hospital inpatients at this stage in their illnesses and to increase the number of such patients who are offered the opportunity to start the process of ACP. Methods: Data were collected prospectively over a 7 month period from four acute hospital trusts and a specialist cancer centre in the South-West London region. Each unit identified a specific patient population who were screened for eligibility to engage in the process of ACP. Data concerning the reasons for eligibility, the suitability for discussion and the various reasons why patients did not complete the process, were recorded. Results: Over a 7 month period 1980 patients were screened and 559 (28.2%) were found to be potentially eligible for an ACP discussion. Of these 227/559 (40.6%) were deemed suitable for a discussion by medical staff. The majority of these patients (195/227; 86%) were offered the opportunity to undergo ACP discussions and 144/ 195 (73.8%) agreed to begin the process of ACP. Conclusions: This report shows that a targeted approach can result in increased uptake in the number of patients who engage in ACP. However, systematic identification of potentially eligible patients requires a significant investment of clinical time and resources.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Advance Care Planning", "Eligibility Determination", "Health Plan Implementation", "Hospitals", "Humans", "Inpatients", "London", "Program Evaluation", "Prospective Studies", "Quality Improvement"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84930515591", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (miscellaneous)", "MEDI", "2701"], ["Oncology (nursing)", "NURS", "2917"], ["Medical and Surgical Nursing", "NURS", "2914"]], "AuthorData": {"56460966000": {"Name": "Schofield G.", "AuthorID": "56460966000", "AffiliationID": "60028145", "AffiliationName": "Kingston Hospital NHS Trust"}, "55837129400": {"Name": "Stone P.", "AuthorID": "55837129400", "AffiliationID": "60029329", "AffiliationName": "Division of Population Health Sciences and Education, St George's University of London"}, "51564138400": {"Name": "Kreeger L.", "AuthorID": "51564138400", "AffiliationID": "60028145", "AffiliationName": "Kingston Hospital NHS Trust"}, "56670707200": {"Name": "Meyer M.", "AuthorID": "56670707200", "AffiliationID": "60016812", "AffiliationName": "Epsom and St Helier University Hospitals NHS Trust"}, "56671210500": {"Name": "Wijeratne A.", "AuthorID": "56671210500", "AffiliationID": "60016812", "AffiliationName": "Epsom and St Helier University Hospitals NHS Trust"}, "56670967200": {"Name": "Swann D.", "AuthorID": "56670967200", "AffiliationID": "60017454, 60162031", "AffiliationName": "Croydon Health Services NHS Trust, Croydon University Hospital"}, "22996251100": {"Name": "Wood J.", "AuthorID": "22996251100", "AffiliationID": "60017166, 60009009", "AffiliationName": "The Royal Marsden and Royal Brompton Palliative Care Service, The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
