It explores how jogging was configured as a physical fitness activity suitable for sedentary middle-aged men and women. Jogging developed as a counter to the ill-effects of habits entrained by the increasingly sedentary lifestyles of modern industrialized urban and suburban dwellers. The paper traces the development of jogging as a defined exercise routine at the University of Oregon, Eugene, Oregon. Focusing on the moment when jogging is \u2018invented\u2019 as a recognizable fitness practice tells a great deal about the origin of contemporary regimes of physical fitness for the middle-aged population and how they have evolved. It also points to the significance of understanding how the shaping of corporeal habits play into the making of (1) individual bodies, (2) common practices of corporeal care and activity, and (3) environments of physical activity.", "AuthorKeywords": ["America", "coronary heart disease", "corporeal skill", "habit", "jogging", "physical fitness", "sedentary lifestyles", "urban environment", "William Bowerman"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84920993074", "SubjectAreas": [["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"], ["Cultural Studies", "SOCI", "3316"], ["Environmental Science (miscellaneous)", "ENVI", "2301"]], "AuthorData": {"7006574944": {"Name": "Latham A.", "AuthorID": "7006574944", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
