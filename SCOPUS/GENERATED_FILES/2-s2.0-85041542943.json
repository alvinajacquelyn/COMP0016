Many reside in care homes and may often have complex needs requiring efficient and timely response by knowledgeable and compassionate staff. The aim of this study is to improve our understanding of health care professionals\u2019 attitudes and knowledge of the barriers to integrated care for people with advanced dementia. In-depth, interactive interviews conducted with 14 health care professionals including commissioners, care home managers, nurses and health care assistants in the UK. Barriers to care for people with advanced dementia are influenced by governmental and societal factors which contribute to challenging environments in care homes, poor morale amongst care staff and a fragmentation of health and social care at the end of life. Quality of care for people with dementia as they approach death may be improved by developing collaborative networks to foster improved relationships between health and social care services.", "AuthorKeywords": ["care homes", "dementia", "integrated care", "palliative care", "qualitative research"], "IndexKeywords": ["Attitude of Health Personnel", "Delivery of Health Care, Integrated", "Dementia", "Health Personnel", "Humans", "Interviews as Topic", "Nursing Homes", "Qualitative Research", "Severity of Illness Index", "Terminal Care", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85041542943", "SubjectAreas": [["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"], ["Social Sciences (all)", "SOCI", "3300"]], "AuthorData": {"55588362000": {"Name": "Kupeli N.", "AuthorID": "55588362000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, Marie Curie Palliative Care Research Department, University College London"}, "55703138200": {"Name": "Harrington J.", "AuthorID": "55703138200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, Marie Curie Palliative Care Research Department, University College London"}, "7403339089": {"Name": "Moore K.", "AuthorID": "7403339089", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, Marie Curie Palliative Care Research Department, University College London"}, "7005604974": {"Name": "Sampson E.L.", "AuthorID": "7005604974", "AffiliationID": "60031025, 60099553", "AffiliationName": "Barnet Enfield and Haringey Mental Health Trust Liaison Psychiatry Team, North Middlesex University Hospital"}, "7403623810": {"Name": "Jones L.", "AuthorID": "7403623810", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, Marie Curie Palliative Care Research Department, University College London"}, "57213716994": {"Name": "Leavey G.", "AuthorID": "57213716994", "AffiliationID": "60020730", "AffiliationName": "Bamford Centre for Mental Health & Wellbeing, University of Ulster"}, "41461444700": {"Name": "Lord K.", "AuthorID": "41461444700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, University College London"}, "56591241100": {"Name": "King M.", "AuthorID": "56591241100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, University College London"}, "55334594200": {"Name": "Nazareth I.", "AuthorID": "55334594200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Primary Care & Population Health, University College London"}}}
