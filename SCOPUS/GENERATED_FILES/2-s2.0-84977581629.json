Objective: Our objective was to test whether increasing women's dietary intake of leafy green vegetables, fruit, and milk before conception and throughout pregnancy reduced their risk of GDM. Methods: Project SARAS (''excellent'') (2006-2012) was a nonblinded, individually randomized, controlled trial in women living in slums in the city of Mumbai, India. The interventions included a daily snack made from leafy green vegetables, fruit, and milk for the treatment group or low-micronutrient vegetables (e.g., potato and onion) for the control group, in addition to the usual diet. Results for the primary outcome, birth weight, have been reported. Women were invited to take an oral-glucose-tolerance test (OGTT) at 28-32 wk gestation to screen for GDM (WHO 1999 criteria). The prevalence of GDM was compared between the intervention and control groups, and Kernel density analysis was used to compare distributions of 120-min plasma glucose concentrations between groups. Results: Of 6513 women randomly assigned, 2291 became pregnant; of these, 2028 reached a gestation of 28 wk, 1008 (50%) attended for an OGTT, and 100 (9.9%) had GDM. In an intention-to-treat analysis, the prevalence of GDM was reduced in the treatment group (7.3% compared with 12.4% in controls; OR: 0.56; 95% CI: 0.36, 0.86; P = 0.008). The reduction in GDM remained significant after adjusting for prepregnancy adiposity and fat or weight gain during pregnancy. Kernel density analysis showed that this was explained by the fact that fewer women in the treatment group had a 2-h glucose concentration in the range 7.5-10.0 mmol/L. Conclusions: In low-income settings, in which women have a low intake of micronutrient-rich foods, improving dietary micronutrient quality by increasing intake of leafy green vegetables, fruit, and/or milk may have an important protective effect against the development of GDM.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Food-based supplement", "Fruit", "Gestational diabetes", "India", "Leafy green vegetables", "Micronutrients", "Milk", "Pregnancy", "Randomized controlled trial"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Diabetes, Gestational", "Female", "Fruit", "Humans", "India", "Milk", "Pregnancy", "Vegetables"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84977581629", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (miscellaneous)", "MEDI", "2701"], ["Nutrition and Dietetics", "NURS", "2916"]], "AuthorData": {"57190129826": {"Name": "Saharia S.A.", "AuthorID": "57190129826", "AffiliationID": "105992282", "AffiliationName": "Centre for the Study of Social Change"}, "57190124976": {"Name": "Potda R.D.", "AuthorID": "57190124976", "AffiliationID": "105992282", "AffiliationName": "Centre for the Study of Social Change"}, "57190131209": {"Name": "Gandh M.", "AuthorID": "57190131209", "AffiliationID": "105992282", "AffiliationName": "Centre for the Study of Social Change"}, "57190120292": {"Name": "Sane H.", "AuthorID": "57190120292", "AffiliationID": "105992282", "AffiliationName": "Centre for the Study of Social Change"}, "37007363200": {"Name": "Chopr H.", "AuthorID": "37007363200", "AffiliationID": "105992282", "AffiliationName": "Centre for the Study of Social Change"}, "57190122014": {"Name": "Shivshankara D.", "AuthorID": "57190122014", "AffiliationID": "105992282", "AffiliationName": "Centre for the Study of Social Change"}, "57190128830": {"Name": "Keho S.H.", "AuthorID": "57190128830", "AffiliationID": "60023615, 60025225", "AffiliationName": "MRC Lifecourse Epidemiology Unit, University of Southampton"}, "57190128897": {"Name": "Brow N.", "AuthorID": "57190128897", "AffiliationID": "60023615, 60025225", "AffiliationName": "MRC Lifecourse Epidemiology Unit, University of Southampton"}, "57190129465": {"Name": "Coakle P.J.", "AuthorID": "57190129465", "AffiliationID": "60023615, 60025225", "AffiliationName": "MRC Lifecourse Epidemiology Unit, University of Southampton"}, "57190131914": {"Name": "Marley-Zaga E.", "AuthorID": "57190131914", "AffiliationID": "60023615, 60025225", "AffiliationName": "MRC Lifecourse Epidemiology Unit, University of Southampton"}, "57210453706": {"Name": "Cox V.A.", "AuthorID": "57210453706", "AffiliationID": "60023615, 60025225", "AffiliationName": "MRC Lifecourse Epidemiology Unit, University of Southampton"}, "57202566908": {"Name": "Fall C.H.D.", "AuthorID": "57202566908", "AffiliationID": "60023615, 60025225", "AffiliationName": "MRC Lifecourse Epidemiology Unit, University of Southampton"}, "57190120853": {"Name": "Jackso A.A.", "AuthorID": "57190120853", "AffiliationID": "60025225, 60175924", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Southampton Biomedical Research Centre, University of Southampton"}, "56722731800": {"Name": "Margett B.M.", "AuthorID": "56722731800", "AffiliationID": "60025287", "AffiliationName": "Public Health Nutrition, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton"}}}
