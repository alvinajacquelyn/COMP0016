Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been widely used for this task. Due to the relatively small data set for training, data augmentation at training time has been commonly used for better performance of CNNs. Recent works also demonstrated the usefulness of data augmentation at test time, in addition to training time, for achieving more robust predictions. We investigate how test-time augmentation can improve CNNs\u2019 performance for brain tumor segmentation. We used different underpinning network structures and augmented the image by 3D rotation, flipping, scaling and adding random noise at both training and test time. Experiments with BraTS 2018 training and validation set show that test-time augmentation can achieve higher segmentation accuracy and obtain uncertainty estimation of the segmentation results.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Brain tumor", "Convolutional neural network", "Data augmentation", "Segmentation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Brain tumor segmentation", "Brain tumors", "Convolutional neural network", "Data augmentation", "Robust predictions", "Segmentation accuracy", "Segmentation results", "Uncertainty estimation"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85063467377", "SubjectAreas": [["Theoretical Computer Science", "MATH", "2614"], ["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"]], "AuthorData": {"55682589900": {"Name": "Wang G.", "AuthorID": "55682589900", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60020649", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome/EPSRC Centre for Interventional and Surgical Sciences, University College London"}, "55823995400": {"Name": "Li W.", "AuthorID": "55823995400", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60020649", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome/EPSRC Centre for Interventional and Surgical Sciences, University College London"}, "6602233595": {"Name": "Ourselin S.", "AuthorID": "6602233595", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "School of Biomedical Engineering and Imaging Sciences, King\u2019s College London"}, "23010613000": {"Name": "Vercauteren T.", "AuthorID": "23010613000", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60020649", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome/EPSRC Centre for Interventional and Surgical Sciences, University College London"}}}
