As the MIMO radar typically transmits orthogonal waveforms to search potential targets, we aim at jointly minimizing the downlink multi-user interference and the non-orthogonality of the transmitted waveform. Given the non-convexity in both orthogonal and CM constraints, we decompose the formulated optimization problem as two sub-problems, where we solve one of the sub-problems by singular value decomposition and the other one by the Riemannian conjugate gradient algorithm. We then propose an alternating minimization approach to obtain a near-optimal solution to the original problem by iteratively solve the two sub-problems. Finally, we assess the effectiveness of the proposed approach via numerical simulations.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Alternating minimization", "Conjugate gradient algorithms", "Multi-user interference", "Near-optimal solutions", "Optimization problems", "Orthogonal waveform", "Orthogonality constraints", "Radar target detection"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85069201939", "SubjectAreas": [["Signal Processing", "COMP", "1711"], ["Artificial Intelligence", "COMP", "1702"], ["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"], ["Aerospace Engineering", "ENGI", "2202"], ["Control and Optimization", "MATH", "2606"]], "AuthorData": {"57211818673": {"Name": "Liu F.", "AuthorID": "57211818673", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "23009493900": {"Name": "Masouros C.", "AuthorID": "23009493900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "7202821654": {"Name": "Griffiths H.", "AuthorID": "7202821654", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}}}
