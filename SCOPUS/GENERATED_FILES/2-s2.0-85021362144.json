This systematic review provides an overview of the literature on the types and prevalence of vertebral anomalies found in patients with CFM. A systematic search was conducted. Data on the number of patients, patient characteristics, types and prevalence of vertebral anomalies, and other associations between CFM and vertebral anomalies were extracted from the articles identified. Thirty-one articles were included. Seventeen articles described both the prevalence and types of vertebral anomalies in CFM, five articles described solely the types of vertebral anomalies in CFM, and nine articles reported solely the prevalence of vertebral anomalies in CFM. The vertebral anomalies most often reported in CFM are hemivertebrae, block vertebrae, scoliosis/kyphoscoliosis, and spina bifida. These anomalies are mostly present in the cervical and thoracic spine and ribs. The reported prevalence of vertebral anomalies in CFM varies from 8% to 79%. To diagnose vertebral anomalies early in patients with CFM, further research should focus on determining which patients with CFM are at risk of vertebral anomalies.", "AuthorKeywords": ["cervical anomalies", "craniofacial microsomia", "Goldenhar syndrome", "hemifacial microsomia", "oculo-auriculo-vertebral spectrum", "systematic review", "vertebral anomalies"], "IndexKeywords": ["Abnormalities, Multiple", "Goldenhar Syndrome", "Humans", "Spine"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85021362144", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Oral Surgery", "DENT", "3504"], ["Otorhinolaryngology", "MEDI", "2733"]], "AuthorData": {"57194631999": {"Name": "Renkema R.W.", "AuthorID": "57194631999", "AffiliationID": "60015627, 60032114", "AffiliationName": "Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, The Dutch Craniofacial Centre, Erasmus MC, Sophia's Children's Hospital Rotterdam"}, "55951479500": {"Name": "Caron C.J.J.M.", "AuthorID": "55951479500", "AffiliationID": "60015627, 60032114", "AffiliationName": "Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, The Dutch Craniofacial Centre, Erasmus MC, Sophia's Children's Hospital Rotterdam"}, "6602721170": {"Name": "Wolvius E.B.", "AuthorID": "6602721170", "AffiliationID": "60015627, 60032114", "AffiliationName": "Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, The Dutch Craniofacial Centre, Erasmus MC, Sophia's Children's Hospital Rotterdam"}, "6603112761": {"Name": "Koudstaal M.J.", "AuthorID": "6603112761", "AffiliationID": "60030521", "AffiliationName": "Department of Plastic and Oral Surgery, Boston Children's Hospital"}, "57111879300": {"Name": "Mathijssen I.M.J.", "AuthorID": "57111879300", "AffiliationID": "60015627, 60032114", "AffiliationName": "Department of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery and Hand Surgery, The Dutch Craniofacial Centre, Erasmus MC, Sophia's Children's Hospital Rotterdam"}, "7003742514": {"Name": "Dunaway D.J.", "AuthorID": "7003742514", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "The Craniofacial Unit, Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "36181080600": {"Name": "Forrest C.R.", "AuthorID": "36181080600", "AffiliationID": "60030319", "AffiliationName": "Division of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, Department of Surgery, The Hospital for Sick Children"}, "7004067604": {"Name": "Padwa B.L.", "AuthorID": "7004067604", "AffiliationID": "60030521", "AffiliationName": "Department of Plastic and Oral Surgery, Boston Children's Hospital"}}}
