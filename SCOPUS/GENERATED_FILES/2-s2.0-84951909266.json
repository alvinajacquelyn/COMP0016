Numerous cost-effective energy efficient options (technologies for new and existing ships and operations) have been identified for improving the energy efficiency of ships. Analysis from industry leading experts and recognised bodies has so far shown substantial unrealised abatement potential using options that often appear to be cost-negative at current fuel prices. Apart from the shortcomings of the analysis, failure to realise this potential could be attributable to various market barriers and failures. This paper discusses non-market failures and market failures in context of shipping and draws on findings of a survey of shipping companies to assess their pervasiveness. The results are compared with analysis undertaken with the global shipping system model (GloTraM). Initial results from these methods suggest the existence of some non-market failures and market failures that have also been discussed in other sectors and industries.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Barriers", "Energy efficiency", "Modelling", "Survey"], "IndexKeywords": ["Abatement potentials", "Barriers", "Energy efficient", "Global shipping", "Leading experts", "Market barriers", "Shipping companies", "System modeling"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84951909266", "SubjectAreas": [["Environmental Engineering", "ENVI", "2305"], ["Ocean Engineering", "ENGI", "2212"]], "AuthorData": {"56206405800": {"Name": "Rehmatulla N.", "AuthorID": "56206405800", "AffiliationID": "60084282", "AffiliationName": "UCL Energy Institute"}, "55522941400": {"Name": "Smith T.", "AuthorID": "55522941400", "AffiliationID": "60084282", "AffiliationName": "UCL Energy Institute"}}}
