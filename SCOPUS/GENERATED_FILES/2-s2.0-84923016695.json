While widely supported at the state and local levels in 2005, by 2011, the mapping program was defunded in the state's budget and the maps were highly politically criticized in Macon County. Even today, the maps remain unused in any legal capacity and are unknown to many residents of the region. Empirically, this article narrates the political fate of the maps in Macon County from 2005-2011 and theoretically, it draws upon a synthesis of urban political ecology (UPE), science and technology studies (STS), and critical cartography to interpret the rapid downfall of the landslide hazard maps. I show that a particular intervention of scientific expertise in exurban contradictions not only produced the maps, but also provided the political conditions for their ultimate discard. Finally, the article concludes by offering a contribution to the growing exurban studies literature as well as the 'second wave' of UPE.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Critical cartography", "Exurban studies", "Landslides", "Science and technology studies", "Southern Appalachia", "Urban political ecology"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84923016695", "SubjectAreas": [["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"]], "AuthorData": {"55750291500": {"Name": "Gustafson S.", "AuthorID": "55750291500", "AffiliationID": "60008293", "AffiliationName": "Universit\u00e4t Bremen, MARUM Center for Marine Environmental Sciences, ARTEC Sustainability Research Center"}}}
