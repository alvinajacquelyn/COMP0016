It presents one primary cross-linguistic finding about the timing of visual bodily behavior in repair sequences: if the party who initiates repair accompanies their turn with a \u201chold\u201d\u2014when relatively dynamic movements are temporarily and meaningfully held static\u2014this position will not be disengaged until the problem is resolved and the sequence closed. We base this finding on qualitative and quantitative analysis of corpora of conversational interaction from three unrelated languages representing two different modalities: Northern Italian, the Cha'palaa language of Ecuador, and Argentine Sign Language. The cross-linguistic similarities uncovered by this comparison suggest that visual bodily practices have been semiotized for similar interactive functions across different languages and modalities due to common pressures in face-to-face interaction.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84961214844", "SubjectAreas": [["Communication", "SOCI", "3315"], ["Language and Linguistics", "ARTS", "1203"], ["Linguistics and Language", "SOCI", "3310"]], "AuthorData": {"50461274500": {"Name": "Floyd S.", "AuthorID": "50461274500", "AffiliationID": "60024516", "AffiliationName": "Language and Cognition Department Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics"}, "56538149500": {"Name": "Manrique E.", "AuthorID": "56538149500", "AffiliationID": "60024516", "AffiliationName": "Language and Cognition Department Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics"}, "55303297700": {"Name": "Rossi G.", "AuthorID": "55303297700", "AffiliationID": "60024516", "AffiliationName": "Language and Cognition Department Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics"}, "23013559200": {"Name": "Torreira F.", "AuthorID": "23013559200", "AffiliationID": "60024516", "AffiliationName": "Language and Cognition Department Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics"}}}
