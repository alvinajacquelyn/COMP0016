This stimulation is known to be critical for prenatal musculoskeletal development; indeed, abnormal or absent movements have been implicated in multiple congenital disorders. However, the mechanical stress and strain experienced by the developing human skeleton in utero have never before been characterized. Here, we quantify the biomechanics of fetal movements during the second half of gestation by modelling fetal movements captured using novel cine-magnetic resonance imaging technology. By tracking these movements, quantifying fetal kick and muscle forces, and applying them to three-dimensional geometries of the fetal skeleton, we test the hypothesis that stress and strain change over ontogeny. We find that fetal kick force increases significantly from 20 to 30 weeks\u2019 gestation, before decreasing towards term. However, stress and strain in the fetal skeleton rises significantly over the latter half of gestation. This increasing trend with gestational age is important because changes in fetal movement patterns in late pregnancy have been linked to poor fetal outcomes and musculoskeletal malformations. This research represents the first quantification of kick force and mechanical stress and strain due to fetal movements in the human skeleton in utero, thus advancing our understanding of the biomechanical environment of the uterus. Further, by revealing a potential link between fetal biomechanics and skeletal malformations, our work will stimulate future research in tissue engineering and mechanobiology.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Biomechanical stimuli", "Cine-MRI", "Finite element analysis", "Joint biomechanics", "Musculo-skeletal development"], "IndexKeywords": ["Biomechanical stimuli", "Cine-MRI", "Congenital disorders", "Joint biomechanics", "Mechanical stress", "Musculo-skeletal", "Stress and strain", "Three dimensional geometry", "Female", "Fetal Development", "Fetus", "Humans", "Male", "Musculoskeletal Development", "Skeleton", "Stress, Physiological"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85044435585", "SubjectAreas": [["Biotechnology", "BIOC", "1305"], ["Biophysics", "BIOC", "1304"], ["Bioengineering", "CENG", "1502"], ["Biomaterials", "MATE", "2502"], ["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"]], "AuthorData": {"55358385900": {"Name": "Verbruggen S.W.", "AuthorID": "55358385900", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Bioengineering, Imperial College London"}, "8520007200": {"Name": "Nowlan N.C.", "AuthorID": "8520007200", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Bioengineering, Imperial College London"}, "25937325100": {"Name": "Kainz B.", "AuthorID": "25937325100", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computing, Imperial College London"}, "57193977588": {"Name": "Phillips A.T.M.", "AuthorID": "57193977588", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Imperial College London"}, "55545709400": {"Name": "Shelmerdine S.C.", "AuthorID": "55545709400", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "35430060900": {"Name": "Hajnal J.V.", "AuthorID": "35430060900", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Centre for the Developing Brain, Kings College London"}, "55165088800": {"Name": "Rutherford M.A.", "AuthorID": "55165088800", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Perinatal Imaging and Health, Centre for the Developing Brain, School of Biomedical Engineering and Imaging Science, Kings College London"}, "6507902996": {"Name": "Arthurs O.J.", "AuthorID": "6507902996", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}}}
