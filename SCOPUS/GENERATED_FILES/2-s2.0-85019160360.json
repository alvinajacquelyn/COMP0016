These sensors and apps create opportunities for more detailed environmental monitoring, as compared to official monitoring networks, and to involve the general public in environmental monitoring through participatory data collection and monitoring schemes. However, depending on the aspects of the environment that are monitored, technical complexity can differ quite a lot. Proper monitoring often requires important efforts in developing and validating sensing devices and in processing the collected data. This chapter deals with low-cost sensing devices and smartphone applications for physico-chemical environmental parameters, that can be used, possibly with some training, by non-specialised people, and as such create new opportunities for collection of novel data and improved monitoring of the environment. It starts with examples of novel sensing devices and apps for different environmental domains, and proceeds with a detailed overview of the possible added value, the technical challenges and future prospects in two specific domains that recently received a lot of interest, air quality and sound monitoring.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Black carbon concentration", "Field calibration", "Mobile monitoring", "Sound level", "Sound level meter"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85019160360", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Computational Mechanics", "ENGI", "2206"], ["Artificial Intelligence", "COMP", "1702"]], "AuthorData": {"8901383500": {"Name": "Theunis J.", "AuthorID": "8901383500", "AffiliationID": "60019342", "AffiliationName": "VITO Flemish Institute for Technological Research"}, "36810661300": {"Name": "Stevens M.", "AuthorID": "36810661300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Extreme Citizen Science (ExCiteS) Research Group, University College London"}, "6701666696": {"Name": "Botteldooren D.", "AuthorID": "6701666696", "AffiliationID": "60033316", "AffiliationName": "Ghent University"}}}
