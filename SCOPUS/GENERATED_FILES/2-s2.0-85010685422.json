To address this, mobile edge-cloud (MEC) has been proposed as an approach to bring resources closer to users. Recently, in contrast to conventional fixed cloud locations, the advent of network function virtualization (NFV) has, with some added cost due to the necessary decentralization, enhanced MEC with new flexibility in placing MEC services to any nodes capable of virtualizing their resources. In this work, we address the question on how to optimally place resources among NFV-enabled nodes to support mobile multimedia applications with low latency requirement and when to adapt the current resource placements to address workload changes. We first show that the placement optimization problem is NP-hard and propose an online dynamic resource allocation scheme that consists of an adaptive greedy heuristic algorithm and a detection mechanism to identify the time when the system will no longer be able to satisfy the applications' delay requirement. Our scheme takes into account the effect of current existing techniques (i.e., auto-scaling and load balancing). We design and implement a realistic NFV-enabled MEC simulated framework and show through extensive simulations that our proposal always manages to allocate sufficient resources on time to guarantee continuous satisfaction of the application latency requirements under changing workload while incurring up to 40% less cost in comparison to existing overprovisioning approaches.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Computational costs", "Design and implements", "Detection mechanism", "Dynamic resource allocations", "Extensive simulations", "Mobile applications", "Mobile multimedia applications", "Placement optimization"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85010685422", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"]], "AuthorData": {"56508663000": {"Name": "Yang B.", "AuthorID": "56508663000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "14041390300": {"Name": "Chai W.", "AuthorID": "14041390300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "7003707235": {"Name": "Pavlou G.", "AuthorID": "7003707235", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "57188821228": {"Name": "Katsaros K.", "AuthorID": "57188821228", "AffiliationID": "60057758", "AffiliationName": "Intracom Telecom"}}}
