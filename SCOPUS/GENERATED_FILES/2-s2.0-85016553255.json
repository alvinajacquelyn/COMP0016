KGaA, WeinheimDespite significant improvements in the synthesis of templated silica materials, post-synthesis purification remains highly expensive and renders the materials industrially unviable. In this study this issue is addressed for porous bioinspired silica by developing a rapid room-temperature solution method for complete extraction of organic additives. Using elemental analysis and N2 and CO2 adsorption, the ability to both purify and controllably tailor the composition, porosity and surface chemistry of bioinspired silica in a single step is demonstrated. For the first time the extraction is modelled using molecular dynamics, revealing that the removal mechanism is dominated by surface-charge interactions. This is extended to other additive chemistry, leading to a wider applicability of the method to other materials. Finally the environmental benefits of the new method are estimated and compared with previous purification techniques, demonstrating significant improvements in sustainability.", "AuthorKeywords": ["green nanomaterials", "manufacturing", "molecular interactions", "porous materials", "silica"], "IndexKeywords": ["Additive chemistry", "Charge interactions", "Environmental benefits", "Functional Nano materials", "Organic additives", "Purification techniques", "Removal mechanism", "Solution methods", "Adsorption", "Carbon Dioxide", "Microscopy, Electron, Scanning", "Molecular Dynamics Simulation", "Nanostructures", "Nitrogen", "Porosity"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85016553255", "SubjectAreas": [["Environmental Chemistry", "ENVI", "2304"], ["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Energy (all)", "ENER", "2100"]], "AuthorData": {"57193795456": {"Name": "Manning J.R.H.", "AuthorID": "57193795456", "AffiliationID": "60001881", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering, University of Sheffield"}, "7004865659": {"Name": "Patwardhan S.V.", "AuthorID": "7004865659", "AffiliationID": "60001881", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering, University of Sheffield"}, "16508426600": {"Name": "Yip T.W.S.", "AuthorID": "16508426600", "AffiliationID": "60024724", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical and Process Engineering, University of Strathclyde"}, "57220959654": {"Name": "Centi A.", "AuthorID": "57220959654", "AffiliationID": "60024724", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical and Process Engineering, University of Strathclyde"}, "7007079464": {"Name": "Jorge M.", "AuthorID": "7007079464", "AffiliationID": "60024724", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical and Process Engineering, University of Strathclyde"}}}
