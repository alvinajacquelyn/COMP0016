In this paper, we prove that a positive proportion of hyperelliptic curves over \u211a of genus g\u2265 1 are locally soluble but have no points over any odd degree extension of \u211a. We also obtain a number of related results. For example, we prove that for any fixed odd integer k > 0, the proportion of locally soluble hyperelliptic curves over \u211a of genus g having no points over any odd degree extension of \u211a of degree at most k tends to 1 as g tends to infinity. We also show that the failures of the Hasse principle in these cases are explained by the Brauer-Manin obstruction. Our methods involve a detailed study of the geometry of pencils of quadrics over a general field of characteristic not equal to 2, together with suitable arguments from the geometry of numbers.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Brauer-Manin obstruction", "Generalized Jacobian", "Hyperelliptic curves", "Points over extensions", "Rational points"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85010858510", "SubjectAreas": [["Mathematics (all)", "MATH", "2600"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"7102531918": {"Name": "Bhargava M.", "AuthorID": "7102531918", "AffiliationID": "60003269", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, Princeton University"}, "7202434951": {"Name": "Gross B.H.", "AuthorID": "7202434951", "AffiliationID": "60009982", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, Harvard University"}, "57193115097": {"Name": "Wang X.", "AuthorID": "57193115097", "AffiliationID": "60003269", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, Princeton University"}, "16066841100": {"Name": "Dokchitser T.", "AuthorID": "16066841100", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University of Bristol"}, "23476859300": {"Name": "Dokchitser V.", "AuthorID": "23476859300", "AffiliationID": "60022020", "AffiliationName": "Mathematics Institute, University of Warwick"}}}
