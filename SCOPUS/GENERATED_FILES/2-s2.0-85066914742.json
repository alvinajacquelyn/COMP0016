The proposed multi-stage framework combines previous approaches to dMRI protocol optimisation: first optimising b-values by minimizing Cramer-Rao lower bounds on parameter variances, and subsequently optimising gradient directions jointly to provide maximum angular coverage across all shells. This removes unnecessary measurements of closely spaced b-values with the same gradient directions, which encode very similar information, and hence reduces the total number of dMRI measurements. We applied the framework to establish an organ-specific, data-driven, set of optimised b-values and gradient directions for dMRI of the placenta. The optimised protocol leads to higher contrast-to-noise ratios in parameter maps compared to a naive protocol of comparable scan time. Applying this framework in other organs has the potential to reduce scanning times required for anisotropic IVIM modelling.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Anisotropic IVIM", "Cramer-Rao lower bound", "Diffusion MRI", "Experimental design", "IVIM", "Microstructural modelling", "Placenta"], "IndexKeywords": ["Anisotropic IVIM", "Cramer Rao lower bound", "Diffusion mris", "IVIM", "Microstructural modelling", "Placenta"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85066914742", "SubjectAreas": [["Modeling and Simulation", "MATH", "2611"], ["Geometry and Topology", "MATH", "2608"], ["Computer Graphics and Computer-Aided Design", "COMP", "1704"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"56989806800": {"Name": "Slator P.", "AuthorID": "56989806800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Image Computing and Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "55523328000": {"Name": "Ianus A.", "AuthorID": "55523328000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Image Computing and Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "36026988600": {"Name": "Panagiotaki E.", "AuthorID": "36026988600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Image Computing and Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "7402830766": {"Name": "Alexander D.", "AuthorID": "7402830766", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Image Computing and Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "55332244600": {"Name": "Hutter J.", "AuthorID": "55332244600", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Biomedical Engineering Department, King\u2019s College London"}, "55165088800": {"Name": "Rutherford M.", "AuthorID": "55165088800", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Centre for the Developing Brain, King\u2019s College London"}, "57205933336": {"Name": "Hajnal J.", "AuthorID": "57205933336", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Biomedical Engineering Department, King\u2019s College London"}}}
