All rights reserved.New therapeutic strategies in Alzheimer's disease (AD) are focused on targeting amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) to modify the underlying cause of the disease rather than just the symptoms.Tthe aim of this study was to investigate the long-term effects of treatment with the anti-A\u03b2 compound phenserine on (i) cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers for A\u03b2 and tau pathology and (ii) brain metabolism as assessed by the regional cerebral metabolic rate for glucose (rCMRglc), using positron emission tomography. Twenty patients with mild AD were included in the study and after 12 months treatment with phenserine, CSF A\u03b240 and \u03b2- and \u03b2-secretase-cleaved soluble amyloid-\u03b2 protein precursor (sA\u03b2PP) levels had significantly increased and rCMRglc had stabilized. Levels of CSF A\u03b240 and sA\u03b2PP correlated positively with rCMRglc and cognition while CSF A\u03b242 levels, the A\u03b242/40 ratio, P-tau, and T-tau correlated negatively with rCMRglc and cognition. In summary, long-term phenserine treatment resulted in increased levels of CSF A\u03b240, sA\u03b2PP\u03b2, and sA\u03b2PP\u03b2, which positively correlated with improvements in rCMRglc and cognition.Tthe study illustrates the value of using biomarkers in the CSF and brain for evaluation of drug effects.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alzheimer's disease", "cerebral glucose metabolism", "cerebrospinal fluid", "phenserine", "positron emission tomography"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Alzheimer Disease", "Amyloid beta-Peptides", "Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor", "Biomarkers", "Brain", "Cognition", "Double-Blind Method", "Female", "Glucose", "Humans", "Male", "Nootropic Agents", "Peptide Fragments", "Phosphorylation", "Physostigmine", "Positron-Emission Tomography", "tau Proteins", "Time Factors", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": null, "EID": "2-s2.0-84938700926", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Clinical Psychology", "PSYC", "3203"], ["Geriatrics and Gerontology", "MEDI", "2717"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"7102413103": {"Name": "Nordberg A.", "AuthorID": "7102413103", "AffiliationID": "60019295", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geriatric Medicine, Karolinska University Hospital Huddinge"}, "24341204900": {"Name": "Kadir A.", "AuthorID": "24341204900", "AffiliationID": "60019295", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geriatric Medicine, Karolinska University Hospital Huddinge"}, "16071391500": {"Name": "Almkvist O.", "AuthorID": "16071391500", "AffiliationID": "60028378", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Stockholm University"}, "7102011511": {"Name": "Andreasen N.", "AuthorID": "7102011511", "AffiliationID": "60019295", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geriatric Medicine, Karolinska University Hospital Huddinge"}, "7102000770": {"Name": "Wall A.", "AuthorID": "7102000770", "AffiliationID": "60003858", "AffiliationName": "Section of Nuclear Medicine and PET, Department of Radiology Oncology and Radiation Sciences, Uppsala University"}, "56415176000": {"Name": "Blennow K.", "AuthorID": "56415176000", "AffiliationID": "60016437", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, Section of Psychiatry and Neurochemistry, G\u00f6teborg University"}, "24791421000": {"Name": "Langstrom B.", "AuthorID": "24791421000", "AffiliationID": "60003858", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemistry and Organic Chemistry, Uppsala University"}, "6701454676": {"Name": "Zetterberg H.", "AuthorID": "6701454676", "AffiliationID": "60016437", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, Clinical Neurochemistry Laboratory, G\u00f6teborg University"}}}
