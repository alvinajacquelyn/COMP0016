The measured infinite dilution activity coefficients are used to calculate air-to-pyridine and water-to-pyridine partition coefficients. The calculated partition coefficients, combined with published experimental data for an additional 52 inorganic and organic solutes taken from the chemical literature, are used to derive Abraham model correlations for describing the transfer of nonelectrolyte solutes into pyridine from both water and the gas phase. The derived mathematical described the air-to-pyridine and water-to-pyridine partition coefficients to within 0.13 log units.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Activity coefficients", "Partition coefficients", "Pyridine solvent", "Solubility ratios", "Solute transfer processes"], "IndexKeywords": ["Calculated partition coefficients", "Chromatographic methods", "Infinite dilution activity coefficients", "Linear free energy relationships", "Nonelectrolyte solutes", "Partition coefficient", "Solubility behavior", "Solute transfer"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84992130254", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"]], "AuthorData": {"57200148048": {"Name": "Sedov I.", "AuthorID": "57200148048", "AffiliationID": "60070941", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Kazan Federal University"}, "57191616702": {"Name": "Salikov T.", "AuthorID": "57191616702", "AffiliationID": "60070941", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Kazan Federal University"}, "56222214400": {"Name": "Hart E.", "AuthorID": "56222214400", "AffiliationID": "60024438", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of North Texas"}, "57188536870": {"Name": "Higgins E.", "AuthorID": "57188536870", "AffiliationID": "60024438", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of North Texas"}, "35496753700": {"Name": "Acree W.", "AuthorID": "35496753700", "AffiliationID": "60024438", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of North Texas"}, "7202901240": {"Name": "Abraham M.", "AuthorID": "7202901240", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}}}
