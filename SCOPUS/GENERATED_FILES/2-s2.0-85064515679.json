All rights reserved.Background/aim: Fluorescent gold nanoparticles demonstrate strong photoluminescence, photostability, and low cellular toxicity, making them attractive agents for biomedical applications. Mechano-growth factor (MGF) is an isoform of IGF1 and its expression has been demonstrated in malignancies including prostate cancer. Materials and Methods: Near-infrared-emitting gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) were synthesized and conjugated to MGF. Following characterization and confirmation of conjugation, these AuNPs were used to investigate the expression of MGF in colon cancer cell lines (HT29 and SW620) and tissues comparing normal and colon cancer. The prostate cancer cell line PC3 and adenocarcinoma tissues were used as positive controls. Results: Colon cancer cell lines, adenocarcinoma tissues and polyp tissues demonstrated evidence of MGF peptide expression, which was not found in normal colon tissues and human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Conclusion: MGF appears to be overexpressed in colon cancer tissues, offering a potential unique target for imaging and drug delivery in colon cancer.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Colon cancer", "Fluorescent nanoparticles", "Gold nanoparticles", "Mechano-growth factor"], "IndexKeywords": ["Biomarkers, Tumor", "Colorectal Neoplasms", "Fluorescent Antibody Technique", "Gold", "HT29 Cells", "Humans", "Metal Nanoparticles", "Microscopy, Confocal", "Microscopy, Fluorescence", "PC-3 Cells", "Quantum Dots", "STAT5 Transcription Factor", "Tumor Suppressor Proteins"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85064515679", "SubjectAreas": [["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Cancer Research", "BIOC", "1306"]], "AuthorData": {"16416503500": {"Name": "Alagaratnam S.", "AuthorID": "16416503500", "AffiliationID": "60175883, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London Centre for Nanotechnology and Regenerative Medicine, Division of Surgery and Interventional Science, University College London, Royal Free Campus"}, "7406945743": {"Name": "Yang S.Y.", "AuthorID": "7406945743", "AffiliationID": "60175883, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London Centre for Nanotechnology and Regenerative Medicine, Division of Surgery and Interventional Science, University College London, Royal Free Campus"}, "57204294898": {"Name": "Loizidou M.", "AuthorID": "57204294898", "AffiliationID": "60175883, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London Centre for Nanotechnology and Regenerative Medicine, Division of Surgery and Interventional Science, University College London, Royal Free Campus"}, "57206435918": {"Name": "Ramesh B.", "AuthorID": "57206435918", "AffiliationID": "60175883, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London Centre for Nanotechnology and Regenerative Medicine, Division of Surgery and Interventional Science, University College London, Royal Free Campus"}, "7102974662": {"Name": "Fuller B.", "AuthorID": "7102974662", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University Department of Surgery and, Liver Transplant Unit, University College London, Royal Free Campus"}}}
