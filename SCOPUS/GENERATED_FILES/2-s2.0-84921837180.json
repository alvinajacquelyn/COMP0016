Despite recent improvements, TAV-related complications still limit its application. In the present work, FE analyses of TAV implantation and function have been performed with the aim of investigating the influence of the calcifications of the aortic valve leaflets on TAV performances. Results suggest that the degree and location of calcifications could influence post-implanted TAV configuration as well as TAV-aortic root interactions and TAV dynamics. The study gives insights in the biomechanics of TAV, while the implemented computational tools could be applied to different scenarios to investigate other relevant clinical aspects.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Calcific aortic stenosis", "Finite element analysis", "Transcatheter aortic valve implantation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aortic stenosis", "Aortic valve leaflets", "Calcific aortic stenosis", "Clinical aspects", "Computational tools", "Interventional procedures", "ITS applications", "Transcatheter aortic valves"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84921837180", "SubjectAreas": [["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"], ["Computational Theory and Mathematics", "COMP", "1703"]], "AuthorData": {"55509277900": {"Name": "Dimasi A.", "AuthorID": "55509277900", "AffiliationID": "60023256", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronics, Information and Bioengineering, Politecnico di Milano"}, "26323830000": {"Name": "Stevanella M.", "AuthorID": "26323830000", "AffiliationID": "60023256", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronics, Information and Bioengineering, Politecnico di Milano"}, "6602264012": {"Name": "Votta E.", "AuthorID": "6602264012", "AffiliationID": "60023256", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronics, Information and Bioengineering, Politecnico di Milano"}, "55837209500": {"Name": "Sturla F.", "AuthorID": "55837209500", "AffiliationID": "60032256", "AffiliationName": "Division of Cardiovascular Surgery, Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Verona"}, "7005302872": {"Name": "Redaelli A.", "AuthorID": "7005302872", "AffiliationID": "60023256", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronics, Information and Bioengineering, Politecnico di Milano"}, "6506017118": {"Name": "Burriesci G.", "AuthorID": "6506017118", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College of London"}}}
