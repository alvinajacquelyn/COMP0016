Additive manufacturing (AM), also known as 3D printing, is a well-established technology with the ability to construct or print' intricate support structures, which can be both integral and light-weight, and is therefore a candidate technique for producing shells for space-based X-ray telescopes. The work described here is a feasibility study into this technology for precision X-ray optics for astronomy and has been sponsored by the UK Space Agency's National Space Technology Programme. The goal of the project is to use a series of test samples to trial different materials and processes with the aim of developing a viable path for the production of an X-ray reflecting prototype for astronomical applications. The initial design of an AM prototype X-ray shell is presented with ray-trace modelling and analysis of the X-ray performance. The polishing process may cause print-through from the light-weight support structure on to the reflecting surface. Investigations in to the effect of the print-through on the X-ray performance of the shell are also presented.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Additive manufacture", "Thin mirrors", "X-ray astronomy", "X-ray telescopes"], "IndexKeywords": ["Additive manufacture", "Astronomical application", "Feasibility studies", "Materials and process", "Modelling and analysis", "Thin mirrors", "X ray telescope", "X-ray astronomy"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85033471671", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"24070521000": {"Name": "Feldman C.", "AuthorID": "24070521000", "AffiliationID": "60033125", "AffiliationName": "University of Leicester"}, "56259878200": {"Name": "Willingale R.", "AuthorID": "56259878200", "AffiliationID": "60033125", "AffiliationName": "University of Leicester"}, "24069736100": {"Name": "Atkins C.", "AuthorID": "24069736100", "AffiliationID": "60006858", "AffiliationName": "UK Astronomy Technology Centre, Royal Observatory"}, "36522537700": {"Name": "Cochrane W.", "AuthorID": "36522537700", "AffiliationID": "60006858", "AffiliationName": "UK Astronomy Technology Centre, Royal Observatory"}, "57196465566": {"Name": "Roulet M.", "AuthorID": "57196465566", "AffiliationID": "60007671, 60008134, 60102127", "AffiliationName": "Aix Marseille Univ, CNRS, Laboratoire d'Astrophysique de Marseille"}, "7403482947": {"Name": "Brooks D.", "AuthorID": "7403482947", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Department of Physics and Astronomy"}, "6506833394": {"Name": "Doel P.", "AuthorID": "6506833394", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Department of Physics and Astronomy"}, "56968574700": {"Name": "Watson S.", "AuthorID": "56968574700", "AffiliationID": "60007671, 60008134, 60102127", "AffiliationName": "Aix Marseille Univ, CNRS, Laboratoire d'Astrophysique de Marseille"}}}
