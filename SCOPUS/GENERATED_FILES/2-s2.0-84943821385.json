Participants as bystanders (N = 260) aged 8-10 and 13-15 years were presented with scenarios of direct aggression between individuals from different social groups (i.e., intergroup verbal aggression). These situations involved either an ingroup aggressor and an outgroup victim or an outgroup aggressor and an ingroup victim. This study focussed on the role of intergroup factors (group membership, ingroup identification, group norms, and social- moral reasoning) in the development of prosocial bystander intentions. Findings showed that prosocial bystander intentions declined with age. This effect was partially mediated by the ingroup norm to intervene and perceived severity of the verbal aggression. However, a moderated mediation analysis showed that only when the victim was an ingroup member and the aggressor an outgroup member did participants become more likely with age to report prosocial bystander intentions due to increased ingroup identification. Results also showed that younger children focussed on moral concerns and adolescents focussed more on psychological concerns when reasoning about their bystander intention. These novel findings help explain the developmental decline in prosocial bystander intentions from middle childhood into early adolescence when observing direct intergroup aggression.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Aggression", "Child", "Child Development", "Female", "Group Processes", "Humans", "Intention", "Male", "Morals", "Social Behavior", "Social Perception", "Thinking", "Verbal Behavior"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84943821385", "SubjectAreas": [["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"], ["Developmental Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2806"]], "AuthorData": {"50262839800": {"Name": "Palmer S.", "AuthorID": "50262839800", "AffiliationID": "60010964", "AffiliationName": "Goldsmiths, University of London"}, "6701862409": {"Name": "Rutland A.", "AuthorID": "6701862409", "AffiliationID": "60010964", "AffiliationName": "Goldsmiths, University of London"}, "9240351900": {"Name": "Cameron L.", "AuthorID": "9240351900", "AffiliationID": "60010818", "AffiliationName": "University of Kent"}}}
