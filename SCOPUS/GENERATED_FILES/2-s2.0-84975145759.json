As a consequence, their experience of internalised stigma is likely to be the most detrimental and pervasive. Internalised stigma interventions have shown some benefits in those who experience serious mental illness including those with a schizophrenia-spectrum diagnosis. A systematic narrative review and meta-analysis were conducted examining the efficacy of internalised stigma interventions for people with a schizophrenia-spectrum diagnosis. Randomised Controlled Trials, controlled trials, and cohort studies were included and assessed against quality criteria. The search identified 12 studies; 7 randomised controlled trials, 3 cohort studies and 2 controlled trials. A variety of psychosocial interventions were utilised with the majority employing Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT), psychoeducation and social skills training. The core outcomes used to examine the efficacy of the intervention were internalised stigma, self-esteem, empowerment, and functioning. The meta-analysis revealed an improvement in internalised stigma favouring the internalised stigma intervention but was not significant (5 RCTs, n = 200). Self-efficacy and insight were significantly improved favouring the internalised stigma intervention. Internalised stigma interventions show promise in those with schizophrenia-spectrum diagnoses. Existing interventions have demonstrated small effects and employed small samples. Large scale RCTs are required to further develop the evidence base of more targeted interventions.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Internalised stigma interventions", "Narrative synthesis", "Psychosis", "Schizophrenia", "Stigma", "Systematic review"], "IndexKeywords": ["Humans", "Schizophrenia", "Schizophrenic Psychology", "Social Stigma"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84975145759", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"], ["Biological Psychiatry", "NEUR", "2803"]], "AuthorData": {"7202513618": {"Name": "Wood L.", "AuthorID": "7202513618", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "University of Manchester, School of Psychological Sciences"}, "37114903900": {"Name": "Varese F.", "AuthorID": "37114903900", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "University of Manchester, School of Psychological Sciences"}, "7402258312": {"Name": "Morrison A.P.", "AuthorID": "7402258312", "AffiliationID": "60122796", "AffiliationName": "Psychosis Research Unit, Greater Manchester West NHS Foundation Trust"}, "36099908000": {"Name": "Byrne R.", "AuthorID": "36099908000", "AffiliationID": "60122796", "AffiliationName": "Psychosis Research Unit, Greater Manchester West NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
