KGaA, Weinheim.Two efficient phase-transfer-catalyzed protocols for the diastereoselective synthesis of cis and trans isomers of 2,6-diaryltetrahydrothiopyran-4-ones (2,6-DATHTPs) have been developed. In a study of the scope of the reactions, differently substituted 2,6-DATHTPs were successfully accessed in high yields and diastereomeric excessses on both experimental and preparative scales.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Configuration determination", "Diastereoselectivity", "Michael addition", "Phase-transfer catalysis", "Sulfur heterocycles", "Synthetic methods"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85027930178", "SubjectAreas": [["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"], ["Organic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1605"]], "AuthorData": {"55466900800": {"Name": "Gendron T.", "AuthorID": "55466900800", "AffiliationID": "60008134", "AffiliationName": "European School of Chemistry, Polymers and Materials, Bioorganic and Medicinal Chemistry, UMR CNRS 7509"}, "57195445254": {"Name": "Kessedjian H.", "AuthorID": "57195445254", "AffiliationID": "60008134", "AffiliationName": "European School of Chemistry, Polymers and Materials, Bioorganic and Medicinal Chemistry, UMR CNRS 7509"}, "6701918848": {"Name": "Davioud-Charvet E.", "AuthorID": "6701918848", "AffiliationID": "60008134", "AffiliationName": "European School of Chemistry, Polymers and Materials, Bioorganic and Medicinal Chemistry, UMR CNRS 7509"}, "23094985800": {"Name": "Lanfranchi D.", "AuthorID": "23094985800", "AffiliationID": "60008134", "AffiliationName": "European School of Chemistry, Polymers and Materials, Bioorganic and Medicinal Chemistry, UMR CNRS 7509"}}}
