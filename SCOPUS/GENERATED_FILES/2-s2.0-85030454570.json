It begins with an account of the role of mentalizing in the attachment context in the development of epistemic trust\u2014defined as trust in the authenticity and personal relevance of interpersonally transmitted knowledge about how the social environment works. It then explains the particular way in which this emphasis on social communication is pertinent to group therapy and its function as a training ground for mentalizing and the initial experimentation with the opening of epistemic trust in a social context. The article finishes with an account of how mentalization-based group work is undertaken.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85030454570", "SubjectAreas": [["Clinical Psychology", "PSYC", "3203"]], "AuthorData": {"7004981532": {"Name": "Fonagy P.", "AuthorID": "7004981532", "AffiliationID": "60170329", "AffiliationName": "Anna Freud National Centre for Children and Families"}, "7403367924": {"Name": "Campbell C.", "AuthorID": "7403367924", "AffiliationID": "60170329", "AffiliationName": "Anna Freud National Centre for Children and Families"}, "7102456176": {"Name": "Bateman A.", "AuthorID": "7102456176", "AffiliationID": "60170329", "AffiliationName": "Anna Freud National Centre for Children and Families"}}}
