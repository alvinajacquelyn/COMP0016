The scope of the present work is to investigate the complex correlations of the earthquake activity that preceded the Mw6.1 event in the broader area of the Cephalonia Island and identify possible indications of critical stages in the evolution of the earthquake generation process. We apply the recently introduced methods of Multiresolution Wavelet Analysis (MRWA) and Natural Time (NT) analysis and for the first time we combine their results in a joint approach that may lead to universal principles in describing the evolution of the earthquake activity as it approaches a major event. In particular, the initial application of MRWA on the inter-event time series indicates a time marker 12 days prior to the major event. By using this time as the initiation point of the NT analysis, the critical stage of seismicity, where the \u03ba1 parameter reaches the critical value of \u03ba1 = 0.070, is approached few days before the occurrence of the Mw6.1 earthquake.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cephalonia", "Multiresolution wavelets", "Natural time analysis", "Seismicity"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cephalonia", "Earthquake activity", "Earthquake generation process", "Multiresolution wavelet analysis", "Multiresolution wavelets", "Natural time", "Seismicity", "Shallow earthquakes"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84983130260", "SubjectAreas": [["Geophysics", "EART", "1908"], ["Geochemistry and Petrology", "EART", "1906"]], "AuthorData": {"56264486500": {"Name": "Vallianatos F.", "AuthorID": "56264486500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Risk and Disaster Reduction, University College London"}, "56630487000": {"Name": "Michas G.", "AuthorID": "56630487000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Risk and Disaster Reduction, University College London"}, "8231055900": {"Name": "Hloupis G.", "AuthorID": "8231055900", "AffiliationID": "60110806", "AffiliationName": "Technological Educational Institute of Athens"}}}
