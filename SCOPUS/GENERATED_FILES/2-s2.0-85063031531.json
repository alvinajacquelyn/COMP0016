Even standard courses of antibiotics dramatically reduce the microbiome\u2019s diversity and can cause transitions to dysbiotic states. Conceptually, this is often described as a \u2018stability landscape\u2019: the microbiome sits in a landscape with multiple stable equilibria, and sufficiently strong perturbations can shift the microbiome from its normal equilibrium to another state. However, this picture is only qualitative and has not been incorporated in previous mathematical models of the effects of antibiotics. Here, we outline a simple quantitative model based on the stability landscape concept and demonstrate its success on real data. Our analytical impulse-response model has minimal assumptions with three parameters. We fit this model in a Bayesian framework to data from a previous study of the year-long effects of short courses of four common antibiotics on the gut and oral microbiomes, allowing us to compare parameters between antibiotics and microbiomes, and further validate our model using data from another study looking at the impact of a combination of last-resort antibiotics on the gut microbiome. Using Bayesian model selection we find support for a long-term transition to an alternative microbiome state after courses of certain antibiotics in both the gut and oral microbiomes. Quantitative stability landscape frameworks are an exciting avenue for future microbiome modelling.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Anti-Bacterial Agents", "Bayes Theorem", "Dysbiosis", "Gastrointestinal Microbiome", "Humans", "Microbiota", "Models, Theoretical"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85063031531", "SubjectAreas": [["Microbiology", "IMMU", "2404"], ["Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics", "AGRI", "1105"]], "AuthorData": {"57191197591": {"Name": "Shaw L.P.", "AuthorID": "57191197591", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "CoMPLEX, UCL"}, "57202058182": {"Name": "Barnes C.P.", "AuthorID": "57202058182", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Cell and Developmental Biology, UCL"}, "6701693410": {"Name": "Balloux F.", "AuthorID": "6701693410", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Genetics Institute, UCL"}, "57194422240": {"Name": "Bassam H.", "AuthorID": "57194422240", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "CoMPLEX, UCL"}, "7403910584": {"Name": "Walker A.S.", "AuthorID": "7403910584", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60003108", "AffiliationName": "MRC Clinical Trials Unit at UCL, UCL"}, "7201775981": {"Name": "Klein N.", "AuthorID": "7201775981", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Child Health, UCL"}}}
