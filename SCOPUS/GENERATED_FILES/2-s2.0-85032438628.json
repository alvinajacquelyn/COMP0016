Design A UK multicentre, retrospective, observational study. Patients' medical records were reviewed for demographics, clinical outcomes and adverse events (AEs) to rifaximin-\u03b1. Details of hospital admissions/attendances in the 6 and 12 months pre-rifaximin-\u03b1 and postrifaximin- \u03b1 initiation were extracted from hospital electronic databases. Setting 13 National Health Service centres. Patients 207 patients with HE who initiated rifaximin-\u03b1 between July 2008 and May 2014. Hospital resource use data were available for 145/207 patients. Main outcome measure Change in mean number of liver-related hospital bed days/patient (total and critical care) between the 6 months pre-rifaximin-\u03b1 and post-rifaximin-\u03b1 initiation. Results Comparing the 6 months pre-rifaximin-\u03b1 and post-rifaximin-\u03b1 initiation in alive patients at the end of the observation period (N=114): there were significant reductions in the mean number of hospitalisations/patient (liver-related 1.3 to 0.5, p<0.0.001; all-cause 1.9 to 0.9, p<0.0.001), hospital bed days/patient (liver-related 17.8 to 6.8, p<0.0.001; all-cause 25.4 to 10.6, p<0.0.001), 30-day hospital readmissions/patient (liver-related 0.5 to 0.2, p=0.039; all-cause 0.8 to 0.4, p=0.024) and emergency department (ED) attendances/patient (all-cause, 1.0 to 0.5, p<0.0.001). The mean critical care bed days/ patient reduced significantly for all-cause admissions (1.3 to 0.3, p=0.049); non-significant reduction for liver-related admissions. 4% of patients (9/207) developed AEs. Conclusions In UK clinical practice, treatment with rifaximin-\u03b1 for HE is well-tolerated and associated with significant reductions in hospitalisations, bed days (including critical care), ED attendances and 30-day readmissions.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85032438628", "SubjectAreas": [["Hepatology", "MEDI", "2721"], ["Gastroenterology", "MEDI", "2715"]], "AuthorData": {"57213909228": {"Name": "Hudson M.", "AuthorID": "57213909228", "AffiliationID": "60018514", "AffiliationName": "Liver Unit, Freeman Hospital"}, "57189389462": {"Name": "Radwan A.", "AuthorID": "57189389462", "AffiliationID": "119701939", "AffiliationName": "UK Medical Affairs, Norgine"}, "57196260989": {"Name": "Di Maggio P.", "AuthorID": "57196260989", "AffiliationID": "119701939", "AffiliationName": "UK Medical Affairs, Norgine"}, "36616807600": {"Name": "Cipelli R.", "AuthorID": "36616807600", "AffiliationID": "60112101", "AffiliationName": "PH Assoc."}, "57202647273": {"Name": "Ryder S.D.", "AuthorID": "57202647273", "AffiliationID": "60025016, 60015138, 60172935", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Unit in Gastrointestinal and Liver Diseases, Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust, University of Nottingham"}, "7201523314": {"Name": "DIllon J.F.", "AuthorID": "7201523314", "AffiliationID": "60171138, 60008877", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gastroenterology, Ninewells Hospital and the School of Medicine, University of Dundee"}, "35769057700": {"Name": "Cash W.J.", "AuthorID": "35769057700", "AffiliationID": "60008028", "AffiliationName": "Liver Unit, Royal Victoria Hospital"}, "6601983897": {"Name": "Przemioslo R.T.", "AuthorID": "6601983897", "AffiliationID": "60016447", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gastroenterology, Southmead Hospital"}, "9532830200": {"Name": "Wright M.", "AuthorID": "9532830200", "AffiliationID": "60000703", "AffiliationName": "Department of Hepatology, University Hospital Southampton"}, "6603656382": {"Name": "Shawcross D.L.", "AuthorID": "6603656382", "AffiliationID": "60021923, 60177635", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Liver Studies and Transplantation, King's College London School of Medicine, King's College Hospital"}, "7005505892": {"Name": "Jalan R.", "AuthorID": "7005505892", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60032819", "AffiliationName": "Liver Failure Group, University College London Institute for Liver and Digestive Health, Royal Free Hospital"}, "57190072200": {"Name": "Saksena S.", "AuthorID": "57190072200", "AffiliationID": "60015208", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gastroenterology, University Hospital of North Durham"}, "7102381712": {"Name": "Allison M.", "AuthorID": "7102381712", "AffiliationID": "60017488", "AffiliationName": "Cambridge Biomedical Research Centre, Addenbrooke's Hospital"}, "9742814700": {"Name": "Richardson P.", "AuthorID": "9742814700", "AffiliationID": "60160274", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Royal Liverpool and Broadgreen University Hospitals NHS Trust"}, "56347483000": {"Name": "Farrington E.", "AuthorID": "56347483000", "AffiliationID": "60028495", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Royal Cornwall Hospital"}, "56452657300": {"Name": "Aspinall R.J.", "AuthorID": "56452657300", "AffiliationID": "60030999", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Queen Alexandra Hospital"}}}
