In this article, the successes and limitations of biomolecular simulation and the further developments that are likely in the near future are discussed. A brief overview is also provided of the experimental biophysical methods that are commonly used to probe biomolecular structure and dynamics, and the accuracy of the information that can be obtained from each is compared with that from modelling. It is concluded that progress towards an accurate spatial and temporal model of biomacromolecules requires a combination of all of these biophysical techniques, both experimental and computational.", "AuthorKeywords": ["biomolecular simulation", "computational techniques Crystallography and complementary methods"], "IndexKeywords": ["Computer Simulation", "Crystallography, X-Ray", "Molecular Dynamics Simulation", "Nucleic Acids", "Proteins", "Quantum Theory"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84921719484", "SubjectAreas": [["Structural Biology", "BIOC", "1315"]], "AuthorData": {"57217450277": {"Name": "Gray A.", "AuthorID": "57217450277", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "Edinburgh Parallel Computing Centre, University of Edinburgh"}, "6603789552": {"Name": "Harlen O.G.", "AuthorID": "6603789552", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "School of Mathematics, University of Leeds"}, "56679086700": {"Name": "Read D.J.", "AuthorID": "56679086700", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "School of Mathematics, University of Leeds"}, "7403484884": {"Name": "Harris S.A.", "AuthorID": "7403484884", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "Astbury Centre for Structural Molecular Biology, University of Leeds"}, "56493993600": {"Name": "Richardson R.A.", "AuthorID": "56493993600", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "School of Physics and Astronomy, University of Leeds"}, "7401994245": {"Name": "Pearson A.R.", "AuthorID": "7401994245", "AffiliationID": "60028229", "AffiliationName": "Hamburg Centre for Ultrafast Imaging, University of Hamburg"}, "7005011249": {"Name": "Khalid S.", "AuthorID": "7005011249", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Natural and Environmental Sciences, University of Southampton"}, "37059325200": {"Name": "Leung Y.M.", "AuthorID": "37059325200", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Natural and Environmental Sciences, University of Southampton"}, "35488072400": {"Name": "Lonsdale R.", "AuthorID": "35488072400", "AffiliationID": "60012556", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Philipps-Universit\u00e4t Marburg"}, "7004313834": {"Name": "Mulholland A.J.", "AuthorID": "7004313834", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Computational Chemistry, University of Bristol"}}}
