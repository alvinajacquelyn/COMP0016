Whether post-operative serum transaminases are a good indicator of IR injury and subsequent graft and patient survival in human liver transplantation remains controversial. A single centre prospectively collected liver transplant database was analysed for the period 1988-2012. All patients were followed up for 5 years or until graft failure. Transaminase levels on the 1st, 3rd and 7th post-operative days were correlated with the patient demographics, operative outcomes, post-operative complications and both graft and patient survival via a binary logistic regression analysis. Graft and patient survival at 3 months was 80.3% and 87.5%. AST levels on the 3rd (P = 0.005) and 7th (P = 0.001) post-operative days correlated with early graft loss. Patients were grouped by their AST level (day 3): <107iU, 107-1213iU, 1213-2744iU and >2744iU. The incidence of graft loss at 3 months was 10%, 12%. 27% and 59% and 1-year patient mortality was 12%, 14%, 27% and 62%. Day 3 AST levels correlate with patient and graft outcome postliver transplantation and would be a suitable surrogate endpoint for clinical trials in liver transplantation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["AST", "graft loss", "liver transplantation", "mortality", "outcome", "surrogate endpoint"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Aspartate Aminotransferases", "Child", "Clinical Trials as Topic", "Female", "Graft Survival", "Humans", "Liver Transplantation", "London", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Postoperative Period", "Prospective Studies", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84958659456", "SubjectAreas": [["Transplantation", "MEDI", "2747"]], "AuthorData": {"56730197200": {"Name": "Robertson F.P.", "AuthorID": "56730197200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Surgery and Interventional Science, Royal Free Campus, University College London (UCL)"}, "57190856911": {"Name": "Thomas N.", "AuthorID": "57190856911", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Surgery and Interventional Science, Royal Free Campus, University College London (UCL)"}, "7102974662": {"Name": "Fuller B.", "AuthorID": "7102974662", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Surgery and Interventional Science, Royal Free Campus, University College London (UCL)"}, "7402965763": {"Name": "Davidson B.R.", "AuthorID": "7402965763", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "HPB and Liver Transplant Unit, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "12140451500": {"Name": "Bessell P.R.", "AuthorID": "12140451500", "AffiliationID": "60026158, 60027272", "AffiliationName": "School of Veterinary Medicine, Roslyn Institute, University of Edinburgh, Easter Bush"}, "26032066000": {"Name": "Diaz-Nieto R.", "AuthorID": "26032066000", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "HPB and Liver Transplant Unit, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "6701544680": {"Name": "Rolando N.", "AuthorID": "6701544680", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "HPB and Liver Transplant Unit, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
