Design: A randomized controlled trial design. Setting: Intervention and assessment took place in the home environment. Participants: A total of 12 people with spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 were randomized into a therapy or control group. Both groups received identical assessments at baseline, four and eight weeks. Interventions: Therapy group participants undertook balance exercises in front of optokinetic stimuli during weeks 4-8, while control group participants received no intervention. Main measures: Test'retest reliability was analysed from outcome measures collected twice at baseline and four weeks later. Feasibility issues were evaluated using daily diaries and end trial exit interviews. Results: The home-based training intervention with opto-kinetic stimuli was feasible for people with pure ataxia, with one drop-out. Test'retest reliability is strong (intraclass correlation coefficient >0.7) for selected outcome measures evaluating balance at impairment and activity levels. Some measures reveal trends towards improvement for those in the therapy group. Sample size estimations indicate that Bal-SARA scores could detect a clinically significant change of 0.8 points in this functional balance score if 80 people per group were analysed in future trials. Conclusions: Home-based targeted training of functional balance for people with pure cerebellar ataxia is feasible and the outcome measures employed are reliable.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Balance", "cerebellar disease", "opto-kinetic training", "rehabilitation", "spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 (SCA6)"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cerebellar Diseases", "Feasibility Studies", "Female", "Home Care Services", "Humans", "Kinetics", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Postural Balance", "Reproducibility of Results"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84922582962", "SubjectAreas": [["Physical Therapy, Sports Therapy and Rehabilitation", "HEAL", "3612"], ["Rehabilitation", "MEDI", "2742"]], "AuthorData": {"36247137500": {"Name": "Bunn L.M.", "AuthorID": "36247137500", "AffiliationID": "60024779", "AffiliationName": "School of Health Professions, Peninsula Allied Health Centre, University of Plymouth"}, "7203036220": {"Name": "Day B.L.", "AuthorID": "7203036220", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Sobell Department of Motor Neuroscience and Movement Disorders, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "6603845190": {"Name": "Giunti P.", "AuthorID": "6603845190", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "37081457800": {"Name": "Marsden J.F.", "AuthorID": "37081457800", "AffiliationID": "60024779", "AffiliationName": "School of Health Professions, Peninsula Allied Health Centre, University of Plymouth"}}}
