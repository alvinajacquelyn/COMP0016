This paper examines the battle over the Argentine consumer price index (CPI) between 2007 and 2015. It argues that in this dispute the index became the object of political struggle rather than a methodological controversy. The main characteristics of the Argentine CPI, its trajectory and the country\u2019s inflationary history influenced the type of debate and the dispute that was possible and feasible. The battle was linked to the erosion of confidence in and social support for official statistics and to the emergence of alternative price indices. Both processes seriously undermined the government's ability to control inflation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Argentina", "consumer price index", "statistical controversies"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85063693986", "SubjectAreas": [["History", "ARTS", "1202"], ["Economics and Econometrics", "ECON", "2002"], ["Social Sciences (all)", "SOCI", "3300"]], "AuthorData": {"55181353100": {"Name": "Daniel C.", "AuthorID": "55181353100", "AffiliationID": "60004518", "AffiliationName": "Claudia J.
