The responsiveness of embryonic cardiomyocytes (E) 12 to P2 receptor agonists by measuring Ca2+ influx did not present response to ATP, but responses to P2 agonists were detected in cardiomyocytes taken from E14 and E18 rats. Photometry revealed that the responses to ATP were concentration-dependent with an EC50 of 1.32 \u03bcM and 0.18 \u03bcM for E14 and E18 cardiomyocytes, respectively. In addition, other P2 agonists were also able to induce Ca2+ mobilization. RT-PCR showed the presence of P2X2 and P2X4 receptor transcripts on E14 cardiomyocytes with a lower expression of P2X3 and P2X7 receptors. P2X1 and a low level of P2X5 receptor messenger RNA (mRNA) were also expressed at E18. Immunofluorescence data indicated that only P2X2 and P2X4 receptor proteins were expressed in E14 cardiomyocytes while protein for all the P2X receptor subtypes was expressed in E18, except for P2X3 and P2X6. Responses mediated by agonists specific for P2Y receptors subtypes showed that P2Y receptors (P2Y1, P2Y2, P2Y4 and P2Y6) were also present in both E14 and E18 cardiomyocytes. Dye transfer experiments showed that ATP induces coupling of cells at E12, but this response is decreased at E14 and lost at E18. Conversely, UTP induced coupling with five or more cells in most cells from E12 to E18. Our results show that specific P2 receptor subtypes are present in embryonic rat cardiomyocytes, including P2X7 and P2Y4 receptors that have not been identified in adult rat cardiomyocytes. The responsiveness to ATP stimulation even before birth, suggests that ATP may be an important messenger in embryonic as well as in adult hearts.", "AuthorKeywords": ["ATP", "Calcium mobilization", "Cardiomyocyte", "FLIPR", "Heart", "P1 receptors", "P2X receptors", "P2Y receptors", "Rat embryo"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adenosine Triphosphate", "Animals", "Calcium", "Myocytes, Cardiac", "Purinergic Agonists", "Rats", "Receptors, Purinergic P2", "Signal Transduction"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84925482031", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"7402406736": {"Name": "Cheung K.K.", "AuthorID": "7402406736", "AffiliationID": "60026553", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics, The University of Melbourne"}, "6602590448": {"Name": "Coutinho-Silva R.", "AuthorID": "6602590448", "AffiliationID": "60000036", "AffiliationName": "Biophysics Institute Carlos Chagas Filho, Federal University of Rio de Janeiro"}, "36037094600": {"Name": "Burnstock G.", "AuthorID": "36037094600", "AffiliationID": "60026553", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics, The University of Melbourne"}, "23100466000": {"Name": "Marques-da-Silva C.", "AuthorID": "23100466000", "AffiliationID": "60000036", "AffiliationName": "Biophysics Institute Carlos Chagas Filho, Federal University of Rio de Janeiro"}, "35575166000": {"Name": "Vairo L.", "AuthorID": "35575166000", "AffiliationID": "60000036", "AffiliationName": "Biophysics Institute Carlos Chagas Filho, Federal University of Rio de Janeiro"}, "56871129000": {"Name": "dos Santos D.S.", "AuthorID": "56871129000", "AffiliationID": "60000036", "AffiliationName": "Biophysics Institute Carlos Chagas Filho, Federal University of Rio de Janeiro"}, "7102387209": {"Name": "Goldenberg R.", "AuthorID": "7102387209", "AffiliationID": "60000036", "AffiliationName": "Biophysics Institute Carlos Chagas Filho, Federal University of Rio de Janeiro"}}}
