By combining digitally addressable LEDs with an off-the-shelf microcontroller (Arduino), multiple LEDs can be controlled independently and with a high degree of temporal, chromatic, and luminance precision. The proposed solution is safe (can be powered by a 5-V battery), tested (has been used in published research), inexpensive (\u223c $60 + $2 per LED), highly interoperable (can be controlled by any type of computer/operating system via a USB or Bluetooth connection), requires no prior knowledge of electrical engineering (components simply require plugging together), and uses widely available components for which established help forums already exist. Matlab code is provided, including a \u2018minimal working example\u2019 of use suitable for use by beginners. Properties of the recommended LEDs are also characterized, including their response time, luminance profile, and color gamut. Based on these, it is shown that the LEDs are highly stable in terms of both luminance and chromaticity, and do not suffer from issues of warm-up, chromatic shift, and slow response times associated with traditional CRT and LCD monitor technology.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Arduino", "Color gamut", "Light emitting diode", "Luminance", "Timing"], "IndexKeywords": ["Lighting", "Microcomputers", "Photic Stimulation", "Software"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84944909623", "SubjectAreas": [["Experimental and Cognitive Psychology", "PSYC", "3205"], ["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"], ["Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)", "ARTS", "1201"], ["Psychology (miscellaneous)", "PSYC", "3201"], ["Psychology (all)", "PSYC", "3200"]], "AuthorData": {"57079316000": {"Name": "Jones P.", "AuthorID": "57079316000", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London (UCL)"}, "56857137900": {"Name": "Garcia S.", "AuthorID": "56857137900", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London (UCL)"}, "8249732800": {"Name": "Nardini M.", "AuthorID": "8249732800", "AffiliationID": "60022175", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Durham University"}}}
