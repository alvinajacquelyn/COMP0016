{"Title": "An investigation of cortical neuroplasticity following stroke in adults: Is there evidence for a critical window for rehabilitation?", "Year": 2015, "Source": "BMC Neurol.", "Volume": "15", "Issue": 1, "Art.No": null, "PageStart": null, "PageEnd": null, "CitedBy": 15, "DOI": "10.1186/s12883-015-0356-7", "Link": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84936888831&origin=inward", "Abstract": "\u00a9 2015 McDonnell et al.Background: Evidence in animal stroke models suggests that neuroplasticity takes place maximally in a specific time window after an ischaemic lesion, which may coincide with the optimal time to intervene with rehabilitation. The aim of this study is to investigate neurophysiological evidence for a \"critical window\" of enhanced neuroplasticity in patients following ischaemic stroke, and establish its duration. We will also investigate changes in cortical inhibition following stroke, and the influence this has on functional recovery. Methods/Design: We will recruit participants recently admitted to the Stroke Unit of major metropolitan hospitals who have had a stroke and can provide informed consent. Participants will be excluded if they have any contraindications to Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation. We will compare neurophysiological outcomes in an age-matched healthy control group. We conservatively hypothesise a 5 % increase in neuroplasticity at the optimal timing following stroke, compared to control participants, and require 43 patients following stroke to detect a significant difference with 80 % power. The primary outcome is the change in the motor evoked potential (MEP) amplitude in a hand muscle, after the administration of a plasticity-inducing paradigm to the affected hemisphere. Secondary outcomes include measures of cortical excitability, intracortical inhibition and arm function. Discussion: The data from this trial will clarify whether there is a critical window for neuroplastic change in the brain following stroke. If so, intensive rehabilitation during this period could be more effective, reducing long-term disability and the cost burden of stroke.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Critical window", "Neuroplasticity", "Stroke"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Evoked Potentials, Motor", "Hand", "Humans", "Muscle, Skeletal", "Neuronal Plasticity", "Recovery of Function", "Stroke Rehabilitation", "Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84936888831", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"8205875100": {"Name": "McDonnell M.N.", "AuthorID": "8205875100", "AffiliationID": "60031846", "AffiliationName": "University of South Australia, School of Health Sciences, Alliance for Research in Exercise, Nutrition and Activity, International Centre for Allied Health Evidence, Sansom Institute for Health Research"}, "6603818794": {"Name": "Koblar S.", "AuthorID": "6603818794", "AffiliationID": "60009512, 60108899, 60189793", "AffiliationName": "University of Adelaide, School of Medicine, South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute"}, "7102178423": {"Name": "Ward N.S.", "AuthorID": "7102178423", "AffiliationID": "60020736", "AffiliationName": "The National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "55455767400": {"Name": "Rothwell J.C.", "AuthorID": "55455767400", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London Institute of Neurology, Sobell Department of Motor Neuroscience"}, "55240211400": {"Name": "Hordacre B.", "AuthorID": "55240211400", "AffiliationID": "60189792, 60009512", "AffiliationName": "University of Adelaide, Neuromotor Plasticity and Development Research Group, Robinson Research Institute, School of Paediatrics and Reproductive Health"}, "7004077220": {"Name": "Ridding M.C.", "AuthorID": "7004077220", "AffiliationID": "60189792, 60009512", "AffiliationName": "University of Adelaide, Neuromotor Plasticity and Development Research Group, Robinson Research Institute, School of Paediatrics and Reproductive Health"}}}
