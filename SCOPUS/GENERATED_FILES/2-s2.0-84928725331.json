Kinase dysfunction can lead to disease, making them an attractive target for drug design. The B-Raf kinase is a key target for the treatment of melanoma since a single mutation (V600E) is found in more than 50% of all malignant melanomas. Despite the importance of B-Raf in melanoma treatment, the molecular mechanism by which the mutation increases kinase activity remains elusive. Since kinases are tightly regulated by a conformational transition between an active and inactive state, which is difficult to capture experimentally, large-scale enhanced-sampling simulations are performed to examine the mechanism by which the V600E mutation enhances the activity of the B-Raf monomer. The results reveal that the mutation has a twofold effect. First, the mutation increases the barrier of the active to inactive transition trapping B-Raf in the active state. The mutation also increases the flexibility of the activation loop which might speed-up the rate-limiting step of phosphorylation. Both effects can be explained by the formation of salt-bridges with the Glu600 residue.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Activation loops", "Active dynamics", "Cellular process", "Conformational transitions", "Enhanced samplings", "Malignant melanoma", "Molecular mechanism", "Rate-limiting steps", "Catalytic Domain", "Humans", "Melanoma", "Molecular Dynamics Simulation", "Point Mutation", "Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84928725331", "SubjectAreas": [["Catalysis", "CENG", "1503"], ["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Colloid and Surface Chemistry", "CENG", "1505"]], "AuthorData": {"24073290800": {"Name": "Marino K.", "AuthorID": "24073290800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "23393975500": {"Name": "Sutto L.", "AuthorID": "23393975500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "6603509498": {"Name": "Gervasio F.", "AuthorID": "6603509498", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}}}
