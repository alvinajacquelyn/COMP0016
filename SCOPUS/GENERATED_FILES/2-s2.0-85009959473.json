The IEA also estimates that space heating demand in the global residential stock has grown by only 5% between 2002 and 2012, despite increases in total populations, households, incomes and expectations of thermal comfort. Energy policy directed at the residential stock has sought to manage and shift energy demand through changes in occupant practices, operations, and building fabric performance.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Building energy use", "Building fabrics", "Energy demands", "Heating demand", "International energy agency", "Rebound effect", "Residential building", "Residential stock"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85009959473", "SubjectAreas": [["Civil and Structural Engineering", "ENGI", "2205"], ["Building and Construction", "ENGI", "2215"]], "AuthorData": {"35310292700": {"Name": "Hamilton I.", "AuthorID": "35310292700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
