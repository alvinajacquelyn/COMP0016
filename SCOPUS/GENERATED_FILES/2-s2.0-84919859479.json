But is it just college students who overestimate the success they will have in the labor market, or is this something common to all young adults?

My findings suggest that young people in employment actually make worse predictions of their future income (on average) than certain student groups, so long as the latter successfully obtain a university degree.", "AuthorKeywords": ["college students", "income expectations", "occupational expectations"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84919859479", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["Economics and Econometrics", "ECON", "2002"]], "AuthorData": {"54418736800": {"Name": "Jerrim J.", "AuthorID": "54418736800", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Education, University of London"}}}
