The macroscopic behaviour associated with such processes is remarkably diverse, ranging from simple nucleated growth to highly cooperative processes with a well-defined lagtime. Thus, conventionally, different molecular mechanisms have been used to explain the self-assembly of different proteins. Here we show that this range of behaviour can be quantitatively captured by a single unifying Petri net that describes filamentous growth in terms of aggregate number and aggregate mass concentrations. By considering general features associated with a particular network connectivity, we are able to establish directly the rate-determining steps of the overall aggregation reaction from the system's scaling behaviour. We illustrate the power of this framework on a range of different experimental and simulated aggregating systems. The approach is general and will be applicable to any future extensions of the reaction network of filamentous self-assembly.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Alzheimer's disease", "Biological phenomena", "Filamentous growth", "Highly cooperatives", "Molecular mechanism", "Naturally occurring", "Network connectivity", "Rate determining step"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85030099585", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"]], "AuthorData": {"54795619000": {"Name": "Meisl G.", "AuthorID": "54795619000", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge"}, "55386223400": {"Name": "Rajah L.", "AuthorID": "55386223400", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge"}, "15041790900": {"Name": "Cohen S.", "AuthorID": "15041790900", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge"}, "7007094071": {"Name": "Vendruscolo M.", "AuthorID": "7007094071", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge"}, "56623994700": {"Name": "Dobson C.", "AuthorID": "56623994700", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge"}, "14012356200": {"Name": "Knowles T.", "AuthorID": "14012356200", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge"}, "57191572196": {"Name": "Pfammatter M.", "AuthorID": "57191572196", "AffiliationID": "60022699, 60019619", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neuropathology, University Hospital of Zurich"}, "7102605630": {"Name": "Aguzzi A.", "AuthorID": "7102605630", "AffiliationID": "60022699, 60019619", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neuropathology, University Hospital of Zurich"}, "23669259400": {"Name": "\u0160ari\u0107 A.", "AuthorID": "23669259400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, Institute for the Physics of Living Systems, University College London"}, "36082300500": {"Name": "Hellstrand E.", "AuthorID": "36082300500", "AffiliationID": "60118754, 60029170", "AffiliationName": "Chemistry Department and Molecular Protein Science, Lund University"}, "7004924118": {"Name": "Linse S.", "AuthorID": "7004924118", "AffiliationID": "60118754, 60029170", "AffiliationName": "Chemistry Department and Molecular Protein Science, Lund University"}, "26647423400": {"Name": "Buell A.", "AuthorID": "26647423400", "AffiliationID": "60025310", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Physical Biology, University of Duesseldorf"}}}
