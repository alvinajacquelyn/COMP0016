Studies have demonstrated that self-testing for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is highly acceptable among individuals and could allow cost savings, compared with provider-delivered HIV testing and counseling (PHTC), although the longer-term population-level effects are uncertain. We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of introducing self-testing in 2015 over a 20-year time frame in a country such as Zimbabwe. Methods. The HIV synthesis model was used. Two scenarios were considered. In the reference scenario, self-testing is not available, and the rate of first-time and repeat PHTC is assumed to increase from 2015 onward, in line with past trends. In the intervention scenario, self-testing is introduced at a unit cost of $3. Results. We predict that the introduction of self-testing would lead to modest savings in healthcare costs of $75 million, while averting around 7000 disability-adjusted life-years over 20 years. Findings were robust to most variations in assumptions; however, higher cost of self-testing, lower linkage to care for people whose diagnosis is a consequence of a positive self-test result, and lower threshold for antiretroviral therapy eligibility criteria could lead to situations in which self-testing is not cost-effective. Conclusions. This analysis suggests that introducing self-testing offers some health benefits and may well save costs.", "AuthorKeywords": ["cost-effectiveness", "diagnostic", "HIV", "mathematical modeling", "self-testing"], "IndexKeywords": ["Anti-HIV Agents", "Cost-Benefit Analysis", "Developing Countries", "Global Health", "HIV Infections", "Humans", "Models, Biological", "Poverty", "Prevalence", "Self Care", "Stochastic Processes", "Time Factors", "Zimbabwe"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84939626138", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"35361474300": {"Name": "Cambiano V.", "AuthorID": "35361474300", "AffiliationID": "115622577", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Infection and Population Health"}, "54385574100": {"Name": "Nakagawa F.", "AuthorID": "54385574100", "AffiliationID": "115622577", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Infection and Population Health"}, "35372648800": {"Name": "Phillips A.", "AuthorID": "35372648800", "AffiliationID": "115622577", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Infection and Population Health"}, "7401568316": {"Name": "Ford D.", "AuthorID": "7401568316", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60003108", "AffiliationName": "MRC Clinical Trials Unit, University College London"}, "57203479433": {"Name": "Miners A.", "AuthorID": "57203479433", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Health Services Research and Policy, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "55192732700": {"Name": "Revill P.", "AuthorID": "55192732700", "AffiliationID": "60016418", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Health Economics, University of York"}, "55855324800": {"Name": "Mabugu T.", "AuthorID": "55855324800", "AffiliationID": "60033774", "AffiliationName": "University of Zimbabwe Clinical Research Centre"}, "24166634200": {"Name": "Mugurungi O.", "AuthorID": "24166634200", "AffiliationID": "60043616", "AffiliationName": "Ministry of Health and Child Welfare Zimbabwe"}, "26423906100": {"Name": "Napierala Mavedzenge S.", "AuthorID": "26423906100", "AffiliationID": "60032205", "AffiliationName": "Women's Global Health Imperative, RTI International"}}}
