Methods: Initial data were collected within the framework of the international project HAPIEE in 2006\u20132008. A random sample of 7115 individuals aged 45\u201372 years was screened. Deaths were evaluated by death register of Kaunas city (Lithuania) in a follow-up study till 2016. Psychological well-being was evaluated by a CASP-12 questionnaire. Socio-demographic, lifestyle, biologic factors and depressive symptoms were evaluated. Results: Age-adjusted survival curves revealed that psychological well-being predicts longevity in men and women (p < 0.001). After adjustment for many possible confounders psychological well-being was independently associated with all-cause mortality in men (HR 0.77; 95% CI 0.62\u20130.94) and women (HR 0.73; 95% CI 0.56\u20130.96). However, psychological well-being association with cardiovascular mortality attained statistical significance only in the women\u2019s group (HR 0.53; 95% CI 0.33\u20130.87), but not in men (HR 0.98; 95% CI 0.72\u20131.33). Conclusions: Psychological well-being is an important predictor of longevity, controlling well-recognized risk factors such as age, education, cardiovascular diseases, social status, marital status, lifestyle and biological factors and depressive symptoms. Positive psychological well-being should be taken into account when screening older people to prevent negative health outcomes.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Mortality", "Psychological well-being"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Cardiovascular Diseases", "Cause of Death", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Humans", "Life Style", "Lithuania", "Longevity", "Longitudinal Studies", "Male", "Marital Status", "Mental Disorders", "Mental Health", "Middle Aged", "Risk Factors", "Surveys and Questionnaires"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85059700870", "SubjectAreas": [["Epidemiology", "MEDI", "2713"], ["Health (social science)", "SOCI", "3306"], ["Social Psychology", "PSYC", "3207"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"57211811198": {"Name": "Tamosiunas A.", "AuthorID": "57211811198", "AffiliationID": "60064285, 60109642", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiology, Medical Academy, Lithuanian University of Health Sciences"}, "12779256900": {"Name": "Luksiene D.", "AuthorID": "12779256900", "AffiliationID": "60064285, 60109642", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiology, Medical Academy, Lithuanian University of Health Sciences"}, "57196263385": {"Name": "Virviciute D.", "AuthorID": "57196263385", "AffiliationID": "60064285, 60109642", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiology, Medical Academy, Lithuanian University of Health Sciences"}, "55503855700": {"Name": "Sapranaviciute-Zabazlajeva L.", "AuthorID": "55503855700", "AffiliationID": "60109642", "AffiliationName": "Health Psychology Department, Lithuanian University of Health Sciences"}, "8681509900": {"Name": "Peasey A.", "AuthorID": "8681509900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Epidemiology and Health Care, University College London"}}}
