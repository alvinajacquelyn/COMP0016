However, drawing on an analysis of 92 policy documents from six different European countries, this article demonstrates that enduring differences remain\u2013at least in so far as constructions of students are concerned. While European policy may assume that higher education students can move unproblematically across national borders, as part of the Erasmus mobility scheme, for example, the article shows that understandings of \u2018the student\u2019 differ in significant ways both across countries and, to some extent, within them. This has implications for both European policy and academic theorisation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Europe", "Higher education", "policy", "students"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85065427849", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"]], "AuthorData": {"7402358771": {"Name": "Brooks R.", "AuthorID": "7402358771", "AffiliationID": "60021097", "AffiliationName": "Department of Sociology, University of Surrey"}}}
