Both platelet granules and endothelial Weibel-Palade bodies (WPBs) are members of lysosome-related organelles (LROs) whose formation is regulated by HPS protein associated complexes such as BLOC (biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles complex) -1, -2, -3, AP-3 (adaptor protein complex-3) and HOPS (homotypic fusion and protein sorting complex). Von Willebrand factor (VWF) is critical to hemostasis, which is stored in a highly-multimerized form as tubules in the WPBs. In this study, we found the defective, but varying, release of VWF into plasma after desmopressin (DDAVP) stimulation in HPS1 (BLOC-3 subunit), HPS6 (BLOC-2 subunit), and HPS9 (BLOC-1 subunit) deficient mice. In particular, VWF tubulation, a critical step in VWF maturation, was impaired in HPS6 deficient WPBs. This likely reflects a defective endothelium, contributing to the bleeding tendency in HPS mice or patients. The differentially defective regulated release of VWF in these HPS mouse models suggests the need for precise HPS genotyping before DDAVP administration to HPS patients.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Biogenesis of lysosome-related organells complex", "Hemostasis", "Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome", "von Willebrand factor", "Weibel-Palade bodies"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Deamino Arginine Vasopressin", "Endothelial Cells", "Genotype", "Homeostasis", "Humans", "Mice", "Protein Conformation", "Vesicular Transport Proteins", "von Willebrand Factor"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85007206646", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"]], "AuthorData": {"56609472400": {"Name": "Ma J.", "AuthorID": "56609472400", "AffiliationID": "60014277, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Molecular Developmental Biology, Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "56768375900": {"Name": "Li W.", "AuthorID": "56768375900", "AffiliationID": "60112647", "AffiliationName": "Center of Alzheimer's Disease, Beijing Institute for Brain Disorders"}, "27567808900": {"Name": "Kriston-Vizi J.", "AuthorID": "27567808900", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60010269", "AffiliationName": "MRC Laboratory for Molecular Cell Biology, University College of London"}, "7102733325": {"Name": "Cutler D.", "AuthorID": "7102733325", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60010269", "AffiliationName": "MRC Laboratory for Molecular Cell Biology, University College of London"}, "56191629900": {"Name": "Zhang Z.", "AuthorID": "56191629900", "AffiliationID": "60014277, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Molecular Developmental Biology, Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "55569854200": {"Name": "Yang L.", "AuthorID": "55569854200", "AffiliationID": "60014277, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Molecular Developmental Biology, Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}}}
