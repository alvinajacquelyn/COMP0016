Satisfaction with Life After Meningitis is a brief multidimensional measure of health related quality of life that is reliable and correlates with criterion variables in a theoretically meaningful way. To develop a Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) measure for adolescent and young adult survivors of (IMD) we used a cross-sectional study and focus groups. The study was conducted in two phases. In Phase 1 a pool of potential items were generated based on the following: a review of existing measures, focus groups with IMD survivors, and an expert group consultation. Phase 2 involved administration of the questionnaire to a sample of adolescent and young adult IMD survivors. Factor analysis suggested a correlated four factor solution: Wellbeing, Positive about Future, Social Support, and Confidence. These factors were significantly correlated in a theoretically predictable way with scores from the Beck Depression Inventory (correlations ranged from \u22120.77 to \u22120.81) and the eight domains of the SF-36 Health Survey (correlations ranged from 0.32 to 0.79). The reliability of all subscales was high ranging from 0.85 to 0.92. The Satisfaction with Life After Meningitis (SLAM) questionnaire is a HRQoL self-report measure that produces reliable scores and is appropriate for use with young survivors of IMD. There is also evidence of concurrent validity with existing measures of physical and psychological well-being.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Adolescence", "Health related quality of life", "Invasive meningococcal disease", "Questionnaire", "Young adults"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84985040901", "SubjectAreas": [["Life-span and Life-course Studies", "SOCI", "3319"]], "AuthorData": {"7004128606": {"Name": "Shevlin M.", "AuthorID": "7004128606", "AffiliationID": "60020730", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, Faculty of Life and Health Sciences, University of Ulster at Magee Campus"}, "56269666600": {"Name": "Coen P.G.", "AuthorID": "56269666600", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Child Health, Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary College, University of London"}, "7102261420": {"Name": "Borg J.", "AuthorID": "7102261420", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "7005899067": {"Name": "Viner R.M.", "AuthorID": "7005899067", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "7006741817": {"Name": "Booy R.", "AuthorID": "7006741817", "AffiliationID": "60026571, 60025709", "AffiliationName": "National Centre for Immunisastion research and Surveillance, Children\u2019s Hospital at Westmead and University of Sydney and Sydney Institute of Emerging Infectious Diseases and Biosecurity"}, "7102638286": {"Name": "Christie D.", "AuthorID": "7102638286", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Paediatric and Adolescent Psychology, University College London Hospitals"}}}
