FTD may be associated with chronic immune dysfunction, microglial activation and raised inflammatory markers, particularly in progranulin (GRN) mutation carriers. Levels of soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (sTREM2) are elevated in Alzheimer's disease (AD), but they have not been fully explored in FTD. Methods: We investigated whether cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sTREM2 levels differ between FTD and controls, across different clinical and genetic subtypes of FTD, or between individuals with FTD due to AD versus non-AD pathology (based on CSF neurodegenerative biomarkers). We also assessed relationships between CSF sTREM2 and other CSF biomarkers (total tau [T-tau], tau phosphorylated at position threonine-181 [P-tau] and \u03b2-amyloid 1-42 [A\u03b242]) and age and disease duration. Biomarker levels were measured using immunoassays in 17 healthy controls and 64 patients with FTD (behavioural variant FTD, n = 20; primary progressive aphasia, n = 44). Ten of 64 had familial FTD, with mutations in GRN (n = 3), MAPT (n = 4), or C9orf72 (n = 3). Fifteen of 64 had neurodegenerative biomarkers consistent with AD pathology (11 of whom had logopenic variant PPA). Levels were compared using multivariable linear regressions. Results: CSF sTREM2 levels did not differ between FTD and controls or between clinical subgroups. However, GRN mutation carriers had higher levels than controls (mean ([SD] = 9.7 [2.9] vs. 6.8 [1.6] ng/ml; P = 0.028) and MAPT (3.9 [1.5] ng/ml; P = 0.003] or C9orf72 [4.6 [1.8] ng/ml; P = 0.006) mutation carriers. Individuals with AD-like CSF had higher sTREM2 levels than those with non-AD-like CSF (9.0 [3.6] vs. 6.9 [3.0] ng/ml; P = 0.029). CSF sTREM2 levels were associated with T-tau levels in control and FTD groups and also with P-tau in those with FTD and AD-like CSF. CSF sTREM2 levels were influenced by both age and disease duration in FTD. Conclusions: Although CSF sTREM2 levels are not raised in FTD overall or in a particular clinical subtype of FTD, levels are raised in familial FTD associated with GRN mutations and in FTD syndromes due to AD pathology. Because CSF sTREM2 levels correlate with a marker of neuronal injury (T-tau), sTREM2 should be explored as a biomarker of disease intensity in future longitudinal studies of FTD.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cerebrospinal fluid", "Frontotemporal dementia", "Microglia", "Neuroinflammation", "Progranulin", "TREM2"], "IndexKeywords": ["Age Factors", "Aged", "Amyloid beta-Peptides", "Aphasia, Primary Progressive", "C9orf72 Protein", "Cohort Studies", "Female", "Frontotemporal Dementia", "Gene Expression Regulation", "Humans", "Male", "Membrane Glycoproteins", "Middle Aged", "Peptide Fragments", "Phosphorylation", "Receptors, Immunologic", "Statistics, Nonparametric", "tau Proteins"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85051631118", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"]], "AuthorData": {"35243804200": {"Name": "Woollacott I.O.C.", "AuthorID": "35243804200", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dementia Research Centre, Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "57189237366": {"Name": "Dick K.M.", "AuthorID": "57189237366", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dementia Research Centre, Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "57194327207": {"Name": "Russell L.L.", "AuthorID": "57194327207", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dementia Research Centre, Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "55799312800": {"Name": "Paterson R.W.", "AuthorID": "55799312800", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dementia Research Centre, Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "55034699600": {"Name": "Keshavan A.", "AuthorID": "55034699600", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dementia Research Centre, Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "7201444328": {"Name": "Fox N.C.", "AuthorID": "7201444328", "AffiliationID": "119181883", "AffiliationName": "UK Dementia Research Institute"}, "35557252600": {"Name": "Warren J.D.", "AuthorID": "35557252600", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dementia Research Centre, Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "7103177641": {"Name": "Schott J.M.", "AuthorID": "7103177641", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dementia Research Centre, Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "14020386900": {"Name": "Rohrer J.D.", "AuthorID": "14020386900", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dementia Research Centre, Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "25630004900": {"Name": "Nicholas J.M.", "AuthorID": "25630004900", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Statistics, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "36463576300": {"Name": "Heslegrave A.", "AuthorID": "36463576300", "AffiliationID": "119181883", "AffiliationName": "UK Dementia Research Institute"}, "57202685041": {"Name": "Heller C.", "AuthorID": "57202685041", "AffiliationID": "119181883", "AffiliationName": "UK Dementia Research Institute"}, "57193198963": {"Name": "Foiani M.S.", "AuthorID": "57193198963", "AffiliationID": "119181883", "AffiliationName": "UK Dementia Research Institute"}, "6701454676": {"Name": "Zetterberg H.", "AuthorID": "6701454676", "AffiliationID": "60027675, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry and Neurochemistry, Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg"}}}
