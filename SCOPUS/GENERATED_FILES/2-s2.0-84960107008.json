The methodology departs from the traditional performance assessment of contact tanks via hydraulic efficiency indicators, as it simulates directly transport and decay of the disinfectant, inactivation of pathogens and accumulation of by-products. The method is applied to study the effects of inlet and compartment design on contact tank performance, with special emphasis on turbulent mixing and minimisation of internal recirculation and short-circuiting. In contrast to the conventional approach of maximising the length-to-width ratio, the proposed design changes are aimed at addressing and mitigating adverse hydrodynamic structures, which have historically led to poor hydraulic efficiency in many existing contact tanks. The results suggest that water treatment facilities can benefit from in-depth analyses of the flow and kinetic processes through computational fluid dynamics, resulting in up to 38 % more efficient pathogen inactivation and 14 % less disinfection by-product formation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Chlorine contact tanks", "Numerical simulation", "Reactor hydrodynamics", "Residence time distribution", "Water disinfection"], "IndexKeywords": ["Contact tanks", "Disinfection by product formations", "Hydrodynamic structures", "Internal recirculations", "Performance assessment", "Three-dimensional numerical models", "Water disinfections", "Water treatment facilities"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84960107008", "SubjectAreas": [["Environmental Science (all)", "ENVI", "2300"]], "AuthorData": {"55350827400": {"Name": "Angeloudis A.", "AuthorID": "55350827400", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "Hydro-environmental Research Centre, School of Engineering, Cardiff University"}, "6507316700": {"Name": "Stoesser T.", "AuthorID": "6507316700", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "Hydro-environmental Research Centre, School of Engineering, Cardiff University"}, "57160765800": {"Name": "Falconer R.A.", "AuthorID": "57160765800", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "Hydro-environmental Research Centre, School of Engineering, Cardiff University"}, "7006067309": {"Name": "Gualtieri C.", "AuthorID": "7006067309", "AffiliationID": "60017293", "AffiliationName": "Civil, Construction and Environmental Engineering Department (DICEA), University of Napoli \u201cFederico II\u201d"}}}
