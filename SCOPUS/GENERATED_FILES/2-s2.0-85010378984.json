Methods Data from two studies (conducted between 2010 and 2014) were pooled. A total of 526 patients on hemodialysis (68.8% with diabetes) completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Elevated symptoms were defined as HADS-Anxiety or HADS-Depression \u2265 8. Univariate and multivariate logistic regressions were used to estimate associations between diabetic status, and other socio-demographic and clinical factors with baseline clinical anxiety and depression. Results A total of 233 (45.4%) reported elevated anxiety symptoms and 256 (49.9%) reported elevated depressive symptoms sufficient for caseness. Rates were not different between patients with and without diabetes. Risk for clinical depression was higher in patients who were single/unpartnered (OR = 1.828), Chinese vs. Malay (OR = 2.05), or had lower albumin levels (OR = 0.932). None of the parameters were associated with anxiety caseness. Conclusion Sociocultural factors rather than comorbid burden may help identify patients at risk for depression. The high rates of anxiety and depression underlie the importance for monitoring and intervention in dialysis care.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Anxiety", "Depression", "Diabetes mellitus", "End-stage renal disease"], "IndexKeywords": ["Anxiety", "Comorbidity", "Depression", "Diabetes Complications", "Female", "Humans", "Kidney Failure, Chronic", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Prevalence", "Renal Dialysis"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85010378984", "SubjectAreas": [["Clinical Psychology", "PSYC", "3203"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"56671310100": {"Name": "Yoong R.K.", "AuthorID": "56671310100", "AffiliationID": "60017161", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, National University of Singapore"}, "56530070700": {"Name": "Lee V.Y.", "AuthorID": "56530070700", "AffiliationID": "60017161", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, National University of Singapore"}, "56023243200": {"Name": "Kang A.W.", "AuthorID": "56023243200", "AffiliationID": "60017161", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, National University of Singapore"}, "6602428057": {"Name": "Griva K.", "AuthorID": "6602428057", "AffiliationID": "60017161", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, National University of Singapore"}, "36739590800": {"Name": "Mooppil N.", "AuthorID": "36739590800", "AffiliationID": "100798756", "AffiliationName": "National Kidney Foundation Singapore"}, "26654817200": {"Name": "Khoo E.Y.", "AuthorID": "26654817200", "AffiliationID": "60106366", "AffiliationName": "Division of Endocrinology, University Medicine Cluster, National University Health System"}, "55808072084": {"Name": "Newman S.P.", "AuthorID": "55808072084", "AffiliationID": "60025704", "AffiliationName": "City University London"}}}
