HCWs have higher rates of latent and active TB than the general population due to persistent occupational TB exposure, particularly in settings where there is a high prevalence of undiagnosed TB in healthcare facilities and TB infection control (TB-IC) programmes are absent or poorly implemented. Occupational health programmes in high TB burden settings are often weak or non-existent and thus data that record the extent of the increased risk of occupational TB globally are scarce. HCWs represent a limited resource in high TB burden settings and occupational TB can lead to workforce attrition. Stigma plays a role in delayed diagnosis, poor treatment outcomes and impaired well-being in HCWs who develop TB. Ensuring the prioritization and implementation of TB-IC interventions and occupational health programmes, which include robust monitoring and evaluation, is critical to reduce nosocomial TB transmission to patients and HCWs. The provision of preventive therapy for HCWs with latent TB infection (LTBI) can also prevent progression to active TB. Unlike other patient groups, HCWs are in a unique position to serve as agents of change to raise awareness, advocate for necessary resource allocation and implement TB-IC interventions, with appropriate support from dedicated TB-IC officers at the facility and national TB programme level. Students and community health workers (CHWs) must be engaged and involved in these efforts. Nosocomial TB transmission is an urgent public health problem and adopting rights-based approaches can be helpful. However, these efforts cannot succeed without increased political will, supportive legal frameworks and financial investments to support HCWs in efforts to decrease TB transmission.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Consumer Advocacy", "Cross Infection", "Female", "Health Personnel", "Human Rights", "Humans", "Infection Control", "Infectious Disease Transmission, Patient-to-Professional", "Infectious Disease Transmission, Professional-to-Patient", "Laboratory Personnel", "Latent Tuberculosis", "Male", "Occupational Diseases", "Occupational Exposure", "Occupational Health Services", "Return to Work", "Risk Factors", "Students, Medical", "Tuberculosis"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85013997132", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"24080902600": {"Name": "Nathavitharana R.R.", "AuthorID": "24080902600", "AffiliationID": "60030058", "AffiliationName": "Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Division of Infectious Diseases"}, "57193438604": {"Name": "Bond P.", "AuthorID": "57193438604", "AffiliationID": "115072084", "AffiliationName": "TB Proof"}, "26221608000": {"Name": "Dramowski A.", "AuthorID": "26221608000", "AffiliationID": "60001565", "AffiliationName": "Paediatric Infectious Diseases, Stellenbosch University, Department of Paediatrics and Child Health"}, "56563149500": {"Name": "Kotze K.", "AuthorID": "56563149500", "AffiliationID": "100488551", "AffiliationName": "East London Hospital Complex"}, "56446505900": {"Name": "Lederer P.", "AuthorID": "56446505900", "AffiliationID": "60029929", "AffiliationName": "Massachusetts General Hospital, Division of Infectious Diseases"}, "56535819000": {"Name": "Peters J.A.", "AuthorID": "56535819000", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, Faculty of Infectious and Tropical Diseases, Clinical Research Department"}, "57193444553": {"Name": "Rossouw C.", "AuthorID": "57193444553", "AffiliationID": "115072084", "AffiliationName": "TB Proof"}, "56563022300": {"Name": "van der Westhuizen H.M.", "AuthorID": "56563022300", "AffiliationID": "100488551", "AffiliationName": "East London Hospital Complex"}, "55615920300": {"Name": "Willems B.", "AuthorID": "55615920300", "AffiliationID": "60001565", "AffiliationName": "Stellenbosch University, Division of Community Health, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences"}, "57189069161": {"Name": "Ting T.X.", "AuthorID": "57189069161", "AffiliationID": "60009426", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Research Center, Sarawak General Hospital"}, "56563095500": {"Name": "von Delft A.", "AuthorID": "56563095500", "AffiliationID": "60000356", "AffiliationName": "School of Public Health and Family Medicine, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Cape Town"}, "56072307200": {"Name": "von Delft D.", "AuthorID": "56072307200", "AffiliationID": "115072084", "AffiliationName": "TB Proof"}, "7006170723": {"Name": "Zumla A.", "AuthorID": "7006170723", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "University College London, and NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, University College London Hospital, Division of Infection and Immunity"}, "57193440174": {"Name": "Oxley I.", "AuthorID": "57193440174", "AffiliationID": "60007279", "AffiliationName": "Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University, Dietetics Division"}, "27267515900": {"Name": "Duarte R.", "AuthorID": "27267515900", "AffiliationID": "60026373", "AffiliationName": "Centro Hospitalar de Vila Nova de Gaia"}, "7004112585": {"Name": "Nardell E.", "AuthorID": "7004112585", "AffiliationID": "60016782", "AffiliationName": "Brigham and Women's Hospital, Division of Global Health and Social Medicine"}}}
