This study aimed to determine the outcome of kidneys initially declined for paediatric recipients and establish renal allograft survival in kidneys that were eventually transplanted. Methods: Data were obtained from the UK Transplant Registry for all donation after brain death (DBD) kidneys offered and declined to paediatric recipients (< 18 years) in the UK from 2009 to 2014. Results: Eighty-two percent (503/615) of kidneys initially declined for paediatric transplantation were eventually transplanted, 7% (46/615) of kidneys went to paediatric recipients and 62% (384/615) of kidneys went to adult (kidney only) recipients. The remainder were used for multiple organ transplants. In the 46 kidneys that went to paediatric recipients, 1 and 3-year renal allograft survivals were 89% (95% CI 75.8\u201395.3%) and 82% (95% CI 67.1\u201390.6%), respectively. In the 384 kidneys given to adult kidney-only recipients, 1 and 3-year renal allograft survivals were 96% (95% CI 93.5\u201397.6%) and 94% (95% CI 90.7\u201396.1%), respectively. Eighty-four percent of the 204 children who initially had an offer declined on their behalf were eventually transplanted and have a functioning graft at a median 3-year follow-up. Conclusions: This study reports acceptable short-term renal allograft survival in kidneys that were initially declined for paediatric recipients and subsequently transplanted. Evidence-based guidelines are required to ensure that the most appropriate kidneys are selected for paediatric recipients.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Paediatric nephrology", "Renal transplantation", "Transplant outcomes"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Allografts", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Donor Selection", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Graft Survival", "Humans", "Infant", "Kidney", "Kidney Failure, Chronic", "Kidney Transplantation", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Practice Guidelines as Topic", "Prospective Studies", "Registries", "Retrospective Studies", "Time Factors", "Transplantation, Homologous", "United Kingdom", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85047664791", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Nephrology", "MEDI", "2727"]], "AuthorData": {"57208565754": {"Name": "Marlais M.", "AuthorID": "57208565754", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "8889557300": {"Name": "Marks S.D.", "AuthorID": "8889557300", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Nephrology, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}, "18344619000": {"Name": "Pankhurst L.", "AuthorID": "18344619000", "AffiliationID": "60030968", "AffiliationName": "NHS Blood and Transplant"}, "57213757243": {"Name": "Martin K.", "AuthorID": "57213757243", "AffiliationID": "60030968", "AffiliationName": "NHS Blood and Transplant"}, "27868025600": {"Name": "Mumford L.", "AuthorID": "27868025600", "AffiliationID": "60030968", "AffiliationName": "NHS Blood and Transplant"}, "6602081871": {"Name": "Tizard E.J.", "AuthorID": "6602081871", "AffiliationID": "60170515", "AffiliationName": "University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
