This challenges the interpretation of fetal growth variability as 'adaptation'. We hypothesized that associations of maternal size and nutritional status with neonatal size are mediated by the dimensions of the maternal pelvis. We analysed data on maternal height, body mass index (BMI) and pelvic dimensions (conjugate, inter-spinous and inter-cristal diameters) and neonatal gestational age, weight, length, thorax girth and head girth (n = 224). Multiple regression analysis was used to identify independent maternal predictors of neonatal size, and the mediating role of neonatal head girth in these associations. Pelvic dimensions displaced maternal BMI as a predictor of birth weight, explaining 11.6% of the variance. Maternal conjugate and inter-spinous diameters predicted neonatal length, thorax girth and head girth, whereas inter-cristal diameter only predicted neonatal length. Associations of pelvic dimensions with birth length, but not birth weight, were mediated by neonatal head girth. Pelvic dimensions predicted neonatal size better than maternal BMI, and these associations were mostly independent of maternal height. Sensitivity of fetal growth to pelvic dimensions reduces the risk of cephalo-pelvic disproportion, potentially a strong selective pressure during secular trends in height. Selection on fetal adaptation to relatively inflexible components of maternal phenotype, rather than directly to external ecological conditions, may help explain high levels of growth plasticity during late fetal life and early infancy.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Adaptation", "Birth weight", "Developmental plasticity", "Fetal growth", "Maternal pelvis"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85051685025", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (miscellaneous)", "MEDI", "2701"], ["Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics", "AGRI", "1105"], ["Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis", "ENVI", "2307"]], "AuthorData": {"55603815000": {"Name": "Wells J.C.K.", "AuthorID": "55603815000", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Population, Policy and Practice Programme, Childhood Nutrition Research Centre, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "6506703146": {"Name": "Figueiroa J.N.", "AuthorID": "6506703146", "AffiliationID": "60069336", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatrics and Statistics Unit, Faculdade Pernambucana de Sa\u00fade (FPS), Medical School, Instituto de Medicina Integral Professor Fernando Figueira (IMIP)"}, "7102351372": {"Name": "Alves J.G.", "AuthorID": "7102351372", "AffiliationID": "60069336", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatrics and Statistics Unit, Faculdade Pernambucana de Sa\u00fade (FPS), Medical School, Instituto de Medicina Integral Professor Fernando Figueira (IMIP)"}}}
