Materials and methods: Twenty-six patients with refractory LUTS were diagnosed with a urethral stricture. The symptoms, the treatment performed and the outcomes were prospectively recorded. Sixteen patients were treated with a urethroplasty using a buccal mucosal graft (BMG) in 14 cases (54 %) and a vaginal flap in 2 (8 %). Urethral dilatation, optical urethrotomy and meatoplasty were performed in 8 (31 %), 1 (3.8 %) and 1 (3.8 %) patients, respectively. Results: Strictures were idiopathic in 11 patients (42 %). Previous urethral instrumentation and traumatic vaginal delivery were the commonest causes of urethral stricture (42 and 15 %, respectively). The most frequent symptoms were reduced flow (93 %), detrusor overactivity (50 %) and UTIs (42 %). The stricture was cured in 93 % of patients treated with a BMG urethroplasty and in all the patients in which a vaginal flap urethroplasty was performed. In the same group, the improvement in urethral pain was observed in the 67 and the 88 % of patients were cured from recurrent UTIs. All the patients treated with urethral dilatation needed further dilatations; hence, the cure of the stricture was achieved in none of them. Improvement in urethral pain, UTIs and detrusor activity was not recorded in the latter group. Conclusion: Urethroplasty in its various forms has demonstrated in the present series the highest cure rate for the treatment of recurrent urethral stricture.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Buccal mucosa graft", "Female", "Stricture", "Urethra", "Urethroplasty"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Cohort Studies", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Humans", "Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Middle Aged", "Patient Satisfaction", "Reconstructive Surgical Procedures", "Recurrence", "Retrospective Studies", "Risk Assessment", "Severity of Illness Index", "Treatment Outcome", "Ultrasonography, Doppler", "Urethral Stricture", "Urodynamics", "Urologic Surgical Procedures"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84990849850", "SubjectAreas": [["Urology", "MEDI", "2748"]], "AuthorData": {"35225313500": {"Name": "Spilotros M.", "AuthorID": "35225313500", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, University College London Hospital"}, "43261497500": {"Name": "Malde S.", "AuthorID": "43261497500", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, University College London Hospital"}, "57190621213": {"Name": "Solomon E.", "AuthorID": "57190621213", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, University College London Hospital"}, "57209911412": {"Name": "Grewal M.", "AuthorID": "57209911412", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, University College London Hospital"}, "57191475078": {"Name": "Mukhtar B.M.", "AuthorID": "57191475078", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, University College London Hospital"}, "57189294591": {"Name": "Pakzad M.", "AuthorID": "57189294591", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, University College London Hospital"}, "55851940397": {"Name": "Hamid R.", "AuthorID": "55851940397", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, University College London Hospital"}, "6506281538": {"Name": "Ockrim J.L.", "AuthorID": "6506281538", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, University College London Hospital"}, "7004415688": {"Name": "Greenwell T.J.", "AuthorID": "7004415688", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, University College London Hospital"}}}
