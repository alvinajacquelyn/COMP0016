To achieve an optimally tuned adaptive response, it is critical that the magnitude of the stress response matches the severity of the threat. Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) released from the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus is a major regulator of theHPAaxis. However,howCRH-producing neurons in an intact animal respond to different stressor intensities is currently not known. Using two-photon calcium imaging on intact larval zebrafish, we recorded the activity of CRH cells, while the larvae were exposed to stressors of varying intensity. By combining behavioral and physiological measures, we first determined how sudden alterations in environmental conditions lead to different levels of stress axis activation. Then, we measured changes in the frequency and amplitude of Ca2+ transients in individual CRH neurons in response to such stressors. The response magnitude of individual CRH cells covaried with stressor intensity. Furthermore, stressors caused the recruitment of previously inactive CRH neurons in an intensity-dependent manner, thus increasing the pool of responsive CRH cells. Strikingly, stressor-induced activity appeared highly synchronized among CRH neurons, and also across hemispheres. Thus, the stressor strength-dependent output of CRH neurons emerges by a dual mechanism that involves both the increased activity of individual cells and the recruitment of a larger pool of responsive cells. The synchronicity ofCRHneurons within and across hemispheres ensures that the overall output of the HPA axis matches the severity of the threat.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Calcium imaging", "Corticotropin releasing hormone", "HPA axis", "Stress", "Synchronicity", "Zebrafish"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Animals, Genetically Modified", "Avoidance Learning", "Calcium", "Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone", "Gene Expression Regulation", "Heat-Shock Proteins", "Hydrocortisone", "Hypothalamus", "Larva", "Luminescent Proteins", "Membrane Potentials", "Motor Activity", "Neurons", "Stress, Physiological", "Zebrafish"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84961285314", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"]], "AuthorData": {"56398557400": {"Name": "vom Berg-Maurer C.M.", "AuthorID": "56398557400", "AffiliationID": "116461538", "AffiliationName": "Developmental Genetics of the Nervous System"}, "57213759225": {"Name": "De Marco R.J.", "AuthorID": "57213759225", "AffiliationID": "116461538", "AffiliationName": "Developmental Genetics of the Nervous System"}, "10340643000": {"Name": "Ryu S.", "AuthorID": "10340643000", "AffiliationID": "60014117", "AffiliationName": "Developmental Genetics of the Nervous System, Max Planck Institute for Medical Research"}, "56653710000": {"Name": "Trivedi C.A.", "AuthorID": "56653710000", "AffiliationID": "60014117", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomedical Optics, Neural Circuits and Behavior Research Group, Max Planck Institute for Medical Research"}, "7003297714": {"Name": "Bollmann J.H.", "AuthorID": "7003297714", "AffiliationID": "60014117", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomedical Optics, Neural Circuits and Behavior Research Group, Max Planck Institute for Medical Research"}}}
