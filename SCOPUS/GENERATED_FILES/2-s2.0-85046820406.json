Poverty, malnutrition, and food insecurity are high in Nepal and may have been aggravated by the 2008 food price crisis. To assess the potential impact of the food price crisis on the affordability of a nutritionally adequate diet in the rural plains of Nepal, data on consumption patterns and local food prices were used to construct typical food baskets, consumed by four different wealth groups in Dhanusha district in 2005 and 2008. A modelled diet designed to meet household requirements for energy and essential nutrients at minimum cost, was also constructed using the \u2018Cost of Diet\u2019 linear programming tool, developed by Save the Children. Between 2005 and 2008, the cost of the four typical food baskets increased by 19% \u2013 26% and the cost of the nutritionally adequate modelled diet increased by 28%. Typical food baskets of all wealth groups were low in macro and micronutrients. Income data for the four wealth groups in 2005 and 2008 were used to assess diet affordability. The nutritionally adequate diet was not affordable for poorer households in both 2005 and 2008. Due to an increase in household income levels, the affordability scenario did not deteriorate further in 2008. Poverty constrained access to nutritionally adequate diets for rural households in Dhanusha, even before the 2008 food price crisis. Despite increased income in 2008, households remain financially unable to meet their nutritional requirements.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Food price crisis", "Food security", "Malnutrition", "Nutritionally Adequate Diet", "Poverty", "Typical food basket"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85046820406", "SubjectAreas": [["Food Science", "AGRI", "1106"], ["Development", "SOCI", "3303"], ["Agronomy and Crop Science", "AGRI", "1102"]], "AuthorData": {"26649803400": {"Name": "Akhter N.", "AuthorID": "26649803400", "AffiliationID": "60022175", "AffiliationName": "Wolfson Research Institute for Health and Wellbeing, Wolfson Building, Durham University Queen\u2019s Campus, University Boulevard"}, "23486721300": {"Name": "Saville N.", "AuthorID": "23486721300", "AffiliationID": "100774087", "AffiliationName": "Mother and Infant Research Activities"}, "6603217003": {"Name": "Osrin D.", "AuthorID": "6603217003", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute for Global Health"}, "54790609700": {"Name": "Costello A.", "AuthorID": "54790609700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute for Global Health"}, "7005158903": {"Name": "Seal A.", "AuthorID": "7005158903", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute for Global Health"}, "7006814651": {"Name": "Shrestha B.", "AuthorID": "7006814651", "AffiliationID": "100774087", "AffiliationName": "Mother and Infant Research Activities"}, "12767143700": {"Name": "Manandhar D.S.", "AuthorID": "12767143700", "AffiliationID": "100774087", "AffiliationName": "Mother and Infant Research Activities"}}}
