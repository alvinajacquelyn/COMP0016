Miniaturized accelerometers worn by athletes can be used to quantify mechanical aspects of running and as a noninvasive tool to assess training status and progression. The aim of this study was to define and validate a method to assess running regularity and allow the estimation of an individual\u2019s oxygen uptake (V\u00b7 O2) and/or blood lactate\u2014[La]b\u2014based on data collected with accelerometers and heart rate. Methods: Male adolescent endurance athletes completed an incremental submaximal aerobic stage test where V\u00b7 O2 and [La]b were measured. The test was terminated when [La]b concentration at the end of the stage exceeded 4 mmol/L. Two wireless triaxial accelerometers were placed on participants\u2019 right shank and lower back throughout the test. The root mean square (RMS) and sample entropy (SampEn) were calculated for the vertical, mediolateral, and anteroposterior components of acceleration. Results: There were significant positive correlations of acceleration and entropy variables with [La]b and V\u00b7 O2, with moderate to high coefficients (r = .43\u2013.87). RMS of the shank acceleration was the most highly related with both physiological variables. When the accelerometer was attached on the trunk, SampEn of the vertical acceleration had the strongest relationship with V\u00b7 O2 (r = .76, P < .01). Conclusions: The described method analyzing running complexity may allow an assessment of gait variability, which noninvasively tracks V\u00b7 O2 and/or [La]b, allowing monitoring of fatigue or training readiness for trained adolescent individuals.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Accelerometry", "Aerobic", "Gait", "Lactate", "Regularity"], "IndexKeywords": ["Accelerometry", "Adolescent", "Athletic Performance", "Biomechanical Phenomena", "Entropy", "Gait", "Heart Rate", "Humans", "Lactic Acid", "Male", "Oxygen Consumption", "Pilot Projects", "Running"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85032833548", "SubjectAreas": [["Orthopedics and Sports Medicine", "MEDI", "2732"], ["Physical Therapy, Sports Therapy and Rehabilitation", "HEAL", "3612"]], "AuthorData": {"56797352300": {"Name": "Murray A.M.", "AuthorID": "56797352300", "AffiliationID": "60106885", "AffiliationName": "Aspire Academy"}, "57196391005": {"Name": "Ryu J.H.", "AuthorID": "57196391005", "AffiliationID": "60106885", "AffiliationName": "Aspire Academy"}, "23992390400": {"Name": "Graham-Smith P.", "AuthorID": "23992390400", "AffiliationID": "60106885", "AffiliationName": "Aspire Academy"}, "7003493917": {"Name": "Cardinale M.", "AuthorID": "7003493917", "AffiliationID": "60106885", "AffiliationName": "Aspire Academy"}, "7004877860": {"Name": "Sproule J.", "AuthorID": "7004877860", "AffiliationID": "60176139, 60027272", "AffiliationName": "Moray House School of Education, University of Edinburgh"}, "35562611300": {"Name": "Turner A.P.", "AuthorID": "35562611300", "AffiliationID": "60176139, 60027272", "AffiliationName": "Moray House School of Education, University of Edinburgh"}}}
