Karger AG, Basel. All rights reserved.Purpose: The study aimed to assess the incidence of and risk factors leading to visual impairment and legal blindness in children with retinoblastoma. Procedures: This is a single-center, retrospective case series of all patients with bilateral retinoblastoma presenting from 2010 to 2014. Results: A total of 44 patients were included in the study. Visual impairment was present in 14 (38%) children, legal blindness was present in 7 (19%) children. Bilateral macular tumors (BMT) were associated with visual impairment (12 of 18 patients with BMT, 2 of 19 patients without BMT, p = 0.0006) and legal blindness (7 of 18 patients with BMT, 0 of 19 patients without BMT, p = 0.003).The International Intraocular Retinoblastoma Classification (IIRC) of the better eye also predicted visual impairment (16% in IIRC Group A-C, 75% in IIRC Group D, E, p = 0.004) and blindness (3% eye in IIRC Group A-C, 50% in Group D, E, p = 0.005). Various non-Snellen visual acuity measures were able to predict visual impairment in pre-verbal children, providing them with early assistance. Conclusions: The rates of visual impairment and blindness reported in this paper can be used to counsel families regarding the risk of binocular visual impairment. Early detection and support for visually impaired infants are essential as development can be affected by severe visual impairment.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Blindness", "Retinoblastoma", "Visual impairment"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85060269470", "SubjectAreas": [["Nursing (all)", "NURS", "2900"]], "AuthorData": {"51864897600": {"Name": "Stacey A.W.", "AuthorID": "51864897600", "AffiliationID": "60015481", "AffiliationName": "University of Washington, Department of Ophthalmology"}, "57202651914": {"Name": "Clarke B.", "AuthorID": "57202651914", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "35310047800": {"Name": "Fabian I.D.", "AuthorID": "35310047800", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57203054292": {"Name": "Sagoo M.S.", "AuthorID": "57203054292", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "30667492100": {"Name": "Ashwin Reddy M.", "AuthorID": "30667492100", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57205497590": {"Name": "Moraitis C.", "AuthorID": "57205497590", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "56583376300": {"Name": "Smith V.", "AuthorID": "56583376300", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital"}}}
