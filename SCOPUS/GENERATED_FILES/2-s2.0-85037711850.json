All rights reserved.This protocol describes a method developed to identify endogenous peptides in human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). For this purpose, a previously developed method based on molecular weight cut-off (MWCO) filtration and mass spectrometric analysis was combined with an offline high-pH reverse phase HPLC pre-fractionation step. Secretion into CSF is the main pathway for removal of molecules shed by cells of the central nervous system. Thus, many processes in the central nervous system are reflected in the CSF, rendering it a valuable diagnostic fluid. CSF has a complex composition, containing proteins that span a concentration range of 8 - 9 orders of magnitude. Besides proteins, previous studies have also demonstrated the presence of a large number of endogenous peptides. While less extensively studied than proteins, these may also hold potential interest as biomarkers. Endogenous peptides were separated from the CSF protein content through MWCO filtration. By removing a majority of the protein content from the sample, it is possible to increase the sample volume studied and thereby also the total amount of the endogenous peptides. The complexity of the filtrated peptide mixture was addressed by including a reverse phase (RP) HPLC pre-fractionation step at alkaline pH prior to LC-MS analysis. The fractionation was combined with a simple concatenation scheme where 60 fractions were pooled into 12, analysis time consumption could thereby be reduced while still largely avoiding co-elution. Automated peptide identification was performed by using three different peptide/protein identification software programs and subsequently combining the results. The different programs were complementary rather than comparable with less than 15% of the identifications overlapped between the three.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alzheimer\u2019s disease", "Biomarkers", "Cerebrospinal fluid", "Endogenous peptides", "Issue 130", "LC-MS/MS", "Multiplexed isobaric labelling", "Neurodegeneration", "Neuroscience", "Peptidomics", "Pre-fractionation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cerebrospinal Fluid", "Chromatography, Liquid", "Humans", "Peptidomimetics", "Tandem Mass Spectrometry"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85037711850", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Immunology and Microbiology (all)", "IMMU", "2400"]], "AuthorData": {"57191903520": {"Name": "Hansson K.", "AuthorID": "57191903520", "AffiliationID": "60027675, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Inst. of Neuroscience and Physiology, Dept. of Psychiatry and Neurochemistry, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg"}, "55345176500": {"Name": "Skillb\u00e4ck T.", "AuthorID": "55345176500", "AffiliationID": "60031699", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Neurochemistry Laboratory, Sahlgrenska University Hospital"}, "57193546970": {"Name": "Pernevik E.", "AuthorID": "57193546970", "AffiliationID": "60027675, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Inst. of Neuroscience and Physiology, Dept. of Psychiatry and Neurochemistry, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg"}, "16238630700": {"Name": "Holm\u00e9n-Larsson J.", "AuthorID": "16238630700", "AffiliationID": "60027675, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Inst. of Neuroscience and Physiology, Dept. of Psychiatry and Neurochemistry, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg"}, "6602971570": {"Name": "Brinkmalm G.", "AuthorID": "6602971570", "AffiliationID": "60027675, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Inst. of Neuroscience and Physiology, Dept. of Psychiatry and Neurochemistry, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg"}, "56415176000": {"Name": "Blennow K.", "AuthorID": "56415176000", "AffiliationID": "60031699", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Neurochemistry Laboratory, Sahlgrenska University Hospital"}, "6701454676": {"Name": "Zetterberg H.", "AuthorID": "6701454676", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "6603847526": {"Name": "Gobom J.", "AuthorID": "6603847526", "AffiliationID": "60031699", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Neurochemistry Laboratory, Sahlgrenska University Hospital"}}}
