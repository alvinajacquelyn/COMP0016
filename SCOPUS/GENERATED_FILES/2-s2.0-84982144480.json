Ps atoms in Rydberg-Stark states with principal quantum number n=10 and electric dipole moments up to 610 D were prepared via two-color two-photon optical excitation in the presence of a 670 V cm-1 electric field. The Ps atoms were created at the entrance of a 0.4 m long electrostatic quadrupole guide, and were detected at the end of the guide via annihilation gamma radiation. When the lasers were tuned to excite low-field-seeking Stark states, a fivefold increase in the number of atoms reaching the end of the guide was observed, whereas no signal was detected when high-field-seeking states were produced. The data are consistent with the calculated geometrical guide acceptance.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Electrostatic quadrupole", "High field", "Inhomogeneous electric fields", "Low field", "Principal quantum numbers", "Rydberg Stark state", "Stark state", "Two photon"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84982144480", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"57213546896": {"Name": "Deller A.", "AuthorID": "57213546896", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "56662772200": {"Name": "Alonso A.", "AuthorID": "56662772200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "56662765500": {"Name": "Cooper B.", "AuthorID": "56662765500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "17434872000": {"Name": "Hogan S.", "AuthorID": "17434872000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "54790549500": {"Name": "Cassidy D.", "AuthorID": "54790549500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}}}
