We investigate various plausible explanations for this phenotypic adaptation, dismissing climatic change as a causal factor, and further rejecting the hypothesis that it was caused by an increase in the proportion of smaller adult females in the population. Instead we find some support for the hypothesis that the size decrease was driven by a demographic shift towards smaller newborns from sub-adult breeding as a result of intensifying meat production strategies during the Neolithic.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animal Husbandry", "Animals", "Animals, Domestic", "Animals, Newborn", "Archaeology", "Breeding", "Cattle", "Europe", "Female", "Male", "Phenotype"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84956852491", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"23392975700": {"Name": "Manning K.", "AuthorID": "23392975700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Archaeology, University College London"}, "6602927062": {"Name": "Shennan S.", "AuthorID": "6602927062", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Archaeology, University College London"}, "35361380600": {"Name": "Crema E.", "AuthorID": "35361380600", "AffiliationID": "60032942", "AffiliationName": "CaSEs- Complexity and Socio-Ecological Dynamics Research Group, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Department of Humanities"}, "55875310400": {"Name": "Timpson A.", "AuthorID": "55875310400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Genetics, Evolution and Environment, University College London"}}}
