Various statistical models have been proposed for predicting this, but they have important practical limitations. We present a Bayesian network model that can be used for maintenance decision support to overcome these limitations. The model extends an existing statistical model of asset deterioration, but shows how (1) data on the condition of assets available from their periodic inspection can be used, (2) failure data from related groups of asset can be combined using judgement from experts and (3) expert knowledge of the deterioration\u2019s causes can be combined with statistical data to adjust predictions. A case study of bridges on the rail network in Great Britain (GB) is presented, showing how the model could be used for the maintenance decision problem, given typical data likely to be available in practice.", "AuthorKeywords": ["available data", "Bayesian network", "deterioration", "expert knowledge", "GB rail bridges", "maintenance modelling"], "IndexKeywords": ["Asset deterioration", "available data", "Bayesian network models", "Expert knowledge", "Maintenance decision problems", "Maintenance decisions", "Periodic inspection", "Statistical modeling"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85054831764", "SubjectAreas": [["Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality", "ENGI", "2213"]], "AuthorData": {"57193740766": {"Name": "Zhang H.", "AuthorID": "57193740766", "AffiliationID": "60022109", "AffiliationName": "School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science, Queen Mary University of London"}, "57212474255": {"Name": "Marsh D.", "AuthorID": "57212474255", "AffiliationID": "60022109", "AffiliationName": "School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science, Queen Mary University of London"}}}
