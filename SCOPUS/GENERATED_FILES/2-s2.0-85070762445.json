Only two such unconformities are known to have been well preserved globally from the Ediacaran Period (in western Australia and central China). This paper provides the first full description of a spectacular subglacial landscape carved beneath ice masses in the Shimengou area of central China, with classical subglacial bed forms including general faceted forms, m\u00fcschelbruche, cavetto, spindle forms, and striations that testify to an abundance of meltwater during subglacial erosion. These features were produced during the southward, somewhat sinuous, flow of a temperate to polythermal ice mass.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Bed forms", "Bird's eye view", "Central chinas", "Ediacaran", "Ice mass", "Neoproterozoic", "Western Australia"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85070762445", "SubjectAreas": [["Geology", "EART", "1907"]], "AuthorData": {"57200017174": {"Name": "Le Heron D.P.", "AuthorID": "57200017174", "AffiliationID": "60025988", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geodynamics and Sedimentology, University of Vienna"}, "56800742700": {"Name": "Scharfenberg L.", "AuthorID": "56800742700", "AffiliationID": "60025988", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geodynamics and Sedimentology, University of Vienna"}, "57192830024": {"Name": "Vandyk T.M.", "AuthorID": "57192830024", "AffiliationID": "60020595", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography, Royal Holloway University of London"}, "33567807100": {"Name": "Davies B.", "AuthorID": "33567807100", "AffiliationID": "60020595", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography, Royal Holloway University of London"}, "16175538700": {"Name": "Kuang H.", "AuthorID": "16175538700", "AffiliationID": "60109828, 60061261", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Geology, Chinese Academy of Geological Sciences"}, "55919564400": {"Name": "Liu Y.", "AuthorID": "55919564400", "AffiliationID": "60109828, 60061261", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Geology, Chinese Academy of Geological Sciences"}, "57201213839": {"Name": "Chen X.", "AuthorID": "57201213839", "AffiliationID": "60109828, 60061261", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Geology, Chinese Academy of Geological Sciences"}, "57203769974": {"Name": "Wang Y.", "AuthorID": "57203769974", "AffiliationID": "60109828, 60061261", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Geology, Chinese Academy of Geological Sciences"}, "57210451486": {"Name": "Yang Z.", "AuthorID": "57210451486", "AffiliationID": "60109828, 60061261", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Geology, Chinese Academy of Geological Sciences"}, "57216628198": {"Name": "Shields G.", "AuthorID": "57216628198", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, University College London"}}}
