Published by Oxford University Press.Mirror neurons have been proposed to underlie humans' ability to understand others' actions and intentions. Despite 2 decades of research, however, the exact computational and neuronal mechanisms implied in this ability remain unclear. In the current study, we investigated whether, in the absence of contextual cues, regions considered to be part of the human mirror neuron system represent intention from movement kinematics. A total of 21 participants observed reach-to-grasp movements, performed with either the intention to drink or to pour while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging. Multivoxel pattern analysis revealed successful decoding of intentions from distributed patterns of activity in a network of structures comprising the inferior parietal lobule, the superior parietal lobule, the inferior frontal gyrus, and the middle frontal gyrus. Consistent with the proposal that parietal regions play a key role in intention understanding, classifier weights were higher in the inferior parietal region. These results provide the first demonstration that putative mirror neuron regions represent subtle differences in movement kinematics to read the intention of an observed motor act.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Action observation", "Intentions", "Kinematics", "Mirror neurons", "MVPA"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Biomechanical Phenomena", "Female", "Hand Strength", "Humans", "Image Processing, Computer-Assisted", "Intention", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Mirror Neurons", "Observation", "Parietal Lobe", "Psychomotor Performance", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85054773151", "SubjectAreas": [["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"]], "AuthorData": {"56556249900": {"Name": "Koul A.", "AuthorID": "56556249900", "AffiliationID": "60102151", "AffiliationName": "C'MON, Cognition, Motion and Neuroscience Unit, Fondazione Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia"}, "36933634300": {"Name": "Cauda F.", "AuthorID": "36933634300", "AffiliationID": "60012259", "AffiliationName": "Focus Lab, Department of Psychology, University of Torino"}, "7103357514": {"Name": "Costa T.", "AuthorID": "7103357514", "AffiliationID": "60012259", "AffiliationName": "Focus Lab, Department of Psychology, University of Torino"}, "55736418000": {"Name": "Diano M.", "AuthorID": "55736418000", "AffiliationID": "60012259", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, University of Torino"}, "57189022574": {"Name": "Becchio C.", "AuthorID": "57189022574", "AffiliationID": "60102151", "AffiliationName": "C'MON, Cognition, Motion and Neuroscience Unit, Fondazione Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia"}, "24340740000": {"Name": "Cavallo A.", "AuthorID": "24340740000", "AffiliationID": "60012259", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, University of Torino"}, "6603887035": {"Name": "Pontil M.", "AuthorID": "6603887035", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}}}
