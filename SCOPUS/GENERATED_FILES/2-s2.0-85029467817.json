However, findings from the Stockings of Cambridge (SOC) planning task suggest changes in processing speed associated with the illness may include faster responses in early stages of planning, though findings are inconsistent. This review uses meta-analytic methods to assess thinking times in psychosis across the available literature. Studies were identified by searching PubMed, Web of Science and Google Scholar. Eligibility criteria: 1) included a sample of people with non-affective psychosis according to DSM III, DSM IV, DSM V or ICD-10 criteria; 2) employed the SOC task; 3) included a healthy control group; and 4) published in English. We identified 11 studies that employed the SOC task. Results show that people with psychosis have significantly faster initial thinking times than non-clinical participants, but significantly slower subsequent thinking times during problem execution. These findings indicate that differences in processing speed are not limited to slower responses in people with psychosis but may reflect a preference for step-by-step processing rather than planning before task execution. We suggest this style of responding is adopted to compensate for working memory impairment.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cognition", "Executive function", "Processing speed, CANTAB", "Schizophrenia"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cognition Disorders", "Humans", "Memory Disorders", "Memory, Short-Term", "Psychotic Disorders", "Reaction Time", "Schizophrenic Psychology", "Thinking"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85029467817", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"], ["Biological Psychiatry", "NEUR", "2803"]], "AuthorData": {"56581079800": {"Name": "Watson A.", "AuthorID": "56581079800", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Sobell Department of Motor Neuroscience and Movement Disorders, University College London"}, "7006398244": {"Name": "Joyce E.", "AuthorID": "7006398244", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Sobell Department of Motor Neuroscience and Movement Disorders, University College London"}, "8923645900": {"Name": "Fugard A.", "AuthorID": "8923645900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London"}, "7801668191": {"Name": "Huddy V.", "AuthorID": "7801668191", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London"}, "6506287768": {"Name": "Leeson V.", "AuthorID": "6506287768", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Psychiatry, Imperial College London"}, "14524043100": {"Name": "Barnes T.", "AuthorID": "14524043100", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Psychiatry, Imperial College London"}}}
