The architecture of the radar enables both high sensitivity and range resolutions of <1.5 m. Moreover, the radar employs moving target indication (MTI) signal processing to remove the problematic primary wall reflection, allowing higher signal-to- noise and signal-to-interference ratios, which can be traded-off for increased operational stand-off. The TW radar operates at 5.8 GHz with a 200 MHz bandwidth. Its dual-frequency design minimises interference from signal leakage, and permits a baseband output after deramping which is digitized using an inexpensive 24-bit off-the-shelf sound card. The system is therefore an order of magnitude lower in cost than competitor ultrawideband (UWB) TW systems. The high sensitivity afforded by this wide dynamic range has allowed us to develop a wall removal technique whereby high-order digital filters provide a flexible means of MTI filtering based on the phases of the returned echoes. Experimental data demonstrates through-wall detection of individuals and groups of people in various scenarios. Target positions were located to within \u00b11.25 m in range, allowing us distinguish between two closely separated targets. Furthermore, at 8.5 m standoff, our wall removal technique can recover target responses that would have otherwise been masked by the primary wall reflection, thus increasing the stand-off capability of the radar. Using phase processing, our experimental data also reveals a clear difference in the micro-Doppler signatures across various types of everyday actions.", "AuthorKeywords": ["FMCW radar", "micro-Doppler", "moving target indication", "Through-wall radar"], "IndexKeywords": ["Activity detection", "FMCW radar", "FMCW radar systems", "Micro-Doppler", "Moving target indication", "Signal to interference ratio", "Through walls", "Wide dynamic range"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85021989214", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"34867832000": {"Name": "Chetty K.", "AuthorID": "34867832000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dept of Security and Crime Science, University College London"}, "56939438700": {"Name": "Chen Q.", "AuthorID": "56939438700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dept of Security and Crime Science, University College London"}, "36186273500": {"Name": "Ritchie M.", "AuthorID": "36186273500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dept. of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "7003652416": {"Name": "Woodbridge K.", "AuthorID": "7003652416", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dept. of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}}}
