Yet bottom-up approaches that could include behavior of users have not been well studied so far. We propose an agent-based model for the short time evolution of a bike-sharing system, with a focus on two strategical parameters that are the role of the quantity of information users have on the all system and the propensity of user to walk after having dropped their bike. We implement the model in a general way so it is applicable to every system as soon as data are available in a certain format. The model of simulation is parametrized and calibrated on processed real time-series of bike movements for the system of Paris. After showing the robustness of the simulations by validating internally and externally the model, we are able to test different user-based strategies for an increase of the level of service. In particular, we show that an increase of user information can have significant impact on the homogeneity of repartition of bikes in docking stations, and, what is important for an future implementation of the strategy, that an action on only 30% of regular users is enough to obtain most of the possible amelioration.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Agent-based modeling", "Bike-sharing transportation system", "Bottom-up complex system management"], "IndexKeywords": ["Agent-based model", "Bottom up approach", "Information users", "Management strategies", "Real time series", "System management", "Transportation system", "Working mechanisms"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84926036625", "SubjectAreas": [["Control and Systems Engineering", "ENGI", "2207"]], "AuthorData": {"57193993383": {"Name": "Raimbault J.", "AuthorID": "57193993383", "AffiliationID": "60105092", "AffiliationName": "LVMT, Ecole Nationale des Ponts et Chauss\u00e9es"}}}
