The contribution is made through revisiting the knowledge-its-own-end thesis associated with Newman and Hirst, Bildung-centred Didaktik and the Schwabian model of a liberal education. The central thesis is that if education is centrally concerned with the cultivation of human powers (capacities, ways of thinking, dispositions), then knowledge needs to be seen as an important resource for that cultivation. A theory of knowledge is needed that conceives the significance of knowledge in ways productive of this cultivation. Furthermore, a theory of content is needed that concerns how knowledge is selected and translated into curriculum content and how content can be analysed and unpacked in ways that open up manifold opportunities for cultivating human powers.", "AuthorKeywords": ["content", "curriculum", "Didaktik", "knowledge", "Liberal education", "Schwab"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85021658018", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"]], "AuthorData": {"7402665793": {"Name": "Deng Z.", "AuthorID": "7402665793", "AffiliationID": "60010940, 60005510", "AffiliationName": "National Institute of Education, Nanyang Technological University"}}}
