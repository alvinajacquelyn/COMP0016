The calculation underlying the simulation is enhanced with a process-specific implementation of the multi-scale improved NLO (Minlo) method, such that it gives physical predictions all through phase space, including regions where the jet additional to the t-channel single-top process is unresolved. We further describe a tuning procedure for the Minlo Sudakov form factor, fitting the coefficient of the first subleading term in its exponent using an artificial neural-network. The latter tuning, implemented as a straightforward event-by-event reweighting, renders the Minlo simulation NLO accurate for t-channel single-top observables, in addition to those of the analogous single-top plus jet process.", "AuthorKeywords": ["NLO Computations", "QCD Phenomenology"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85053682654", "SubjectAreas": [["Nuclear and High Energy Physics", "PHYS", "3106"]], "AuthorData": {"55415836800": {"Name": "Carrazza S.", "AuthorID": "55415836800", "AffiliationID": "60019778", "AffiliationName": "CERN, Theoretical Physics Department"}, "35285524400": {"Name": "Hamilton K.", "AuthorID": "35285524400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "57206150370": {"Name": "Zanderighi G.", "AuthorID": "57206150370", "AffiliationID": "60019778", "AffiliationName": "CERN, Theoretical Physics Department"}, "23982779800": {"Name": "Frederix R.", "AuthorID": "23982779800", "AffiliationID": "60117813, 60019722", "AffiliationName": "Physik Department T31, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen"}}}
