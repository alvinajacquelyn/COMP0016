The masker was a diotic 11-Hz wide noise centered on 500 Hz. The tonal signal was presented either diotically or dichotically (180\u00b0 interaural phase difference) with frequencies ranging from 400 to 600 Hz. The results and the modeling agree with previous data and hypotheses; simulations with a binaural model sensitive to monaural modulation cues show that the effect of duration on off-frequency binaural masking-level differences is mainly a result of modulation cues which are only available in the monaural detection of long signals.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Binaural masking", "Binaural masking-level differences", "Interaural phase differences", "Long duration", "Model simulation", "Model-sensitive", "Pattern datum", "Tonal signal"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85027287378", "SubjectAreas": [["Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)", "ARTS", "1201"], ["Acoustics and Ultrasonics", "PHYS", "3102"]], "AuthorData": {"35234663000": {"Name": "Nitschmann M.", "AuthorID": "35234663000", "AffiliationID": "60018362", "AffiliationName": "Department of Experimental Audiology, Otto von Guericke University"}, "7003818043": {"Name": "Verhey J.", "AuthorID": "7003818043", "AffiliationID": "60018362", "AffiliationName": "Department of Experimental Audiology, Otto von Guericke University"}, "57203606003": {"Name": "Yasin I.", "AuthorID": "57203606003", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "7102449400": {"Name": "Henning G.", "AuthorID": "7102449400", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}}}
