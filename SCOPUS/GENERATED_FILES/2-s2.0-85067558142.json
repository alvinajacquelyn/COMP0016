The platform performed unmanned kinetic experiments with the aim of precisely estimating the parameters of a kinetic model for the esterification between benzoic acid and ethanol catalysed by sulfuric acid. The capabilities of the autonomous platform were demonstrated on three different experimental scenarios: 1) performing steady-state experiments, where the experimental reaction conditions were pre-defined by the user; 2) performing steady-state experiments, where the conditions were optimised online by Model-Based Design of Experiments (MBDoE) algorithms, with the aim of improving parameter precision; 3) executing transient experiments, where the conditions were pre-selected by the user. For the steady-state experiments, the platform automatically performed online parameter estimation and MBDoE with a pre-selected kinetic model. It was demonstrated that a campaign of steady-state experiments designed using online MBDoE algorithms led to more precise parameter estimates than a campaign of experiments designed by the traditional factorial design. Transient experiments were shown to expedite kinetic parameter estimation and use less reagents than campaigns of steady-state experiments, as it was no longer necessary to wait for the system to reach steady-state. In general, the transient experiments offered less precise parameter estimates than the steady-state campaigns, however the experiments could be completed in just 2 h instead of the 8 h required for a campaign of steady-state experiments.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Autonomous platforms", "Model-based design of experiments", "On-line parameter estimations", "Parameter estimate", "Product concentration", "Rapid identification", "Reaction conditions", "Transient experiments"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85067558142", "SubjectAreas": [["Catalysis", "CENG", "1503"], ["Chemistry (miscellaneous)", "CHEM", "1601"], ["Chemical Engineering (miscellaneous)", "CENG", "1501"], ["Process Chemistry and Technology", "CENG", "1508"], ["Fluid Flow and Transfer Processes", "CENG", "1507"]], "AuthorData": {"56640992900": {"Name": "Waldron C.", "AuthorID": "56640992900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dept of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "57200073442": {"Name": "Pankajakshan A.", "AuthorID": "57200073442", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dept of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "57194192459": {"Name": "Quaglio M.", "AuthorID": "57194192459", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dept of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "9241458400": {"Name": "Cao E.", "AuthorID": "9241458400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dept of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "25029440500": {"Name": "Galvanin F.", "AuthorID": "25029440500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dept of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "7003522751": {"Name": "Gavriilidis A.", "AuthorID": "7003522751", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dept of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}}}
