We prove that the problem of computation of the commuting quantum chromatic number of a graph is solvable by an SDP algorithm and describe an hierarchy of variants of the commuting quantum chromatic number which converge to it. We introduce the tracial rank of a graph, a parameter that gives a lower bound for the commuting quantum chromatic number and parallels the projective rank, and prove that it is multiplicative. We describe the tracial rank, the projective rank and the fractional chromatic numbers in a unified manner that clarifies their connection with the commuting quantum chromatic number, the quantum chromatic number and the classical chromatic number, respectively. Finally, we present a new SDP algorithm that yields a parameter larger than the Lov\u00e1sz number and is yet a lower bound for the tracial rank of the graph. We determine the precise value of the tracial rank of an odd cycle.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Chromatic number", "Operator system", "Tensor product"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84958119291", "SubjectAreas": [["Analysis", "MATH", "2603"]], "AuthorData": {"6701483660": {"Name": "Paulsen V.", "AuthorID": "6701483660", "AffiliationID": "60005837", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University of Houston"}, "8984521800": {"Name": "Severini S.", "AuthorID": "8984521800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "35178372200": {"Name": "Stahlke D.", "AuthorID": "35178372200", "AffiliationID": "60027950", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Carnegie Mellon University"}, "7102462921": {"Name": "Todorov I.", "AuthorID": "7102462921", "AffiliationID": "60029738", "AffiliationName": "Pure Mathematics Research Centre, Queen's University Belfast"}, "7202642495": {"Name": "Winter A.", "AuthorID": "7202642495", "AffiliationID": "60023020, 60032907", "AffiliationName": "ICREA and F\u00edsica Te\u00f2rica: Informaci\u00f3 i Fenomens Qu\u00e0ntics, Universitat Aut\u00f2noma de Barcelona"}}}
