Published by SPIE under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 Unported License.Diffuse optical tomography has demonstrated significant potential for clinical utility in the diagnosis and prognosis of breast cancer, and its use in combination with other structural imaging modalities improves lesion localization and the quantification of functional tissue properties. Here, we introduce a hybrid diffuse optical imaging system that operates concurrently with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the imaging suite, utilizing commercially available MR surface coils. The instrument acquires both continuous-wave and time-domain diffuse optical data in the parallel-plate geometry, permitting both absolute assignment of tissue optical properties and three-dimensional tomography; moreover, the instrument is designed to incorporate diffuse correlation spectroscopic measurements for probing tissue blood flow. The instrument is described in detail here. Image reconstructions of a tissue phantom are presented as an initial indicator of the system's ability to accurately reconstruct optical properties and the concrete benefits of the spatial constraints provided by concurrent MRI. Last, we briefly discuss how various data combinations that the instrument could facilitate, including tissue perfusion, can enable more comprehensive assessment of lesion physiology.", "AuthorKeywords": ["breast cancer", "magnetic resonance imaging.", "multimodality", "optics", "reconstruction", "tomography"], "IndexKeywords": ["Breast Cancer", "Comprehensive assessment", "Diagnosis and prognosis", "Diffuse optical tomography", "Multi-modality", "Spectroscopic measurements", "Three-dimensional tomography", "Tissue optical properties", "Breast Neoplasms", "Equipment Design", "Female", "Humans", "Image Processing, Computer-Assisted", "Imaging, Three-Dimensional", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Optics and Photonics", "Phantoms, Imaging", "Spectrophotometry", "Tomography, Optical"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85060540049", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Biomaterials", "MATE", "2502"], ["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"]], "AuthorData": {"57190004424": {"Name": "Cochran J.M.", "AuthorID": "57190004424", "AffiliationID": "60006297", "AffiliationName": "University of Pennsylvania, Department of Physics and Astronomy"}, "7103087869": {"Name": "Busch D.R.", "AuthorID": "7103087869", "AffiliationID": "60030118", "AffiliationName": "Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Department of Neurology"}, "56447479800": {"Name": "Lin L.", "AuthorID": "56447479800", "AffiliationID": "60031581", "AffiliationName": "California Institute of Technology, Department of Medical Engineering"}, "7005135615": {"Name": "Yodh A.G.", "AuthorID": "7005135615", "AffiliationID": "60006297", "AffiliationName": "University of Pennsylvania, Department of Physics and Astronomy"}, "24766759300": {"Name": "Minkoff D.L.", "AuthorID": "24766759300", "AffiliationID": "60000928", "AffiliationName": "Emory University, Department of Medicine"}, "55332412100": {"Name": "Schweiger M.", "AuthorID": "55332412100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Centre for Medical Image Computing"}, "7005759823": {"Name": "Arridge S.", "AuthorID": "7005759823", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Centre for Medical Image Computing"}}}
