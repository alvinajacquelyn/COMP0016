KGaA, WeinheimThe iris, found in many animal species, is a biological tissue that can change the aperture (pupil) size to regulate light transmission into the eye in response to varying illumination conditions. The self-regulation of the eye lies behind its autofocusing ability and large dynamic range, rendering it the ultimate \u201cimaging device\u201d and a continuous source of inspiration in science. In optical imaging devices, adjustable apertures play a vital role as they control the light exposure, the depth of field, and optical aberrations of the systems. Tunable irises demonstrated to date require external control through mechanical actuation, and are not capable of autonomous action in response to changing light intensity without control circuitry. A self-regulating artificial iris would offer new opportunities for device automation and stabilization. Here, this paper reports the first iris-like, liquid crystal elastomer device that can perform automatic shape-adjustment by reacting to the incident light power density. Similar to natural iris, the device closes under increasing light intensity, and upon reaching the minimum pupil size, reduces the light transmission by a factor of seven. The light-responsive materials design, together with photoalignment-based control over the molecular orientation, provides a new approach to automatic, self-regulating optical systems based on soft smart materials.", "AuthorKeywords": ["azobenzene", "biomimetic materials", "iris", "liquid crystal elastomer", "photoactuation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Biological tissues", "Illumination conditions", "Incident light power", "Iris", "Light-responsive materials", "Liquid crystal elastomers", "Mechanical actuations", "Photoactuation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85020186255", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Mechanics of Materials", "ENGI", "2211"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"]], "AuthorData": {"56308771200": {"Name": "Zeng H.", "AuthorID": "56308771200", "AffiliationID": "60009565", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Chemistry and Bioengineering, Tampere University of Technology"}, "57194276857": {"Name": "Wani O.M.", "AuthorID": "57194276857", "AffiliationID": "60009565", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Chemistry and Bioengineering, Tampere University of Technology"}, "9536861300": {"Name": "Priimagi A.", "AuthorID": "9536861300", "AffiliationID": "60009565", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Chemistry and Bioengineering, Tampere University of Technology"}, "6602894094": {"Name": "Wasylczyk P.", "AuthorID": "6602894094", "AffiliationID": "60013756", "AffiliationName": "Photonic Nanostructure Facility, Institute of Experimental Physics, Faculty of Physics, University of Warsaw"}, "7006704264": {"Name": "Kaczmarek R.", "AuthorID": "7006704264", "AffiliationID": "60007108", "AffiliationName": "Department and Clinic of Ophthalmology, Wroc\u0142aw Medical University"}}}
