CR was quantified using standardized residuals (W scores) from a (covariate-adjusted) linear regression with global cognition (13-item Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale) as an independent variable of interest, and either gray matter volumes or white matter hyperintensity volume as dependent variables. These W scores, reflecting whether an individual's degree of cerebral damage is lower or higher than clinically expected, were tested as predictors of diagnostic conversion (i.e., NC to MCI/AD dementia, or MCI to AD dementia) and longitudinal changes in memory (ADNI-MEM) and executive functions (ADNI-EF).ResultsThe median follow-up period was 24 months (interquartile range 6-42). Corrected for age, sex, APOE4 status, and baseline cerebral damage, higher gray matter volume-based W scores (i.e., greater CR) were associated with a lower diagnostic conversion risk (hazard ratio [HR] 0.22, p < 0.001) and slower decline in memory (\u03b2 = 0.48, p < 0.001) and executive function (\u03b2 = 0.67, p < 0.001). Stratified by disease stage, we found similar results for NC (diagnostic conversion: HR 0.30, p = 0.038; ADNI-MEM: \u03b2 = 0.52, p = 0.028; ADNI-EF: \u03b2 = 0.42, p = 0.077) and MCI (diagnostic conversion: HR 0.21, p < 0.001; ADNI-MEM: \u03b2 = 0.43, p = 0.003; ADNI-EF: \u03b2 = 0.59, p < 0.001), but opposite findings (i.e., more rapid decline) for AD dementia (ADNI-MEM: \u03b2 = -0.91, p = 0.002; ADNI-EF: \u03b2 = -0.77, p = 0.081).ConclusionsAmong A\u03b2-positive individuals, greater CR related to attenuated clinical progression in predementia stages of AD, but accelerated cognitive decline after the onset of dementia.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Alzheimer Disease", "Amyloid beta-Peptides", "Aniline Compounds", "Case-Control Studies", "Cognitive Dysfunction", "Cognitive Reserve", "Contrast Media", "Disease Progression", "Ethylene Glycols", "Executive Function", "Female", "Gray Matter", "Humans", "Male", "Memory", "Middle Aged", "Organ Size", "Peptide Fragments", "Thiazoles", "White Matter"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85070183718", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"57163957600": {"Name": "Van Loenhoud A.C.", "AuthorID": "57163957600", "AffiliationID": "60013779", "AffiliationName": "Alzheimer Center Amsterdam, Department of Neurology"}, "57204743974": {"Name": "Van Der Flier W.M.", "AuthorID": "57204743974", "AffiliationID": "60008734", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Amsterdam UMC"}, "57193537705": {"Name": "Dicks E.", "AuthorID": "57193537705", "AffiliationID": "60013779", "AffiliationName": "Alzheimer Center Amsterdam, Department of Neurology"}, "57204678974": {"Name": "Groot C.", "AuthorID": "57204678974", "AffiliationID": "60013779", "AffiliationName": "Alzheimer Center Amsterdam, Department of Neurology"}, "57204745168": {"Name": "Scheltens P.", "AuthorID": "57204745168", "AffiliationID": "60013779", "AffiliationName": "Alzheimer Center Amsterdam, Department of Neurology"}, "6601993367": {"Name": "Wink A.M.", "AuthorID": "6601993367", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology and Nuclear Medicine, Amsterdam Neuroscience"}, "7102989379": {"Name": "Barkhof F.", "AuthorID": "7102989379", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institutes of Neurology and Healthcare Engineering, University College London"}, "40462134000": {"Name": "Ossenkoppele R.", "AuthorID": "40462134000", "AffiliationID": "60029170", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Memory Research Unit, Lund University"}, "57217754613": {"Name": "Twisk J.", "AuthorID": "57217754613", "AffiliationID": "60008734", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Amsterdam UMC"}}}
