{"Title": "Expert consensus on a train-the-trainer curriculum for robotic colorectal surgery", "Year": 2019, "Source": "Colorectal Dis.", "Volume": "21", "Issue": 8, "Art.No": null, "PageStart": 903, "PageEnd": 908, "CitedBy": 7, "DOI": "10.1111/codi.14637", "Link": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85062773069&origin=inward", "Abstract": "Colorectal Disease \u00a9 2019 The Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and IrelandAim: Robotic techniques are being increasingly used in colorectal surgery. There is, however, a lack of training opportunities and structured training programmes. Robotic surgery has specific problems and challenges for trainers and trainees. Ergonomics, specific skills and user\u2013machine interfaces are different from those in traditional laparoscopic surgery. The aim of this study was to establish expert consensus on the requirements for a robotic train-the-trainer curriculum amongst robotic surgeons and trainers. Method: This is a modified Delphi-type study involving 14 experts in robotic surgery teaching. A reiterating 19-item questionnaire was sent out to the same group and agreement levels analysed. A consensus of 0.8 or higher was considered to be high-level agreement. Results: Response rates were 93\u2013100% and most items reached high levels of agreement within three rounds. Specific requirements for a robotic faculty development curriculum included maximizing dual-console teaching, theatre team training, nontechnical skills training, patient safety, user\u2013machine interface training and telementoring. Conclusion: A clear need for the development of a train-the-trainer curriculum has been identified. Further research is needed to assess feasibility, effectiveness and clinical impact of a robotic train-the-trainer curriculum.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Delphi", "Robotic surgery", "trainer", "training"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Colorectal Surgery", "Consensus", "Curriculum", "Delphi Technique", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Robotic Surgical Procedures", "Teacher Training"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85062773069", "SubjectAreas": [["Gastroenterology", "MEDI", "2715"]], "AuthorData": {"55857279200": {"Name": "G\u00f3mez Ruiz M.", "AuthorID": "55857279200", "AffiliationID": "120979247", "AffiliationName": "IDIVAL, Instituto de Investigaci\u00f3n Sanitaria"}, "57195274995": {"Name": "Rivera Castellano J.", "AuthorID": "57195274995", "AffiliationID": "120979247", "AffiliationName": "IDIVAL, Instituto de Investigaci\u00f3n Sanitaria"}, "7004108792": {"Name": "Alfieri S.", "AuthorID": "7004108792", "AffiliationID": "60073799, 60031984", "AffiliationName": "Gemelli Robotic Mentoring Center, Catholic University of Sacred Hearth - IRCS Gemelli Foundation"}, "56881775500": {"Name": "Becker T.", "AuthorID": "56881775500", "AffiliationID": "60005542", "AffiliationName": "General, Visceral, Thoracic, Transplant and Pediatric Surgery, University Medical Center Schleswig-Holstein"}, "35419805000": {"Name": "Bergmann M.", "AuthorID": "35419805000", "AffiliationID": "60011394", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery, Medical University of Vienna"}, "7006650849": {"Name": "Boggi U.", "AuthorID": "7006650849", "AffiliationID": "60028868", "AffiliationName": "Translational Research and New Technologies in Medicine, University of Pisa"}, "7404950765": {"Name": "Collins J.", "AuthorID": "7404950765", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, Karolinska Institutet"}, "57007987100": {"Name": "Figueiredo N.", "AuthorID": "57007987100", "AffiliationID": "60113883", "AffiliationName": "Surgery Unit, Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Champalimaud"}, "6506393429": {"Name": "G\u00f6genur I.", "AuthorID": "6506393429", "AffiliationID": "60030840", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Clinical Medicine, Copenhagen University"}, "7003545168": {"Name": "Matzel K.", "AuthorID": "7003545168", "AffiliationID": "60029931", "AffiliationName": "Leiter Sektion Koloproktologie, Chirurgische Universit\u00e4tsklinik Erlangen"}, "23980952800": {"Name": "Miskovic D.", "AuthorID": "23980952800", "AffiliationID": "60022734", "AffiliationName": "St Mark's Hospital"}, "12769911500": {"Name": "Parvaiz A.", "AuthorID": "12769911500", "AffiliationID": "60113883", "AffiliationName": "Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Champalimaud"}, "7004402904": {"Name": "Pratschke J.", "AuthorID": "7004402904", "AffiliationID": "60026245", "AffiliationName": "Surgery, Charit\u00e9 \u2013 Universit\u00e4tsmedizin Berlin Chirurgische Klinik"}, "50061751400": {"Name": "Qureshi T.", "AuthorID": "50061751400", "AffiliationID": "60026868", "AffiliationName": "Poole Hospital"}, "7004952270": {"Name": "Svendsen L.B.", "AuthorID": "7004952270", "AffiliationID": "60006564", "AffiliationName": "Rigshospitalet"}, "7003594138": {"Name": "Tekkis P.", "AuthorID": "7003594138", "AffiliationID": "109617843", "AffiliationName": "Gastrointestinal Surgery, The Royal Marsden"}, "57205458258": {"Name": "Vaz C.", "AuthorID": "57205458258", "AffiliationID": "116675509", "AffiliationName": "Colorectal Cancer Unit, Robotic Surgery Unit, Hospital CUF Infante Santo"}}}
