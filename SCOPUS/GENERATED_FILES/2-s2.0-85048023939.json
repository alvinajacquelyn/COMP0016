In this final chapter we draw conclusions and seek further insights from the evidence presented. First we give a brief overview, taking the discussion back to the initial questions about the recession effects to which the preceding chapters were directed. Second, we discuss the evidence in the light of key themes of contemporary youth research and draw out their intersection with life course theory. We then consider the theoretical and policy insights to be gained from the evidence reported. Our discussion focuses on young people in the USA, the UK, and Germany, but also takes into account developments across a range of industrialized countries.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85048023939", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychology (all)", "PSYC", "3200"]], "AuthorData": {"35427099700": {"Name": "Elder G.", "AuthorID": "35427099700", "AffiliationID": "60025111", "AffiliationName": "University of North Carolina"}, "55954783800": {"Name": "Schoon I.", "AuthorID": "55954783800", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "University College London Institute of Education"}, "6603816440": {"Name": "Bynner J.", "AuthorID": "6603816440", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "7006157564": {"Name": "Heinz W.", "AuthorID": "7006157564", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
