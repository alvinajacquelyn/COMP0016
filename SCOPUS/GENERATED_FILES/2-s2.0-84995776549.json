These tablets are being designed for use inside a modified nipple shield worn by a mother during breastfeeding, a proposed novel platform technology to administer drugs and nutrients to breastfeeding infants. In this study, the release of a model compound, sulforhodamine B, from tablet formulations was studied under physiologically relevant forces induced by compression and rotation of a tongue mimic. The release profiles of the sulforhodamine B in flowing deionized water were found to be statistically different using 2-way ANOVA with matching, when tongue mimic rotation was introduced for 2 compression levels representing 2 tongue strengths (p = 0.0013 and p < 0.0001 for the lower and higher compression settings, respectively). Compression level was found to be a significant factor for increasing model compound release at rotational rates representing nonnutritive breastfeeding (p = 0.0162). This novel apparatus is the first to simulate the motion and pressures applied by the tongue and could be used in future infant oral product development.", "AuthorKeywords": ["drug delivery systems", "in vitro models", "oral drug delivery", "pediatric", "physical characterization"], "IndexKeywords": ["Breast Feeding", "Drug Delivery Systems", "Drug Liberation", "Equipment Design", "Humans", "Infant", "Peristalsis", "Pharmaceutical Preparations", "Rhodamines", "Tablets", "Tongue"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84995776549", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmaceutical Science", "PHAR", "3003"]], "AuthorData": {"56580292300": {"Name": "Scheuerle R.L.", "AuthorID": "56580292300", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering and Biotechnology, BioScience Engineering Research Group, University of Cambridge, New Museums Site"}, "23028495000": {"Name": "Slater N.K.H.", "AuthorID": "23028495000", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering and Biotechnology, BioScience Engineering Research Group, University of Cambridge, New Museums Site"}, "36940952800": {"Name": "Gerrard S.E.", "AuthorID": "36940952800", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering and Biotechnology, BioScience Engineering Research Group, University of Cambridge, New Museums Site"}, "34768370600": {"Name": "Kendall R.A.", "AuthorID": "34768370600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmaceutics, School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "8446290500": {"Name": "Tuleu C.", "AuthorID": "8446290500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmaceutics, School of Pharmacy, University College London"}}}
