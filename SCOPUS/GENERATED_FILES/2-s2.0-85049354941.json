The linearized velocity potential theory is adopted. The total fluid domain is divided into two sub-ones: one for the harbour and the other for the external open sea. Boundary integral equations together with the free surface Green function are used in the both domains. Matching conditions are imposed on the interface of the two sub-domains to ensure the velocity and pressure continuity. The advantage of the domain decomposition method over the single domain method is that it removes the coastal surface from the boundary integral equation. This subsequently removes the need for elements on the coastal wall when the equation is discretized. The accuracy of the method is demonstrated through convergence study and through the comparison with the published data. Extensive results through the hydrodynamic coefficients, wave exciting forces and ship motions are provided. Highly oscillatory behaviour is observed and its mechanism is discussed. Finally, the effects of incident wave direction, ship location as well as the harbour topography are investigated in detail.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Domain decomposition", "Free-surface green function", "Ship motion in a harbour", "Three-dimensional boundary element method"], "IndexKeywords": ["Free-surface green functions", "Hydrodynamic coefficients", "Matching condition", "Ship motion", "Three-dimensional boundary element methods", "Three-dimensional domain", "Velocity potentials", "Wave-exciting forces"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85049354941", "SubjectAreas": [["Ocean Engineering", "ENGI", "2212"]], "AuthorData": {"56969946300": {"Name": "Shi Y.", "AuthorID": "56969946300", "AffiliationID": "60003353", "AffiliationName": "College of Shipbuilding Engineering, Harbin Engineering University"}, "56723490000": {"Name": "Li Z.", "AuthorID": "56723490000", "AffiliationID": "60069706", "AffiliationName": "School of Naval Architecture and Ocean Engineering, Jiangsu University of Science and Technology"}, "14012675900": {"Name": "Wu G.", "AuthorID": "14012675900", "AffiliationID": "60069706", "AffiliationName": "School of Naval Architecture and Ocean Engineering, Jiangsu University of Science and Technology"}}}
