In these proteins most of the hemes are arranged in a linear array suggesting a facile path for electronic conduction. To test this, we studied solvent-free electron transport across two multi-heme Cytc-type proteins: MtrF (deca-heme Cytc) and STC (tetra-heme Cytc). Transport is measured across monolayers of these proteins in a solid state configuration between Au electrodes. Both proteins showed 1000\u00d7 higher conductance than single heme, or heme-free proteins, but similar conductance to monolayers of conjugated organics. Conductance is found to be temperature-independent (320-80 K), suggesting tunneling as the transport mechanism. This mechanism is consistent with I-V curves modelling, results of which could be interpreted by having protein-electrode coupling as rate limiting, rather than transport within the proteins.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Au electrodes", "C-type cytochrome", "Electrode couplings", "Electronic conduction", "Linear arrays", "Solid state electronics", "Temperature independents", "Transport mechanism"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85054222521", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"]], "AuthorData": {"7005308690": {"Name": "Cahen D.", "AuthorID": "7005308690", "AffiliationID": "60017563", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials and Interfaces, Weizmann Institute of Science"}, "35847505700": {"Name": "Garg K.", "AuthorID": "35847505700", "AffiliationID": "60017563", "AffiliationName": "Department of Organic Chemistry, Weizmann Institute of Science"}, "57197156541": {"Name": "Ghosh M.", "AuthorID": "57197156541", "AffiliationID": "60017563", "AffiliationName": "Department of Organic Chemistry, Weizmann Institute of Science"}, "6507953941": {"Name": "Eliash T.", "AuthorID": "6507953941", "AffiliationID": "60017563", "AffiliationName": "Department of Organic Chemistry, Weizmann Institute of Science"}, "57189999917": {"Name": "Sheves M.", "AuthorID": "57189999917", "AffiliationID": "60017563", "AffiliationName": "Department of Organic Chemistry, Weizmann Institute of Science"}, "15053909400": {"Name": "Van Wonderen J.H.", "AuthorID": "15053909400", "AffiliationID": "60000112", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, School of Biological Sciences, University of East Anglia"}, "55425390300": {"Name": "Butt J.N.", "AuthorID": "55425390300", "AffiliationID": "60000112", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, School of Biological Sciences, University of East Anglia"}, "7401640600": {"Name": "Shi L.", "AuthorID": "7401640600", "AffiliationID": "60006019", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biological Sciences and Technology, School of Environmental Sciences, China University of Geosciences"}, "57199054420": {"Name": "Jiang X.", "AuthorID": "57199054420", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175885", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Astronomy and Thomas Young Centre, University College London"}, "57204045744": {"Name": "Zdenek F.", "AuthorID": "57204045744", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175885", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Astronomy and Thomas Young Centre, University College London"}, "8669973600": {"Name": "Blumberger J.", "AuthorID": "8669973600", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175885", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Astronomy and Thomas Young Centre, University College London"}, "56238560500": {"Name": "Pecht I.", "AuthorID": "56238560500", "AffiliationID": "60017563", "AffiliationName": "Department of Immunology, Weizmann Institute of Science"}}}
