Two of the complexes, 2a and 3c, kill breast CSC-enriched HMLER-shEcad cells (grown in both monolayer and three-dimensional cell cultures) to a significantly better extent than salinomycin, a well-established CSC toxin. The most potent complex in the series, 3c induces its cytotoxic effect by generating intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inhibiting cyclooxgenase-2 (COX-2) activity. Encapsulation of 3c using biodegradable methoxy poly(ethylene glycol)-b-poly(d,l-lactic-co-glycolic) acid (PEG-PLGA) copolymers at the appropriate feed (5%, 3c NP5) enhances breast CSC uptake and reduces overall toxicity. The nanoparticle formulation, 3c NP5 selectively kills breast CSCs over bulk breast cancer cells, and evokes a similar cellular response to the payload, 3c. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate that polymeric nanoparticles can be used to effectively deliver CSC-potent metal complexes into CSCs.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Anti-inflammatory drugs", "Methoxypolyethylene glycol", "Nanoparticle formulation", "Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs", "Phenanthroline complexes", "Polymeric nanoparticles", "Reactive oxygen species", "Three dimensional cell culture", "Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal", "Antineoplastic Agents", "Breast Neoplasms", "Cell Line", "Cell Line, Tumor", "Coordination Complexes", "Copper", "Drug Carriers", "Female", "Humans", "Nanoparticles", "Neoplastic Stem Cells", "Polyesters", "Polyethylene Glycols"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84994689686", "SubjectAreas": [["Inorganic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1604"]], "AuthorData": {"57191891112": {"Name": "Eskandari A.", "AuthorID": "57191891112", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, King's College London"}, "57090927800": {"Name": "Boodram J.", "AuthorID": "57090927800", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, King's College London"}, "57090463800": {"Name": "Cressey P.", "AuthorID": "57090463800", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, King's College London"}, "26637758400": {"Name": "Lu C.", "AuthorID": "26637758400", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, King's College London"}, "25927531500": {"Name": "Suntharalingam K.", "AuthorID": "25927531500", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, King's College London"}, "55553040200": {"Name": "Bruno P.", "AuthorID": "55553040200", "AffiliationID": "60022195", "AffiliationName": "Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research, Massachusetts Institute of Technology"}, "57210198671": {"Name": "Hemann M.", "AuthorID": "57210198671", "AffiliationID": "60022195", "AffiliationName": "Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research, Massachusetts Institute of Technology"}}}
