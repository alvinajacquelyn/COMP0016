Oral Implants Res.", "Volume": "26", "Issue": null, "Art.No": null, "PageStart": 123, "PageEnd": 138, "CitedBy": 15, "DOI": "10.1111/clr.12629", "Link": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84941918015&origin=inward", "Abstract": "\u00a9 2015 John Wiley & Sons A/S.Aim: To investigate whether the height and volume of the soft tissues and peri-implant bone levels around dental implants are stable, when soft tissue augmentation has been performed. Materials and Methods: Three operators conducted a search on electronic databases (MEDLINE, COCHRANE, EMBASE) and a hand searching on the main journals dealing with periodontology and implantology until 30 October 2014. Only articles that considered peri-implant soft tissue augmentation performed in a group of at least 10 patients and with a follow-up of at least 1 year were selected. The outcome variables were peri-implant attached/keratinized tissue width (KTW) changes, peri-implant marginal soft tissue level (PSL) changes, and peri-implant marginal bone level (PBL) changes. The review was performed according to the PRISMA statements. Results: Ten articles were selected for the qualitative synthesis, but only one meta-analysis was accomplished, indicating that 1 year after implant recession coverage procedures, a mean gain of 1.65 \u00b1 0.01 mm (90% CrI [1.44; 1.85]) was observed. Conclusions: There is no long-term evidence whether augmented soft tissues can be maintained over time and able to influence the peri-implant bone levels.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Dental implant", "Review", "Soft tissue"], "IndexKeywords": ["Dental Implantation, Endosseous", "Dental Implants", "Gingiva", "Gingivoplasty", "Humans"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84941918015", "SubjectAreas": [["Oral Surgery", "DENT", "3504"]], "AuthorData": {"7003711963": {"Name": "Rotundo R.", "AuthorID": "7003711963", "AffiliationID": "60013985, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Periodontal Unit, Eastman Dental Institute, University College of London"}, "56856801700": {"Name": "Bendinelli E.", "AuthorID": "56856801700", "AffiliationID": "60021859", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery and Translational Medicine, University of Florence"}, "6603396010": {"Name": "Pagliaro U.", "AuthorID": "6603396010", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Private Practice"}, "7102693395": {"Name": "Esposito M.", "AuthorID": "7102693395", "AffiliationID": "60027675", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomaterials, The Sahlgrenska Academy at G\u00f6teborg University"}, "15842800000": {"Name": "Buti J.", "AuthorID": "15842800000", "AffiliationID": "60172345", "AffiliationName": "School of Dentistry, University of Manchester"}}}
