Nations and Nationalism \u00a9 ASEN/John Wiley & Sons Ltd 2017This paper investigates how Croats view the minority Serb population in Croatia. It is based on focus groups, dyads and interviews conducted in Croatia in 2014 and 2015. Serbs constitute the \u2018other\u2019 to Croatian identity, which is defined primarily through language and religion. The analysis finds that the predominant war narrative related to the 1991\u20131995 conflict, one of defence against a larger Serbian aggressor, influences both of these notions of identity, as well as perceptions of the Serb minority in the state. Participants displayed contradictory attitudes in a discourse that featured many key facets of the war narrative. Most respondents agreed that Serbs should be equal members of Croatian society, but they also did not believe Cyrillic signs should be put up in Vukovar. The introduction of bilingual signs both reduced trust in government institutions and was interpreted as a continued threat against the Croatian people and state.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Croatia", "Croatian identity", "Cyrillic protests", "Serbian minority", "transitional justice", "Vukovar"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85011700173", "SubjectAreas": [["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"], ["Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)", "ARTS", "1201"], ["Political Science and International Relations", "SOCI", "3320"]], "AuthorData": {"57190224666": {"Name": "Sokoli\u0107 I.", "AuthorID": "57190224666", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60182807", "AffiliationName": "UCL, Centre for Multidisciplinary and Intercultural Inquiry (CMII)"}}}
