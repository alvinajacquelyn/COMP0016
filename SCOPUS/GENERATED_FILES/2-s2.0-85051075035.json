In theory, these oscillations can be used as biomarkers and thereby serve as a feedback signal to control the delivery of deep brain stimulation (DBS). This new form of DBS, dependent on different characteristics of pathological oscillations, is called adaptive DBS (aDBS), and it has already been applied in patients with Parkinson's disease. In this review, the authors summarize the scientific research to date on pathological oscillations in dystonia and address potential biomarkers that might be used as a feedback signal for controlling aDBS in patients with dystonia.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Adaptive deep brain stimulation", "Dystonia", "Electromyography", "Local field potentials", "Low-frequency oscillations"], "IndexKeywords": ["Basal Ganglia", "Deep Brain Stimulation", "Dystonia", "Dystonic Disorders", "Globus Pallidus", "Humans", "Physical Therapy Modalities"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85051075035", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"56419967000": {"Name": "Pi\u00f1a-Fuentes D.", "AuthorID": "56419967000", "AffiliationID": "60006027, 60010023", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen"}, "22954059900": {"Name": "Oterdoom D.", "AuthorID": "22954059900", "AffiliationID": "60006027, 60010023", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurosurgery, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen"}, "55317071300": {"Name": "van Dijk J.", "AuthorID": "55317071300", "AffiliationID": "60006027, 60010023", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurosurgery, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen"}, "24832614900": {"Name": "Beudel M.", "AuthorID": "24832614900", "AffiliationID": "60004078", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Isala Klinieken"}, "57188802588": {"Name": "van Zijl J.", "AuthorID": "57188802588", "AffiliationID": "60006027, 60010023", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen"}, "7003604940": {"Name": "Elting J.", "AuthorID": "7003604940", "AffiliationID": "60006027, 60010023", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen"}, "36490607400": {"Name": "van Egmond M.", "AuthorID": "36490607400", "AffiliationID": "60006027, 60010023", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen"}, "7004162353": {"Name": "Tijssen M.", "AuthorID": "7004162353", "AffiliationID": "60006027, 60010023", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen"}, "55209995700": {"Name": "Little S.", "AuthorID": "55209995700", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Sobell Department of Motor Neuroscience and Movement Disorders, UCL Institute of Neurology"}}}
