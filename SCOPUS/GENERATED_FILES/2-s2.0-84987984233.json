Unsteady Reynolds-Averaged Navier Stokes simulations were used to simulate the flow around a 98 m catamaran, at both model and full scale, and compared to model test results for a 1:22 scale model. A non-shedding squashed horseshoe vortex was found to build up in the stagnant zone past the vessel, with the transom running dry at transom draft Froude numbers of 2.5 in model test experiments and at transom draft Froude numbers of 2.4 in numerical simulations. For full-scale Reynolds numbers, ventilation occurred at transom draft Froude numbers of 2.2. Finally, unsteady Reynolds-Averaged Navier Stokes simulations are capable of accurately predicting the recirculating flow in the wake of the vessel and the state of transom ventilation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Flow visualisation", "Full-scale CFD", "Medium-speed catamaran", "Transom ventilation", "Unsteady RANS simulation", "Wave-piercing catamaran"], "IndexKeywords": ["Flow visualisation", "Horseshoe vortices", "Medium-speed catamaran", "Recirculating flow", "Scale modeling", "Unsteady reynolds-averaged navier-stokes", "Unsteady-RANS simulations", "Wave piercing catamaran"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84987984233", "SubjectAreas": [["Ocean Engineering", "ENGI", "2212"]], "AuthorData": {"7102449839": {"Name": "Haase M.", "AuthorID": "7102449839", "AffiliationID": "60015356", "AffiliationName": "University of Tasmania"}, "25421499900": {"Name": "Binns J.", "AuthorID": "25421499900", "AffiliationID": "60015356", "AffiliationName": "University of Tasmania"}, "35611441100": {"Name": "Bose N.", "AuthorID": "35611441100", "AffiliationID": "60015356", "AffiliationName": "University of Tasmania"}, "25925551300": {"Name": "Thomas G.", "AuthorID": "25925551300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
