We undertook this study to identify protective factors associated with cessation of injection drug use. Design and Methods: Data were derived from three prospective cohorts of people who use illicit drugs in Vancouver, Canada, between September 2005 and November 2011. Generalised estimating equations were used to examine protective factors and 6-month cessation of injection drug use. Results: Our sample of 1663 people who inject drugs included 563 (33.9%) women, and median age was 40 years. Overall, 904 (54.4%) individuals had at least one 6-month injection cessation event. In multivariable analysis, protective factors associated with cessation of injection drug use included the following: having a regular place to stay [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 1.30; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.13\u20131.48]; formal employment (AOR = 1.12; 95% CI 1.01\u20131.23); social support from personal contacts (AOR = 1.22; 95% CI 1.10\u20131.35); social support from professionals (AOR = 1.26; 95% CI 1.14\u20131.39); ability to access health and social services (AOR = 1.21; 95% CI 1.09\u20131.34); and positive self-rated health (AOR = 1.21, 95% CI 1.11\u20131.32). Discussion and Conclusions: Over half of people who inject drugs in this study reported achieving 6-month cessation of injection drug use, with cessation being associated with a range of modifiable protective factors. Policy makers and practitioners should promote increased access to stable housing, employment, social support and other services to promote cessation of injection drug use.
