Aims To compare levels of emotional and behavioural problems in children with LI and children with ASD recruited from the same mainstream schools. Methods & Procedures We measured teacher-reported emotional and behavioural problems using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) in a sample of 5-13-year-old children with LI (N = 62) and children with ASD (N = 42) attending mainstream school but with identified special educational needs. Outcomes & Results Both groups showed similarly elevated levels of emotional, conduct and hyperactivity problems. The only differences between the LI and ASD groups were on subscales assessing peer problems (which were higher in the ASD group) and prosocial behaviours (which were higher in the LI group). Overall, there were few associations between emotional and behavioural problems and child characteristics, reflecting the pervasive nature of these difficulties in children with LI and children with ASD, although levels of problems were higher in children with ASD with lower language ability. However, in the ASD group only, a measure of family social economic status was associated with language ability and attenuated the association between language ability and emotional and behavioural problems. Conclusions & Implications Children with LI and children with ASD in mainstream school show similarly elevated levels of emotional and behavioural problems, which require monitoring and may benefit from intervention. Further work is required to identify the child, family and situational factors that place children with LI and children with ASD at risk of emotional and behavioural problems, and whether these differ between the two groups. This work can then guide the application of evidence-based interventions to these children.", "AuthorKeywords": ["autism spectrum disorders", "emotional and behavioural problems", "language impairment", "mental health"], "IndexKeywords": ["Affective Symptoms", "Autism Spectrum Disorder", "Child", "Child Behavior Disorders", "Comorbidity", "Education, Special", "Female", "Humans", "Language Development Disorders", "Language Tests", "Mainstreaming (Education)", "Male", "Psychometrics", "Reference Values", "Social Behavior", "Statistics as Topic"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84923049613", "SubjectAreas": [["Language and Linguistics", "ARTS", "1203"], ["Linguistics and Language", "SOCI", "3310"], ["Speech and Hearing", "HEAL", "3616"]], "AuthorData": {"7006913774": {"Name": "Charman T.", "AuthorID": "7006913774", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "King's College London, Institute of Psychiatry, Department of Psychology"}, "18038318500": {"Name": "Ricketts J.", "AuthorID": "18038318500", "AffiliationID": "60012197", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Education, University of Reading"}, "7004429681": {"Name": "Dockrell J.E.", "AuthorID": "7004429681", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology and Human Development, Institute of Education, University of London"}, "7102841300": {"Name": "Lindsay G.", "AuthorID": "7102841300", "AffiliationID": "60022020", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Educational Development, Appraisal and Research (CEDAR), University of Warwick"}, "26031680000": {"Name": "Palikara O.", "AuthorID": "26031680000", "AffiliationID": "60026761", "AffiliationName": "School of Education, University of Roehampton"}}}
