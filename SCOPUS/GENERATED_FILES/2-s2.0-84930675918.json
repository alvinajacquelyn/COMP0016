Here we report quasielastic neutron scattering measurements showing that dipolar CH 3 NH 3 + ions reorientate between the faces, corners or edges of the pseudo-cubic lattice cages in CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 crystals with a room temperature residence time of \u00e2 1/414\u00e2 \u20ac\u2030ps. Free rotation, \u00cf \u20ac-flips and ionic diffusion are ruled out within a 1-200-ps time window. Monte Carlo simulations of interacting CH 3 NH 3 + dipoles realigning within a 3D lattice suggest that the scattering measurements may be explained by the stabilization of CH 3 NH 3 + in either antiferroelectric or ferroelectric domains. Collective realignment of CH 3 NH 3 + to screen a device's built-in potential could reduce photovoltaic performance. However, we estimate the timescale for a domain wall to traverse a typical device to be \u00e2 1/40.1-1\u00e2 \u20ac\u2030ms, faster than most observed hysteresis.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84930675918", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"56641710700": {"Name": "Leguy A.M.A.", "AuthorID": "56641710700", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Imperial College London"}, "56523459100": {"Name": "McMahon A.P.", "AuthorID": "56523459100", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Imperial College London"}, "55665151000": {"Name": "Nelson J.", "AuthorID": "55665151000", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Imperial College London"}, "56565984100": {"Name": "Barnes P.R.F.", "AuthorID": "56565984100", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Imperial College London"}, "14421269400": {"Name": "Frost J.M.", "AuthorID": "14421269400", "AffiliationID": "60030480", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Bath"}, "35315151400": {"Name": "Walsh A.", "AuthorID": "35315151400", "AffiliationID": "60030480", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Bath"}, "9238674400": {"Name": "Sakai V.G.", "AuthorID": "9238674400", "AffiliationID": "60023254", "AffiliationName": "Rutherford Appleton Laboratory"}, "56674660300": {"Name": "Kochelmann W.", "AuthorID": "56674660300", "AffiliationID": "60023254", "AffiliationName": "Rutherford Appleton Laboratory"}, "36646284700": {"Name": "Law C.", "AuthorID": "36646284700", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Imperial College London"}, "34971506900": {"Name": "Li X.", "AuthorID": "34971506900", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Imperial College London"}, "6701529045": {"Name": "O'Regan B.C.", "AuthorID": "6701529045", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Imperial College London"}, "6507657713": {"Name": "Foglia F.", "AuthorID": "6507657713", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, Imperial College London"}, "7201350220": {"Name": "Cabral J.T.", "AuthorID": "7201350220", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, Imperial College London"}}}
