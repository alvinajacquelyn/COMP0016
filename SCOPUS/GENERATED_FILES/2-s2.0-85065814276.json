Ricin is a highly toxic protein largely existing in castor beans, which could be used as a warfare agent due to its unique properties. As a deadenylase, inactivation of ricin means a loss of its toxic threat. Therefore, developing simple, accurate, and sensitive on-site detection of biologically active ricin in wide types of complex matrices is most valuable. Here, antifouling polymer brush modified magnetic beads were prepared first and post modified with ricin monoclonal antibody (the MB@P(C-H)-mAb ricin ) to efficiently capture ricin from various foods and biological matrices. Active ricin obtained in this manner were sequentially determined by a new designed AuNP/QDs nanoassembly. In this double strand oligodeoxynucleotides (dsODN) linked core-satellite nanoprobe, the fluorescence of satellite QDs was extensively quenched by AuNPs due to the dipole-metal interaction. Active ricin can react with its specific depurination substrates which had been inserted in the dsODN linkers. This reaction would trigger the separation of QDs from Au cores by cutting multiple adenines, and then result in the restoration of QDs fluorescence. By coupling with the magnetic enrichment, this AuNP/QDs nanoprobe provided a qualitative result for active ricin in the range from 10.0 to 100.0 ng mL -1 with the limit of detection as low as 7.46 ng mL -1 . Compared with previously proposed methods, this on-site detection strategy offered an easy to handle on-site test for trace amounts of active ricin in a wide range of complex matrices.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85065814276", "SubjectAreas": [["Analytical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1602"]], "AuthorData": {"56106371400": {"Name": "Sun J.", "AuthorID": "56106371400", "AffiliationID": "60031363", "AffiliationName": "Beijing Key Laboratory of Diagnostic and Traceability Technologies for Food Poisoning, Beijing Center for Disease Prevention and Control"}, "8712044800": {"Name": "Shao B.", "AuthorID": "8712044800", "AffiliationID": "60013551", "AffiliationName": "Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Food Nutrition and Human Health, China Agricultural University"}, "57208872064": {"Name": "Li H.", "AuthorID": "57208872064", "AffiliationID": "60031363", "AffiliationName": "Beijing Key Laboratory of Diagnostic and Traceability Technologies for Food Poisoning, Beijing Center for Disease Prevention and Control"}, "57208798259": {"Name": "Zhang X.", "AuthorID": "57208798259", "AffiliationID": "60002546", "AffiliationName": "School of Police Law Enforcement Abilities Training, People's Public Security University of China"}, "57205456778": {"Name": "Li T.", "AuthorID": "57205456778", "AffiliationID": "60026707", "AffiliationName": "School of Public Health, Capital Medical University"}, "57194506415": {"Name": "Xie J.", "AuthorID": "57194506415", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "55946409200": {"Name": "Xue D.", "AuthorID": "55946409200", "AffiliationID": "60019499, 60109828", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Lithospheric Evolution, Institute of Geology and Geophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "57208796908": {"Name": "Tang X.", "AuthorID": "57208796908", "AffiliationID": "60019499, 60109828", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Lithospheric Evolution, Institute of Geology and Geophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "57201929874": {"Name": "Liu Y.", "AuthorID": "57201929874", "AffiliationID": "60019499, 60109828", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Lithospheric Evolution, Institute of Geology and Geophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}}}
