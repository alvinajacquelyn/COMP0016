The overarching objectives of the studies were to document the natural course of Stargardt disease and identify the most appropriate clinical outcome measures for clinical trials assessing the efficacy and safety of upcoming treatments for Stargardt disease. A workshop organized by the Foundation Fighting Blindness Clinical Research Institute was held on June 11, 2018, in Baltimore, MD, USA. Invited speakers discussed spectral-domain optical coherence tomography, fundus autofluorescence, and microperimetry methods and findings in the ProgStar prospective study. The workshop concluded with a panel discussion of optimal endpoints for measuring treatment efficacy in Stargardt disease. We summarize the workshop presentations in light of the most current literature on Stargardt disease and discuss potential clinical outcome measures and endpoints for future treatment trials.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Fundus autofluorescence", "Microperimetry", "Natural history", "Optical coherence tomography", "Stargardt"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85070319694", "SubjectAreas": [["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"], ["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"]], "AuthorData": {"23481923000": {"Name": "Ervin A.M.", "AuthorID": "23481923000", "AffiliationID": "60006183, 60005248", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Johns Hopkins University"}, "8935400200": {"Name": "Strauss R.W.", "AuthorID": "8935400200", "AffiliationID": "60006224", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, Medical University Graz"}, "27169445100": {"Name": "Ahmed M.I.", "AuthorID": "27169445100", "AffiliationID": "60015891, 60005248, 60001117", "AffiliationName": "Wilmer Eye Institute, The Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University"}, "55566987800": {"Name": "Sch\u00f6nbach E.M.", "AuthorID": "55566987800", "AffiliationID": "60000305", "AffiliationName": "Case Western Reserve University"}, "35463160200": {"Name": "West S.K.", "AuthorID": "35463160200", "AffiliationID": "60015891, 60005248, 60001117", "AffiliationName": "Wilmer Eye Institute, The Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University"}, "7006706337": {"Name": "Scholl H.P.N.", "AuthorID": "7006706337", "AffiliationID": "120707758", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Molecular and Clinical Ophthalmology Basel"}, "56852126400": {"Name": "Birch D.", "AuthorID": "56852126400", "AffiliationID": "60006874", "AffiliationName": "Retina Foundation of the Southwest"}, "57194264923": {"Name": "Cheetham J.", "AuthorID": "57194264923", "AffiliationID": "100863346", "AffiliationName": "Foundation Fighting Blindness Clinical Research Institute"}, "35408084600": {"Name": "Ferris F.L.", "AuthorID": "35408084600", "AffiliationID": "60007651, 60006577", "AffiliationName": "National Eye Institute, National Institutes of Health"}, "7102423269": {"Name": "Ip M.S.", "AuthorID": "7102423269", "AffiliationID": "60005247, 60014349", "AffiliationName": "Doheny Imaging Reading Center, Doheny Eye Institute, David Geffen School of Medicine at University of California Los Angeles"}, "6701477860": {"Name": "Sadda S.R.", "AuthorID": "6701477860", "AffiliationID": "60005247, 60014349", "AffiliationName": "Doheny Imaging Reading Center, Doheny Eye Institute, David Geffen School of Medicine at University of California Los Angeles"}, "57208137855": {"Name": "Jaffe G.J.", "AuthorID": "57208137855", "AffiliationID": "60005200", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, Duke University School of Medicine"}, "35448311500": {"Name": "Maguire M.G.", "AuthorID": "35448311500", "AffiliationID": "60003711, 60006297", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania"}, "null": {"Name": null, "AuthorID": null, "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
