However, little is known about such cognition or how it is pharmacologically modulated. Here, we test theoretical predictions of the \u2018elaborated intrusion\u2019 theory by comparing neutral with alcohol related mental imagery, and examine the effects of low dose alcohol on phenomenological aspects of this imagery. Methods Alcohol related and neutral imagery was assessed after at risk drinkers (n = 40) consumed alcohol (0.3 g/kg) or placebo, in a crossover design. Sensory and visuospatial qualities of imagery, along with associated craving, positive affect and \u2018mind wandering\u2019 were assessed. Results Alcohol related mental imagery was rated as more vivid and sensorially rich, effects that were larger following the priming dose of alcohol. In addition, mind wandering was substantially lower during alcohol versus neutral imagery, especially after alcohol consumption. First person perspective was more prevalent for alcohol imagery after alcohol, although the Drink \u00d7 Imagery type interaction did not reach statistical significance. However, first person imagery was associated with higher levels of craving during alcohol related imagery. Conclusions Alcohol related mental imagery differs phenomenologically from neutral imagery on a number of dimensions. Priming with alcohol may enable cognitive elaboration by biasing the output of controlled cognitive processing towards enhanced sensory elaboration and increased attention to alcohol related cognition. These feedforward effects may be involved in focusing cognitive and behavioural resources on alcohol acquisition/consumption through the elaboration and rehearsal of relevant goals and plans.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alcohol", "Alcohol priming", "Craving", "Elaborated intrusion theory", "Mental imagery", "Mind wandering"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85028516073", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"57195506394": {"Name": "Yates M.", "AuthorID": "57195506394", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Clinical Educational and Health Psychology, University College London"}, "7003707171": {"Name": "Kamboj S.", "AuthorID": "7003707171", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Psychopharmacology Unit, University College London"}}}
