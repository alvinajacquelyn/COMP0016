The predicted ubiquity of connected devices indicates that IoT technologies are quickly becoming an important part of the digital fluency curriculum, however, no research yet exists on suitable pedagogical approaches for teaching children about the IoT. The current research explores the design and deployment of a pedagogical approach and associated tangible toolkit, ConnectUs, that will enable 10-13 year old children to explore and design for the Internet of Things.", "AuthorKeywords": ["CodeMe.", "ConnectUs", "Internet of Things", "Playful learning", "SenseMe", "Tangible interfaces", "Ubiquitous Computing"], "IndexKeywords": ["CodeMe", "ConnectUs", "Playful learning", "SenseMe", "Tangible interfaces"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84991089529", "SubjectAreas": [["Hardware and Architecture", "COMP", "1708"], ["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Information Systems", "COMP", "1710"], ["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"], ["Human-Computer Interaction", "COMP", "1709"]], "AuthorData": {"57191505501": {"Name": "Lechelt Z.", "AuthorID": "57191505501", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, UCL Interaction Centre"}, "7003925319": {"Name": "Rogers Y.", "AuthorID": "7003925319", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, UCL Interaction Centre"}, "55921115600": {"Name": "Marquardt N.", "AuthorID": "55921115600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, UCL Interaction Centre"}, "14058826400": {"Name": "Shum V.", "AuthorID": "14058826400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, UCL Interaction Centre"}}}
