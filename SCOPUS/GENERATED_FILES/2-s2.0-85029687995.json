The homemade s-SNOM, based on a resonant tuning fork and metallic tip, operates in tapping mode with a spatial resolution of ?78 nm. The quantum cascade laser is realized from a bound-to-continuum active region design with a central emission of ?2.85 THz, which has been lens-coupled in order to maximize the feedback into the laser cavity. Accordingly, the spatial resolution corresponds to >?/1000. The s-SNOM has been used to investigate a bidimensional plasmonic photonic crystal and to observe the optical resonant modes supported by coupled plasmonic planar antennas, showing remarkable agreement with the theoretical predictions. The compactness, unique sensitivity, and fast acquisition capability of this approach make the proposed s-SNOM a unique tool for solid-state investigations and biomedical imaging.", "AuthorKeywords": ["near-field microscopy", "photonic crystals", "plasmonics", "quantum cascade laser", "self-mixing detection", "terahertz"], "IndexKeywords": ["Near field microscopy", "Near field optical microscope", "Plasmonic resonances", "Plasmonic-photonic crystals", "Plasmonics", "Self-mixing", "Spatial resolution", "Tera Hertz"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85029687995", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Biotechnology", "BIOC", "1305"], ["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"14053718900": {"Name": "Degl'Innocenti R.", "AuthorID": "14053718900", "AffiliationID": "60121115, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Cavendish Laboratory, University of Cambridge"}, "56381049100": {"Name": "Wallis R.", "AuthorID": "56381049100", "AffiliationID": "60121115, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Cavendish Laboratory, University of Cambridge"}, "57193899526": {"Name": "Wei B.", "AuthorID": "57193899526", "AffiliationID": "60121115, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Cavendish Laboratory, University of Cambridge"}, "57102414600": {"Name": "Xiao L.", "AuthorID": "57102414600", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Engineering, University of Cambridge"}, "57188687150": {"Name": "Kindness S.", "AuthorID": "57188687150", "AffiliationID": "60121115, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Cavendish Laboratory, University of Cambridge"}, "7005719934": {"Name": "Beere H.", "AuthorID": "7005719934", "AffiliationID": "60121115, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Cavendish Laboratory, University of Cambridge"}, "36050490200": {"Name": "Ritchie D.", "AuthorID": "36050490200", "AffiliationID": "60121115, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Cavendish Laboratory, University of Cambridge"}, "55988809200": {"Name": "Braeuninger-Weimer P.", "AuthorID": "55988809200", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Engineering, University of Cambridge"}, "8094172800": {"Name": "Hofmann S.", "AuthorID": "8094172800", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Engineering, University of Cambridge"}, "7003451569": {"Name": "Mitrofanov O.", "AuthorID": "7003451569", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}}}
