Unsurprisingly, mutations in MMR genes occur in a wide range of different cancers. Studies thus far have largely focused on specific tumor types or MMR mutations; however, it is becoming increasingly clear that a therapy targeting MMR deficiency in general would be clinically very beneficial. Experimental Design: Based on a drug-repositioning approach, we screened a large panel of cell lines with various MMR deficiencies from a range of different tumor types with a compound drug library of previously approved drugs. We have identified the potassium-sparing diuretic drug triamterene, as a novel sensitizing agent in MMR-deficient tumor cells, in vitro and in vivo. Results: The selective tumor cell cytotoxicity of triamterene occurs through its antifolate activity and depends on the activity of the folate synthesis enzyme thymidylate synthase. Triamterene leads to a thymidylate synthase-dependent differential increase in reactive oxygen species in MMR-deficient cells, ultimately resulting in an increase in DNA double-strand breaks. Conclusions: Conclusively, our data reveal a new drug repurposing and novel therapeutic strategy that has potential for the treatment of MMR deficiency in a range of different tumor types and could significantly improve patient survival.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Brain Neoplasms", "Cell Line, Tumor", "Colorectal Neoplasms", "DNA Breaks, Double-Stranded", "DNA Mismatch Repair", "Drug Repositioning", "Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor", "Humans", "Neoplastic Syndromes, Hereditary", "Triamterene"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85020315382", "SubjectAreas": [["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Cancer Research", "BIOC", "1306"]], "AuthorData": {"57217950790": {"Name": "Guillotin D.", "AuthorID": "57217950790", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Molecular Oncology, Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London, John Vane Science Centre"}, "57194459891": {"Name": "Austin P.", "AuthorID": "57194459891", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Molecular Oncology, Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London, John Vane Science Centre"}, "55485715600": {"Name": "Begum R.", "AuthorID": "55485715600", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Molecular Oncology, Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London, John Vane Science Centre"}, "48060999300": {"Name": "Freitas M.O.", "AuthorID": "48060999300", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Molecular Oncology, Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London, John Vane Science Centre"}, "35409573700": {"Name": "Martin S.A.", "AuthorID": "35409573700", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Molecular Oncology, Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London, John Vane Science Centre"}, "35741348400": {"Name": "Merve A.", "AuthorID": "35741348400", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Blizard Institute, Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary, University of London"}, "55757783542": {"Name": "Marino S.", "AuthorID": "55757783542", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Blizard Institute, Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary, University of London"}, "6507176823": {"Name": "Brend T.", "AuthorID": "6507176823", "AffiliationID": "60020454, 60023959, 60022106", "AffiliationName": "Leeds Institute of Cancer and Pathology, Wellcome Trust Brenner Building, St James's University Hospital"}, "7102838197": {"Name": "Short S.", "AuthorID": "7102838197", "AffiliationID": "60020454, 60023959, 60022106", "AffiliationName": "Leeds Institute of Cancer and Pathology, Wellcome Trust Brenner Building, St James's University Hospital"}}}
