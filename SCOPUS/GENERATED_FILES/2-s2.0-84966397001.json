All rights reserved.Purpose To determine the intrasession repeatability of spectral-domain OCT (SDOCT)-derived macular retinal and choroidal metrics in patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) in the Distance of Choroid Study (DOCS). Design Validity and reliability analysis. Methods Enrolled patients underwent repeated SDOCT imaging using the Spectralis OCT (Heidelberg Engineering, Heidelberg, Germany). A single technician certified for clinical trials took 3 macular volume scans. Retinal thicknesses were calculated for each of the 9 Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) macular subfields. Center point thickness and total macular volume were also included in the analysis. Manual subfoveal choroidal thickness measurements were made by a masked observer. Results A total of 40 eyes of 40 patients were included in this analysis (mean [\u00b1 standard deviation] age: 74.1 [\u00b1 7.2] years, 60% male). The coefficient of repeatability (CR) of the central macular subfield was 30.6 \u03bcm (95% confidence interval [CI] 29.8-1.4 \u03bcm). The CR for the other macular subfields ranged from 7.0 \u03bcm to 38.2 \u03bcm. The CR for the total macular volume was 0.212 mm3 (95% CI 0.206-0.217 mm3) and the CR for the center point was 47.5 \u03bcm (95% CI 46.2-48.7 \u03bcm). Images were also reviewed for the presence of segmentation error in the central macular subfield, and after exclusion of these eyes the revised CR for this subfield was 13.7 \u03bcm (95% CI 13.3-14.1 \u03bcm). The intrasession CR of subfoveal choroidal thickness was 34.7 \u03bcm (95% CI 33.7-35.7 \u03bcm). Conclusions This study suggests that a change of greater than 31 \u03bcm in Spectralis SDOCT-derived retinal thickness measurement of the central macular subfield and 35 \u03bcm in subfoveal choroidal thickness is necessary to detect true clinical change associated with disease progression or improvement in nAMD with a revised figure of 14 \u03bcm for central macular retinal subfield thickness in the absence of segmentation error.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Choroid", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Organ Size", "Prospective Studies", "Reproducibility of Results", "Retina", "Tomography, Optical Coherence", "Wet Macular Degeneration"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84966397001", "SubjectAreas": [["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"]], "AuthorData": {"56086533500": {"Name": "Hanumunthadu D.", "AuthorID": "56086533500", "AffiliationID": "60016691, 60022148, 60172638, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health Research, Biomedical Research Centre, Moorfields Eye Hospital, National Health Service, Foundation Trust, University College London, Institute of Ophthalmology, NHS Foundation Trust"}, "54917457500": {"Name": "Ilginis T.", "AuthorID": "54917457500", "AffiliationID": "60016691, 60022148, 60172638, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health Research, Biomedical Research Centre, Moorfields Eye Hospital, National Health Service, Foundation Trust, University College London, Institute of Ophthalmology, NHS Foundation Trust"}, "6701811432": {"Name": "Restori M.", "AuthorID": "6701811432", "AffiliationID": "60016691, 60022148, 60172638, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health Research, Biomedical Research Centre, Moorfields Eye Hospital, National Health Service, Foundation Trust, University College London, Institute of Ophthalmology, NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57203054292": {"Name": "Sagoo M.", "AuthorID": "57203054292", "AffiliationID": "60016691, 60022148, 60172638, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health Research, Biomedical Research Centre, Moorfields Eye Hospital, National Health Service, Foundation Trust, University College London, Institute of Ophthalmology, NHS Foundation Trust"}, "15924308700": {"Name": "Tufail A.", "AuthorID": "15924308700", "AffiliationID": "60016691, 60022148, 60172638, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health Research, Biomedical Research Centre, Moorfields Eye Hospital, National Health Service, Foundation Trust, University College London, Institute of Ophthalmology, NHS Foundation Trust"}, "8588146600": {"Name": "Balaggan K.S.", "AuthorID": "8588146600", "AffiliationID": "60016691, 60022148, 60172638, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health Research, Biomedical Research Centre, Moorfields Eye Hospital, National Health Service, Foundation Trust, University College London, Institute of Ophthalmology, NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7401717575": {"Name": "Patel P.J.", "AuthorID": "7401717575", "AffiliationID": "60016691, 60022148, 60172638, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health Research, Biomedical Research Centre, Moorfields Eye Hospital, National Health Service, Foundation Trust, University College London, Institute of Ophthalmology, NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
