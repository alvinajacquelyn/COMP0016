A debate exists as to whether SCOB is a true phenomenon or a statistical artefact. In this study, we examine time trends and determinants of SCOB in Egypt and test the hypothesis that increased child sugary snack consumption, and reduced fruit/vegetable consumption (markers of poor dietary diversity) are associated with SCOB. Data on 25,065 mothers and their children from the Egyptian Demographic and Health Surveys from 1992, 1995, 2005 and 2008 are used to examine trends in child stunting, maternal obesity and child\u2013mother household type [normal/non-obese, stunted/non-obese, normal/obese, stunted/obese (SCOB)]. The association of child sugary snack and fruit/vegetable consumption with household type is also examined using multinomial logistic regression adjusting for maternal age, maternal education, child age, breastfeeding, household wealth and urban/rural residence. The prevalence of SCOB increased between the periods 1992/95 and 2005/08 despite reductions in stunting levels. This increase paralleled a rise in maternal obesity. Child sugary snack consumption was associated with higher odds (51 %) of belonging to a SCOB household compared with normal/non-obese households, while fruit/vegetable consumption was associated with lower odds (24 %). The results suggest the existence of a link between the rise in maternal obesity and an increase in SCOB, and an association between child sugary snack consumption and SCOB. Addressing SCOB may require a household\u2014rather than individual-based approach to nutrition.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Double burden", "Epidemiology", "Nutrition", "Obesity", "Socioeconomic factors", "Stunting"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Child Nutrition Disorders", "Child, Preschool", "Developing Countries", "Diet", "Educational Status", "Egypt", "Family Characteristics", "Female", "Growth Disorders", "Health Surveys", "Humans", "Infant", "Logistic Models", "Maternal Age", "Middle Aged", "Mother-Child Relations", "Obesity", "Pediatric Obesity", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84957935852", "SubjectAreas": [["Epidemiology", "MEDI", "2713"], ["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Obstetrics and Gynecology", "MEDI", "2729"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"24764458000": {"Name": "Aitsi-Selmi A.", "AuthorID": "24764458000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health"}}}
