However, the defect distribution formed during irradiation is expected to be temperature dependent due to the differences in lattice energy caused by a temperature change. This has been tested through defect analysis of two p-channel e2v CCD204 devices, one irradiated at room temperature and one at a cryogenic temperature (153 K). Analysis is performed using the method of single trap pumping. The dominant charge trapping defects at these conditions have been identified as the donor level of the silicon divacancy and the carbon interstitial defect. The defect parameters are analyzed both immediately postirradiation and following several subsequent roomerature anneal phases up until a cumulative anneal time of approximately 10 months. We have also simulated charge transfer in an irradiated CCD pixel using the defect distribution from both the roomerature and cryogenic case, to study how the changes affect imaging performance. The results demonstrate the importance of cryogenic irradiation and annealing studies, with large variations seen in the defect distribution when compared to a device irradiated at roomerature, which is the current standard procedure for radiation-tolerance testing.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Carbon", "charge coupled devices (CCDs)", "defect", "divacancy", "p-channel", "pocket pumping", "radiation damage", "trap pumping"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cryogenic temperatures", "Defect distribution", "Divacancies", "Interstitial defects", "P channels", "Radiation tolerances", "Standard procedures", "Temperature dependent"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85037732192", "SubjectAreas": [["Nuclear and High Energy Physics", "PHYS", "3106"], ["Nuclear Energy and Engineering", "ENER", "2104"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"57198667804": {"Name": "Wood D.", "AuthorID": "57198667804", "AffiliationID": "60012113", "AffiliationName": "Center for Electronic Imaging, Department of Physical Sciences, Open University"}, "57214169439": {"Name": "Hall D.", "AuthorID": "57214169439", "AffiliationID": "60012113", "AffiliationName": "Center for Electronic Imaging, Department of Physical Sciences, Open University"}, "22984865200": {"Name": "Gow J.", "AuthorID": "22984865200", "AffiliationID": "60012113", "AffiliationName": "Center for Electronic Imaging, Department of Physical Sciences, Open University"}, "35100980600": {"Name": "Skottfelt J.", "AuthorID": "35100980600", "AffiliationID": "60012113", "AffiliationName": "Center for Electronic Imaging, Department of Physical Sciences, Open University"}, "7007134520": {"Name": "Stefanov K.", "AuthorID": "7007134520", "AffiliationID": "60012113", "AffiliationName": "Center for Electronic Imaging, Department of Physical Sciences, Open University"}, "7202996580": {"Name": "Holland A.", "AuthorID": "7202996580", "AffiliationID": "60012113", "AffiliationName": "Center for Electronic Imaging, Department of Physical Sciences, Open University"}, "24073235100": {"Name": "Murray N.", "AuthorID": "24073235100", "AffiliationID": "119895222", "AffiliationName": "Dynamic Imaging Analytics"}}}
