Most existing studies concerning the characterization of the bond\u2013slip relationship have been carried out on elements built with deformed reinforcing bars. The bond\u2013slip relationship for plain bars is still not well known, and current empirical expressions are found not to take into account all the factors that influence bond\u2013slip performance. This paper presents the results of ten sets of pull-out tests (nine monotonic and one cyclic) performed on specimens built with hot-rolled plain bars. One additional set of specimens built with deformed bars was tested monotonically to highlight the difference, in terms of bond\u2013slip relationship, between plain and deformed rebars. Based on the experimental results, new empirical expressions are proposed for the parameters adopted in one of the more recent bond\u2013slip models for plain bars available in the literature. The new empirical expressions take into account the concrete compressive strength, rebar yield stress, embedded length and bar diameter, and are an improvement on existing expressions. Finally, a new monotonic bond\u2013slip model is proposed, which better represents the bond\u2013slip relationship after the peak strength.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bond\u2013slip relationships", "Existing RC structures", "Plain reinforcing bars", "Pull-out tests"], "IndexKeywords": ["Concrete compressive strength", "Deformed reinforcing bar", "Empirical expression", "European Countries", "Pull-out test", "RC structure", "Reinforcing bar", "Structural elements"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84938841875", "SubjectAreas": [["Civil and Structural Engineering", "ENGI", "2205"], ["Building and Construction", "ENGI", "2215"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Mechanics of Materials", "ENGI", "2211"]], "AuthorData": {"12039997100": {"Name": "Melo J.", "AuthorID": "12039997100", "AffiliationID": "60024825", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil Engineering, University of Aveiro"}, "23135674700": {"Name": "Varum H.", "AuthorID": "23135674700", "AffiliationID": "60024825", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil Engineering, University of Aveiro"}, "7801656850": {"Name": "Rossetto T.", "AuthorID": "7801656850", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil, Environmental & Geomatic Engineering, University College of London"}}}
