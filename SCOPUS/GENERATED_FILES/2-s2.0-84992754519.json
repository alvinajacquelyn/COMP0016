This work evaluates the water-equivalence of novel water-equivalent plastics specifically designed for light-ion beams, as well as commercially available plastics in a clinical high-energy carbon-ion beam. A plasticto- water conversion factor Hpl,w was established to derive absorbed dose to water in a water phantom from ionization chamber readings performed in a plastic phantom. Three trial plastic materials with varying atomic compositions were produced and experimentally characterized in a high-energy carbon-ion beam. Measurements were performed with a Roos ionization chamber, using a broad un-modulated beam of 11 \u00d7 11 cm2, to measure the plastic-to-water conversion factor for the novel materials. The experimental results were compared with Monte Carlo simulations. Commercially available plastics were also simulated for comparison with the plastics tested experimentally, with particular attention to the influence of nuclear interaction cross sections. The measured Hpl,w exp correction increased gradually from 0% at the surface to 0.7% at a depth near the Bragg peak for one of the plastics prepared in this work, while for the other two plastics a maximum correction of 0.8%-1.3% was found. Average differences between experimental and numerical simulations were 0.2%. Monte Carlo results showed that for polyethylene, polystyrene, Rando phantom soft tissue and A-150, the correction increased from 0% to 2.5%-4.0% with depth, while for PMMA it increased to 2%. Water-equivalent plastics such as, Plastic Water, RMI-457, Gammex 457-CTG, WT1 and Virtual Water, gave similar results where maximum corrections were of the order of 2%. Considering the results from Monte Carlo simulations, one of the novel plastics was found to be superior in comparison with the plastic materials currently used in dosimetry, demonstrating that it is feasible to tailor plastic materials to be water-equivalent for carbon ions specifically.", "AuthorKeywords": ["carbon-ion radiotherapy", "conversion factors", "relative dosimetry", "water-equivalent plastics"], "IndexKeywords": ["Atomic compositions", "Average difference", "Carbon ion radiotherapy", "Conversion factor", "Experimental characterization", "Monte Carlo results", "Nuclear interaction", "Water equivalent", "Carbon", "Humans", "Models, Theoretical", "Monte Carlo Method", "Phantoms, Imaging", "Plastics", "Radiometry", "Radiotherapy, High-Energy", "Water"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84992754519", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiological and Ultrasound Technology", "HEAL", "3614"], ["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"56526411700": {"Name": "Louren\u00e7o A.", "AuthorID": "56526411700", "AffiliationID": "60010785", "AffiliationName": "Division of Acoustics and Ionising Radiation, National Physical Laboratory"}, "7005472272": {"Name": "Royle G.", "AuthorID": "7005472272", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "11940630000": {"Name": "Thomas R.", "AuthorID": "11940630000", "AffiliationID": "60010785", "AffiliationName": "Division of Acoustics and Ionising Radiation, National Physical Laboratory"}, "57191753454": {"Name": "Homer M.", "AuthorID": "57191753454", "AffiliationID": "60010785", "AffiliationName": "Division of Acoustics and Ionising Radiation, National Physical Laboratory"}, "6701569343": {"Name": "Palmans H.", "AuthorID": "6701569343", "AffiliationID": "60112015", "AffiliationName": "Medical Physics Group, EBG MedAustron GmbH"}, "57191749885": {"Name": "Wellock N.", "AuthorID": "57191749885", "AffiliationID": "60004093, 60159931", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Physics, St Bartholomew's Hospital, Barts Health NHS Trust"}, "8533692200": {"Name": "Macdougall N.", "AuthorID": "8533692200", "AffiliationID": "60004093, 60159931", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Physics, St Bartholomew's Hospital, Barts Health NHS Trust"}, "6603838207": {"Name": "Bouchard H.", "AuthorID": "6603838207", "AffiliationID": "60009507", "AffiliationName": "D\u00e9partement de Physique, Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al, Pavillon Roger-Gaudry"}, "7202219344": {"Name": "Kanai T.", "AuthorID": "7202219344", "AffiliationID": "60161943, 60014756", "AffiliationName": "Gunma University Heavy Ion Medical Center, Gunma University"}}}
