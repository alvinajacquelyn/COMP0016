The American Astronomical Society. All rights reserved..A variety of methods have been proposed to define and to quantify galaxy environments. While these techniques work well in general with spectroscopic redshift samples, their application to photometric redshift surveys remains uncertain. To investigate whether galaxy environments can be robustly measured with photo-z samples, we quantify how the density measured with the nearest-neighbor approach is affected by photo-z uncertainties by using the Durham mock galaxy catalogs in which the 3D real-space environments and the properties of galaxies are known exactly. Furthermore, we present an optimization scheme in the choice of parameters used in the 2D projected measurements that yield the tightest correlation with respect to the 3D real-space environments. By adopting the optimized parameters in the density measurements, we show that the correlation between the 2D projected optimized density and the real-space density can still be revealed, and the color-density relation is also visible out to z \u223c 0.8 even for a photo-z uncertainty (\u03c3\u03b4z/(1+z)) up to 0.06. We find that at redshifts 0.3 < z < 0.5 a deep (i \u223c 25) photometric redshift survey with \u03c3\u03b4z/(1+z) yields a performance in small-scale density measurement that is comparable to a shallower i \u223c 22.5 spectroscopic sample with \u223c10% sampling rate. Finally, we discuss the application of the local density measurements to the Pan-STARRS1 Medium Deep Survey (PS-MDS), one of the largest deep optical imaging surveys. Using data from \u223c5 square degrees of survey area, our results show that it is possible to measure local density and to probe the color-density relation with 3\u03c3 confidence level out to z \u223c 0.8 in the PS-MDS. The color-density relation, however, quickly degrades for data covering smaller areas.", "AuthorKeywords": ["galaxies: evolution", "galaxies: formation", "galaxies: halos"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84978387423", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"57190220588": {"Name": "Lai C.", "AuthorID": "57190220588", "AffiliationID": "60091990, 60016969", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics, Academia Sinica"}, "35373583000": {"Name": "Chiueh T.", "AuthorID": "35373583000", "AffiliationID": "60005429", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, National Taiwan University"}, "35313961500": {"Name": "Lin L.", "AuthorID": "35313961500", "AffiliationID": "60091990, 60016969", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics, Academia Sinica"}, "7005705180": {"Name": "Jian H.", "AuthorID": "7005705180", "AffiliationID": "60005429", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, National Taiwan University"}, "36617079900": {"Name": "Chen C.", "AuthorID": "36617079900", "AffiliationID": "60091990, 60016969", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics, Academia Sinica"}, "50761302000": {"Name": "Merson A.", "AuthorID": "50761302000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "7005287980": {"Name": "Baugh C.", "AuthorID": "7005287980", "AffiliationID": "60022175", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Computational Cosmology, Department of Physics, Durham University"}, "6602932157": {"Name": "Foucaud S.", "AuthorID": "6602932157", "AffiliationID": "60025084", "AffiliationName": "Center for Astronomy and Astrophysics, Shanghai Jiao Tong University"}, "35242015200": {"Name": "Chen W.", "AuthorID": "35242015200", "AffiliationID": "60024666", "AffiliationName": "Graduate Institute of Astronomy, National Central University"}}}
