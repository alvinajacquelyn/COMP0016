The school is situated in an area of London that has consistently featured as one of poverty. Unlike some other schools which changed their student population in search of success, the school continues to serve its immediate local community which compromises almost mainly working class families. Although empirical research undertaken in the school demonstrates some evidence of \u2018principled infidelity\u2019 (seeming to follow external policy diktats whilst pursuing their own agenda) we conclude that the ethos underpinning the school\u2019s sustained improvement is the concept of \u2018critical hope\u2019. This is an approach where the needs of young people in disadvantaged communities are recognised and addressed in order to provide them with the opportunity to control their destiny. The consequence is that the school has exceeded its prescripted expectations, continues to improve and has lifted both the students and the community\u2019s aspirations exponentially.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Critical hope", "Public school", "School leadership", "Urban education"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84980006528", "SubjectAreas": [["Urban Studies", "SOCI", "3322"]], "AuthorData": {"36089232800": {"Name": "Palaiologou I.", "AuthorID": "36089232800", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "London Centre for Leadership in Education, UCL Institute of Education"}, "6602662694": {"Name": "Male T.", "AuthorID": "6602662694", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "London Centre for Leadership in Education, UCL Institute of Education"}}}
