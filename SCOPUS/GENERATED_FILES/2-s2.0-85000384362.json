I show for a general joint distribution of the agents' preferences that the searcher's optimal policy is a threshold rule. In contrast to the standard model, the threshold is weakly decreasing in time (i.e., exhibits the \"discouragement effect\"), although the search horizon is infinite and the search environment stationary. I characterise the threshold and discuss the testable implications of the discouragement effect. The characteristics of my model differ from two single-agent search models that feature a time-varying threshold (convex search costs or deadline). In particular, my model features a threshold that decreases endogenously over time and never generates return to an item rejected earlier, in contrast to the other models.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Discouragement effect", "Multi-agent search", "Sequential search", "Threshold policy"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85000384362", "SubjectAreas": [["Economics and Econometrics", "ECON", "2002"], ["Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management", "BUSI", "1407"]], "AuthorData": {"55273551200": {"Name": "Mauring E.", "AuthorID": "55273551200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Economics, University College London"}}}
