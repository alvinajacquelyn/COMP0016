However, the low theoretical capacity and conductivity of titanium dioxide has limited its application. In this work, rutile TiO2 was synthesized using a batch hydrothermal method, and doped with Nb5+ (3.5 at%). <Potentiodynamic/galvanostatic > cycling in the range 1.0\u20133.0 V vs Li/Li+ was used to determine the Li-ion capacity of the doped and pristine TiO2 material, and electrochemical cycling was used to measure the extent of conversion from the lithiated to de-lithiated state. The nanoscale structures of the pristine and doped materials were determined by powder X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area measurements. Cycling in the range 1.0\u20133.0 V vs Li/Li+ showed that Nb5+ doping into the structure resulted in higher charge capacities. After 100 cycles at 100 mA g\u22121, the Nb-doped rutile TiO2 maintained a capacity of ca. 390 mAh g\u22121, 64% higher than undoped TiO2. For electrochemical cycling in the range 0.05\u20133.0 V vs Li/Li+, the introduction of Nb5+ resulted in a higher conversion of rutile TiO2 from the lithiated to de-lithiated state. The higher capacity of the doped TiO2 is shown to be mainly due to the smaller particle size, optimized surface area, and orientation of the nanorods.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Brunauer-emmett-teller surface areas", "Electrochemical cycling", "Hydrothermal methods", "Lithium ion insertion", "Nanoscale structure", "Negative electrode material", "Powder X ray diffraction", "Theoretical capacity"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85050201057", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"]], "AuthorData": {"56790109900": {"Name": "Gardecka A.J.", "AuthorID": "56790109900", "AffiliationID": "60030743", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Materials Research and Engineering (IMRE), A*STAR (Agency for Science, Technology and Research)"}, "55226279200": {"Name": "L\u00fcbke M.", "AuthorID": "55226279200", "AffiliationID": "60030743", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Materials Research and Engineering (IMRE), A*STAR (Agency for Science, Technology and Research)"}, "56217400400": {"Name": "Parkin I.P.", "AuthorID": "56217400400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "6603926697": {"Name": "Darr J.A.", "AuthorID": "6603926697", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "57193522107": {"Name": "Armer C.F.", "AuthorID": "57193522107", "AffiliationID": "60008950", "AffiliationName": "College of Engineering and Computer Science, Australian National University"}, "57194285749": {"Name": "Ning D.", "AuthorID": "57194285749", "AffiliationID": "60030743", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Materials Research and Engineering (IMRE), A*STAR (Agency for Science, Technology and Research)"}, "55820974500": {"Name": "Liu Z.", "AuthorID": "55820974500", "AffiliationID": "60030743", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Materials Research and Engineering (IMRE), A*STAR (Agency for Science, Technology and Research)"}, "57189525733": {"Name": "Lowe A.", "AuthorID": "57189525733", "AffiliationID": "60008950", "AffiliationName": "College of Engineering and Computer Science, Australian National University"}, "57216102131": {"Name": "Reddy M.V.", "AuthorID": "57216102131", "AffiliationID": "60017161", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials Science and Engineering, National University of Singapore"}, "57203002002": {"Name": "Williams A.S.", "AuthorID": "57203002002", "AffiliationID": "120984267", "AffiliationName": "Isogonal Ltd"}}}
