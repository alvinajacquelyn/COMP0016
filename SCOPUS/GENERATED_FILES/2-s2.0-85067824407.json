The study provides evidence confirming that the approach is increasingly popular; and takes stock of crime scripting practices through a systematic review of over 100 scripts published between 1994 and 2018. The results offer the first comprehensive picture of this approach and highlight new directions for those interested in using data from cyber-systems and the Internet of Things to develop effective situational crime prevention measures.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Crime commission process", "crime script", "modus operandi", "scenario", "situational crime prevention"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85067824407", "SubjectAreas": [["Law", "SOCI", "3308"]], "AuthorData": {"57188839935": {"Name": "Dehghanniri H.", "AuthorID": "57188839935", "AffiliationID": "60017098", "AffiliationName": "De Montfort University"}, "22233563100": {"Name": "Borrion H.", "AuthorID": "22233563100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
