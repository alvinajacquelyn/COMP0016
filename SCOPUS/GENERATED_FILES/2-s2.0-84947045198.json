The sequence was dated by radiocarbon and tephrochronology and used for multi-proxy analyses (chironomids, pollen, diatoms). Although the evolution of Beringian climate through the Holocene is primarily driven by global forcing mechanisms, regional controls, such as volcanic activity or vegetation dynamics, lead to a spatial heterogeneous response. This study aims to reconstruct past changes in the aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems and to separate the climate-driven response from a response to regional or localised environmental change. Radiocarbon dates from plant macrophytes gave a basal date of 7800 cal. yr BP. Coring terminated in a tephra layer, so sedimentation at the lake started prior to this date, possibly in the early Holocene following local glacier retreat. Initially the catchment vegetation was dominated by Betula and Alnus woodland with a mosaic of open, wet, aquatic and semi-aquatic habitats. Between 7800 and 6000 cal. yr BP the diatom-inferred lake water was pH. 4.4-5.3 and chironomid and diatom assemblages in the lake were initially dominated by a small number of acidophilic/acid tolerant taxa. The frequency of Pinus pumila (Siberian dwarf pine) pollen increased from 5000 cal. yr BP and threshold analysis indicates that P. pumila arrived in the catchment between 4200 and 3000 cal. yr BP. Its range expansion was probably mediated by strengthening of the Aleutian Low pressure system and increased winter snowfall. The diatom-inferred pH reconstructions show that after an initial period of low pH, pH gradually increased from 5500 cal. yr BP to pH. 5.8 at 1500 cal. yr BP. This trend of increasing pH through the Holocene is unusual in lake records, but the initially low pH may have resulted directly or indirectly from intense regional volcanic activity during the mid-Holocene. The chironomid-inferred July temperature reconstruction suggests cool periods between 3200-2800. cal. yr BP and 1100-700. cal. yr BP and a warmer period between 2800 and 1100 cal. yr BP. Chironomid and diatom DCA scores decline from ca. 6000 cal. yr BP, indicating compositional changes in these aquatic assemblages. In comparison declines in pollen PCA scores are delayed, starting ca. 5100 cal. yr BP. The results suggest that while catchment vegetation was responding primarily to climate change, the biota within the lake and lake water chemistry were responding to localised environmental conditions.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Chironomids", "Climate", "Diatoms", "Holocene", "Kamchatka", "Pollen"], "IndexKeywords": ["Chironomids", "Climate", "Diatoms", "Holocenes", "Kamchatka", "Pollen"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84947045198", "SubjectAreas": [["Global and Planetary Change", "ENVI", "2306"], ["Oceanography", "EART", "1910"]], "AuthorData": {"23478887200": {"Name": "Self A.", "AuthorID": "23478887200", "AffiliationID": "60025352", "AffiliationName": "Department of Life Sciences, The Natural History Museum"}, "7401651179": {"Name": "Brooks S.", "AuthorID": "7401651179", "AffiliationID": "60025352", "AffiliationName": "Department of Life Sciences, The Natural History Museum"}, "56593304900": {"Name": "Klimaschewski A.", "AuthorID": "56593304900", "AffiliationID": "60029738", "AffiliationName": "School of Geography, Archaeology and Palaeoecology, Queen's University Belfast"}, "35478979400": {"Name": "Solovieva N.", "AuthorID": "35478979400", "AffiliationID": "60070941", "AffiliationName": "Kazan Federal University, Institute of Geology and Petroleum Technologies"}, "23044212200": {"Name": "Jones V.", "AuthorID": "23044212200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Environmental Change Research Centre, University College London"}, "56186700900": {"Name": "Andreev A.", "AuthorID": "56186700900", "AffiliationID": "60024025", "AffiliationName": "Institut f\u00fcr Geologie und Mineralogie, Universit\u00e4t zu K\u00f6ln"}, "6602857637": {"Name": "Andr\u00e9n E.", "AuthorID": "6602857637", "AffiliationID": "60021136", "AffiliationName": "School of Natural Sciences, Technology and Environmental Studies, S\u00f6dert\u00f6rn University"}, "6602158246": {"Name": "Hammarlund D.", "AuthorID": "6602158246", "AffiliationID": "60029170", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geology, Quaternary Sciences, Lund University"}}}
