The study area varied by water depth (12-111 m), organic carbon content (0.09-1.57% TOC), grain size, hydrographic regime (well-mixed vs. stratified), and water column phytodetrital input (represented by algal polyunsaturated PLFA). The relative abundance of bacterial-derived PLFA (sum of methyl-branched, cyclopropyl and odd-carbon number PLFA) was positively correlated with fine-grained sediment, and was highest in the depositional mud belt. A strong association between bacterial biomass and eukaryote primary production was suggested based on observed positive correlations with total nitrogen and algal polyunsaturated fatty acids. In addition, 16S rRNA genes affiliated to the classes Clostridia and Flavobacteria represented a major proportion of total 16S rRNA gene sequences. This suggests that benthic bacterial communities are also important degraders of phytodetrital organic matter and closely coupled to water column productivity in the western Irish Sea.", "AuthorKeywords": ["16S rRNA gene barcoded pyrosequencing", "Irish Sea", "Marine sedimentary bacteria", "Phospholipid ester-linked fatty acids", "Shelf sediment"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84949818245", "SubjectAreas": [["Oceanography", "EART", "1910"], ["Aquatic Science", "AGRI", "1104"], ["Geology", "EART", "1907"]], "AuthorData": {"57200085185": {"Name": "O'Reilly S.", "AuthorID": "57200085185", "AffiliationID": "60025059", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemical Sciences, Dublin City University"}, "26647840700": {"Name": "Szpak M.", "AuthorID": "26647840700", "AffiliationID": "60025059", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemical Sciences, Dublin City University"}, "57203250907": {"Name": "Murphy B.", "AuthorID": "57203250907", "AffiliationID": "60025059", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemical Sciences, Dublin City University"}, "26432108000": {"Name": "Jordan S.", "AuthorID": "26432108000", "AffiliationID": "60025059", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemical Sciences, Dublin City University"}, "7004496128": {"Name": "Kelleher B.", "AuthorID": "7004496128", "AffiliationID": "60025059", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemical Sciences, Dublin City University"}, "55846104500": {"Name": "Pentlavalli P.", "AuthorID": "55846104500", "AffiliationID": "60029738", "AffiliationName": "School of Biological Sciences, Queen's University Belfast, Medical Biology Centre"}, "40361226500": {"Name": "Flanagan P.", "AuthorID": "40361226500", "AffiliationID": "60029738", "AffiliationName": "School of Biological Sciences, Queen's University Belfast, Medical Biology Centre"}, "7402266049": {"Name": "Allen C.", "AuthorID": "7402266049", "AffiliationID": "60029738", "AffiliationName": "School of Biological Sciences, Queen's University Belfast, Medical Biology Centre"}, "57211236070": {"Name": "Monteys X.", "AuthorID": "57211236070", "AffiliationID": "60026271", "AffiliationName": "Geological Survey of Ireland, Beggars Bush"}}}
