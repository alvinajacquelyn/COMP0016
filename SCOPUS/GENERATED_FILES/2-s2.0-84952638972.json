This review details the following conditions: complete and incomplete achromatopsia, blue-cone monochromatism, oligocone trichromacy, bradyopsia and Bornholm eye disease. We describe the clinical, psychophysical, electrophysiological and imaging findings that are characteristic to each condition in order to aid their accurate diagnosis, as well as highlight some classically held notions about these diseases that have come to be challenged over the recent years. The latest data regarding the genetic aetiology and pathological changes observed in the cone dysfunction syndromes are discussed, and, where relevant, translational avenues of research, including completed and anticipated interventional clinical trials, for some of the diseases described herein will be presented. Finally, we briefly review the current management of these disorders.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Color Vision Defects", "Genotype", "Humans", "Phenotype", "Retinal Cone Photoreceptor Cells", "Retinal Diseases", "Syndrome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84952638972", "SubjectAreas": [["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"], ["Sensory Systems", "NEUR", "2809"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"]], "AuthorData": {"24278380300": {"Name": "Aboshiha J.", "AuthorID": "24278380300", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "34876470600": {"Name": "Dubis A.M.", "AuthorID": "34876470600", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "57197636332": {"Name": "Hardcastle A.J.", "AuthorID": "57197636332", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "7101991490": {"Name": "Michaelides M.", "AuthorID": "7101991490", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "7402034918": {"Name": "Carroll J.", "AuthorID": "7402034918", "AffiliationID": "60012553", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, Medical College of Wisconsin"}}}
