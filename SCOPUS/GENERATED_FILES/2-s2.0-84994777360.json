Objective To examine the potential impact of these trials on changes in clinical practice and life-years saved. Design, setting, and participants A model was developed to examine the impact of changes in clinical practice in the UK. A survey of clinicians who treat men with prostate cancer in the UK and Canada was performed. Measurements Outcomes of interest were the proportion of patients treated with different approaches and the predicted number of life-years saved due to changes in clinical practice. Survey data were cross-tabulated and Pearson's \u03c72 tests were applied. Results and limitations The survey was completed by 193 clinicians (105 from the UK, 80 from Canada), of whom 70% were clinical/radiation oncologists, 8% were medical oncologists, and 15% were urologists. UK respondents were more likely to report a change in practice in response to the results (44% UK vs 21% Canada). Canadians were more likely to have already been using ADT plus radiotherapy (77% Canada vs 56% UK). The increase in the proportion of patients in the UK treated with ADT + EBRT could result in around 3730\u20135177 extra life-years at 15 yr from a cohort of 7930 men diagnosed in a single calendar year, compared to if all had been treated with ADT alone. Conclusions Trial findings have changed clinical practice, meaning that men with locally advanced prostate cancer are likely to survive longer. Patient summary Doctors in the UK have changed practice in response to evidence on the superiority of hormone therapy plus radiotherapy to hormone therapy alone. These changes will improve the survival of men with locally advanced prostate cancer. Further reductions in the use of hormone therapy alone could further improve survival.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Androgen deprivation therapy", "Clinical practice", "External beam radiotherapy", "Impact", "Knowledge translation", "Prostate cancer"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84994777360", "SubjectAreas": [["Urology", "MEDI", "2748"]], "AuthorData": {"36657711300": {"Name": "South A.", "AuthorID": "36657711300", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council Clinical Trials Unit, University College London"}, "55836382400": {"Name": "Sydes M.R.", "AuthorID": "55836382400", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council Clinical Trials Unit, University College London"}, "7102310808": {"Name": "Parmar M.K.", "AuthorID": "7102310808", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council Clinical Trials Unit, University College London"}, "6603176839": {"Name": "Parulekar W.R.", "AuthorID": "6603176839", "AffiliationID": "60016005, 60083903", "AffiliationName": "NCIC Clinical Trials Group, Queen's University"}, "8243453300": {"Name": "Chen B.E.", "AuthorID": "8243453300", "AffiliationID": "60016005, 60083903", "AffiliationName": "NCIC Clinical Trials Group, Queen's University"}, "7201772622": {"Name": "Clarke N.", "AuthorID": "7201772622", "AffiliationID": "60028784", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, The Christie NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7005254014": {"Name": "Warde P.", "AuthorID": "7005254014", "AffiliationID": "60027817", "AffiliationName": "Princess Margaret Hospital"}, "7201987236": {"Name": "Mason M.", "AuthorID": "7201987236", "AffiliationID": "60103683", "AffiliationName": "Cardiff University School of Medicine"}}}
