The bounds on the uncertainties are employed in the observer design to enhance the robustness when the structure of the uncertainties is available for design. Under the condition that the structure distribution matrices of the uncertainties are known, a robust sliding-mode observer is designed and a set of sufficient conditions is developed to guarantee that the error dynamics are asymptotically stable. In the case that the structure of uncertainties is unknown, an ultimately bounded approximate observer is developed to estimate the system states using sliding mode techniques. The results obtained are applied to a multimachine power system, and simulation for a two-machine power system is presented to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the developed methods.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Asymptotically stable", "Distribution matrices", "Multi machine power system", "Observer design", "Robust sliding mode", "Sliding mode techniques", "Ultimately bounded", "Unstructured uncertainty"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85019147316", "SubjectAreas": [["Control and Systems Engineering", "ENGI", "2207"], ["Human-Computer Interaction", "COMP", "1709"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Control and Optimization", "MATH", "2606"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"57190493298": {"Name": "Mohamed M.", "AuthorID": "57190493298", "AffiliationID": "60010818", "AffiliationName": "Instrumentation, Control and Embedded Systems Research Group, School of Engineering and Digital Arts, University of Kent"}, "7403595938": {"Name": "Yan X.", "AuthorID": "7403595938", "AffiliationID": "60010818", "AffiliationName": "Instrumentation, Control and Embedded Systems Research Group, School of Engineering and Digital Arts, University of Kent"}, "7005642573": {"Name": "Spurgeon S.", "AuthorID": "7005642573", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, UCL"}, "36047336900": {"Name": "Jiang B.", "AuthorID": "36047336900", "AffiliationID": "60021666", "AffiliationName": "College of Automation Engineering, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics"}}}
