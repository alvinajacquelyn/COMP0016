When listening to music we constantly generate plausible hypotheses about what could happen next, while actively attending to music resolves the ensuing uncertainty. Within the predictive coding framework, we present a novel formulation of precision filtering and attentional selection, which explains why some lower-level auditory, and even higher-level music-syntactic processes elicited by irregular events are relatively exempt from top-down predictive processes. We review findings providing unique evidence for the attentional selection of salient auditory features. This formulation suggests that \u2018listening\u2019 is a more active process than traditionally conceived in models of perception.", "AuthorKeywords": ["active inference", "auditory processing", "embodiment", "ERAN", "MMN", "music perception", "predictive coding"], "IndexKeywords": ["active inference", "Auditory processing", "embodiment", "ERAN", "Music perception", "Predictive coding", "Anticipation, Psychological", "Attention", "Auditory Perception", "Brain", "Humans", "Music"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85057049271", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuropsychology and Physiological Psychology", "PSYC", "3206"], ["Experimental and Cognitive Psychology", "PSYC", "3205"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"]], "AuthorData": {"7003503324": {"Name": "Koelsch S.", "AuthorID": "7003503324", "AffiliationID": "60029622", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biological and Medical Psychology, University of Bergen"}, "16041024200": {"Name": "Vuust P.", "AuthorID": "16041024200", "AffiliationID": "60028262, 60029616", "AffiliationName": "Center for Music in the Brain, Dept. of Clinical Medicine, Aarhus University & The Royal Academy of Music Aarhus/Aalborg"}, "36080215500": {"Name": "Friston K.", "AuthorID": "36080215500", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60084279", "AffiliationName": "The Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging, University College London"}}}
