Most products originate from academic research and are explored in early exploratory clinical trials. However, the success rate toward approval for regular patient care is disappointingly low. In this paper, we define strengths and hurdles applying to the development of cell therapy medicinal products in academic institutes, and analyze why only a few promising cell therapies have reached late-stage clinical development. Subsequently, we provide recommendations to stakeholders involved in development of cell therapies to exploit their potential clinical benefit.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Academies and Institutes", "Biomedical Research", "Cell- and Tissue-Based Therapy", "Humans", "Universities"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84992306826", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"], ["Drug Discovery", "PHAR", "3002"]], "AuthorData": {"57193609707": {"Name": "de Wilde S.", "AuthorID": "57193609707", "AffiliationID": "60015618", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Pharmacy and Toxicology, Leiden University Medical Center"}, "7005148505": {"Name": "Guchelaar H.J.", "AuthorID": "7005148505", "AffiliationID": "60015618", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Pharmacy and Toxicology, Leiden University Medical Center"}, "20735991500": {"Name": "Zandvliet M.", "AuthorID": "20735991500", "AffiliationID": "60015618", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Pharmacy and Toxicology, Leiden University Medical Center"}, "6602610738": {"Name": "Meij P.", "AuthorID": "6602610738", "AffiliationID": "60015618", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Pharmacy and Toxicology, Leiden University Medical Center"}, "6603553785": {"Name": "Herberts C.", "AuthorID": "6603553785", "AffiliationID": "60113759", "AffiliationName": "Pharmacotherapeutic Group 3, Medicines Evaluation Board (MEB)"}, "7003930276": {"Name": "Lowdell M.", "AuthorID": "7003930276", "AffiliationID": "60032819, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Hematology, Royal Free Hospital & University College London"}, "57207901452": {"Name": "Hildebrandt M.", "AuthorID": "57207901452", "AffiliationID": "60019722", "AffiliationName": "Technical University Munich, Faculty of Medicine, TUM Cells Interdisciplinary Center for Cellular Therapies"}}}
