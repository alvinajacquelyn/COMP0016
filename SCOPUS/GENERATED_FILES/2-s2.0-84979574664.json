It is increasingly being used to consider the retention of health workers in low-income countries. However, the determinants of job satisfaction vary in different contexts, and it is important to use measurement methods that are contextually appropriate. We identified a measurement tool developed by Paul Spector, and used mixed methods to assess its validity and reliability in measuring job satisfaction among maternal and newborn health workers (MNHWs) in government facilities in rural Nepal. Methods: We administered the tool to 137 MNHWs and collected qualitative data from 78 MNHWs, and district and central level stakeholders to explore definitions of job satisfaction and factors that affected it. We calculated a job satisfaction index for all MNHWs using quantitative data and tested for validity, reliability and sensitivity. We conducted qualitative content analysis and compared the job satisfaction indices with qualitative data. Results: Results from the internal consistency tests offer encouraging evidence of the validity, reliability and sensitivity of the tool. Overall, the job satisfaction indices reflected the qualitative data. The tool was able to distinguish levels of job satisfaction among MNHWs. However, the work environment and promotion dimensions of the tool did not adequately reflect local conditions. Further, community fit was found to impact job satisfaction but was not captured by the tool. The relatively high incidence of missing responses may suggest that responding to some statements was perceived as risky. Conclusion: Our findings indicate that the adapted job satisfaction survey was able to measure job satisfaction in Nepal. However, it did not include key contextual factors affecting job satisfaction of MNHWs, and as such may have been less sensitive than a more inclusive measure. The findings suggest that this tool can be used in similar settings and populations, with the addition of statements reflecting the nature of the work environment and structure of the local health system. Qualitative data on job satisfaction should be collected before using the tool in a new context, to highlight any locally relevant dimensions of job satisfaction not already captured in the standard survey.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Human resources for health", "Job satisfaction", "Nepal", "Tool validation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Absenteeism", "Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Attitude of Health Personnel", "Career Mobility", "Female", "Health Personnel", "Humans", "Intention", "Job Satisfaction", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Nepal", "Personnel Turnover", "Reproducibility of Results", "Rural Health", "Salaries and Fringe Benefits", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "Workplace", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84979574664", "SubjectAreas": [["Health Policy", "MEDI", "2719"]], "AuthorData": {"55606878900": {"Name": "Batura N.", "AuthorID": "55606878900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "26654536200": {"Name": "Skordis-Worrall J.", "AuthorID": "26654536200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "35732449300": {"Name": "Thapa R.", "AuthorID": "35732449300", "AffiliationID": "105743231", "AffiliationName": "Nick Simons Institute"}, "56625973500": {"Name": "Basnyat R.", "AuthorID": "56625973500", "AffiliationID": "105743231", "AffiliationName": "Nick Simons Institute"}, "9435917600": {"Name": "Morrison J.", "AuthorID": "9435917600", "AffiliationID": "105743231", "AffiliationName": "Nick Simons Institute"}}}
