All rights reserved.Facial deformity significantly affects individuals both psychologically and functionally. Over the past six decades there have been great advances in the management of facial deformity. Developments in orthognathic surgery have been of key importance to improving the outcome for these patients. Orthognathic treatment involves teamwork. The orthodontist plays a vital role in planning and assessment, preparing the patient for surgery and detailing the occlusion post surgery.
