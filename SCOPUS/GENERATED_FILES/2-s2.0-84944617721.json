Body mass index (BMI) fully explained differences in the odds of secondary amenorrhea (SA) across diagnoses. Women with dieting behaviors had borderline significantly higher odds of SA than those without after accounting for BMI. We suggest the presence of a strong association between BMI and SA and that dieting might represent a risk factor for SA regardless of BMI and ED diagnosis.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Amenorrhea", "Body mass index", "Dieting", "Eating disorders", "Menstrual dysfunctions"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Amenorrhea", "Body Mass Index", "Europe", "Feeding and Eating Disorders", "Female", "Health Behavior", "Humans", "Logistic Models", "Menstruation Disturbances", "Oligomenorrhea", "Prevalence", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84944617721", "SubjectAreas": [["Obstetrics and Gynecology", "MEDI", "2729"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"57197508214": {"Name": "Martini M.", "AuthorID": "57197508214", "AffiliationID": "60031624", "AffiliationName": "Psychiatric Unit, United Hospitals of Ancona and Academic Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, Polytechnic University of Marche"}, "16031429800": {"Name": "Micali N.", "AuthorID": "16031429800", "AffiliationID": "60012981", "AffiliationName": "Dept. of Psychiatry, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"}, "55263597100": {"Name": "Solmi F.", "AuthorID": "55263597100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Applied Health Research, University College London"}, "16047693100": {"Name": "Krug I.", "AuthorID": "16047693100", "AffiliationID": "60026553", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychological Sciences, University of Melbourne"}, "57209340703": {"Name": "Karwautz A.", "AuthorID": "57209340703", "AffiliationID": "60011394", "AffiliationName": "Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Medical University of Vienna"}, "56804250900": {"Name": "Wagner G.", "AuthorID": "56804250900", "AffiliationID": "60011394", "AffiliationName": "Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Medical University of Vienna"}, "6602871103": {"Name": "Fernandez-Aranda F.", "AuthorID": "6602871103", "AffiliationID": "60011805, 60025847", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, University Hospital Bellvitge-IDIBELL and CIBER Fisiopatolog\u00eda Obesidad y Nutrici\u00f3n (CIBERobn)"}, "7006097367": {"Name": "Treasure J.", "AuthorID": "7006097367", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Eating Disorders Research Unit, Psychological Medicine, Institute of Psychiatry, King\u2019s College London"}}}
