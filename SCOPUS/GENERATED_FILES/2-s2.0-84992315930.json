As a prerequisite for EPD technique, stable suspension of YSZ nanoparticles has been prepared in isopropanol medium using phosphate ester (PE) as dispersant. Effect of PE concentration on zeta potential, pH, electrical conductivity and stability of the suspension is studied in detail to optimize the suspension chemistry. Due to broad size distribution of YSZ particles in the initial suspension, supernatant is taken after centrifugation for subsequent EPD. This supernatant suspension produced uniform deposit with high packing density (in as-deposited stage) onto non-conducting NiO-YSZ porous substrate. Such as-deposited film resulted in thin and dense YSZ coating (thickness \u223c 3 \u03bcm) when fired at 1200 \u00b0C/2 h. The half-cells (anode + electrolyte) thus obtained is then used to construct SOFC coupon cell by applying a screen-printed La0.65Sr0.3MnO3cathode layer on the top of the electrolyte. A maximum current density of 1.08 Acm\u22122is obtained at 800 \u00b0C and 0.7 V using hydrogen and oxygen as fuel and oxidant respectively.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Electrophoretic deposition", "Nanomaterials", "SOFC", "Suspension chemistry", "Thin films", "YSZ"], "IndexKeywords": ["Broad size distribution", "Electrical conductivity", "Electrophoretic deposition techniques", "Electrophoretic depositions", "High packing density", "Maximum current density", "Stable suspensions", "Yttria-stabilized zirconia thin films"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84992315930", "SubjectAreas": [["Mechanics of Materials", "ENGI", "2211"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"], ["Metals and Alloys", "MATE", "2506"], ["Materials Chemistry", "MATE", "2505"]], "AuthorData": {"57214767056": {"Name": "Das D.", "AuthorID": "57214767056", "AffiliationID": "60023083", "AffiliationName": "Fuel Cell and Battery Division, CSIR-Central Glass & Ceramic Research Institute"}, "16456874100": {"Name": "Bagchi B.", "AuthorID": "16456874100", "AffiliationID": "60023083", "AffiliationName": "Fuel Cell and Battery Division, CSIR-Central Glass & Ceramic Research Institute"}, "55748971300": {"Name": "Basu R.N.", "AuthorID": "55748971300", "AffiliationID": "60023083", "AffiliationName": "Fuel Cell and Battery Division, CSIR-Central Glass & Ceramic Research Institute"}}}
