Sophisticated tools used to investigate their activity in living cells include probes based on fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), bimolecular fluorescence complementation, and photoactivation. However, such methods are of limited use in quickly migrating cells due to a short time available for image acquisition leading to a low signal-to-noise ratio. Attempts to remedy this effect by increasing the intensity of illumination are restricted by photobleaching of probes and the cell photosensitivity. Here we present design and characterization of a new fluorescent probe that selectively binds to active form of Rac1 GTPases, and demonstrate its superior properties for imaging in highly motile Dictyostelium cells. The probe is based on the GTPase-binding domain (GBD) from DPAKa kinase and was selected on the basis of yeast two-hybrid screen, GST pull-down assay and FRET measurements by fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy. DPAKa(GBD) probe binds specifically to GTP-bound Rac1 at the cell membrane and features a low cytoplasmic background. The main advantage of DPAKa(GBD) in comparison with similar probes is its finely graded intensity distribution along the entire plasma membrane, which enables quantitative measurements of the Rac1 activity in different parts of the membrane. Finally, expression of DPAKa(GBD) induces no adverse effects on cell growth, motility and cytokinesis.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cell migration", "Dictyostelium", "FLIM", "Fluorescent probe", "Live cell imaging", "Rho GTPases"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cells, Cultured", "Dictyostelium", "Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer", "p21-Activated Kinases", "rac1 GTP-Binding Protein"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84964507759", "SubjectAreas": [["Histology", "MEDI", "2722"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Medical Laboratory Technology", "HEAL", "3607"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"53983042200": {"Name": "Marinovi\u0107 M.", "AuthorID": "53983042200", "AffiliationID": "60000961", "AffiliationName": "Division of Molecular Biology, Ru\u0111er Bo\u0161kovi\u0107 Institute"}, "56271536500": {"Name": "\u0160o\u0161tar M.", "AuthorID": "56271536500", "AffiliationID": "60000961", "AffiliationName": "Division of Molecular Biology, Ru\u0111er Bo\u0161kovi\u0107 Institute"}, "6505646063": {"Name": "Fili\u0107 V.", "AuthorID": "6505646063", "AffiliationID": "60000961", "AffiliationName": "Division of Molecular Biology, Ru\u0111er Bo\u0161kovi\u0107 Institute"}, "56237652800": {"Name": "Antolovi\u0107 V.", "AuthorID": "56237652800", "AffiliationID": "60000961", "AffiliationName": "Division of Molecular Biology, Ru\u0111er Bo\u0161kovi\u0107 Institute"}, "7102280456": {"Name": "Weber I.", "AuthorID": "7102280456", "AffiliationID": "60000961", "AffiliationName": "Division of Molecular Biology, Ru\u0111er Bo\u0161kovi\u0107 Institute"}}}
