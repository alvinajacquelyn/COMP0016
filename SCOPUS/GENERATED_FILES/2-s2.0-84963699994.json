The operation principle of the antenna is analyzed and design guidelines are laid down. Then, an optimized loop-aperture combined antenna is designed and demonstrated to exhibit an endfire beam in parallel with its plane within 5.74-5.88 GHz for|S11| lower than -10 dB and axial ratio smaller than 3 dB. The proposed antenna can be used as a low-profile, cost-effective, hand-held reader antenna for radio frequency identification systems.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Circularly polarized antenna", "endfire", "loop-aperture combined antenna", "planar antenna"], "IndexKeywords": ["Antenna substrates", "Circularly polarized antennas", "Cost effective", "End-fire", "Magnetic dipole", "Planar antennas", "Radiation beams", "Reader antenna"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84963699994", "SubjectAreas": [["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"55484291200": {"Name": "Lu W.", "AuthorID": "55484291200", "AffiliationID": "60005244", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Millimeter Waves, SEU"}, "56915090200": {"Name": "Shi J.", "AuthorID": "56915090200", "AffiliationID": "60009400", "AffiliationName": "Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Wireless Communications, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications"}, "8882010600": {"Name": "Zhu H.", "AuthorID": "8882010600", "AffiliationID": "60009400", "AffiliationName": "Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Wireless Communications, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications"}, "7102473419": {"Name": "Tong K.", "AuthorID": "7102473419", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "EEE Department, University College London"}}}
