There is an absence of clear evidence asto how best to encourage evidence-informed decision making, and how to build capacity among decision makers in the use of research. This paper proposes a demand-focused approach for increasing the use of evidence in policy, presenting strategies supporting 'pull' activities and closer linkages and exchanges between producers and users. The paper shares for discussion a people-focused theory of change for building capacity to use research evidence amongst policy makers in southern Africa.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Capacity building", "Evidence-informed policy", "Knowledge transition", "Research use"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84950257169", "SubjectAreas": [["Social Sciences (miscellaneous)", "SOCI", "3301"]], "AuthorData": {"8604870700": {"Name": "Stewart R.", "AuthorID": "8604870700", "AffiliationID": "60000717", "AffiliationName": "University of Johannesburg"}}}
