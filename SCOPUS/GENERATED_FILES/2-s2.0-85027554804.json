Picture descriptions elicited from 50 Japanese EFL learners from varied proficiency levels were analyzed through a range of pronunciation, fluency, vocabulary, and grammar measures. Results indicated that the learners\u2019 aptitude test scores in phonemic coding, rote and associative memory, and language analytic ability were moderately associated with the phonological/morphological accuracy, fluency, and lexicogrammar complexity of production, which are linguistic aspects thought to be instrumental in the acquisition of advanced L2 oral ability. In contrast, aptitude\u2013proficiency links were not found with respect to relatively implicit and incidental learning aptitude (sound recognition) and foundational aspects of proficiency (appropriate use of frequent words).", "AuthorKeywords": ["aptitude", "fluency", "foreign language", "grammar", "pronunciation", "vocabulary"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85027554804", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["Language and Linguistics", "ARTS", "1203"], ["Linguistics and Language", "SOCI", "3310"]], "AuthorData": {"36515364100": {"Name": "Saito K.", "AuthorID": "36515364100", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Birkbeck, University of London"}}}
