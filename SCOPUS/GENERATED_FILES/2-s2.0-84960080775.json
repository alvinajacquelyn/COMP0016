Beyond the variables appearing in the inflationary action, these include dynamical initial conditions, the number of fields, and couplings to other sectors. These quantities are often ignored but cosmological observables can depend on the unknown parameters. We use Bayesian networks to account for a large set of inflationary parameters, deriving generative models for the primordial spectra that are conditioned on a hierarchical set of prior probabilities describing the initial conditions, reheating physics, and other free parameters. We use Nf-quadratic inflation as an illustrative example, finding that the number of e-folds N\u2217 between horizon exit for the pivot scale and the end of inflation is typically the most important parameter, even when the number of fields, their masses and initial conditions are unknown, along with possible conditional dependencies between these parameters.", "AuthorKeywords": ["cosmological parameters from CMBR", "inflation", "particle physics - cosmology connection", "physics of the early universe"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84960080775", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"]], "AuthorData": {"55802658800": {"Name": "Price L.C.", "AuthorID": "55802658800", "AffiliationID": "60005686", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of Auckland"}, "6701459596": {"Name": "Easther R.", "AuthorID": "6701459596", "AffiliationID": "60005686", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of Auckland"}, "23991274600": {"Name": "Peiris H.V.", "AuthorID": "23991274600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "36494599500": {"Name": "Frazer J.", "AuthorID": "36494599500", "AffiliationID": "60104285", "AffiliationName": "IKERBASQUE, Basque Foundation for Science"}}}
