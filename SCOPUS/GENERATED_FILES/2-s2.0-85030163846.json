This study evaluated the effectiveness of a parent-delivered early language enrichment programme. Methods: We conducted a randomised controlled trial (RCT) with 208 preschool children and their parents living in socially diverse areas in the United Kingdom. Families were allocated to an oral language programme (N = 103) or an active control programme targeting motor skills (N = 105). Parents delivered the programmes to their child at home in daily 20-min sessions over 30 weeks of teaching. Results: Children receiving the language programme made significantly larger gains in language (d =.21) and narrative skills (d =.36) than children receiving the motor skills programme at immediate posttest. Effects on language were maintained 6 months later (d =.34), and at this point, the language group also scored higher on tests of early literacy (d values=.35 and.42). There was no evidence that the movement programme improved motor skills. Conclusions: This study provides evidence for the effectiveness of a parent-delivered language enrichment programme. Further large-scale evaluations of the programme are needed to confirm and extend these findings.", "AuthorKeywords": ["early literacy", "education", "Language", "motor skills", "parents", "randomised controlled trial"], "IndexKeywords": ["Child, Preschool", "Early Intervention (Education)", "Female", "Humans", "Language", "Language Development", "Literacy", "Male", "Motor Skills", "Outcome Assessment (Health Care)", "Parents", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85030163846", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"35101595700": {"Name": "Burgoyne K.", "AuthorID": "35101595700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychology and Language Sciences, UCL"}, "57195932478": {"Name": "Gardner R.", "AuthorID": "57195932478", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychology and Language Sciences, UCL"}, "7006289482": {"Name": "Whiteley H.", "AuthorID": "7006289482", "AffiliationID": "60022506", "AffiliationName": "Department of Social and Psychological Sciences, Edge Hill University"}, "7006347552": {"Name": "Snowling M.J.", "AuthorID": "7006347552", "AffiliationID": "60002634", "AffiliationName": "Department of Experimental Psychology, University of Oxford"}, "7006105965": {"Name": "Hulme C.", "AuthorID": "7006105965", "AffiliationID": "60175816", "AffiliationName": "Department of Education, University of Oxford"}}}
