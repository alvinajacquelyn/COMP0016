Although the role of hotspot mutations is well defined, the impact of uncommon mutations is still unknown. In this study, we aimed to discuss the potential utility of detecting uncommon RAS and BRAF mutation profiles with next-generation sequencing. A total of 779 FFPE samples from patients with metastatic colorectal cancer with valid NGS results were screened and 22 uncommon mutational profiles of KRAS, NRAS and BRAF genes were selected. In silico prediction of mutation impact was then assessed by 2 predictive scores and a structural protein modelling. Three samples carry a single KRAS non-hotspot mutation, one a single NRAS non-hotspot mutation, four a single BRAF non-hotspot mutation and fourteen carry several mutations. This in silico study shows that some non-hotspot RAS mutations seem to behave like hotspot mutations and warrant further examination to assess whether they should confer a resistance to anti-EGFR mAbs therapy for patients bearing these non-hotspot RAS mutations. For BRAF gene, non-V600E mutations may characterise a novel subtype of mCRC with better prognosis, potentially implying a modification of therapeutic strategy.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological", "Colorectal Neoplasms", "Computer Simulation", "Diagnostic Tests, Routine", "Drug Resistance, Neoplasm", "ErbB Receptors", "Genotype", "Genotyping Techniques", "GTP Phosphohydrolases", "High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing", "Humans", "Membrane Proteins", "Mutation", "Neoplasm Metastasis", "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide", "Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf", "Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras)", "Retrospective Studies"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85065569759", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"57189094122": {"Name": "Franczak C.", "AuthorID": "57189094122", "AffiliationID": "113393912", "AffiliationName": "Institut de Canc\u00e9rologie de Lorraine, Service de Biopathologie"}, "57196393936": {"Name": "Husson M.", "AuthorID": "57196393936", "AffiliationID": "113393912", "AffiliationName": "Institut de Canc\u00e9rologie de Lorraine, Service de Biopathologie"}, "26435457500": {"Name": "Rouyer M.", "AuthorID": "26435457500", "AffiliationID": "113393912", "AffiliationName": "Institut de Canc\u00e9rologie de Lorraine, Service de Biopathologie"}, "57207035544": {"Name": "Demange J.", "AuthorID": "57207035544", "AffiliationID": "113393912", "AffiliationName": "Institut de Canc\u00e9rologie de Lorraine, Service de Biopathologie"}, "55748763500": {"Name": "Kandathil S.M.", "AuthorID": "55748763500", "AffiliationID": "60107285", "AffiliationName": "The Francis Crick Institute"}, "7005678371": {"Name": "Leroux A.", "AuthorID": "7005678371", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "55806022400": {"Name": "Merlin J.L.", "AuthorID": "55806022400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "55567250800": {"Name": "Harl\u00e9 A.", "AuthorID": "55567250800", "AffiliationID": "60104289, 60073336", "AffiliationName": "Universit\u00e9 de Lorraine, CNRS UMR 7039 CRAN, Institut de Canc\u00e9rologie de Lorraine, Service de Biopathologie, 6 avenue de Bourgogne CS 30519"}, "57203156457": {"Name": "Gilson P.", "AuthorID": "57203156457", "AffiliationID": "60104289, 60073336", "AffiliationName": "Universit\u00e9 de Lorraine, CNRS UMR 7039 CRAN, Institut de Canc\u00e9rologie de Lorraine, Service de Biopathologie, 6 avenue de Bourgogne CS 30519"}}}
