The Authors.Year-round variability in the Ross Gyre (RG), Antarctica, during 2011\u20132015, is derived using radar altimetry. The RG is characterized by a bounded recirculating component and a westward throughflow to the south. Two modes of variability of the sea surface height and ocean surface stress curl are revealed. The first represents a large-scale sea surface height change forced by the Antarctic Oscillation. The second represents semiannual variability in gyre area and strength, driven by fluctuations in sea level pressure associated with the Amundsen Sea Low. Variability in the throughflow is also linked to the Amundsen Sea Low. An adequate description of the oceanic circulation is achieved only when sea ice drag is accounted for in the ocean surface stress. The drivers of RG variability elucidated here have significant implications for our understanding of the oceanic forcing of Antarctic Ice Sheet melting and for the downstream propagation of its ocean freshening footprint.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Amundsen Sea Low", "CryoSat-2", "Ross Sea", "Sea ice", "Semiannual Oscillation", "Southern Ocean circulation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Amundsen Sea", "Cryosat", "Ross Sea", "Semiannual oscillations", "Southern ocean"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85049869879", "SubjectAreas": [["Geophysics", "EART", "1908"], ["Earth and Planetary Sciences (all)", "EART", "1900"]], "AuthorData": {"56226852600": {"Name": "Dotto T.", "AuthorID": "56226852600", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "Ocean and Earth Science, University of Southampton"}, "6602255562": {"Name": "Naveira Garabato A.", "AuthorID": "6602255562", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "Ocean and Earth Science, University of Southampton"}, "57202930041": {"Name": "Hooley J.", "AuthorID": "57202930041", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "Ocean and Earth Science, University of Southampton"}, "35075986300": {"Name": "Frajka-Williams E.", "AuthorID": "35075986300", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "Ocean and Earth Science, University of Southampton"}, "7005591362": {"Name": "Bacon S.", "AuthorID": "7005591362", "AffiliationID": "60010934", "AffiliationName": "National Oceanography Centre"}, "24330320400": {"Name": "Tsamados M.", "AuthorID": "24330320400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Polar Observation and Modelling, University College London"}, "16403028400": {"Name": "Ridout A.", "AuthorID": "16403028400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Polar Observation and Modelling, University College London"}, "7202793167": {"Name": "Holland P.", "AuthorID": "7202793167", "AffiliationID": "60025990", "AffiliationName": "British Antarctic Survey"}, "7103271119": {"Name": "Meredith M.", "AuthorID": "7103271119", "AffiliationID": "60025990", "AffiliationName": "British Antarctic Survey"}}}
