Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.There were 30.7 million registered cars in Great Britain in 2011, outnumbering the total number of households recorded by the census. Despite this, the Driving and Vehicle Licensing Agency\u2019s (DVLA) data-base of car model registrations remains underexplored as an indicator of socio-economic characteristics. In the past, car ownership itself has been frequently considered as a census proxy variable for affluence. However, this is an increasingly dated interpretation as ownership has become more widespread across society and the value of cars varies considerably. Understanding the geography of different car types, however, is likely to be more informative of local population characteristics as the choice of model is dependent on several factors, notably including the cost and the purpose of the vehicle. In partnership with the Department for Transport (DfT), a car segmentation was produced that grouped every car model registered in England and Wales in 2011 into 10 distinctive categories based on the vehicle\u2019s key characteristics. Data representing the total number of registered cars for each car segment and three age groups were made available at a small area geography (known as lower layer super output areas - LSOAs) to be analysed for this study. It revealed that each car segment is uniquely distributed across London, and the rest of England and Wales. The patterns were then compared with key 2011 Census variables on socio-economics to understand the extent to which spatial patterns of broad car characteristics correspond with variances in indicators of social make-up.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Administrative data", "Car ownership", "Cars", "Population", "Segmentation", "Socio-economics"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84971441134", "SubjectAreas": [["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"], ["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"], ["Economics and Econometrics", "ECON", "2002"]], "AuthorData": {"56539902700": {"Name": "Lansley G.", "AuthorID": "56539902700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography, University College London"}}}
