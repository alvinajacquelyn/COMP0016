However, the relationship between IBD and recurrent PSC (rPSC) is less well understood. We assessed the prevalence of rPSC and analysed the factors associated with rPSC post-liver transplantation and its influence on graft and patient survival. Methods This is a UK multicentre observational cohort study across six of the seven national liver transplant units. All patients undergoing a first liver transplant for PSC between January 1 1990 and December 31 2010 were included. Prospectively collected liver transplant data was obtained from NHSBT and colitis data was retrospectively collected from individual units. Results There were 679 (8.8%) first transplants for PSC. 347 patients (61.4%) had IBD, of which 306 (88.2%) had ulcerative colitis (UC). 81 (14.3%) patients developed rPSC and 37 (48.7%) of them developed graft failure from rPSC. Presence of UC post-liver transplant (HR = 2.40, 95% CI 1.44-4.02) and younger age (HR = 0.78, 95% CI 0.66-0.93) were the only factors significantly associated with rPSC. rPSC was associated with over a 4-fold increase in the risk of death (HR = 4.71, 95% CI 3.39, 6.56) with 1, 5, and 10-year graft survival rates of 98%, 84%, and 56% respectively compared to 95%, 88%, and 72% in patients who did not develop rPSC. Conclusion The presence of UC post-liver transplant is associated with a significantly increased risk of rPSC. Furthermore, the presence of rPSC increases the rate of graft failure and death, with higher re-transplantation rates.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Colectomy", "Liver transplantation", "Patients and graft survival", "Recurrent PSC", "Ulcerative colitis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Cholangitis, Sclerosing", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Graft Survival", "Humans", "Liver Transplantation", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Postoperative Complications", "Recurrence", "Retrospective Studies", "Risk Assessment", "Risk Factors", "Survival Rate", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84945477969", "SubjectAreas": [["Hepatology", "MEDI", "2721"]], "AuthorData": {"36155638200": {"Name": "Ravikumar R.", "AuthorID": "36155638200", "AffiliationID": "60032819, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Sheila Sherlock Liver Unit, UCL Institute for Liver and Digestive Health, Royal Free London Hospital"}, "16023392700": {"Name": "Tsochatzis E.", "AuthorID": "16023392700", "AffiliationID": "60032819, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Sheila Sherlock Liver Unit, UCL Institute for Liver and Digestive Health, Royal Free London Hospital"}, "13405244200": {"Name": "Monaco A.", "AuthorID": "13405244200", "AffiliationID": "60032819, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Sheila Sherlock Liver Unit, UCL Institute for Liver and Digestive Health, Royal Free London Hospital"}, "25629557900": {"Name": "Fusai G.", "AuthorID": "25629557900", "AffiliationID": "60032819, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Sheila Sherlock Liver Unit, UCL Institute for Liver and Digestive Health, Royal Free London Hospital"}, "6603890260": {"Name": "Fernando B.", "AuthorID": "6603890260", "AffiliationID": "60032819, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Sheila Sherlock Liver Unit, UCL Institute for Liver and Digestive Health, Royal Free London Hospital"}, "56450243500": {"Name": "Burroughs A.", "AuthorID": "56450243500", "AffiliationID": "60032819, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Sheila Sherlock Liver Unit, UCL Institute for Liver and Digestive Health, Royal Free London Hospital"}, "55872182100": {"Name": "Jose S.", "AuthorID": "55872182100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Infection and Population Health, University College London"}, "7102381712": {"Name": "Allison M.", "AuthorID": "7102381712", "AffiliationID": "60016390", "AffiliationName": "Cambridge Transplant Unit, Cambridge University Hospitals"}, "56603767000": {"Name": "Owen N.", "AuthorID": "56603767000", "AffiliationID": "60016390", "AffiliationName": "Cambridge Transplant Unit, Cambridge University Hospitals"}, "56880232300": {"Name": "Athale A.", "AuthorID": "56880232300", "AffiliationID": "60021923", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Liver Studies, Kings College Hospital"}, "16317005500": {"Name": "Madanur M.", "AuthorID": "16317005500", "AffiliationID": "60021923", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Liver Studies, Kings College Hospital"}, "7103192357": {"Name": "Srinivasan P.", "AuthorID": "7103192357", "AffiliationID": "60021923", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Liver Studies, Kings College Hospital"}, "56798582200": {"Name": "Creamer F.", "AuthorID": "56798582200", "AffiliationID": "60002975", "AffiliationName": "Department of HPB and Liver Transplant Surgery, Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh"}, "7005923336": {"Name": "Gunson B.", "AuthorID": "7005923336", "AffiliationID": "60026493", "AffiliationName": "Liver Unit, University Hospital Birmingham"}, "56797611900": {"Name": "Iyer V.", "AuthorID": "56797611900", "AffiliationID": "60026493", "AffiliationName": "Liver Unit, University Hospital Birmingham"}, "7006492396": {"Name": "Mirza D.", "AuthorID": "7006492396", "AffiliationID": "60026493", "AffiliationName": "Liver Unit, University Hospital Birmingham"}, "26428882000": {"Name": "Roberts K.", "AuthorID": "26428882000", "AffiliationID": "60026493", "AffiliationName": "Liver Unit, University Hospital Birmingham"}, "7003617874": {"Name": "Manas D.", "AuthorID": "7003617874", "AffiliationID": "60018514", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Transplantation, Freeman Hospital"}, "7103374556": {"Name": "Sen G.", "AuthorID": "7103374556", "AffiliationID": "60018514", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Transplantation, Freeman Hospital"}, "7006251519": {"Name": "Wigmore S.", "AuthorID": "7006251519", "AffiliationID": "60018514", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Transplantation, Freeman Hospital"}}}
