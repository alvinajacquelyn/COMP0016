Serum albumin may be used to stratify human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected persons with high CD4 count according to their risk of serious non-AIDS endpoints. Methods. Cox proportional hazards models were used to analyze the risk of serious non-AIDS events in the Strategic Timing of Antiretroviral Treatment (START) study (NCT00867048) with serum albumin as a fixed and time-updated predictor. Models with exclusion of events during initial follow-up years were built to assess the ability of serum albumin to predict beyond shorter periods of time. Secondarily, we considered hospitalizations and AIDS events. Results. Among 4576 participants, 71 developed a serious non-AIDS event, 788 were hospitalized, and 63 experienced an AIDS event. After adjusting for a range of variables associated with hypoalbuminemia, higher baseline serum albumin (per 1 g/dL) was associated with a decreased risk of serious non-AIDS events (hazard ratio, 0.37 [95% confidence interval, .20-.71]; P = .002). Similar results were obtained in a time-updated model, after controlling for interleukin 6, and after excluding initial follow-up years. Serum albumin was independently associated with hospitalization but not with risk of AIDS. Conclusions. A low serum albumin level is a predictor for short-A nd long-term serious non-AIDS events, and may be a useful marker of risk of noncommunicable diseases, particularly in resource-limited settings.", "AuthorKeywords": ["albumin", "biomarker", "HIV", "non-AIDS comorbidity", "non-communicable disease"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Biomarkers", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "HIV Infections", "Hospitalization", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Noncommunicable Diseases", "Prognosis", "Risk Assessment", "Serum Albumin, Human"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85041182880", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"55343755800": {"Name": "Ronit A.", "AuthorID": "55343755800", "AffiliationID": "60030840, 60006564", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infectious Diseases Rigshospitalet, University of Copenhagen"}, "55356235300": {"Name": "Sharma S.", "AuthorID": "55356235300", "AffiliationID": "60013223, 60029445", "AffiliationName": "Division of Biostatistics, School of Public Health, University of Minnesota"}, "15070550000": {"Name": "Baker J.V.", "AuthorID": "15070550000", "AffiliationID": "60019146", "AffiliationName": "Infectious Diseases and Department of Medicine, Hennepin County Medical Center"}, "36614528400": {"Name": "Mngqibisa R.", "AuthorID": "36614528400", "AffiliationID": "60004001", "AffiliationName": "Enhancing Care Foundation, Durban University of Technology"}, "55614210800": {"Name": "Delory T.", "AuthorID": "55614210800", "AffiliationID": "60002900, 60021567", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infectious Diseases, Hospital Saint Louis, Assistance Publique-H\u00f4pitaux de Paris"}, "6602208012": {"Name": "Caldeira L.", "AuthorID": "6602208012", "AffiliationID": "60021007, 60106051", "AffiliationName": "Cl\u00ednica Universit\u00e1ria de Doenc\u0105s Infecciosas, Faculty of Medicine, Santa Maria University Hospital, University of Lisbon"}, "56206346500": {"Name": "Ndembi N.", "AuthorID": "56206346500", "AffiliationID": "119345465", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Human Virology"}, "35307337700": {"Name": "Lundgren J.D.", "AuthorID": "35307337700", "AffiliationID": "60030840", "AffiliationName": "CHIP, Department of Infectious Diseases, University of Copenhagen"}, "35372648800": {"Name": "Phillips A.N.", "AuthorID": "35372648800", "AffiliationID": "60029950", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Infection and Population Health, University College London Medical School"}}}
