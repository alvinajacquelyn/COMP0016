Method: Eighty-five (74% of those eligible) children (5-15 years) in a population-based sample with active epilepsy underwent psychological assessment. The ADHD Rating Scale\u2013IV (ADHD-RS-IV) scale was completed by parents (n = 69) and teachers (n = 67) of participating children with an IQ > 34. ADHD was diagnosed with respect to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed., text rev.). Results: Parents reported significantly more symptoms of ADHD than teachers (p <.001). Symptoms of inattention were more commonly reported than symptoms of hyperactivity-impulsivity (p <.001). Neurobehavioral comorbidity was similar in those with ADHD and non-ADHD with the exception of oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) and developmental coordination disorder (DCD), which were more common in those with both epilepsy and ADHD. Conclusion: Symptoms of ADHD are very common in childhood epilepsy but prevalence is influenced by informant.", "AuthorKeywords": ["attention", "epilepsy", "parent", "teacher"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Attention Deficit and Disruptive Behavior Disorders", "Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Comorbidity", "Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders", "England", "Epilepsy", "Faculty", "Female", "Humans", "Impulsive Behavior", "Male", "Parents", "Prevalence", "Problem Behavior", "Prospective Studies", "School Teachers"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85027550195", "SubjectAreas": [["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"], ["Clinical Psychology", "PSYC", "3203"]], "AuthorData": {"26634364600": {"Name": "Reilly C.", "AuthorID": "26634364600", "AffiliationID": "60016437", "AffiliationName": "University of Gothenburg"}, "7402223872": {"Name": "Das K.B.", "AuthorID": "7402223872", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Trust"}, "6507002035": {"Name": "Burch V.", "AuthorID": "6507002035", "AffiliationID": "60112913", "AffiliationName": "Young Epilepsy"}, "24479788300": {"Name": "Neville B.G.R.", "AuthorID": "24479788300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "7101634220": {"Name": "Gillberg C.", "AuthorID": "7101634220", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "23968672700": {"Name": "Atkinson P.", "AuthorID": "23968672700", "AffiliationID": "60011982", "AffiliationName": "Crawley Hospital"}, "6603729064": {"Name": "Aylett S.E.", "AuthorID": "6603729064", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Trust"}, "7404342499": {"Name": "Scott R.C.", "AuthorID": "7404342499", "AffiliationID": "60009500", "AffiliationName": "University of Vermont"}, "16030504100": {"Name": "Chin R.F.M.", "AuthorID": "16030504100", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "The University of Edinburgh"}}}
