This systematic literature review draws on the evidence of 193 academic papers to map out the existing academic knowledge about professional doctorates and highlight the gaps that this special issue aims to address. We use a simple vote-counting approach to categorizing the identified papers, considering: the type of professional doctorate studied, the country in focus, the main themes explored, the research methods used and the year of publication. This review highlights the need for academic work in this area to move beyond individual case studies of practice on programmes towards developing principles of practice for professional doctorates as a whole. This special issue hopes to start that academic conversation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Professional doctorates", "Systematic literature review"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85045914768", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"]], "AuthorData": {"7006092102": {"Name": "Hawkes D.", "AuthorID": "7006092102", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Education"}, "57191418179": {"Name": "Yerrabati S.", "AuthorID": "57191418179", "AffiliationID": "60111677", "AffiliationName": "Higher Education Academy"}}}
