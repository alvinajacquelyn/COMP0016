All rights reserved.Background: Adalimumab, a fully human anti-tumor necrosis factor \u00e1 monoclonal antibody, is effective in the treatment of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). We tested the efficacy of adalimumab in the treatment of JIA-associated uveitis. Methods: In this multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, we assessed the efficacy and safety of adalimumab in children and adolescents 2 years of age or older who had active JIA-associated uveitis. Patients who were taking a stable dose of methotrexate were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive either adalimumab (at a dose of 20 mg or 40 mg, according to body weight) or placebo, administered subcutaneously every 2 weeks. Patients continued the trial regimen until treatment failure or until 18 months had elapsed. They were followed for up to 2 years after randomization. The primary end point was the time to treatment failure, defined according to a multicomponent intraocular inflammation score that was based on the Standardization of Uveitis Nomenclature criteria. Results: The prespecified stopping criteria were met after the enrollment of 90 of 114 patients. We observed 16 treatment failures in 60 patients (27%) in the adalimumab group versus 18 treatment failures in 30 patients (60%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.25; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.12 to 0.49; P<0.0001 [the prespecified stopping boundary]). Adverse events were reported more frequently in patients receiving adalimumab than in those receiving placebo (10.07 events per patient-year [95% CI, 9.26 to 10.89] vs. 6.51 events per patient-year [95% CI, 5.26 to 7.77]), as were serious adverse events (0.29 events per patient-year [95% CI, 0.15 to 0.43] vs. 0.19 events per patient-year [95% CI, 0.00 to 0.40]). Conclusions: Adalimumab therapy controlled inflammation and was associated with a lower rate of treatment failure than placebo among children and adolescents with active JIA-associated uveitis who were taking a stable dose of methotrexate. Patients who received adalimumab had a much higher incidence of adverse events and serious adverse events than those who received placebo.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adalimumab", "Adolescent", "Anti-Inflammatory Agents", "Antirheumatic Agents", "Arthritis, Juvenile", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Double-Blind Method", "Drug Therapy, Combination", "Female", "Humans", "Intention to Treat Analysis", "Male", "Methotrexate", "Time Factors", "Uveitis"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85019009078", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"7003605847": {"Name": "Ramanan A.V.", "AuthorID": "7003605847", "AffiliationID": "60015756", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Rheumatology, Bristol Royal Hospital for Children"}, "7103296976": {"Name": "Dick A.D.", "AuthorID": "7103296976", "AffiliationID": "60016691, 60022148, 60172638, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health Research (NIHR), Biomedical Research Centre, Moorfields Eye Hospital, University College London, Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "55998283500": {"Name": "Benton D.", "AuthorID": "55998283500", "AffiliationID": "60170515", "AffiliationName": "University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust"}, "55416171000": {"Name": "Woo P.", "AuthorID": "55416171000", "AffiliationID": "60016691, 60022148, 60172638, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health Research (NIHR), Biomedical Research Centre, Moorfields Eye Hospital, University College London, Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "8210058200": {"Name": "Compeyrot-Lacassagne S.", "AuthorID": "8210058200", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "57207652117": {"Name": "Edelsten C.", "AuthorID": "57207652117", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "26660306600": {"Name": "Jones A.P.", "AuthorID": "26660306600", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Translational Medicine, University of Liverpool"}, "55208580100": {"Name": "McKay A.", "AuthorID": "55208580100", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Translational Medicine, University of Liverpool"}, "57212501855": {"Name": "Williamson P.R.", "AuthorID": "57212501855", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Translational Medicine, University of Liverpool"}, "55999128200": {"Name": "Hardwick B.", "AuthorID": "55999128200", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Translational Medicine, University of Liverpool"}, "8733037100": {"Name": "Hickey H.", "AuthorID": "8733037100", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Translational Medicine, University of Liverpool"}, "6603662700": {"Name": "Beresford M.W.", "AuthorID": "6603662700", "AffiliationID": "60024857", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Rheumatology, Alder Hey Children's NHS Foundation Trust"}, "35570067600": {"Name": "Hughes D.", "AuthorID": "35570067600", "AffiliationID": "60025779", "AffiliationName": "Bangor University"}, "null": {"Name": null, "AuthorID": null, "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
