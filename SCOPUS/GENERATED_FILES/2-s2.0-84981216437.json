To protect patients and doctors, the General Medical Council offers guidance on the use of chaperones for intimate examinations. We assessed the opinions and use of chaperones amongst members of the British Association of Urological Surgeons (BAUS). METHODS: An online questionnaire comprising 12 questions on the use of chaperones in clinical practice was sent to all full, trainee and speciality doctor members of BAUS. RESULTS: The questionnaire had a response rate of 26% (n=331). The majority of respondents were consultant urologists, comprising 78.8% (n=261), with a wide range of years of experience. Of the respondents, 38.9% were not aware of the GMC guidance on chaperones. While 72.5% always used a chaperone., 22.9% never use a chaperone when the patient was of the same sex. Chaperones were most commonly used for intimate examinations (64.6%), and for examinations involving members of the opposite sex (77.3%). A majority of respondents felt that chaperones protect both the patient (77.3%), and the doctor (96.6%). However, 42.5% did not feel that using a chaperone assists the doctor's examination, and some (17.2%) participants\\ felt that chaperones were unnecessary. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows considerable variability amongst urologists in their use of chaperones. A significant proportion of respondents were not aware of the GMC guidelines and did not regularly use a chaperone during an intimate examination. In addition, practice appears to be gender biased. Further study and education is suggested.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Attitude of health personnel", "Informed consent", "Patient chaperone", "Physical examination", "Surgeons"], "IndexKeywords": ["Attitude of Health Personnel", "Female", "Great Britain", "Humans", "Informed Consent", "Male", "Medical Chaperones", "Physical Examination", "Practice Patterns, Physicians'", "Surgeons", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "Urologic Surgical Procedures"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84981216437", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"]], "AuthorData": {"36628980200": {"Name": "Modgil V.", "AuthorID": "36628980200", "AffiliationID": "60026493", "AffiliationName": "Heart of England NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57190565313": {"Name": "Barratt R.", "AuthorID": "57190565313", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "University College London Hospitals"}, "24339107700": {"Name": "Muneer A.", "AuthorID": "24339107700", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "University College London Hospitals"}, "6603125588": {"Name": "Summerton D.J.", "AuthorID": "6603125588", "AffiliationID": "60015908", "AffiliationName": "Leicester General Hospital"}}}
