The incorporation of 1.0 wt% of graphene into epoxy was found to significantly improve the matrix fracture energy by \u223c150% and reduce the thermal expansion coefficient by \u223c30%. When these partially cured G/E composites were used as interleaves in carbon fiber/epoxy (CF/E) composites and co-cured, a remarkable 140% increase in mode I interlaminar fracture energy was achieved. Detailed toughening mechanisms of the graphene sheets in both G/E and CF/E composites were studied. Moreover, the damage sensing capacity of the graphene interleaved CF/E composites with a simple electrical response method was demonstrated, where the electrical resistance change increased almost linearly with crack increment.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Delamination", "Fracture toughness", "Functional composites", "Polymer-matrix composites"], "IndexKeywords": ["Composite laminate", "Electrical resistance change", "Electrical response", "Functional composites", "Functionalized graphene", "Interlaminar fracture", "Thermal expansion coefficients", "Toughening mechanisms"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85009135326", "SubjectAreas": [["Ceramics and Composites", "MATE", "2503"], ["Engineering (all)", "ENGI", "2200"]], "AuthorData": {"13007866800": {"Name": "Du X.", "AuthorID": "13007866800", "AffiliationID": "60025709", "AffiliationName": "Center for Advanced Materials Technology (CAMT), School of Aerospace Mechanical & Mechatronic Engineering J07, The University of Sydney"}, "56939433000": {"Name": "Zhou H.", "AuthorID": "56939433000", "AffiliationID": "60025761", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Materials Processing and Die & Mould Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"}, "55600876400": {"Name": "Sun W.", "AuthorID": "55600876400", "AffiliationID": "60025709", "AffiliationName": "Center for Advanced Materials Technology (CAMT), School of Aerospace Mechanical & Mechatronic Engineering J07, The University of Sydney"}, "56308874100": {"Name": "Liu H.", "AuthorID": "56308874100", "AffiliationID": "60025709", "AffiliationName": "Center for Advanced Materials Technology (CAMT), School of Aerospace Mechanical & Mechatronic Engineering J07, The University of Sydney"}, "7404741969": {"Name": "Zhou H.", "AuthorID": "7404741969", "AffiliationID": "60025761", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Materials Processing and Die & Mould Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"}, "15128237800": {"Name": "Mai Y.", "AuthorID": "15128237800", "AffiliationID": "60025709", "AffiliationName": "Center for Advanced Materials Technology (CAMT), School of Aerospace Mechanical & Mechatronic Engineering J07, The University of Sydney"}, "57192922266": {"Name": "Zhou G.", "AuthorID": "57192922266", "AffiliationID": "60010365", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials Engineering, University of British Columbia"}}}
