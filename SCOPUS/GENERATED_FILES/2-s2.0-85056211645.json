Despite these interventions, mean overall survival remains less than 15 months, during which extensive tumor infiltration throughout the brain occurs. The resulting metastasized cells in the brain are characterized by chemotherapy resistance and extensive intratumoral heterogeneity. An orthogonal approach attacking both intracellular resistance mechanisms as well as intercellular heterogeneity is necessary to halt tumor progression. For this reason, we established the WINDOW Consortium (Window for Improvement for Newly Diagnosed patients by Overcoming disease Worsening), in which we are establishing a strategy for rational selection and development of effective therapies against glioblastoma. Here, we overview the many challenges posed in treating glioblastoma, including selection of drug combinations that prevent therapy resistance, the need for drugs that have improved blood brain barrier penetration and strategies to counter heterogeneous cell populations within patients. Together, this forms the backbone of our strategy to attack glioblastoma.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Blood brain barrier", "Combination therapy", "Glioblastoma", "Small molecule drugs", "Therapy resistance", "Toxicity"], "IndexKeywords": ["Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols", "Blood-Brain Barrier", "Brain Neoplasms", "Drug Delivery Systems", "Drug Resistance, Neoplasm", "Glioblastoma", "Humans", "Small Molecule Libraries"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85056211645", "SubjectAreas": [["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"], ["Cancer Research", "BIOC", "1306"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"56630899900": {"Name": "Abdul K.U.", "AuthorID": "56630899900", "AffiliationID": "60001157", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurosurgery, Brain Tumor Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam University Medical Center, Cancer Center Amsterdam"}, "57204570376": {"Name": "Houweling M.", "AuthorID": "57204570376", "AffiliationID": "60001157", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurosurgery, Brain Tumor Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam University Medical Center, Cancer Center Amsterdam"}, "57200540501": {"Name": "Cornelissen F.M.G.", "AuthorID": "57200540501", "AffiliationID": "60001157", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurosurgery, Brain Tumor Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam University Medical Center, Cancer Center Amsterdam"}, "57220321152": {"Name": "K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fckosmanoglu A.", "AuthorID": "57220321152", "AffiliationID": "60001157", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurosurgery, Brain Tumor Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam University Medical Center, Cancer Center Amsterdam"}, "24726101100": {"Name": "Wurdinger T.", "AuthorID": "24726101100", "AffiliationID": "60001157", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurosurgery, Brain Tumor Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam University Medical Center, Cancer Center Amsterdam"}, "7003398637": {"Name": "Westerman B.A.", "AuthorID": "7003398637", "AffiliationID": "60001157", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurosurgery, Brain Tumor Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam University Medical Center, Cancer Center Amsterdam"}, "6603427180": {"Name": "Svensson F.", "AuthorID": "6603427180", "AffiliationID": "107066407", "AffiliationName": "IOTA Pharmaceuticals Ltd, St Johns Innovation Centre"}, "7402156085": {"Name": "Bailey D.", "AuthorID": "7402156085", "AffiliationID": "107066407", "AffiliationName": "IOTA Pharmaceuticals Ltd, St Johns Innovation Centre"}, "46961223500": {"Name": "Narayan R.S.", "AuthorID": "46961223500", "AffiliationID": "60001157", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiation Oncology, Amsterdam University Medical Center, Cancer Center Amsterdam"}, "30267890000": {"Name": "Metzakopian E.", "AuthorID": "30267890000", "AffiliationID": "119945428", "AffiliationName": "UK Dementia Research Institute"}, "57189639274": {"Name": "Watts C.", "AuthorID": "57189639274", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cancer and Genomic Sciences, University of Birmingham"}}}
