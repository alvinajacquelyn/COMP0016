We retrospectively studied 30 children with a suspected diagnosis of CIDP. The diagnosis of CIDP was compared against the childhood CIDP revised diagnostic criteria 2000. Of the 30 children, five did not meet the criteria and four others met the criteria but subsequently had alternative diagnosis, leaving a total of 21 children (12 male) with CIDP as the final diagnosis. Thirteen children presented with chronic symptom-onset (>8 weeks). The majority presented with gait difficulties or pain in legs (n = 16). 12 children (57%) met the neurophysiological criteria and 18/19 (94%) met the cerebrospinal fluid criteria. Nerve biopsy was suggestive in 3/9 (33%), with magnetic resonance imaging supportive in 9/20 (45%). Twenty-one children received immuno-modulatory treatment at first presentation, of which majority (n = 19, 90%) received IVIG (immunoglobulin) monotherapy with 13 (68%) showing a good response. 8 children received second line treatment with either IVIG or steroids or plasmapharesis (PE) and 4 needed other immune-modulatory agents. During a median follow-up of 3.6 years, 9 (43%) had a monophasic course and 12 (57%) had a relapsing\u2013remitting course. At last paediatric follow up 7 (33%) were off all treatment, 9 (43%) left with no or minimal residual disability and 6 (28%) children were walking with assistance (n = 3) or were non-ambulant (n = 3). Our review highlights challenges in the diagnosis and management of paediatric CIDP. It also confirms that certain metabolic disorders may mimic CIDP.", "AuthorKeywords": ["CIDP", "Immuno-modulatory therapy", "Inflammatory neuropathy"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Disease Progression", "Female", "Gait", "Humans", "Immunoglobulins, Intravenous", "Immunologic Factors", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Neural Conduction", "Plasmapheresis", "Polyradiculoneuropathy, Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating", "Retrospective Studies", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85050696619", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Genetics (clinical)", "MEDI", "2716"]], "AuthorData": {"55213231600": {"Name": "Silwal A.", "AuthorID": "55213231600", "AffiliationID": "60018207, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Neuromuscular Diseases & Neuroscience Unit, Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "7102280708": {"Name": "Pitt M.", "AuthorID": "7102280708", "AffiliationID": "60018207, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Neuromuscular Diseases & Neuroscience Unit, Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "26535084400": {"Name": "Phadke R.", "AuthorID": "26535084400", "AffiliationID": "60018207, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Neuromuscular Diseases & Neuroscience Unit, Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "6603598778": {"Name": "DeVile C.", "AuthorID": "6603598778", "AffiliationID": "60018207, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Neuromuscular Diseases & Neuroscience Unit, Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "7004508063": {"Name": "Manzur A.Y.", "AuthorID": "7004508063", "AffiliationID": "60018207, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Neuromuscular Diseases & Neuroscience Unit, Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "7102038246": {"Name": "Muntoni F.", "AuthorID": "7102038246", "AffiliationID": "60018207, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Neuromuscular Diseases & Neuroscience Unit, Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "16507468800": {"Name": "Munot P.", "AuthorID": "16507468800", "AffiliationID": "60018207, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Neuromuscular Diseases & Neuroscience Unit, Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "24390956300": {"Name": "Mankad K.", "AuthorID": "24390956300", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Neuroradiology Department, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}, "36503791000": {"Name": "Davison J.E.", "AuthorID": "36503791000", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Metabolic Medicine, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57218107544": {"Name": "Rossor A.", "AuthorID": "57218107544", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60019953, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Neuromuscular Diseases, UCL Institute of Neurology and National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "57203175311": {"Name": "Reilly M.M.", "AuthorID": "57203175311", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60019953, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Neuromuscular Diseases, UCL Institute of Neurology and National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}}}
