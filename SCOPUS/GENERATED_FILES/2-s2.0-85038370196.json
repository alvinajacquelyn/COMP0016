Defining critical research gaps (RG), their prioritisation and resolution, could improve patient outcomes. Design RG analysis was conducted by a multidisciplinary panel of patients, clinicians and researchers (n=71). Eight working groups (WG) were constituted: discovery science; risk; prevention; early diagnosis and screening; pathology; curative treatment; stage IV disease; and living with and beyond CRC. A series of discussions led to development of draft papers by each WG, which were evaluated by a 20-strong patient panel. A final list of RGs and research recommendations (RR) was endorsed by all participants. Results Fifteen critical RGs are summarised below: RG1: Lack of realistic models that recapitulate tumour/tumour micro/macroenvironment; RG2: Insufficient evidence on precise contributions of genetic/environmental/lifestyle factors to CRC risk; RG3: Pressing need for prevention trials; RG4: Lack of integration of different prevention approaches; RG5: Lack of optimal strategies for CRC screening; RG6: Lack of effective triage systems for invasive investigations; RG7: Imprecise pathological assessment of CRC; RG8: Lack of qualified personnel in genomics, data sciences and digital pathology; RG9: Inadequate assessment/communication of risk, benefit and uncertainty of treatment choices; RG10: Need for novel technologies/interventions to improve curative outcomes; RG11: Lack of approaches that recognise molecular interplay between metastasising tumours and their microenvironment; RG12: Lack of reliable biomarkers to guide stage IV treatment; RG13: Need to increase understanding of health related quality of life (HRQOL) and promote residual symptom resolution; RG14: Lack of coordination of CRC research/funding; RG15: Lack of effective communication between relevant stakeholders. Conclusion Prioritising research activity and funding could have a significant impact on reducing CRC disease burden over the next 5 years.", "AuthorKeywords": ["colorectal cancer"], "IndexKeywords": ["Biomedical Research", "Colorectal Neoplasms", "Early Detection of Cancer", "Evidence-Based Medicine", "Gene-Environment Interaction", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Humans", "Risk Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85038370196", "SubjectAreas": [["Gastroenterology", "MEDI", "2715"]], "AuthorData": {"16750578600": {"Name": "Lawler M.", "AuthorID": "16750578600", "AffiliationID": "60029738", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cancer Research and Cell Biology, Queen's University Belfast"}, "55740129200": {"Name": "Wilson R.H.", "AuthorID": "55740129200", "AffiliationID": "60029738", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cancer Research and Cell Biology, Queen's University Belfast"}, "36518153400": {"Name": "Alsina D.", "AuthorID": "36518153400", "AffiliationID": "101133552", "AffiliationName": "Bowel Cancer UK"}, "57199704561": {"Name": "Wilde L.M.", "AuthorID": "57199704561", "AffiliationID": "119922827", "AffiliationName": "Atticus Consultants Ltd"}, "25622953500": {"Name": "Adams R.A.", "AuthorID": "25622953500", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "School of Medicine, Cardiff University"}, "57182480800": {"Name": "Anderson A.S.", "AuthorID": "57182480800", "AffiliationID": "60008877", "AffiliationName": "Research into Cancer Prevention and Screening, University of Dundee"}, "7402223116": {"Name": "Steele R.J.C.", "AuthorID": "7402223116", "AffiliationID": "60008877", "AffiliationName": "Research into Cancer Prevention and Screening, University of Dundee"}, "8772573900": {"Name": "Brown G.", "AuthorID": "8772573900", "AffiliationID": "60011472", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Royal Marsden Hospital"}, "6603257428": {"Name": "Fearnhead N.S.", "AuthorID": "6603257428", "AffiliationID": "60017488", "AffiliationName": "Department of Colorectal Surgery, Addenbrooke's Hospital"}, "7004595310": {"Name": "Fenwick S.W.", "AuthorID": "7004595310", "AffiliationID": "60014875", "AffiliationName": "Hepatobiliary Surgery Unit, Aintree University Hospital"}, "57204892111": {"Name": "Halloran S.P.", "AuthorID": "57204892111", "AffiliationID": "60021097, 60172389", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Surrey"}, "6701713285": {"Name": "Hochhauser D.", "AuthorID": "6701713285", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Oncology, University College London, Cancer Institute"}, "57203076498": {"Name": "Hull M.A.", "AuthorID": "57203076498", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "Leeds Institute of Biomedical and Clinical Sciences, University of Leeds"}, "25521851600": {"Name": "Koelzer V.H.", "AuthorID": "25521851600", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Molecular and Population Genetics Laboratory, University of Oxford"}, "24463348400": {"Name": "McNair A.G.K.", "AuthorID": "24463348400", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Surgical Research, University of Bristol"}, "35189279700": {"Name": "Monahan K.J.", "AuthorID": "35189279700", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Family History of Bowel Cancer Clinic, Imperial College London"}, "6603884122": {"Name": "N\u00e4thke I.", "AuthorID": "6603884122", "AffiliationID": "60008877", "AffiliationName": "School of Life Sciences, University of Dundee"}, "35512880600": {"Name": "Norton C.", "AuthorID": "35512880600", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Florence Nightingale Faculty of Nursing and Midwifery, King's College London"}, "7004333584": {"Name": "Novelli M.R.", "AuthorID": "7004333584", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Pathology, University College London, Medical School"}, "7403883165": {"Name": "Thomas A.L.", "AuthorID": "7403883165", "AffiliationID": "60033125", "AffiliationName": "Leicester Cancer Research Centre, University of Leicester"}, "7103338177": {"Name": "Tomlinson I.", "AuthorID": "7103338177", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cancer and Genomic Sciences, University of Birmingham"}}}
