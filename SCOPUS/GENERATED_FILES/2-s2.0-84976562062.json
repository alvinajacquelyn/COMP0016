Cardamine hirsuta, a relative of Arabidopsis thaliana, uses an explosive mechanism to disperse its seeds. We show that this trait evolved through morphomechanical innovations at different spatial scales. At the organ scale, tension within the fruit wall generates the elastic energy required for explosion. This tension is produced by differential contraction of fruit wall tissues through an active mechanism involving turgor pressure, cell geometry, and wall properties of the epidermis. Explosive release of this tension is controlled at the cellular scale by asymmetric lignin deposition within endocarp b cells\u2014a striking pattern that is strictly associated with explosive pod shatter across the Brassicaceae plant family. By bridging these different scales, we present an integrated mechanism for explosive seed dispersal that links evolutionary novelty with complex trait innovation.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Arabidopsis", "Biological Evolution", "Biomechanical Phenomena", "Cardamine", "Cell Wall", "Fruit", "Lignin", "Models, Biological", "Seed Dispersal"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84976562062", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"7801446289": {"Name": "Hofhuis H.", "AuthorID": "7801446289", "AffiliationID": "60028289", "AffiliationName": "Max Planck Institute for Plant Breeding Research"}, "25823530000": {"Name": "Routier-Kierzkowska A.L.", "AuthorID": "25823530000", "AffiliationID": "60028289", "AffiliationName": "Max Planck Institute for Plant Breeding Research"}, "56199882400": {"Name": "Mosca G.", "AuthorID": "56199882400", "AffiliationID": "60020486", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Plant Sciences, University of Bern"}, "15726164100": {"Name": "Reinhardt H.", "AuthorID": "15726164100", "AffiliationID": "60028289", "AffiliationName": "Max Planck Institute for Plant Breeding Research"}, "8547550600": {"Name": "Gan X.", "AuthorID": "8547550600", "AffiliationID": "60028289", "AffiliationName": "Max Planck Institute for Plant Breeding Research"}, "6602853874": {"Name": "Tsiantis M.", "AuthorID": "6602853874", "AffiliationID": "60028289", "AffiliationName": "Max Planck Institute for Plant Breeding Research"}, "55727359400": {"Name": "Smith R.", "AuthorID": "55727359400", "AffiliationID": "60028289", "AffiliationName": "Max Planck Institute for Plant Breeding Research"}, "7201696283": {"Name": "Hay A.", "AuthorID": "7201696283", "AffiliationID": "60028289", "AffiliationName": "Max Planck Institute for Plant Breeding Research"}, "15126229300": {"Name": "Moulton D.", "AuthorID": "15126229300", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Mathematical Institute, University of Oxford, Radcliffe Observatory Quarter"}, "25624841300": {"Name": "Lessinnes T.", "AuthorID": "25624841300", "AffiliationID": "60028186", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, \u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne, LCVMM"}, "35613573500": {"Name": "Goriely A.", "AuthorID": "35613573500", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Mathematical Institute, University of Oxford, Radcliffe Observatory Quarter"}, "8370081400": {"Name": "Bomphrey R.J.", "AuthorID": "8370081400", "AffiliationID": "60026530", "AffiliationName": "Structure and Motion Laboratory, Department of Comparative Biomedical Sciences, Royal Veterinary College, University of London"}, "57063359800": {"Name": "Sarchet P.", "AuthorID": "57063359800", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Plant Sciences Department, University of Oxford"}, "6603704133": {"Name": "Ventikos Y.", "AuthorID": "6603704133", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Mechanical Engineering Department, University College London"}, "23494161500": {"Name": "Walker S.", "AuthorID": "23494161500", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Zoology Department, University of Oxford"}}}
