KGaA, Weinheim.Sirtuins, NAD+-dependent histone deacetylases (HDACs), have recently emerged as potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of a variety of diseases. The discovery of potent and iso-form-selective inhibitors of this enzyme family should provide chemical tools to help determine the roles of these targets and validate their therapeutic value. Herein, we report the discovery of a novel class of highly selective SIRT2 inhibitors, identified by pharmacophore screening. We report the identification and validation of 3-((2-methoxynaphthalen-1-yl)methyl)-7-((pyridin-3-ylmethyl)amino)-5,6,7,8-tetrahydrobenzo[4,5]thieno[2,3-d]pyrimidin-4(3H)-one (ICL-SIRT078), a substrate-competitive SIRT2 inhibitor with a Ki value of 0.62\u00b10.15mM and more than 50-fold selectivity against SIRT1, 3 and 5. Treatment of MCF-7 breast cancer cells with ICL-SIRT078 results in hyperacetylation of \u03b1-tubulin, an established SIRT2 biomarker, at doses comparable with the biochemical IC50 data, while suppressing MCF-7 proliferation at higher concentrations. In concordance with the recent reports that suggest SIRT2 inhibition is a potential strategy for the treatment of Parkinson's disease, we find that compound ICL-SIRT078 has a significant neuroprotective effect in a lactacystin-induced model of Parkinsonian neuronal cell death in the N27 cell line. These results encourage further investigation into the effects of ICL-SIRT078, or an optimised derivative thereof, as a candidate neuroprotective agent in in vivo models of Parkinson's disease.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Acetylation", "Histone deacetylases (HDACs)", "Parkinson's disease", "SIRT", "Sirtuins"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Binding Sites", "Cell Line", "Cell Proliferation", "Disease Models, Animal", "Dopaminergic Neurons", "Drug Evaluation, Preclinical", "Forkhead Transcription Factors", "Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors", "Humans", "MCF-7 Cells", "Molecular Docking Simulation", "Neuroprotective Agents", "Parkinson Disease", "Protein Binding", "Protein Structure, Tertiary", "Pyrimidinones", "Rats", "Sirtuin 2", "Structure-Activity Relationship", "Thiophenes"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84919778888", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Molecular Medicine", "BIOC", "1313"], ["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"], ["Drug Discovery", "PHAR", "3002"], ["Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics (all)", "PHAR", "3000"], ["Organic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1605"]], "AuthorData": {"35791650900": {"Name": "Di Fruscia P.", "AuthorID": "35791650900", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Imperial College London, St. Kensington Campus"}, "56460269600": {"Name": "Zacharioudakis E.", "AuthorID": "56460269600", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Imperial College London, St. Kensington Campus"}, "57191677038": {"Name": "Liu C.", "AuthorID": "57191677038", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Imperial College London, St. Kensington Campus"}, "26040728700": {"Name": "Koltsida K.", "AuthorID": "26040728700", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Imperial College London, St. Kensington Campus"}, "8407234400": {"Name": "Fuchter M.", "AuthorID": "8407234400", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Imperial College London, St. Kensington Campus"}, "24830931800": {"Name": "Moniot S.", "AuthorID": "24830931800", "AffiliationID": "60023208", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemistry, University of Bayreuth"}, "6701657642": {"Name": "Steegborn C.", "AuthorID": "6701657642", "AffiliationID": "60023208", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemistry, University of Bayreuth"}, "55053477400": {"Name": "Laohasinnarong S.", "AuthorID": "55053477400", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery and Cancer, Imperial College London"}, "36630599000": {"Name": "Khongkow M.", "AuthorID": "36630599000", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery and Cancer, Imperial College London"}, "7102889877": {"Name": "Lam E.", "AuthorID": "7102889877", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery and Cancer, Imperial College London"}, "55382681000": {"Name": "Harrison I.", "AuthorID": "55382681000", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Neuroinflammation and Neurodegeneration, Division of Brain Sciences, Imperial College London"}, "7006330956": {"Name": "Dexter D.", "AuthorID": "7006330956", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Neuroinflammation and Neurodegeneration, Division of Brain Sciences, Imperial College London"}, "55252952200": {"Name": "Reynolds C.", "AuthorID": "55252952200", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Life Sciences, Imperial College London"}, "7101911184": {"Name": "Sternberg M.", "AuthorID": "7101911184", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Life Sciences, Imperial College London"}, "6503975609": {"Name": "Schmidtkunz K.", "AuthorID": "6503975609", "AffiliationID": "60025641", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Albert-Ludwigs University"}, "7402549857": {"Name": "Jung M.", "AuthorID": "7402549857", "AffiliationID": "60025641", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Albert-Ludwigs University"}, "7201682244": {"Name": "Chapman K.", "AuthorID": "7201682244", "AffiliationID": "60111999", "AffiliationName": "Domainex Ltd."}}}
