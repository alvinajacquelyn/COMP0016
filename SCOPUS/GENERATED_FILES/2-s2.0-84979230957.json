We studied the decadal-scale response of two UK shallow lakes to fish kills using a palaeolimnological approach. Eutrophic and turbid Barningham Lake experienced two fish kills in the early 1950s and late 1970s with fish recovering after both events, whereas less eutrophic, macrophyte-dominated Wolterton Lake experienced one kill event in the early 1970s from which fish failed to recover. Our palaeo-data show fish-driven trophic cascade effects across all trophic levels (covering benthic and pelagic species) in both lakes regardless of pre-kill macrophyte coverage and trophic status. In turbid Barningham Lake, similar to long-term studies of biomanipulations in other eutrophic lakes, effects at the macrophyte level are shown to be temporary after the first kill (c. 20 years) and non-existent after the second kill. In plant-dominated Wolterton Lake, permanent fish disappearance failed to halt a long-term pattern of macrophyte community change (for example, loss of charophytes and over-wintering macrophyte species) symptomatic of eutrophication. Important implications for theory and restoration ecology arise from our study. Firstly, our data support ideas of slow eutrophication-driven change in shallow lakes where perturbations are not necessary prerequisites for macrophyte loss. Secondly, the study emphasises a key need for lake managers to reduce external nutrient loading if sustainable and long-term lake restoration is to be achieved. Our research highlights the enormous potential of multi-indicator palaeolimnology and alludes to an important need to consider potential fish kill signatures when interpreting results.", "AuthorKeywords": ["biomanipulation", "eutrophication", "fish kills", "macrofossils", "palaeolimnology", "shallow lakes", "trophic cascades"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84979230957", "SubjectAreas": [["Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics", "AGRI", "1105"], ["Environmental Chemistry", "ENVI", "2304"], ["Ecology", "ENVI", "2303"]], "AuthorData": {"7003314493": {"Name": "Sayer C.", "AuthorID": "7003314493", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Environmental Change Research Centre (ECRC), Department of Geography, University College London"}, "57189877089": {"Name": "Rawcliffe R.", "AuthorID": "57189877089", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Environmental Change Research Centre (ECRC), Department of Geography, University College London"}, "57190338790": {"Name": "Cockerton G.", "AuthorID": "57190338790", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Environmental Change Research Centre (ECRC), Department of Geography, University College London"}, "57203203579": {"Name": "Rose N.", "AuthorID": "57203203579", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Environmental Change Research Centre (ECRC), Department of Geography, University College London"}, "7103293305": {"Name": "Davidson T.", "AuthorID": "7103293305", "AffiliationID": "60029616", "AffiliationName": "Section for Ecoinformatics and Biodiversity, Department of Bioscience, Aarhus University"}, "8602598300": {"Name": "Langdon P.", "AuthorID": "8602598300", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "Geography and Environment, University of Southampton"}, "57190346055": {"Name": "Croft T.", "AuthorID": "57190346055", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "Geography and Environment, University of Southampton"}, "7003344757": {"Name": "Leavitt P.", "AuthorID": "7003344757", "AffiliationID": "60030101", "AffiliationName": "Limnology Laboratory, Department of Biology, University of Regina"}}}
