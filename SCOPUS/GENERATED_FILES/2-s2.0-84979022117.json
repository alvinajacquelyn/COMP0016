Distribution or reproduction of this work in whole or in part requires full attribution of the original publication, including its DOI.We highlight a significant problem that needs to be considered and addressed when performing functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) studies, namely the possibility of inadvertently measuring fNIRS hemodynamic responses that are not due to neurovascular coupling. These can be misinterpreted as brain activity, i.e., \"false positives\" (errors caused by wrongly assigning a detected hemodynamic response to functional brain activity), or mask brain activity, i.e., \"false negatives\" (errors caused by wrongly assigning a not observed hemodynamic response in the presence of functional brain activity). Here, we summarize the possible physiological origins of these issues and suggest ways to avoid and remove them.", "AuthorKeywords": ["functional near-infrared spectroscopy", "hemodynamic response"], "IndexKeywords": ["Brain activity", "False negatives", "False positive", "Functional near infrared spectroscopy", "Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fnirs)", "Hemodynamic response", "Neuro-vascular coupling", "Physiological origin"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84979022117", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (miscellaneous)", "NEUR", "2801"], ["Radiological and Ultrasound Technology", "HEAL", "3614"], ["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"6507301690": {"Name": "Tachtsidis I.", "AuthorID": "6507301690", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, Malet Place Engineering Building"}, "35811271000": {"Name": "Scholkmann F.", "AuthorID": "35811271000", "AffiliationID": "60019619, 60012614", "AffiliationName": "University Hospital Zurich, University of Zurich, Department of Neonatology, Biomedical Optics Research Laboratory"}}}
