Here, we employed three different preheat treatments (energy per unit area, EA) to a Ti-6Al-4V powder bed. Each standalone build, we fabricated a large block sample and seven can-shaped samples containing sintered powder. X-ray computed tomography (XCT) was employed to quantify the porosity and build accuracy of the can-shaped samples. The effective thermal conductivity of the sintered powder bed was estimated by XCT image-based modelling. The microstructural and mechanical properties of the block sample were examined by scanning electron microscopy and microhardness testing, respectively. The results demonstrate that increasing EA reduces the anisotropy of tortuosity and increases the thermal conductivity of the sintered powder bed, improving the heat transfer efficiency for subsequent beam-matter interaction. High preheat has a negligible effect on the porosity of large AM components; however, it decreases the microhardness from 330 \u00b1 7 to 315 \u00b1 11 HV0.5 and increases the maximum build error from 330 to 400 \u03bcm. Our study shows that a medium EA (411 kJ m\u22122) is sufficient to produce components with a high hardness whilst optimising build accuracy.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Additive manufacturing", "Dimensional accuracy", "Image-based modelling", "Preheating", "Thermal conductivity", "X-ray computed tomography (CT)"], "IndexKeywords": ["Dimensional accuracy", "Effective thermal conductivity", "Heat transfer efficiency", "Image-based modelling", "Microhardness testing", "Pre-heat treatment", "Selective electron beam melting", "X-ray computed tomography"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85064661233", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Mechanics of Materials", "ENGI", "2211"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"]], "AuthorData": {"57201552479": {"Name": "Leung C.L.A.", "AuthorID": "57201552479", "AffiliationID": "60023254", "AffiliationName": "Research Complex at Harwell, Rutherford Appleton Laboratory"}, "8504683300": {"Name": "Lee P.D.", "AuthorID": "8504683300", "AffiliationID": "60023254", "AffiliationName": "Research Complex at Harwell, Rutherford Appleton Laboratory"}, "57201801522": {"Name": "Nonni S.", "AuthorID": "57201801522", "AffiliationID": "60003771, 60176593", "AffiliationName": "Henry Royce Institute, School of Materials, University of Manchester"}, "56112901000": {"Name": "Tosi R.", "AuthorID": "56112901000", "AffiliationID": "113105170", "AffiliationName": "The Manufacturing Technology Centre"}, "57204642487": {"Name": "Muzangaza E.", "AuthorID": "57204642487", "AffiliationID": "113105170", "AffiliationName": "The Manufacturing Technology Centre"}, "7102893317": {"Name": "Withers P.J.", "AuthorID": "7102893317", "AffiliationID": "60003771, 60176593", "AffiliationName": "Henry Royce Institute, School of Materials, University of Manchester"}}}
