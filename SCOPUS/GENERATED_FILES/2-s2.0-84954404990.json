The central thesis is that the rapprochement requires a reconceptualisation of curriculum theory and didactics in light of the Practical and the German Didaktik tradition, respectively, together with an understanding of their complementary relationship within the societal, institutional and instructional contexts of schooling. The article concludes by drawing implications for reconstructing curriculum theory and didactics within the context of China\u2019s recent curriculum reform and for the international dialogue of curriculum vs. Didaktik.", "AuthorKeywords": ["curriculum", "curriculum theory", "didactics", "Didaktik", "John Dewey", "teaching", "the Practical"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84954404990", "SubjectAreas": [["Cultural Studies", "SOCI", "3316"], ["Education", "SOCI", "3304"]], "AuthorData": {"7402665793": {"Name": "Deng Z.", "AuthorID": "7402665793", "AffiliationID": "60010940, 60005510", "AffiliationName": "National Institute of Education, Nanyang Technological University"}}}
