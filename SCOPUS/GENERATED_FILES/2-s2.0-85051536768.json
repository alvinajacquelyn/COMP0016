Intuitively, some people read the news frequently and broadly whilst others read it occasionally and selectively. It is likely that these differences in news reading behaviour arise in part from differences in peoples' personalities. We report a study that surveyed the digital news reading habits and personality traits of 241 people. We find correlations between most news reading characteristics (e.g., how much time over a day a person reads news) and some personality traits (e.g Openness-to-Experience). The correlations provide a better understanding of the different types of news reading user and why they read news in different ways. They indicate the value of extending user model profiles to include personality traits along with domain specific activity factors.", "AuthorKeywords": ["News Reading Behaviour", "Personalisation", "Personality"], "IndexKeywords": ["Digital news", "Domain specific", "News Reading Behaviour", "Personalisation", "Personality", "Personality traits", "User Modeling", "User Modelling"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85051536768", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"]], "AuthorData": {"55515206300": {"Name": "Constantinides M.", "AuthorID": "55515206300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dept. of Computer Science, University College London"}, "36165166700": {"Name": "Dowell J.", "AuthorID": "36165166700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dept. of Computer Science, University College London"}, "23389317300": {"Name": "Germanakos P.", "AuthorID": "23389317300", "AffiliationID": "60072347", "AffiliationName": "SAP SE, University of Cyprus"}, "7003437264": {"Name": "Samaras G.", "AuthorID": "7003437264", "AffiliationID": "60071343", "AffiliationName": "Dept. of Computer Science, University of Cyprus"}}}
