In this paper we address the challenge of supporting end-users, especially when they are not technical experts, in connecting new low-power, low-cost Wi-Fi devices with very minimal UIs to an existing, secure Wi-Fi infrastructure. We report two usability studies through which 30 participants, with no formal technical training, compared 4 alternative configuration techniques, selected based on cost and consumption constraints, and on adoption in off-The-shelf products. Through an analysis of success rate and causes of failure, our results indicate that two techniques are noticeably more usable than others. These are a web-based configuration mechanism, where users connect to an access point on the Wi-Fi device, and one that makes use of a standard audio cable to connect a smartphone to the device to be configured.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Configuration", "Deployment", "Internet-of-Things", "User study"], "IndexKeywords": ["Alternative configurations", "Configuration", "Configuration mechanisms", "Deployment", "Technical experts", "Technical training", "Usability studies", "User study"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84960943080", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"], ["Hardware and Architecture", "COMP", "1708"], ["Software", "COMP", "1712"]], "AuthorData": {"14016052900": {"Name": "Jewell M.O.", "AuthorID": "14016052900", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "Interaction and Complexity Group, School of Electronics and Computer Science, University of Southampton"}, "22834126300": {"Name": "Costanza E.", "AuthorID": "22834126300", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "Interaction and Complexity Group, School of Electronics and Computer Science, University of Southampton"}, "57191502184": {"Name": "Kittley-Davies Agents J.", "AuthorID": "57191502184", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "Interaction and Complexity Group, School of Electronics and Computer Science, University of Southampton"}}}
