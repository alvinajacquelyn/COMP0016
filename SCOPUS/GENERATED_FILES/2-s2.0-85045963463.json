Aim: To examine factors associated with consultation rates in general practice. Design and setting: A cross-sectional study examining a sample of 304 937 patients registered at 316 English practices between 2013 and 2014, drawn from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink. Method: Age, sex, ethnicity, smoking status, and deprivation measures were linked with practice-level data on staffing, rurality, training practice status, and Quality and Outcomes Framework performance. Multilevel analyses of patient consultation rates were conducted. Results: Consultations were grouped into three types: all (GP or nurse), GP, and nurse. Non-smokers consulted less than current smokers (all: rate ratio [RR] = 0.88, 95% CI = 0.87 to 0.89; GP: RR = 0.88, 95% CI = 0.87 to 0.89; nurse: RR = 0.91, 95% CI = 0.90 to 0.92). Consultation rates were higher for those in the most deprived quintile compared with the least deprived quintile (all: RR = 1.18, 95% CI = 1.16 to 1.19; GP: RR = 1.17, 95% CI = 1.15 to 1.19; nurse: RR = 1.13, 95% CI = 1.11 to 1.15). For all three consultation types, consultation rates increased with age and female sex, and varied by ethnicity. Rates in practices with >8 and \u226419 full-time equivalent (FTE) GPs were higher compared with those with \u22642 FTE GPs (all: RR = 1.26, 95% CI = 1.06 to 1.49; GP: RR = 1.36, 95% CI = 1.19 to 1.56). Conclusion: The analyses show consistent trends in factors related to consultation rates in general practice across three types of consultation. These data can be used to inform the development of more sophisticated staffing models, and resource allocation formulae.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Consultation rates", "General practice", "Health services", "Workload"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "England", "Female", "General Practice", "Health Services Research", "Humans", "Infant", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Office Visits", "Patient Acceptance of Health Care", "Patient Satisfaction", "Practice Patterns, Nurses'", "Practice Patterns, Physicians'", "Referral and Consultation", "Workload", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85045963463", "SubjectAreas": [["Family Practice", "MEDI", "2714"]], "AuthorData": {"6506482445": {"Name": "Mukhtar T.K.", "AuthorID": "6506482445", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Public Health and Primary Care, University of Cambridge"}, "57193756967": {"Name": "Hobbs F.D.R.", "AuthorID": "57193756967", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Population, Policy and Practice, University College London"}, "7005395035": {"Name": "Bankhead C.", "AuthorID": "7005395035", "AffiliationID": "60002634", "AffiliationName": "Department of Primary Care Health Sciences, Nuffield Department of Primary Care Health Sciences"}, "57206180642": {"Name": "Stevens S.", "AuthorID": "57206180642", "AffiliationID": "60002634", "AffiliationName": "Department of Primary Care Health Sciences, Nuffield Department of Primary Care Health Sciences"}, "57203214133": {"Name": "Perera R.", "AuthorID": "57203214133", "AffiliationID": "60002634", "AffiliationName": "Department of Primary Care Health Sciences, Nuffield Department of Primary Care Health Sciences"}, "7006060216": {"Name": "Holt T.A.", "AuthorID": "7006060216", "AffiliationID": "60002634", "AffiliationName": "Department of Primary Care Health Sciences, Nuffield Department of Primary Care Health Sciences"}, "20935682000": {"Name": "Salisbury C.", "AuthorID": "20935682000", "AffiliationID": "60171764", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Academic Primary Care, School of Social and Community Medicine, University of Bristol"}}}
