Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.In this short note, we observe that, for purely formal reasons, any autoequivalence can be constructed as a twist around a spherical functor. As an example, we show how the P-twists constructed by Huybrechts and Thomas can be formulated as spherical twists.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85057304036", "SubjectAreas": [["Mathematics (all)", "MATH", "2600"]], "AuthorData": {"24475131500": {"Name": "Segal E.", "AuthorID": "24475131500", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Imperial College London"}}}
