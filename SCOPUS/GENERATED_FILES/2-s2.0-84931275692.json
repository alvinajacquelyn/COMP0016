Nanoparticle properties such as size, shape and surface chemistry can be controlled to improve their performance in biological systems. This enables modulation of immune system interactions, blood clearance profile and interaction with target cells, thereby aiding effective delivery of cargo within cells or tissues. Their ability to target and enter tissues from the blood is highly dependent on their behaviour under blood flow. Here we have produced an agent-based model of nanoparticle behaviour under blood flow in capillaries. We demonstrate that red blood cells are highly important for effective nanoparticle distribution within capillaries. Furthermore, we use this model to demonstrate how nanoparticle size can selectively target tumour tissue over normal tissue. We demonstrate that the polydispersity of nanoparticle populations is an important consideration in achieving optimal specificity and to avoid off-target effects. In future this model could be used for informing new nanoparticle design and to predict general and specific uptake properties under blood flow.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Biological Transport", "Blood Circulation", "Erythrocytes", "Humans", "Nanoparticles"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84931275692", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"36662226900": {"Name": "Fullstone G.", "AuthorID": "36662226900", "AffiliationID": "60001881", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University of Sheffield"}, "57204254218": {"Name": "Battaglia G.", "AuthorID": "57204254218", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Molecular Virology, University College London"}, "57214045194": {"Name": "Wood J.", "AuthorID": "57214045194", "AffiliationID": "60008750, 60001881", "AffiliationName": "Sheffield Institute for Translational Neuroscience, University of Sheffield"}, "22334007800": {"Name": "Holcombe M.", "AuthorID": "22334007800", "AffiliationID": "60001881", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University of Sheffield"}}}
