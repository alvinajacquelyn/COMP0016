Multipath TCP (MPTCP), the most popular multiflow protocol on the Internet, allows receivers to exploit multiple paths towards a single sender. Nevertheless, MPTCP cannot fully exploit the potential gains of multipath connectivity, as it must fairly share resources with (single-flow) TCP, without a clear understanding of whether the available paths do share any bottleneck links. In this paper, we introduce a hybrid congestion control algorithm for multisource and multipath transport that enables higher bandwidth utilization compared to MPTCP, while remaining friendly to TCP-like flows. Our solution employs (i) an in-network module that offers essential topological information and (ii) Normalized Multiflow Congestion Control (NMCC), a novel end-to-end congestion control algorithm. While NMCC is architecture-independent and the in-network module can be adapted for Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) or Software Defined Networks (SDNs), our prototype was implemented on the Publish-Subscribe Internetworking (PSI) architecture, which offers centralized path formation and source routing. Using an actual protocol implementation deployed on our test-bed, we provide experimental results which validate the effectiveness of our design in terms of performance, adaptation to shifting network conditions and friendliness to other flows.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Band-width utilization", "Content distribution", "End-to-end congestion control", "Multi protocol label switching", "Multipath transport", "Network assistance", "Protocol implementation", "Topological information"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84982282621", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"]], "AuthorData": {"55849034000": {"Name": "Thomas Y.", "AuthorID": "55849034000", "AffiliationID": "60019507", "AffiliationName": "Mobile Multimedia Laboratory, Department of Informatics, School of Information Sciences and Technology, Athens University of Economics and Business"}, "6701809084": {"Name": "Xylomenos G.", "AuthorID": "6701809084", "AffiliationID": "60019507", "AffiliationName": "Mobile Multimedia Laboratory, Department of Informatics, School of Information Sciences and Technology, Athens University of Economics and Business"}, "15066050300": {"Name": "Tsilopoulos C.", "AuthorID": "15066050300", "AffiliationID": "60019507", "AffiliationName": "Mobile Multimedia Laboratory, Department of Informatics, School of Information Sciences and Technology, Athens University of Economics and Business"}, "7004703536": {"Name": "Polyzos G.C.", "AuthorID": "7004703536", "AffiliationID": "60019507", "AffiliationName": "Mobile Multimedia Laboratory, Department of Informatics, School of Information Sciences and Technology, Athens University of Economics and Business"}}}
