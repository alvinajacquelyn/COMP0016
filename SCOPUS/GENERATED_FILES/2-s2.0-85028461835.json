Analysis considered nationally-representative samples of students in England, aged 15 (Year 11), from 2006 and 2015. On both occasions, accounting for students\u2019 background and other views, students\u2019 perceived utility of science most strongly and positively associated with their science-related career aspirations, while students\u2019 reports of encountering different teaching approaches had smaller or no associations. Conveying the wider applications of science to students was the only teaching approach to consistently and positively associate with students\u2019 utility and other attitudes. Developing students\u2019 attitudes, and hence their aspirations, through highlighting the applications and relevance of science to everyday life may be beneficial.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Aspirations", "Attitudes", "Intentions", "Motivation", "PISA", "STEM"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85028461835", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"]], "AuthorData": {"55962835400": {"Name": "Sheldrake R.", "AuthorID": "55962835400", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Education, University College London"}, "26038741700": {"Name": "Mujtaba T.", "AuthorID": "26038741700", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Education, University College London"}, "7202205455": {"Name": "Reiss M.", "AuthorID": "7202205455", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Education, University College London"}}}
