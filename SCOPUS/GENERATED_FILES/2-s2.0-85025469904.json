As ranitidine is a substrate for the efflux transporter P-glycoprotein (P-gp), we hypothesized that the sex-related influence could be due to interactions between PEG 400 and P-gp. In this study, we tested this hypothesis by: i) measuring the influence of PEG 400 on the oral bioavailability of another P-gp substrate (ampicillin) and of a non-P-gp substrate (metformin); and ii) measuring the effect of PEG 400 on drug bioavailability in the presence of a P-gp inhibitor (cyclosporine A) in male and female rats. We found that PEG 400 significantly increased (p < 0.05) the bioavailability of ampicillin (the P-gp substrate) in male rats, but not in female ones. In contrast, PEG 400 had no influence on the bioavailability of the non-P-gp substrate, metformin in male or female rats. Inhibition of P-gp by oral pre-treatment with cyclosporine A increased the bioavailability of the P-gp substrates (ampicillin and ranitidine) in males and females (p < 0.05), and to a greater extent in males, but had no influence on the bioavailability of metformin in either male or female rats. These results prove the hypothesis that the sex-specific effect of PEG 400 on the bioavailability of certain drugs is due to the interaction of PEG 400 with the efflux transporter P-gp.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bioavailability", "Ciclosporin A", "Excipients", "Multi drug resistance protein 1 (MDR1", "Oral absorption", "Polyethylene glycol 400", "Polyoxyethylene polymers", "Sex difference"], "IndexKeywords": ["Ampicillin", "Animals", "ATP-Binding Cassette, Sub-Family B, Member 1", "Biological Availability", "Cyclosporine", "Excipients", "Female", "Male", "Metformin", "Polyethylene Glycols", "Ranitidine", "Rats, Wistar", "Sex Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85025469904", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmaceutical Science", "PHAR", "3003"]], "AuthorData": {"55783204700": {"Name": "Mai Y.", "AuthorID": "55783204700", "AffiliationID": "60016379, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "56205649000": {"Name": "Afonso-Pereira F.", "AuthorID": "56205649000", "AffiliationID": "60016379, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "55078653600": {"Name": "Murdan S.", "AuthorID": "55078653600", "AffiliationID": "60016379, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "7003826707": {"Name": "Basit A.", "AuthorID": "7003826707", "AffiliationID": "60016379, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy, University College London"}}}
