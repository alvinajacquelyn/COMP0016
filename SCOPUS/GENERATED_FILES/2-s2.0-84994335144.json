The metastable \u03b1-form is very susceptible to grinding, a property not initially realized considering the polymorphs have been reported in the literature for many years. Systematic milling studies have been carried out in a search for other polymorphic forms and to assess the rate of any polymorphic change(s). No new polymorphs were found, though a computational search for low energy structures suggested a complex crystal-energy landscape. An experimental polymorph screen was also carried out.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Complex crystals", "Energy landscape", "Low energy structures", "Low temperatures", "nocv2", "Polymorphic forms"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84994335144", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"]], "AuthorData": {"7005206877": {"Name": "Cockcroft J.K.", "AuthorID": "7005206877", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "57191865121": {"Name": "Ntantou A.", "AuthorID": "57191865121", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "7201882352": {"Name": "Price L.S.", "AuthorID": "7201882352", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "7005072839": {"Name": "Tocher D.A.", "AuthorID": "7005072839", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "36893205700": {"Name": "Vickers M.", "AuthorID": "36893205700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "26643040800": {"Name": "Lancaster R.W.", "AuthorID": "26643040800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "36020023200": {"Name": "Buanz A.B.M.", "AuthorID": "36020023200", "AffiliationID": "60016379", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy"}}}
