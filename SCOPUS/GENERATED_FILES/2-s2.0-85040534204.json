The present analyses aimed to investigate whether gross and fine motor delays in infants were associated with objective and self-reported activity in childhood. Data were from the UK Millennium Cohort Study, a prospective cohort study, involving UK children born on or around the millennium (September 2000 and January 2002). When children were 9 months old, parents reported children's fine and gross motor-coordination, and at 7 years, sports club attendance and daily TV viewing time. Children's physical activity was measured using accelerometers at 7 years. Adjusted regression models were used to examine associations between delayed motor development and accelerometry measured moderate-to-vigorous physical activity and sedentary behavior, and parent-reported sport club attendance and TV viewing time. In this sample (n=13, 021), gross motor delay in infancy was associated with less time in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (B -5.0 95% confidence interval [CI] -6.8, -3.2) and more time sedentary (B 13.5 95% CI 9.3, 17.8) in childhood. Gross and fine motor delays during infancy were associated with a reduced risk of having high attendance at sports clubs in childhood (both relative risk [RR] 0.7, 95% CI 0.6, 0.9). Fine motor delays, but not gross delays, were also associated with an increased risk of having high TV viewing time (RR 1.3 95% CI 1.0, 1.6). Findings from the present study suggest that delays in motor development in infancy are associated with physical activity and sedentary time in childhood.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cohort", "Motor coordination", "Physical activity", "Sedentary"], "IndexKeywords": ["Child", "Developmental Disabilities", "Exercise", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Humans", "Infant", "Male", "Motor Disorders", "Sedentary Lifestyle"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85040534204", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"56371435100": {"Name": "L\u00f3pez S\u00e1nchez G.F.", "AuthorID": "56371435100", "AffiliationID": "60000130", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Sport Sciences, University of Murcia"}, "55469265700": {"Name": "Williams G.", "AuthorID": "55469265700", "AffiliationID": "60000913", "AffiliationName": "Cambridge Centre for Sport and Exercise Sciences, Department of Life Sciences, Anglia Ruskin University"}, "37004641300": {"Name": "Johnstone J.", "AuthorID": "37004641300", "AffiliationID": "60000913", "AffiliationName": "Cambridge Centre for Sport and Exercise Sciences, Department of Life Sciences, Anglia Ruskin University"}, "55483054300": {"Name": "Roberts J.", "AuthorID": "55483054300", "AffiliationID": "60000913", "AffiliationName": "Cambridge Centre for Sport and Exercise Sciences, Department of Life Sciences, Anglia Ruskin University"}, "37117793800": {"Name": "Smith L.", "AuthorID": "37117793800", "AffiliationID": "60000913", "AffiliationName": "Cambridge Centre for Sport and Exercise Sciences, Department of Life Sciences, Anglia Ruskin University"}, "55219956400": {"Name": "Aggio D.", "AuthorID": "55219956400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Physical Activity Research Group, University College London"}, "57199509236": {"Name": "Vicinanza D.", "AuthorID": "57199509236", "AffiliationID": "60000913", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computing and Technology, Anglia Ruskin University"}, "57204891343": {"Name": "Stubbs B.", "AuthorID": "57204891343", "AffiliationID": "60000913", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Health, Social Care and Education, Anglia Ruskin University"}, "37461506900": {"Name": "Kerr C.", "AuthorID": "37461506900", "AffiliationID": "60000913", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Health, Social Care and Education, Anglia Ruskin University"}}}
