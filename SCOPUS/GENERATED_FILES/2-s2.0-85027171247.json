The main reason has been the realisation that increases in human population life expectancy are accompanied by late onset diseases. Indeed, ageing is the most important risk factor for a number of neoplastic, neurodegenerative and metabolic pathologies. Advances in the knowledge of the genetics of ageing, mainly through research in model organisms, have implicated various cellular processes and the respective signalling pathways that regulate them in cellular and organismal ageing. Associated with ageing is a dysregulation of metabolic homeostasis usually manifested as age-related obesity, diminished insulin sensitivity and impaired glucose and lipid homeostasis. Metabolic deterioration contributes to the ageing phenotype and metabolic pathologies are thought to be one of the main factors limiting the potential for lifespan extension. Great efforts have been directed towards identifying pharmacological interventions with the potential to improve healthspan and a number of natural and synthetic compounds have shown promise in achieving beneficial metabolic effects.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Ageing", "Diabetes", "Insulin resistance", "Metabolism", "Obesity", "PI3K"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aging", "Animals", "Caloric Restriction", "Energy Metabolism", "Food", "Humans", "Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins", "Mice", "Signal Transduction"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85027171247", "SubjectAreas": [["Aging", "BIOC", "1302"], ["Gerontology", "NURS", "2909"], ["Geriatrics and Gerontology", "MEDI", "2717"]], "AuthorData": {"35101272600": {"Name": "Bettedi L.", "AuthorID": "35101272600", "AffiliationID": "60017777, 60006577", "AffiliationName": "Cell Biology and Neurobiology Branch, National Institutes of Child Health and Human Development, National Institutes of Health"}, "6602573458": {"Name": "Foukas L.", "AuthorID": "6602573458", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Healthy Ageing and Department of Genetics, Evolution and Environment, University College London"}}}
