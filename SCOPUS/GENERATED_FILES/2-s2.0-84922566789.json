Unlike the corresponding bulk material, our simulations show that monolayer MX2 (M = Mo and W; X = S, Se, and Te) exhibits a negative thermal expansion at low temperatures, induced by the bending modes. The transition from contraction to expansion at higher temperatures is observed. Interestingly, the thermal expansion can be tailored regularly by alteration of the M or X atom. Detailed analysis shows that the positive thermal expansion coefficient is determined mainly by the in-plane stiffness, which can be expressed by a simple relationship. Essentially the regularity of this change can be attributed to the difference in charge transfer between the different elements. These findings should be applicable to other two-dimensional systems.", "AuthorKeywords": ["phonon", "thermal expansion", "transition metal dichalcogenide"], "IndexKeywords": ["First-principles calculation", "In-plane stiffness", "Low temperatures", "Semiconducting transition", "Temperature dependence", "Thermal expansion coefficients", "Transition metal dichalcogenides", "Two-dimensional systems"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84922566789", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"57192240754": {"Name": "Wang Z.", "AuthorID": "57192240754", "AffiliationID": "60018554", "AffiliationName": "School of Physics and Engineering, Zhengzhou University"}, "56320279700": {"Name": "Wang F.", "AuthorID": "56320279700", "AffiliationID": "60018554", "AffiliationName": "School of Physics and Engineering, Zhengzhou University"}, "56472195100": {"Name": "Sun Q.", "AuthorID": "56472195100", "AffiliationID": "60018554", "AffiliationName": "School of Physics and Engineering, Zhengzhou University"}, "57198560184": {"Name": "Guo Z.", "AuthorID": "57198560184", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "7401504128": {"Name": "Jia Y.", "AuthorID": "7401504128", "AffiliationID": "60018554", "AffiliationName": "School of Physics and Engineering, Zhengzhou University"}, "56029078900": {"Name": "Wang X.", "AuthorID": "56029078900", "AffiliationID": "60018554", "AffiliationName": "School of Physics and Engineering, Zhengzhou University"}, "56510591200": {"Name": "Zhou Y.", "AuthorID": "56510591200", "AffiliationID": "105175639", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering, Henan Industry, Trade Vocational College"}}}
