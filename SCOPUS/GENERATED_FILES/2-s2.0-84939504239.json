This approach resulted in improved fetal growth in growth-restricted pregnancies. Adenoviral vectors encoding VEGF-A 165 or a reporter gene \u03b2-galactosidase were dissolved in 10 mL normal saline shortly before administration. A midline laparotomy was performed and the course of the uterine artery identifi ed. The main trunk (just prior to the fi rst bifurcation) was mobilized by dissection and a vessel loop placed beneath it in order to elevate the artery, which was then occluded digitally just proximal to the planned injection site. The adenoviral solution was slowly injected over 1 min, and the occlusion was maintained for a further 4 min to maximize transduction of the downstream endothelium. After ensuring hemostasis, the abdomen was closed in layers.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Adenovirus", "Fetal growth restriction", "Pregnancy", "Uterine artery blood fl ow", "VEGF"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adenoviridae", "Animals", "Female", "Fetal Development", "Gene Transfer Techniques", "Genetic Therapy", "Genetic Vectors", "Models, Animal", "Placental Circulation", "Pregnancy", "Sheep", "Transduction, Genetic", "Uterine Artery", "Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84939504239", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"]], "AuthorData": {"36834354700": {"Name": "Carr D.", "AuthorID": "36834354700", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "35604074600": {"Name": "Mehta V.", "AuthorID": "35604074600", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "7402967637": {"Name": "Wallace J.", "AuthorID": "7402967637", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "7402605276": {"Name": "David A.", "AuthorID": "7402605276", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
