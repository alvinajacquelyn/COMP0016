Materials and Methods: Texture analysis was performed using commercially available software (TexRAD Ltd, Cambridge, UK) on pre-treatment contrast-enhanced CT studies from 50 patients with metastatic lung adenocarcinoma treated by TKI. Texture features were quantified on a 5-mm-thick central slice of the primary tumor and were correlated with progression-free and overall survival (PFS and OS) using an internally cross-validated machine learning approach then validated on a bootstrapped sample. Results: Median PFS and OS were 10.5 and 20.7 months, respectively. A noninvasive signature based on five texture parameters predicted 6-month progression with Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.8 (95% CI) and 1-year progression with AUC of 0.76. A high-risk group had hazard ratios for progression of 4.63 and 5.78 when divided by median and best cut-off points, respectively. Texture signature did not correlate with OS. Available clinical variables did not correlate with PFS or with OS. Conclusion: Texture features seem to be associated with PFS in lung adenocarcinoma treated with TKI.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Adenocarcinoma", "Carcinoma", "Epidermal growth factor", "Non small cell lung", "Prognosis", "Progression-free survival", "Protein kinase inhibitors", "Receptor", "Texture analysis", "Tomography", "X-ray computed"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adenocarcinoma of Lung", "Adult", "Aged", "Antineoplastic Agents", "Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols", "Disease Progression", "Disease-Free Survival", "Erlotinib Hydrochloride", "Female", "Gefitinib", "Humans", "Lung Neoplasms", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Neoplasm Metastasis", "Prognosis", "Protein-Tyrosine Kinases", "Retrospective Studies", "Tomography, X-Ray Computed"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85056240790", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"23983619700": {"Name": "Ravanelli M.", "AuthorID": "23983619700", "AffiliationID": "60015300, 60011918", "AffiliationName": "University of Brescia, Department of Radiology, Piazzale Spedali Civili 1"}, "57193275249": {"Name": "Agazzi G.M.", "AuthorID": "57193275249", "AffiliationID": "60015300, 60011918", "AffiliationName": "University of Brescia, Department of Radiology, Piazzale Spedali Civili 1"}, "56369080500": {"Name": "Tononcelli E.", "AuthorID": "56369080500", "AffiliationID": "60015300, 60011918", "AffiliationName": "University of Brescia, Department of Radiology, Piazzale Spedali Civili 1"}, "57204572918": {"Name": "Bettoni V.", "AuthorID": "57204572918", "AffiliationID": "60015300, 60011918", "AffiliationName": "University of Brescia, Department of Radiology, Piazzale Spedali Civili 1"}, "24463349300": {"Name": "Borghesi A.", "AuthorID": "24463349300", "AffiliationID": "60015300, 60011918", "AffiliationName": "University of Brescia, Department of Radiology, Piazzale Spedali Civili 1"}, "7003402149": {"Name": "Maroldi R.", "AuthorID": "7003402149", "AffiliationID": "60015300, 60011918", "AffiliationName": "University of Brescia, Department of Radiology, Piazzale Spedali Civili 1"}, "7004908037": {"Name": "Farina D.", "AuthorID": "7004908037", "AffiliationID": "60015300, 60011918", "AffiliationName": "University of Brescia, Department of Radiology, Piazzale Spedali Civili 1"}, "8556612100": {"Name": "Ganeshan B.", "AuthorID": "8556612100", "AffiliationID": "60090043, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Nuclear Medicine, University College"}, "55259921100": {"Name": "Roca E.", "AuthorID": "55259921100", "AffiliationID": "60015300, 60011918", "AffiliationName": "University of Brescia, Department of Oncology, Piazzale Spedali Civili 1"}, "7005291153": {"Name": "Berruti A.", "AuthorID": "7005291153", "AffiliationID": "60015300, 60011918", "AffiliationName": "University of Brescia, Department of Oncology, Piazzale Spedali Civili 1"}, "54410300200": {"Name": "Caprioli A.", "AuthorID": "54410300200", "AffiliationID": "60015300, 60011918", "AffiliationName": "University of Brescia, Department of Pneumology, Piazzale Spedali Civili 1"}}}
