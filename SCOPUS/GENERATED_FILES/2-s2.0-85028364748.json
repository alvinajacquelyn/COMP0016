Diagnosis is challenging owing to a wide variability in clinical manifestations and severity of symptoms. Many patients may experience marked delays in obtaining a definitive diagnosis. The two surveys reported herein aimed to explore the patient journey to diagnosis of GD from the perspectives of Gaucher expert physicians and patients. Findings from the surveys revealed that many patients experienced diagnostic delays and misdiagnoses, with nearly 1 in 6 patients stating that they were not diagnosed with GD for 7 years or more after first consulting a doctor. Physicians and patients both reported multiple referrals to different specialties before a diagnosis of GD was obtained, with primary care, haematology/haematology-oncology and paediatrics the main specialties to which patients first presented. Splenomegaly, thrombocytopenia, anaemia and bone pain were reported as the most common medical problems at first presentation in both surveys. These findings support a clear need for straightforward and easy-to-follow guidance designed to assist non-specialists to identify earlier patients who are at risk of GD.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Delayed diagnosis", "Diagnosis", "Gaucher disease", "Patient survey", "Physician survey"], "IndexKeywords": ["Child", "Delayed Diagnosis", "Gaucher Disease", "Humans", "Male", "Medicine", "Patients", "Physicians", "Risk Factors", "Surveys and Questionnaires"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85028364748", "SubjectAreas": [["Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism", "MEDI", "2712"], ["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Endocrinology", "BIOC", "1310"]], "AuthorData": {"56921222900": {"Name": "Mehta A.", "AuthorID": "56921222900", "AffiliationID": "60029950, 60032819", "AffiliationName": "Lysosomal Storage Disorders Unit, Department of Haematology, Royal Free Hospital, UCL Medical School"}, "55186237200": {"Name": "Hughes D.", "AuthorID": "55186237200", "AffiliationID": "60029950, 60032819", "AffiliationName": "Lysosomal Storage Disorders Unit, Department of Haematology, Royal Free Hospital, UCL Medical School"}, "7003564362": {"Name": "Belmatoug N.", "AuthorID": "7003564362", "AffiliationID": "116159802", "AffiliationName": "Referral Centre for Lysosomal Diseases, University Hospital Paris Nord Val de Seine"}, "7003606384": {"Name": "Bembi B.", "AuthorID": "7003606384", "AffiliationID": "114374116", "AffiliationName": "Academic Medical Centre Hospital of Udine, Regional Coordinator Centre for Rare Diseases"}, "8558838100": {"Name": "Deegan P.", "AuthorID": "8558838100", "AffiliationID": "60017488", "AffiliationName": "Addenbrooke's Hospital"}, "7005179505": {"Name": "Elstein D.", "AuthorID": "7005179505", "AffiliationID": "115063993", "AffiliationName": "Shire"}, "57200200455": {"Name": "Panahloo Z.", "AuthorID": "57200200455", "AffiliationID": "115063993", "AffiliationName": "Shire"}, "6507595392": {"Name": "G\u00f6ker-Alpan \u00d6.", "AuthorID": "6507595392", "AffiliationID": "118296901", "AffiliationName": "Lysosomal Disorders Unit and Center for Clinical Trials, O&O Alpan, LLC"}, "7006788246": {"Name": "Lukina E.", "AuthorID": "7006788246", "AffiliationID": "60073364", "AffiliationName": "National Research Center for Hematology"}, "6602409016": {"Name": "Mengel E.", "AuthorID": "6602409016", "AffiliationID": "60031216, 60022135", "AffiliationName": "Villa Metabolica, Center for Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine, University Medical Center of the Johannes Gutenberg-University"}, "7407669005": {"Name": "Nakamura K.", "AuthorID": "7407669005", "AffiliationID": "60019431", "AffiliationName": "Kumamoto University Hospital"}, "7005660938": {"Name": "Pastores G.M.", "AuthorID": "7005660938", "AffiliationID": "60019449, 60005141", "AffiliationName": "University College Dublin, and Mater Misericordiae University Hospital"}, "7003693055": {"Name": "P\u00e9rez-L\u00f3pez J.", "AuthorID": "7003693055", "AffiliationID": "60012486", "AffiliationName": "Unit of Rare Diseases, Hospital Vall d'Hebron"}, "7201769440": {"Name": "Schwartz I.", "AuthorID": "7201769440", "AffiliationID": "60006726", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genetics, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul"}, "23098491600": {"Name": "Serratrice C.", "AuthorID": "23098491600", "AffiliationID": "60009963", "AffiliationName": "Foundation Hospital Saint Joseph, Marseille, France and Geneva University Hospital"}, "7006053620": {"Name": "Szer J.", "AuthorID": "7006053620", "AffiliationID": "60005245", "AffiliationName": "Royal Melbourne Hospital"}, "7006390817": {"Name": "Zimran A.", "AuthorID": "7006390817", "AffiliationID": "60072445, 60022846", "AffiliationName": "Gaucher Clinic, Shaare Zedek Medical Center, affiliated with the Hebrew University-Hadassah Medical School"}, "15755169600": {"Name": "Di Rocco M.", "AuthorID": "15755169600", "AffiliationID": "60016041", "AffiliationName": "Unit of Rare Diseases, Department of Pediatrics, Giannina Gaslini Institute"}, "35488255000": {"Name": "Kuter D.J.", "AuthorID": "35488255000", "AffiliationID": "60029929, 60002746", "AffiliationName": "Center for Hematology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School"}}}
