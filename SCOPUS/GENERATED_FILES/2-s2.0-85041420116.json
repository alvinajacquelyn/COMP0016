Setting English and Welsh National Health Services (secondary care): February 2011 to January 2012. Participants 15 325 women aged 18-60 years in England and Wales who had a new referral for HMB to a gynaecology outpatient department Methods Multivariable linear regression to calculate adjusted differences in mean symptom severity and quality of life scores at first outpatient visit. Multivariable logistic regression to calculate adjusted ORs. Adjustment for body mass index, parity and comorbidities. Primary outcome measures Mean symptom severity score (0=best, 100=worst), mean condition-specific quality of life score (0=worst, 100=best) and symptom duration (\u22651 year). Results Women were on average 42 years old and 12% reported minority ethnic backgrounds. Mean symptom severity and condition-specific quality of life scores were 61.8 and 34.7. Almost three-quarters of women (74%) reported having had symptoms for \u22651 year. Women from more deprived areas had more severe symptoms at their first outpatient visit (difference -6.1; 95% CI-7.2 to -4.9, between least and most deprived quintiles) and worse condition-specific quality of life (difference 6.3; 95% CI 5.1 to 7.5). Symptom severity declined with age while quality of life improved. Conclusions Women living in more deprived areas reported more severe HMB symptoms and poorer quality of life at the start of treatment in secondary care. Providers should examine referral practices to explore if these differences reflect women's health-seeking behaviour or how providers decide whether or not to refer.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Age Factors", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Cohort Studies", "England", "Female", "Health Equity", "Health Surveys", "Humans", "Linear Models", "Menorrhagia", "Middle Aged", "Quality of Life", "Referral and Consultation", "Secondary Care", "Severity of Illness Index", "Socioeconomic Factors", "Time-to-Treatment", "Wales", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85041420116", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"57213508094": {"Name": "Kiran A.", "AuthorID": "57213508094", "AffiliationID": "60113763", "AffiliationName": "Lindsay Stewart Centre for Audit and Clinical Informatics, Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists"}, "55522384600": {"Name": "Geary R.S.", "AuthorID": "55522384600", "AffiliationID": "60113763", "AffiliationName": "Lindsay Stewart Centre for Audit and Clinical Informatics, Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists"}, "15834690800": {"Name": "Gurol-Urganci I.", "AuthorID": "15834690800", "AffiliationID": "60113763", "AffiliationName": "Lindsay Stewart Centre for Audit and Clinical Informatics, Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists"}, "26040692500": {"Name": "Cromwell D.A.", "AuthorID": "26040692500", "AffiliationID": "60113763", "AffiliationName": "Lindsay Stewart Centre for Audit and Clinical Informatics, Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists"}, "7102799145": {"Name": "Van Der Meulen J.", "AuthorID": "7102799145", "AffiliationID": "60113763", "AffiliationName": "Lindsay Stewart Centre for Audit and Clinical Informatics, Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists"}, "7101634545": {"Name": "Mahmood T.", "AuthorID": "7101634545", "AffiliationID": "60113763", "AffiliationName": "Lindsay Stewart Centre for Audit and Clinical Informatics, Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists"}, "55769366800": {"Name": "Bansi-Matharu L.", "AuthorID": "55769366800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Epidemiology and Health, University College London"}, "57204146344": {"Name": "Shakespeare J.", "AuthorID": "57204146344", "AffiliationID": "60113753", "AffiliationName": "Royal College of General Practitioners"}}}
