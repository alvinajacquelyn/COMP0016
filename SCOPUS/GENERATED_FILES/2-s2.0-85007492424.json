This study was conducted to determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D), maximum tolerated dose, safety, pharmacokinetics, and antitumor activity of oral ridaforolimus in children with advanced solid tumors. Experimental Design: In this phase 1, multicenter, open-label study in children aged 6 to < 18 years with advanced solid tumors, ridaforolimus was administered orally for 5 consecutive days/week in 28-day cycles until progression, unacceptable toxicity, or consent withdrawal. Dose started at 22 mg/m2 and increased to 28 mg/m2 and 33 mg/m2, followed by expansion at the RP2D. Results: Twenty patients were treated; 18 were evaluable for dose-limiting toxicities. One dose-limiting toxicity (grade 3 increased alanine aminotransferase) occurred in 1 patient at 33 mg/m2. Dose escalation concluded at 33 mg/m2; the maximum tolerated dose was not determined. The most common treatment-related adverse events (frequency \u226540%) were manageable grade 1-2 stomatitis, thrombocytopenia, hypertriglyceridemia, increased alanine aminotransferase, fatigue, hypercholesterolemia, anemia, and increased aspartate aminotransferase. Ridaforolimus exposure at 28 mg/m2 and 33 mg/m2 exceeded adult target levels. The RP2D for oral ridaforolimus in children was defined as 33 mg/m2. Four patients received at least 4 cycles; 2 with pineoblastoma and diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma had stable disease for 12 and 46 cycles, respectively. Conclusions: Ridaforolimus is orally bioavailable and well tolerated in children with advanced solid tumors. The RP2D (33 mg/m2, 5 days/week) exceeds the adult RP2D. The favorable toxicity and pharmacokinetic profiles may allow for combination therapy, a promising therapeutic option in pediatric malignancies.", "AuthorKeywords": ["MTOR", "Pharmacokinetics", "Phase I-III trials_pediatric cancers", "Phase I-III trials_sarcoma/soft-tissue malignancies", "Ridaforolimus"], "IndexKeywords": ["Administration, Oral", "Adolescent", "Adult", "Antineoplastic Agents", "Child", "Combined Modality Therapy", "Drug Dosage Calculations", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Neoplasm Staging", "Neoplasms", "Sirolimus", "Stomatitis", "TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85007492424", "SubjectAreas": [["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"]], "AuthorData": {"7401994312": {"Name": "Pearson A.D.J.", "AuthorID": "7401994312", "AffiliationID": "60017166, 60010337", "AffiliationName": "Paediatric Drug Development Unit, Children and Young People's Unit, Institute of Cancer Research, The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust"}, "35195817400": {"Name": "Federico S.M.", "AuthorID": "35195817400", "AffiliationID": "60019905", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatric Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital"}, "8100913600": {"Name": "Aerts I.", "AuthorID": "8100913600", "AffiliationID": "60030640", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatric, Adolescent and Young Adult Oncology, Institut Curie"}, "57210349888": {"Name": "Hargrave D.R.", "AuthorID": "57210349888", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Haematology and Oncology Department, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children"}, "7005784051": {"Name": "DuBois S.G.", "AuthorID": "7005784051", "AffiliationID": "60014334, 60002746", "AffiliationName": "Dana-Farber/Boston Children's Cancer, Blood Disorders Center, Harvard Medical School"}, "6604063204": {"Name": "Iannone R.", "AuthorID": "6604063204", "AffiliationID": "60007995", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Research, Merck and Co., Inc."}, "16021749400": {"Name": "Geschwindt R.D.", "AuthorID": "16021749400", "AffiliationID": "60007995", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Research, Merck and Co., Inc."}, "56723031100": {"Name": "Wang R.", "AuthorID": "56723031100", "AffiliationID": "114865603", "AffiliationName": "BARDS, MSD R and D (China) Co.
