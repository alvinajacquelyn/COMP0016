When the input velocity field does not depend on the time parameter, the solution is often referred to as the Lie exponential of the velocity field. In this work, we present an integration method for its numerical computation based both on a generalization of the scaling and squaring algorithm and on a class of numerical integrators aimed to solve systems of ordinary differential equations called exponential integrators. This new method led to the introduction of three numerical integrators, and the subsequent validation are performed on synthetic deformations and real medical images.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Diffeomorphic image registrations", "Exponential integrators", "Numerical computations", "Numerical integrator", "Scaling and squaring", "Spatial transformation", "Systems of ordinary differential equations", "Velocity parameters"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85010199519", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition", "COMP", "1707"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"57193025963": {"Name": "Ferraris S.", "AuthorID": "57193025963", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Translational Imaging Group, Centre for Medical Image Computing, Wolfson House, University College London"}, "26654433200": {"Name": "Lorenzi M.", "AuthorID": "26654433200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Translational Imaging Group, Centre for Medical Image Computing, Wolfson House, University College London"}, "56674274500": {"Name": "Daga P.", "AuthorID": "56674274500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Translational Imaging Group, Centre for Medical Image Computing, Wolfson House, University College London"}, "24376919100": {"Name": "Modat M.", "AuthorID": "24376919100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Translational Imaging Group, Centre for Medical Image Computing, Wolfson House, University College London"}, "23010613000": {"Name": "Vercauteren T.", "AuthorID": "23010613000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Translational Imaging Group, Centre for Medical Image Computing, Wolfson House, University College London"}}}
