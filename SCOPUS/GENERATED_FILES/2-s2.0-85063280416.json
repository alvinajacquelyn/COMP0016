Purpose: Dynamic in-situ proton ( 1 H) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and 1 H T 2 -relaxometry experiments are described in an attempt to: (i) understand the physical processes, that occur during the reconstitution of lyophilized bovine serum albumin (BSA) and monoclonal antibody (mAb) proteins; and (ii) objectify the reconstitution time. Methods: Rapid two-dimensional 1 H MRI and diffusion weighted MRI were used to study the temporal changes in solids dissolution and characterise water mass transport characteristics. One-shot T 2 relaxation time measurements were also acquired in an attempt to quantify the reconstitution time. Both MRI data and T 2 -relaxation data were compared to standard visual observations currently adopted by industry. The 1 H images were further referenced to MRI calibration data to give quantitative values of protein concentration and, percentage of remaining undissolved solids. Results: An algorithmic analysis of the 1 H T 2 -relaxation data shows it is possible to classify the reconstitution event into three regimes (undissolved, transitional and dissolved). Moreover, a combined analysis of the 2D 1 H MRI and 1 H T 2 -relaxation data gives a unique time point that characterises the onset of a reconstituted protein solution within well-defined error bars. These values compared favourably with those from visual observations. Diffusion weighted MRI showed that low concentration BSA and mAb samples showed distinct liquid-liquid phase separation attributed to two liquid layers with significant density differences. Conclusions: T 2 relaxation time distributions (whose interpretation is validated from the 2D 1 H MR images) provides a quick and effective framework to build objective, quantitative descriptors of the reconstitution process that facilitate the interpretation of subjective visual observations currently adopted as the standard practice industry.", "AuthorKeywords": ["dissolution", "lyophilization", "magnetic resonance imaging", "protein concentration", "protein formulation", "reconstitution", "T 2 relaxation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Antibodies, Monoclonal", "Drug Stability", "Freeze Drying", "Humans", "Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, Biomolecular", "Pharmaceutical Preparations", "Protein Stability", "Serum Albumin, Bovine", "Solubility", "Water"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85063280416", "SubjectAreas": [["Biotechnology", "BIOC", "1305"], ["Molecular Medicine", "BIOC", "1313"], ["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"], ["Pharmaceutical Science", "PHAR", "3003"], ["Organic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1605"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"57207938790": {"Name": "Partridge T.A.", "AuthorID": "57207938790", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering and Biotechnology, University of Cambridge"}, "57194376182": {"Name": "Mantle M.D.", "AuthorID": "57194376182", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering and Biotechnology, University of Cambridge"}, "57207934033": {"Name": "Ahmed M.", "AuthorID": "57207934033", "AffiliationID": "60004219", "AffiliationName": "Conjugation Group, Spirogen Ltd, QMB Innovation Centre"}, "57207933229": {"Name": "Choudhary S.B.", "AuthorID": "57207933229", "AffiliationID": "60004219", "AffiliationName": "Dosage Form Design and Development, AstraZeneca"}, "55466016400": {"Name": "Patel S.M.", "AuthorID": "55466016400", "AffiliationID": "60004219", "AffiliationName": "Dosage Form Design and Development, AstraZeneca"}, "7202504753": {"Name": "Bishop S.M.", "AuthorID": "7202504753", "AffiliationID": "60004219", "AffiliationName": "Dosage Form Design and Development, AstraZeneca"}, "6602764225": {"Name": "van der Walle C.F.", "AuthorID": "6602764225", "AffiliationID": "122287292", "AffiliationName": "Dosage Form Design and Development, Spirogen Ltd"}}}
