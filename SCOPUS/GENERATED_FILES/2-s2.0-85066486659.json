Accurate targeting of the intended structure is crucial for optimal clinical outcomes. However, most targets used in functional neurosurgery are sub-optimally visualized on routine MRI. This article reviews recent neuroimaging advancements for targeting in movement disorders. Recent Findings: Dedicated MRI sequences can often visualize to some degree anatomical structures commonly targeted during DBS surgery, including at 1.5-T field strengths. Due to recent technological advancements, MR images using ultra-high magnetic field strengths and new acquisition parameters allow for markedly improved visualization of common movement disorder targets. In addition, novel neuroimaging techniques have enabled group-level analysis of DBS patients and delineation of areas associated with clinical benefits. These areas might diverge from the conventionally targeted nuclei and may instead correspond to white matter tracts or hubs of functional networks. Summary: Neuroimaging advancements have enabled improved direct visualization-based targeting as well as optimization and adjustment of conventionally targeted structures.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Deep brain stimulation", "Functional neurosurgery", "MRI", "Neuroimaging"], "IndexKeywords": ["Deep Brain Stimulation", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Movement Disorders", "Neuroimaging", "Neurosurgery", "Neurosurgical Procedures"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85066486659", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"56723950900": {"Name": "Boutet A.", "AuthorID": "56723950900", "AffiliationID": "60014468", "AffiliationName": "University Health Network"}, "7005808835": {"Name": "Kucharczyk W.", "AuthorID": "7005808835", "AffiliationID": "60014468", "AffiliationName": "University Health Network"}, "56026346700": {"Name": "Gramer R.", "AuthorID": "56026346700", "AffiliationID": "60014468", "AffiliationName": "University Health Network"}, "55154579800": {"Name": "Elias G.J.B.", "AuthorID": "55154579800", "AffiliationID": "60014468", "AffiliationName": "University Health Network"}, "13906186100": {"Name": "Germann J.", "AuthorID": "13906186100", "AffiliationID": "60014468", "AffiliationName": "University Health Network"}, "55759384100": {"Name": "Maciel R.", "AuthorID": "55759384100", "AffiliationID": "60016849, 60002401", "AffiliationName": "Division of Neurology, Edmond J.
