Appropriate complementary feeding (CF) practices can greatly reduce this risk. Thus, we undertook a systematic review of studies assessing CF (timing, dietary diversity, meal frequency and influencing factors) in children aged <2 years in Pakistan. Design Searches between January 2000 and June 2016 in MEDLINE, EMBASE, Global Health, Web of Science, OVID Maternity & Infant Care, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, BanglaJOL, POPLINE and WHO Global Health Library. Eligibility criteria: primary research on CF practices in SA children aged 0-2 years and/or their families. Search terms: 'children', 'feeding' and 'Asians' with their derivatives. Two researchers undertook study selection, data extraction and quality appraisal (EPPI-Centre Weight of Evidence). Results From 45 712 results, seventeen studies were included. Despite adopting the WHO Infant and Young Child Feeding guidelines, suboptimal CF was found in all studies. Nine of fifteen studies assessing timing recorded CF introduced between 6 and 9 months. Five of nine observed dietary diversity across four of seven food groups; and two of four, minimum meal frequency in over 50 % of participants. Influencing factors included lack of CF knowledge, low maternal education, socio-economic status and cultural beliefs. Conclusions This is the first systematic review to evaluate CF practices in Pakistan. Campaigns to change health and nutrition behaviour are needed to meet the substantial unmet needs of these children.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Child", "Complementary feeding", "Diet", "Infant", "Nutrition", "Pakistan"], "IndexKeywords": ["Breast Feeding", "Culture", "Diet", "Feeding Behavior", "Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice", "Humans", "Infant", "Infant Care", "Infant Food", "Infant Nutritional Physiological Phenomena", "Infant, Newborn", "Meals", "Mothers", "Nutritional Status", "Pakistan", "Socioeconomic Factors", "Weaning"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85044254534", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (miscellaneous)", "MEDI", "2701"], ["Nutrition and Dietetics", "NURS", "2916"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"36499843200": {"Name": "Manikam L.", "AuthorID": "36499843200", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Population, Policy and Practice, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "57201312160": {"Name": "Ahmed S.", "AuthorID": "57201312160", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Population, Policy and Practice, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "6506572494": {"Name": "Lakhanpaul M.", "AuthorID": "6506572494", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Population, Policy and Practice, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "57201306572": {"Name": "Sharmila A.", "AuthorID": "57201306572", "AffiliationID": "60021923, 60029685", "AffiliationName": "King's College Hospital, King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57200553338": {"Name": "Alexander E.C.", "AuthorID": "57200553338", "AffiliationID": "60021923, 60029685", "AffiliationName": "King's College Hospital, King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57201312089": {"Name": "Kuah J.Y.", "AuthorID": "57201312089", "AffiliationID": "60021923, 60029685", "AffiliationName": "King's College Hospital, King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57201320114": {"Name": "Prasad A.", "AuthorID": "57201320114", "AffiliationID": "60021923, 60029685", "AffiliationName": "King's College Hospital, King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57201327704": {"Name": "Dharmaratnam A.", "AuthorID": "57201327704", "AffiliationID": "60017977, 60033125", "AffiliationName": "Leicester Medical School, University of Leicester"}, "6701750970": {"Name": "Lingam R.", "AuthorID": "6701750970", "AffiliationID": "60026712, 60006222", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Health and Society, Newcastle University"}}}
