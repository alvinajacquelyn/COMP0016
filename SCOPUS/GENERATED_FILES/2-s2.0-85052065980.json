We tested the association of serum uric acid levels with specific behavioral and clinical characteristics in 99 individuals suffering from major affective disorders. Subjects were assessed and interviewed using the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale, the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale, the Modified Overt Aggression Scale, and the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale. We found that psychological distress and suicidal ideation severity were associated with lower uric acid serum levels. On the other hand, verbal aggression and history of violence were associated with higher levels of serum uric acid. However, according to linear regression analyses, there were no behavioral and clinical characteristics independently associated with serum uric acid. Serum uric acid levels were influenced by creatinine and BMI, as well as, possibly, by white blood cells count and gender. Despite some limitations, these results suggest that no behavioral / clinical features are associated with variations of serum uric acid, which rather seem attributable to specific biochemical and metabolic parameters. Nevertheless, the role of purinergic system in different mental disorders and behavioral abnormalities, deserves further research.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Behavior", "Bipolar disorder", "Major depression", "Uric acid"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Biomarkers", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Mood Disorders", "Suicidal Ideation", "Suicide", "Uric Acid"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85052065980", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"], ["Biological Psychiatry", "NEUR", "2803"]], "AuthorData": {"55249556900": {"Name": "Bartoli F.", "AuthorID": "55249556900", "AffiliationID": "60012306", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine and Surgery, University of Milano Bicocca"}, "55634683100": {"Name": "Crocamo C.", "AuthorID": "55634683100", "AffiliationID": "60012306", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine and Surgery, University of Milano Bicocca"}, "56598587400": {"Name": "Bava M.", "AuthorID": "56598587400", "AffiliationID": "60012306", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine and Surgery, University of Milano Bicocca"}, "57188701737": {"Name": "Castagna G.", "AuthorID": "57188701737", "AffiliationID": "60012306", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine and Surgery, University of Milano Bicocca"}, "57193855827": {"Name": "Di Brita C.", "AuthorID": "57193855827", "AffiliationID": "60012306", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine and Surgery, University of Milano Bicocca"}, "57192720067": {"Name": "Riboldi I.", "AuthorID": "57192720067", "AffiliationID": "60012306", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine and Surgery, University of Milano Bicocca"}, "57188697976": {"Name": "Trotta G.", "AuthorID": "57188697976", "AffiliationID": "60012306", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine and Surgery, University of Milano Bicocca"}, "57203460156": {"Name": "Verrengia E.", "AuthorID": "57203460156", "AffiliationID": "60012306", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine and Surgery, University of Milano Bicocca"}, "56926906800": {"Name": "Clerici M.", "AuthorID": "56926906800", "AffiliationID": "60012306", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine and Surgery, University of Milano Bicocca"}, "7003818736": {"Name": "Carr\u00e0 G.", "AuthorID": "7003818736", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, University College London"}}}
