Building on political psychology literature, we derive hypotheses about how fundamental personality traits such as extraversion and agreeableness correlate with politicians\u2019 preferences for personalized representation. We investigate these expectations using new survey data collected simultaneously among Danish and British MPs, including comprehensive personality measures. We show that personalized representation is particularly pronounced among MPs with higher levels of extraversion, openness to experience and lower levels of agreeableness. Furthermore, and in line with our theoretical expectations, we show that the correlations between personality traits and preferences for personalization vary across countries. Our findings suggest that personalized representation has an underlying personal dimension; consequently, politicians with certain personality traits may have an electoral advantage, particularly where politics become increasingly personalized.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Denmark", "elite survey", "personality", "personalized politics", "political representation", "United Kingdom"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85068080790", "SubjectAreas": [["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"]], "AuthorData": {"57191631638": {"Name": "B\u00f8ggild T.", "AuthorID": "57191631638", "AffiliationID": "60029616", "AffiliationName": "Aarhus Universitet"}, "57208004744": {"Name": "Nielsen M.K.", "AuthorID": "57208004744", "AffiliationID": "60029616", "AffiliationName": "Aarhus Universitet"}, "36603296900": {"Name": "Pedersen H.H.", "AuthorID": "36603296900", "AffiliationID": "60029616", "AffiliationName": "Aarhus Universitet"}, "13409686500": {"Name": "Campbell R.", "AuthorID": "13409686500", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "King\u2019s College London"}, "37062135000": {"Name": "vanHeerde-Hudson J.A.", "AuthorID": "37062135000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
