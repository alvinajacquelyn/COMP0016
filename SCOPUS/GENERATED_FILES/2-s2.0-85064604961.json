In this study, we propose a quasistatic approach for 3D modeling and real-time simulation of a pneumatically actuated soft continuum robotic appendage to estimate the contact force and overall pose. Our model can incorporate external load at any arbitrary point on the body and deliver positional and force propagation information along the entire backbone. In line with the proposed model, the effectiveness of elasticity versus hyperelasticity assumptions (neo-Hookean and Gent) is investigated and compared. Experiments are carried out with and without external load, and simulations are validated across a range of Young's moduli. Results show best conformity with Hooke's model for limited strains with about 6% average normalized error of position; and a mean absolute error of less than 0.08 N for force applied at the tip and on the body, demonstrating high accuracy in estimating the position and the contact force.", "AuthorKeywords": ["elasticity", "force estimation", "hyperelasticity", "modeling", "pose estimation", "soft continuum manipulator", "variable curvature"], "IndexKeywords": ["Computer Simulation", "Elasticity", "Fingers", "Humans", "Models, Biological", "Motion", "Physical Phenomena", "Robotic Surgical Procedures", "Robotics", "Stress, Mechanical"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85064604961", "SubjectAreas": [["Control and Systems Engineering", "ENGI", "2207"], ["Biophysics", "BIOC", "1304"], ["Artificial Intelligence", "COMP", "1702"]], "AuthorData": {"57190121572": {"Name": "Shiva A.", "AuthorID": "57190121572", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Morphological Computation and Learning Lab, Dyson School of Design Engineering, Imperial College London"}, "56637802700": {"Name": "Noh Y.", "AuthorID": "56637802700", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Informatics, Centre for Robotics Research, King's College London"}, "56081578500": {"Name": "Ataka A.", "AuthorID": "56081578500", "AffiliationID": "60022109", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Advanced Robotics @ Queen Mary (ARQ), Faculty of Science and Engineering, Queen Mary University of London"}, "57188663416": {"Name": "Sadati S.M.H.", "AuthorID": "57188663416", "AffiliationID": "60020650, 60115485", "AffiliationName": "Bristol Robotics Laboratory, Faculty of Engineering, University of Bristol"}, "6508336274": {"Name": "Nanayakkara T.", "AuthorID": "6508336274", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Morphological Computation and Learning Lab, Dyson School of Design Engineering, Imperial College London"}, "35299439100": {"Name": "Hauser H.", "AuthorID": "35299439100", "AffiliationID": "60020650, 60115485", "AffiliationName": "Bristol Robotics Laboratory, Faculty of Engineering, University of Bristol"}, "56426562600": {"Name": "Fra\u015b J.", "AuthorID": "56426562600", "AffiliationID": "60088121", "AffiliationName": "Industrial Research Institute for Automation and Measurements PIAP"}, "6701489118": {"Name": "Althoefer K.", "AuthorID": "6701489118", "AffiliationID": "60022109", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Advanced Robotics @ Queen Mary (ARQ), Faculty of Science and Engineering, Queen Mary University of London"}, "35119695800": {"Name": "W\u00fcrdemann H.", "AuthorID": "35119695800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "35593049800": {"Name": "Walker I.D.", "AuthorID": "35593049800", "AffiliationID": "60026610", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Clemson University"}}}
