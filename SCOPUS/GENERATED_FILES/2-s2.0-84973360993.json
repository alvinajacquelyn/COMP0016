As opposed to conventional suppression, interference can be exploited constructively to enhance the desired signal. With the aid of channel state information (CSI) at the transmitter and data information, we study symbol-level downlink beamforming problems based on noise robustness and outage probability, respectively, subject to power constraints. We further show that an equivalence relationship between the noise robustness and outage probability symbol-level downlink beamforming problems can be obtained. Finally, we provide an analytic symbol error rate (SER) upper bound of the worst user by solving the outage probability-based problem. Our simulations demonstrate that the proposed techniques provide substantial performance improvements over conventional downlink beamforming techniques.", "AuthorKeywords": ["constructive interference", "convex optimization", "Downlink beamforming", "error probability", "robust design"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84973360993", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Signal Processing", "COMP", "1711"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"35076119000": {"Name": "Law K.", "AuthorID": "35076119000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University College London"}, "23009493900": {"Name": "Masouros C.", "AuthorID": "23009493900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University College London"}}}
