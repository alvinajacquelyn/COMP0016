We assume the signal of interest and the side information signal are drawn from a correlated mixture of distributions/components, where each component associated with a specific class label follows a Gaussian mixture model (GMM). We provide sharp sufficient and/or necessary conditions for the phase transition of the misclassification probability and the reconstruction error in the low-noise regime. These conditions, which are reminiscent of the well-known Slepian-Wolf and Wyner-Ziv conditions, are a function of the number of measurements taken from the signal of interest, the number of measurements taken from the side information signal, and the geometry of these signals and their interplay.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Classification", "Gaussian mixture models", "reconstruction", "side information"], "IndexKeywords": ["Compressive measurements", "Gaussian Mixture Model", "Misclassification probability", "Mixture of distributions", "Performance limits", "Reconstruction error", "Side information", "Signal of interests"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84969769873", "SubjectAreas": [["Theoretical Computer Science", "MATH", "2614"], ["Information Systems", "COMP", "1710"], ["Modeling and Simulation", "MATH", "2611"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"24802572900": {"Name": "Renna F.", "AuthorID": "24802572900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "7202521476": {"Name": "Rodrigues M.", "AuthorID": "7202521476", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "35070860700": {"Name": "Wang L.", "AuthorID": "35070860700", "AffiliationID": "60008724", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Duke University"}, "57188549342": {"Name": "Yuan X.", "AuthorID": "57188549342", "AffiliationID": "60008724", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Duke University"}, "24476676300": {"Name": "Reeves G.", "AuthorID": "24476676300", "AffiliationID": "60008724", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Duke University"}, "35586083000": {"Name": "Calderbank R.", "AuthorID": "35586083000", "AffiliationID": "60008724", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Duke University"}, "7004561693": {"Name": "Carin L.", "AuthorID": "7004561693", "AffiliationID": "60008724", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Duke University"}, "55756154100": {"Name": "Yang J.", "AuthorID": "55756154100", "AffiliationID": "60002668", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Infocomm Research"}}}
