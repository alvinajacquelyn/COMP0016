Each vignette was followed by thirteen questions concerning the participant's knowledge about diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis. Participants demonstrated good mental health literacy (MHL) for depression, but were poor at diagnosing ASD. Drug therapy was rated as the least effective treatment and \u2018talking to a family member of friend\u2019 was rated as the most effective for each disorder. The highest prognosis ratings were given to depression, and the lowest given to ASD. Participants demonstrated better MHL than expected, possibly due to the availability of information on the Internet and the increase in prevalence of mental illnesses such as depression and ASD among the general population.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Autistic Spectrum Disorder", "Depression", "Lay Recognition", "Mental Health Literacy"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Asperger Syndrome", "Autism Spectrum Disorder", "Depression", "Female", "Health Literacy", "Humans", "Male", "Mental Health", "Middle Aged", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85064209166", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"], ["Biological Psychiatry", "NEUR", "2803"]], "AuthorData": {"57208244351": {"Name": "Godfrey Born C.", "AuthorID": "57208244351", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London"}, "7004768888": {"Name": "McClelland A.", "AuthorID": "7004768888", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Experimental Psychology, University College London"}, "36045985300": {"Name": "Furnham A.", "AuthorID": "36045985300", "AffiliationID": "60007996", "AffiliationName": "Norwegian Business School (BI)"}}}
