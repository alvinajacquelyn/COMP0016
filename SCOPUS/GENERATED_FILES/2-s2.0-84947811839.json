This paper extends the previous logarithmic mean Divisia index (LMDI) decomposition model by introducing three novel factors (R&D intensity, investment intensity, and R&D efficiency). The extended model not only considers the conventional drivers of EICE, but also reflects the microeconomic effects of investment and R&D behaviors on EICE. Furthermore, taking Shanghai as an example, which is the economic center and leading CO2 emitter in China, we use the extended model to decompose and explain EICE changes. Also, we incorporate renewable energy sources into the proposed model to carry out an alternative decomposition analysis at Shanghais entire industrial level. The results show that among conventional (macroeconomic) factors, expanding output scale is mainly responsible for the increase in EICE, and industrial structure adjustment is the most significant factor in mitigating EICE. Regardless of renewable energy sources, the emission-reduction effect of energy intensity focused on by the Chinese government is less than the expected due to the rebound effect, but the introduction of renewable energy sources intensifies its mitigating effect, partly resulting from the transmission from the abating effect of industrial structure adjustment. The effect of energy structure is the weakest. Although all the three novel factors exert significant effects on EICE, they are more sensitive to policy interventions than conventional factors. R&D intensity presents an obvious mitigating effect, while investment intensity and R&D efficiency display an overall promotion effect with some volatility. The introduction of renewable energy sources intensifies the promotion effect of R&D efficiency as a result of the \"green paradox\" effect. Finally, we propose that CO2 mitigation efforts should be made by considering both macroeconomic and microeconomic factors in order to achieve a desirable emission-reduction effect.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Extended LMDI model", "Industrial CO2 emissions", "Investment and R&D activities", "Macroeconomic factors", "Microeconomic factors", "Shanghai"], "IndexKeywords": ["CO2 emissions", "Decomposition analysis", "Industrial structure adjustments", "Macroeconomic factors", "Microeconomic factors", "Policy intervention", "Renewable energy source", "Shanghai"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84947811839", "SubjectAreas": [["Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment", "ENER", "2105"]], "AuthorData": {"35070391800": {"Name": "Shao S.", "AuthorID": "35070391800", "AffiliationID": "60032744", "AffiliationName": "School of Urban and Regional Science, Shanghai University of Finance and Economics"}, "56970082400": {"Name": "Cao J.", "AuthorID": "56970082400", "AffiliationID": "60032744", "AffiliationName": "School of Urban and Regional Science, Shanghai University of Finance and Economics"}, "15839411900": {"Name": "Guan D.", "AuthorID": "15839411900", "AffiliationID": "60000112", "AffiliationName": "School of International Development, University of East Anglia"}, "55733062500": {"Name": "Yang L.", "AuthorID": "55733062500", "AffiliationID": "60175853", "AffiliationName": "School of International Economics and Trade, Institute of Guogou and Free Trade Zone Finance, Shanghai Finance University"}, "56970681100": {"Name": "Gan C.", "AuthorID": "56970681100", "AffiliationID": "109713346", "AffiliationName": "Shanghai Customs College"}, "7103277844": {"Name": "Geng Y.", "AuthorID": "7103277844", "AffiliationID": "60025084", "AffiliationName": "School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University"}}}
