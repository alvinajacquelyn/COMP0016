Methods: LC MRI contrast was quantified in 73 individuals from the DZNE Longitudinal Cognitive Impairment and Dementia Study (DELCODE) study comprising 25 healthy elderly adults and 21 individuals with subjective cognitive decline, 16 with mild cognitive impairment, and 11 participants with AD dementia using 3D T 1 -weighted fast low-angle shot (FLASH) imaging (0.75 mm isotropic resolution). Bootstrapped Pearson's correlations between LC contrast, CSF amyloid, and tau were performed in 44 individuals with CSF biomarker status. Results: A significant regional decrease in LC MRI contrast was observed in patients with AD dementia but not mild cognitive impairment and subjective cognitive decline compared with healthy controls. A negative association between LC MRI contrast and levels of CSF amyloid but not with CSF tau was found. Discussion: These results provide first evidence for a direct association between LC MRI contrast using in vivo T 1 -weighted FLASH imaging and AD pathology.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alzheimer's disease (AD)", "Amyloid", "Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)", "Locus coeruleus (LC)", "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)", "Tau"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85063286871", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"36840399500": {"Name": "Betts M.J.", "AuthorID": "36840399500", "AffiliationID": "60018362", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cognitive Neurology and Dementia Research, Otto-von-Guericke-University Magdeburg"}, "6508147821": {"Name": "Cardenas-Blanco A.", "AuthorID": "6508147821", "AffiliationID": "60018362", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cognitive Neurology and Dementia Research, Otto-von-Guericke-University Magdeburg"}, "6701771740": {"Name": "D\u00fczel E.", "AuthorID": "6701771740", "AffiliationID": "60109771, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, University College London"}, "6602680710": {"Name": "Kanowski M.", "AuthorID": "6602680710", "AffiliationID": "60072303, 60018362", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, University Hospital of Magdeburg, Otto-von-Guericke-University Magdeburg"}, "8944770900": {"Name": "Spottke A.", "AuthorID": "8944770900", "AffiliationID": "60103674", "AffiliationName": "German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE)"}, "7006672877": {"Name": "Jessen F.", "AuthorID": "7006672877", "AffiliationID": "60024025", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, University of Cologne"}, "7004435774": {"Name": "Teipel S.J.", "AuthorID": "7004435774", "AffiliationID": "60024766", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychosomatic Medicine, University Medicine Rostock"}, "55129257000": {"Name": "Kilimann I.", "AuthorID": "55129257000", "AffiliationID": "60103674", "AffiliationName": "German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE)"}}}
