Recent efforts have focused on preoperative optimization in an attempt to modify the risk associated with major surgery. Underaddressed, but important, modifiable risk factors are physical fitness and nutritional status. Surgical patients are particularly at risk of 3 related, but distinct, conditions: frailty, sarcopenia, and reduced physical fitness. Exercise-based prehabilitation strategies have shown promise in terms of improving aerobic fitness, although their impact on key clinical perioperative outcome measures have not been fully determined. Preoperative nutritional status also has a strong bearing on perioperative outcome.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Exercise", "Nutrition", "Perioperative medicine", "Prehabilitation", "Preoptimization"], "IndexKeywords": ["Exercise", "Humans", "Nutrition Therapy", "Nutritional Status", "Postoperative Complications", "Preoperative Care"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85055747715", "SubjectAreas": [["Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine", "MEDI", "2703"]], "AuthorData": {"47761759900": {"Name": "Whittle J.", "AuthorID": "47761759900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Perioperative Medicine, University College London"}, "6603692931": {"Name": "Wischmeyer P.E.", "AuthorID": "6603692931", "AffiliationID": "60030982, 60005200, 60122467", "AffiliationName": "Nutrition Support Service, Duke Clinical Research Institute, Duke University Hospital, Duke University School of Medicine"}, "55348894800": {"Name": "Grocott M.P.W.", "AuthorID": "55348894800", "AffiliationID": "60000703, 60175924", "AffiliationName": "Critical Care Research Group, NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust"}, "36843561700": {"Name": "Miller T.E.", "AuthorID": "36843561700", "AffiliationID": "60113147, 60005200, 60004654", "AffiliationName": "Duke University School of Medicine, Duke University Health System"}}}
