BCCTBbp is dedicated to maximising research on patient tissues by initially storing genomics, methylomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and microRNA data that has been mined from the literature and linking to pathways and mechanisms involved in breast cancer. Currently, the portal holds 146 datasets comprising over 227 795 expression/genomic measurements from various breast tissues (e.g. normal, malignant or benign lesions), cell lines and body fluids. BCCTBbp can be used to build on breast cancer knowledge and maximise the value of existing research. By recording a large number of annotations on samples and studies, and linking to other databases, such as NCBI, Ensembl and Reactome, a wide variety of different investigations can be carried out. Additionally, BC-CTBbp has a dedicated analytical layer allowing researchers to further analyse stored datasets. A future important role for BCCTBbp is to make available all data generated on BCCTB tissues thus building a valuable resource of information on the tissues in BCCTB that will save repetition of experiments and expand scientific knowledge.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Breast Neoplasms", "Computational Biology", "Databases, Genetic", "Female", "Gene Expression Profiling", "Genomics", "Humans", "Internet", "Methylation", "MicroRNAs", "Proteomics", "Tissue Banks"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84945317802", "SubjectAreas": [["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"]], "AuthorData": {"37664574700": {"Name": "Cutts R.J.", "AuthorID": "37664574700", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Molecular Oncology, Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London"}, "36026665000": {"Name": "Guerra-Assun\u00e7\u00e3o J.A.", "AuthorID": "36026665000", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Molecular Oncology, Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London"}, "36494566100": {"Name": "Gadaleta E.", "AuthorID": "36494566100", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Molecular Oncology, Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London"}, "56940154200": {"Name": "Ullah A.Z.D.", "AuthorID": "56940154200", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Molecular Oncology, Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London"}, "24075502900": {"Name": "Chelala C.", "AuthorID": "24075502900", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Molecular Oncology, Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London"}}}
