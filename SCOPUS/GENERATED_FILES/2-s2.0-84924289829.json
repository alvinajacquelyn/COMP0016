Despite this, audiological monitoring is not commonly performed and if performed, uses only standard pure-tone audiometry (PTA). The aim of this study was to investigate ototoxicity in CF children, to determine the most appropriate audiological tests and to identify possible risk factors. Methods: Auditory assessment was performed in CF children using standard pure tone audiometry (PTA), extended high-frequency (EHF) audiometry and distortion-product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAE). Results: 70 CF children, mean (SD) age 10.7 (3.5) years, were recruited. Of the 63 children who received IV AG, 15 (24%) children had ototoxicity detected by EHF audiometry and DPOAE. Standard PTA only detected ototoxicity in 13 children. Eleven of these children had received at least 10 courses of IV AG courses. A 25 to 85. dB. HL hearing loss (mean \u00b1 SD: 57.5 \u00b1 25.7. dB. HL) across all EHF frequencies and a significant drop in DPOAE amplitudes at frequencies 4 to 8. kHz were detected. However, standard PTA detected a significant hearing loss (>. 20. dB. HL) only at 8. kHz in 5 of these 15 children and none in 2 subjects who had significantly elevated EHF thresholds. The number of courses of IV AG received, age and lower lung function were shown to be risk factors for ototoxicity. Conclusions: CF children who had received at least 10 courses of IV AG had a higher risk of ototoxicity. EHF audiometry identified 2 more children with ototoxicity than standard PTA and depending on facilities available, should be the test of choice for detecting ototoxicity in children with CF receiving IV AG.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Aminoglycoside", "Audiometry", "Cystic fibrosis", "Ototoxicity"], "IndexKeywords": ["Administration, Intravenous", "Adolescent", "Aminoglycosides", "Audiometry, Pure-Tone", "Child", "Cystic Fibrosis", "Female", "Great Britain", "Hearing Loss", "Humans", "Male", "Otoacoustic Emissions, Spontaneous", "Risk Assessment", "Risk Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84924289829", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine", "MEDI", "2740"]], "AuthorData": {"36894635400": {"Name": "Al-Malky G.", "AuthorID": "36894635400", "AffiliationID": "60011326", "AffiliationName": "University College London Ear Institute"}, "7202902185": {"Name": "Dawson S.J.", "AuthorID": "7202902185", "AffiliationID": "60011326", "AffiliationName": "University College London Ear Institute"}, "6603415470": {"Name": "Sirimanna T.", "AuthorID": "6603415470", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Audiology and Audiological Medicine, Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "42160994800": {"Name": "Bagkeris E.", "AuthorID": "42160994800", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60015879, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre of Epidemiology for Child Health, UCL Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "7103225246": {"Name": "Suri R.", "AuthorID": "7103225246", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Respiratory Medicine, Great Ormond Street Hospital"}}}
