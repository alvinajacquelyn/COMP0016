However, recent experience also affects interpretation: recently encountered word-meanings become more readily available (Rodd et al., 2016, 2013). Here, 3 experiments investigated how multiple encounters with word-meanings influence the subsequent interpretation of these ambiguous words. Participants heard ambiguous words contextually-disambiguated towards a particular meaning and, after a 20- to 30-min delay, interpretations of the words were tested in isolation. We replicate the finding that 1 encounter with an ambiguous word biased the later interpretation of this word towards the primed meaning for both subordinate (Experiments 1, 2, 3) and dominant meanings (Experiment 1). In addition, for the first time, we show cumulative effects of multiple repetitions of both the same and different meanings. The effect of a single subordinate exposure persisted after a subsequent encounter with the dominant meaning, compared to a dominant exposure alone (Experiment 1). Furthermore, 3 subordinate word-meaning repetitions provided an additional boost to priming compared to 1, although only when their presentation was spaced (Experiments 2, 3); massed repetitions provided no such boost (Experiments 1, 3). These findings indicate that comprehension is guided by the collective effect of multiple recently activated meanings and that the spacing of these activations is key to producing lasting updates to the lexical-semantic network.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Lexical ambiguity", "Lexical-semantic representations", "Priming", "Repetitions", "Spacing"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Association", "Female", "Humans", "Linguistics", "Male", "Random Allocation", "Repetition Priming", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85039151500", "SubjectAreas": [["Language and Linguistics", "ARTS", "1203"], ["Experimental and Cognitive Psychology", "PSYC", "3205"], ["Linguistics and Language", "SOCI", "3310"]], "AuthorData": {"56946558200": {"Name": "Betts H.", "AuthorID": "56946558200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Experimental Psychology, University College London"}, "57195683821": {"Name": "Gilbert R.", "AuthorID": "57195683821", "AffiliationID": "60029069, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "MRC Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit, University of Cambridge"}, "41661049700": {"Name": "Cai Z.", "AuthorID": "41661049700", "AffiliationID": "60000112", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, University of East Anglia"}, "57200082899": {"Name": "Okedara Z.", "AuthorID": "57200082899", "AffiliationID": "60000112", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, University of East Anglia"}, "6701635982": {"Name": "Rodd J.", "AuthorID": "6701635982", "AffiliationID": "60000112", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, University of East Anglia"}}}
