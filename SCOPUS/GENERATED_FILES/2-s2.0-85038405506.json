Simulation can fill this gap to optimize skills\u2019 development and progress monitoring. A structured virtual reality (VR) laparoscopic sigmoid colectomy curriculum is constructed and its validity and outcomes assessed. Methods: Parameters and thresholds were defined by analysing the performance of six expert surgeons completing the relevant module on the LAP Mentor simulator. Fourteen surgical trainees followed the curriculum, performance being recorded and analysed. Evidence of validity was assessed. Results: Time to complete procedure, number of movements of right and left instrument, and total path length of right and left instrument movements demonstrated evidence of validity and clear learning curves, with a median of 14 attempts needed to complete the curriculum. Conclusions: A structured curriculum is proposed for training in laparoscopic sigmoid colectomy in a VR environment based on objective metrics in addition to expert consensus. Validity has been demonstrated for some key metrics.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Curriculum development", "Laparoscopic colorectal surgery", "Simulation", "Training", "Virtual reality"], "IndexKeywords": ["Clinical Competence", "Colectomy", "Computer Simulation", "Curriculum", "Education, Medical, Graduate", "Humans", "Laparoscopy", "Learning Curve", "Surgeons", "User-Computer Interface", "Virtual Reality"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85038405506", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"]], "AuthorData": {"34772340500": {"Name": "Wynn G.", "AuthorID": "34772340500", "AffiliationID": "119922516", "AffiliationName": "ICENI Centre for Minimally Invasive Surgery"}, "40361377000": {"Name": "Lykoudis P.", "AuthorID": "40361377000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Surgery & Interventional Science, Royal Free Campus, UCL"}, "56062402900": {"Name": "Berlingieri P.", "AuthorID": "56062402900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Surgery & Interventional Science, Royal Free Campus, UCL"}}}
