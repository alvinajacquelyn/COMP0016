We used cryo-electron microscopy to determine the 4.5-\u00c5 resolution structure of the motor domain of the fission yeast kinesin-5 Cut7 bound to fission yeast microtubules and explored the topology of the motor\u2013microtubule interface and the susceptibility of the complex to drug binding. Despite their non-canonical architecture and mechanochemistry, Schizosaccharomyces pombe microtubules were stabilized by epothilone at the taxane binding pocket. The overall Cut7 footprint on the S. pombe microtubule surface is altered compared to mammalian tubulin microtubules because of their different polymer architectures. However, the core motor\u2013microtubule interaction is tightly conserved, reflected in similar Cut7 ATPase activities on each microtubule type. AMPPNP-bound Cut7 adopts a kinesin-conserved ATP-like conformation including cover neck bundle formation. However, the Cut7 ATPase is not blocked by a mammalian-specific kinesin-5 inhibitor, consistent with the non-conserved sequence and structure of its loop5 insertion.", "AuthorKeywords": ["3D reconstruction", "Cut7", "cytoskeleton", "mitosis", "motor"], "IndexKeywords": ["Chromosome Segregation", "Cryoelectron Microscopy", "Drug Resistance", "Kinesin", "Microtubule-Associated Proteins", "Microtubules", "Mitosis", "Protein Binding", "Schizosaccharomyces", "Schizosaccharomyces pombe Proteins", "Spindle Apparatus", "Tubulin"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85060557367", "SubjectAreas": [["Structural Biology", "BIOC", "1315"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"]], "AuthorData": {"44462114700": {"Name": "von Loeffelholz O.", "AuthorID": "44462114700", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology"}, "57196472530": {"Name": "Pe\u00f1a A.", "AuthorID": "57196472530", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology"}, "6701857441": {"Name": "Moores C.A.", "AuthorID": "6701857441", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology"}, "36847214000": {"Name": "Drummond D.R.", "AuthorID": "36847214000", "AffiliationID": "60000064", "AffiliationName": "Division of Biomedical Cell Biology, Warwick Medical School"}, "7202235831": {"Name": "Cross R.", "AuthorID": "7202235831", "AffiliationID": "60000064", "AffiliationName": "Division of Biomedical Cell Biology, Warwick Medical School"}}}
