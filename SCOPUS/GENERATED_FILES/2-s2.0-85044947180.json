Though the case for transdisciplinary research in this space has been made, the extent of stakeholder engagement in research remains limited with stakeholders most commonly incorporated in research as end-users. Yet, stakeholders interact with nexus issues in a variety of ways, consequently there is much that collaboration might offer to develop nexus research and enhance its application. This paper outlines four aspects of nexus research and considers the value and potential challenges for transdisciplinary research in each. We focus on assessing and visualising nexus systems; understanding governance and capacity building; the importance of scale; and the implications of future change. The paper then proceeds to describe a novel mixed-method study that deeply integrates stakeholder knowledge with insights from multiple disciplines. We argue that mixed-method research designs\u2014in this case orientated around a number of cases studies\u2014are best suited to understanding and addressing real-world nexus challenges, with their inevitable complex, non-linear system characteristics. Moreover, integrating multiple forms of knowledge in the manner described in this paper enables research to assess the potential for, and processes of, scaling-up innovations in the nexus space, to contribute insights to policy and decision making.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Energy", "Mixed-method", "Nexus", "Transdisciplinary", "Water"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85044947180", "SubjectAreas": [["Global and Planetary Change", "ENVI", "2306"], ["Health (social science)", "SOCI", "3306"], ["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"], ["Ecology", "ENVI", "2303"], ["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"], ["Nature and Landscape Conservation", "ENVI", "2309"], ["Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law", "ENVI", "2308"]], "AuthorData": {"54911930500": {"Name": "Hoolohan C.", "AuthorID": "54911930500", "AffiliationID": "60003771, 60122652", "AffiliationName": "Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research, University of Manchester"}, "15838914300": {"Name": "Larkin A.", "AuthorID": "15838914300", "AffiliationID": "60003771, 60122652", "AffiliationName": "Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research, University of Manchester"}, "8615217600": {"Name": "McLachlan C.", "AuthorID": "8615217600", "AffiliationID": "60003771, 60122652", "AffiliationName": "Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research, University of Manchester"}, "8836811200": {"Name": "Falconer R.", "AuthorID": "8836811200", "AffiliationID": "60001903", "AffiliationName": "University of Abertay Dundee"}, "7005636201": {"Name": "Gilmour D.", "AuthorID": "7005636201", "AffiliationID": "60001903", "AffiliationName": "University of Abertay Dundee"}, "14424483600": {"Name": "Soutar I.", "AuthorID": "14424483600", "AffiliationID": "60026479", "AffiliationName": "University of Exeter"}, "7402386966": {"Name": "Mitchell C.", "AuthorID": "7402386966", "AffiliationID": "60026479", "AffiliationName": "University of Exeter"}, "9942380700": {"Name": "Suckling J.", "AuthorID": "9942380700", "AffiliationID": "60021097", "AffiliationName": "University of Surrey"}, "23034083500": {"Name": "Druckman A.", "AuthorID": "23034083500", "AffiliationID": "60021097", "AffiliationName": "University of Surrey"}, "15081806200": {"Name": "Varga L.", "AuthorID": "15081806200", "AffiliationID": "60004407", "AffiliationName": "Cranfield University"}, "26654849900": {"Name": "Haltas I.", "AuthorID": "26654849900", "AffiliationID": "60004407", "AffiliationName": "Cranfield University"}, "6506302137": {"Name": "Lumbroso D.", "AuthorID": "6506302137", "AffiliationID": "60025658", "AffiliationName": "HR Wallingford"}, "54782943400": {"Name": "Ledbetter R.", "AuthorID": "54782943400", "AffiliationID": "60025658", "AffiliationName": "HR Wallingford"}, "15721478400": {"Name": "Scott M.", "AuthorID": "15721478400", "AffiliationID": "60001490", "AffiliationName": "University of Glasgow"}, "55989827100": {"Name": "McGrane S.", "AuthorID": "55989827100", "AffiliationID": "60001490", "AffiliationName": "University of Glasgow"}, "57201462757": {"Name": "Yu D.", "AuthorID": "57201462757", "AffiliationID": "60000891", "AffiliationName": "Loughborough University"}}}
