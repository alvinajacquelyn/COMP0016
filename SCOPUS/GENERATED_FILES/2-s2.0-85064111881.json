Here we tested the hypothesis that M\u00fcller cells stabilize the neurovascular unit, microvasculature by suppression of HIF-1\u03b1 activation as a result of hypoxic preconditioning. Methods: Tube Formation Assay and In vitro Vascular Permeability Image Assay were used to analyze angiogenesis and vascular integrity. Seahorse XF Cell Mito Stress Test was used to measure mitochondrial respiration. Gene and protein expression were examined by qRT-PCR, ELISA and western blot. Results: Hypoxic insult induces a significant induction of proangiogenic factors including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and angiopoietin-like 4 (ANGPTL-4) resulting in angiogenesis and increased vascular permeability of vascular endothelial cells. Hypoxic preconditioning of a human retinal M\u00fcller glia cell line significantly attenuates HIF-1\u03b1 activation through the inhibition of mTOR and concomitant induction of aerobic glycolysis, stabilizing endothelial cells. Conclusion: Hypoxic preconditioning of M\u00fcller cells confers a robust protection to endothelial cells, through the suppression of HIF-1\u03b1 activation and its downstream regulation of VEGF and ANGPTL-4.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Angiogenesis", "Hypoxia", "Hypoxic preconditioning", "M\u00fcller cells", "Vascular permeability"], "IndexKeywords": ["Angiopoietin-like 4 Protein", "Cell Hypoxia", "Cell Line", "Cell Proliferation", "Cell Survival", "Culture Media, Conditioned", "Ependymoglial Cells", "Glycolysis", "Humans", "Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit", "Microvessels", "Mitochondria", "Neovascularization, Physiologic", "TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases", "Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85064111881", "SubjectAreas": [["Physiology", "BIOC", "1314"]], "AuthorData": {"57208208356": {"Name": "Ou K.", "AuthorID": "57208208356", "AffiliationID": "60171764, 60020650", "AffiliationName": "Academic Unit of Ophthalmology, Bristol Medical School, University of Bristol"}, "23480171400": {"Name": "Mertsch S.", "AuthorID": "23480171400", "AffiliationID": "60025310", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory for Experimental Ophthalmology, University of D\u00fcsseldorf"}, "22135923000": {"Name": "Schrader S.", "AuthorID": "22135923000", "AffiliationID": "60025310", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, University of D\u00fcsseldorf"}, "36673951300": {"Name": "Theodoropoulou S.", "AuthorID": "36673951300", "AffiliationID": "60171764, 60020650", "AffiliationName": "Academic Unit of Ophthalmology, Bristol Medical School, University of Bristol"}, "57221512831": {"Name": "Wu J.", "AuthorID": "57221512831", "AffiliationID": "60171764, 60020650", "AffiliationName": "Academic Unit of Ophthalmology, Bristol Medical School, University of Bristol"}, "54684258400": {"Name": "Liu J.", "AuthorID": "54684258400", "AffiliationID": "60171764, 60020650", "AffiliationName": "Academic Unit of Ophthalmology, Bristol Medical School, University of Bristol"}, "57197345814": {"Name": "Copland D.A.", "AuthorID": "57197345814", "AffiliationID": "60171764, 60020650", "AffiliationName": "Academic Unit of Ophthalmology, Bristol Medical School, University of Bristol"}, "57208211582": {"Name": "Scott L.M.", "AuthorID": "57208211582", "AffiliationID": "60171764, 60020650", "AffiliationName": "Academic Unit of Ophthalmology, Bristol Medical School, University of Bristol"}, "7103296976": {"Name": "Dick A.D.", "AuthorID": "7103296976", "AffiliationID": "60016691, 60022148, 60172638, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health Research (NIHR), Biomedical Research Centre, Moorfields Eye Hospital, University College London, Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "57208206383": {"Name": "Liu L.", "AuthorID": "57208206383", "AffiliationID": "60171764, 60020650", "AffiliationName": "Academic Unit of Ophthalmology, Bristol Medical School, University of Bristol"}}}
