It has often been noted that the Dirichlet assumption is approximate because positive correlations among alleles cannot be accommodated under the Dirichlet model. However, the validity of the Dirichlet distribution has never been systematically investigated in a general framework. This paper attempts to address this problem by providing a general overview of how allele fraction data under the most common multi-allelic mutational structures should be modeled. The Dirichlet and alternative models are investigated by simulating allele fractions from a diffusion approximation of the multi-allelic Wright\u2013Fisher process with mutation, and applying a moment-based analysis method. The study shows that the optimal modeling strategy for the distribution of allele fractions depends on the specific mutation process. The Dirichlet model is only an exceptionally good approximation for the pure drift, Jukes\u2013Cantor and parent-independent mutation processes with small mutation rates. Alternative models are required and proposed for the other mutation processes, such as a Beta\u2013Dirichlet model for the infinite alleles mutation process, and a Hierarchical Beta model for the Kimura, Hasegawa\u2013Kishino\u2013Yano and Tamura\u2013Nei processes. Finally, a novel Hierarchical Beta approximation is developed, a Pyramidal Hierarchical Beta model, for the generalized time-reversible and single-step mutation processes.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Allele fraction", "Beta\u2013Dirichlet", "Diffusion", "Dirichlet", "Distribution of allele fractions", "Evolutionary history", "Hierarchical Beta", "Moments", "Multi-allelic Wright\u2013Fisher", "Mutation processes", "Pyramid"], "IndexKeywords": ["Alleles", "Computer Simulation", "Data Analysis", "Datasets as Topic", "Genetics, Population", "Humans", "Models, Genetic", "Mutation Rate"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85061315952", "SubjectAreas": [["Modeling and Simulation", "MATH", "2611"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (miscellaneous)", "AGRI", "1101"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"57205727015": {"Name": "Speed M.S.", "AuthorID": "57205727015", "AffiliationID": "60023882", "AffiliationName": "Department of Affective Disorders, Aarhus University Hospital"}, "6602567701": {"Name": "Hobolth A.", "AuthorID": "6602567701", "AffiliationID": "60029616", "AffiliationName": "Bioinformatics Research Centre, Aarhus University"}, "7004169857": {"Name": "Balding D.J.", "AuthorID": "7004169857", "AffiliationID": "60118644, 60026553", "AffiliationName": "Melbourne Integrative Genomics, School of BioSciences and School of Mathematics & Statistics, University of Melbourne"}}}
