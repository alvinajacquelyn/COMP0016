Tau pathology correlates well with impaired neuronal activity and dementia. Focused ultrasound coupled with systemic administration of microbubbles has previously been shown to open the blood-brain barrier and induce an immune response, which, in an amyloid AD mouse model, resulted in the reduction of the amyloid brain load. Methods: In this study, we investigated the effect of focused ultrasound at the early stages of tau pathology (pre-tangle) in the rTg4510 mouse model. Results: Reduction of phosphorylated tau from the hippocampal formation processes, and particularly the pyramidal CA1 neurons, was noted in the ultrasound-treated brains without an associated increase in the phosphorylated tau-affected cell somas, typically associated with disease progression. Attenuation of the pathology was found to correlate well with the ultrasound-initiated immune response without compromising neuronal integrity. Unilateral ultrasound application resulted in a bilateral effect indicating a broader reduction of the phosphorylated tau. Conclusion: Findings presented herein reinforce the premise of ultrasound in reducing tau pathology and thus curbing the progression of Alzheimer\u2019s disease.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alzheimer\u2019s disease", "Blood-brain barrier opening", "Focused ultrasound", "Tau pathology"], "IndexKeywords": ["Alzheimer Disease", "Animals", "Blood-Brain Barrier", "Disease Models, Animal", "Hippocampus", "Mice, Transgenic", "Recombinant Proteins", "tau Proteins", "Treatment Outcome", "Ultrasonography"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85070332430", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (miscellaneous)", "MEDI", "2701"], ["Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics (miscellaneous)", "PHAR", "3001"]], "AuthorData": {"56414853100": {"Name": "Karakatsani M.E.", "AuthorID": "56414853100", "AffiliationID": "60030162", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University"}, "57192893539": {"Name": "Kugelman T.", "AuthorID": "57192893539", "AffiliationID": "60030162", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University"}, "57200088148": {"Name": "Ji R.", "AuthorID": "57200088148", "AffiliationID": "60030162", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University"}, "57210365908": {"Name": "Murillo M.", "AuthorID": "57210365908", "AffiliationID": "60030162", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University"}, "35747170400": {"Name": "Wang S.", "AuthorID": "35747170400", "AffiliationID": "60030162", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University"}, "57210365883": {"Name": "Niimi Y.", "AuthorID": "57210365883", "AffiliationID": "60030162", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University"}, "7005877325": {"Name": "Konofagou E.E.", "AuthorID": "7005877325", "AffiliationID": "60030162", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Columbia University"}, "7102189047": {"Name": "Small S.A.", "AuthorID": "7102189047", "AffiliationID": "60030162", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology and Pathology, Columbia University"}, "35393105600": {"Name": "Duff K.E.", "AuthorID": "35393105600", "AffiliationID": "60030162", "AffiliationName": "Department of Integrative Neuroscience, Columbia University"}}}
