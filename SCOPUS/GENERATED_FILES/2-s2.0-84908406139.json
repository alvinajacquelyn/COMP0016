All rights reserved.Understanding the interaction of organic molecules with TiO2 surfaces is important for a wide range of technological applications. While density functional theory (DFT) calculations can provide valuable insight about these interactions, traditional DFT approaches with local exchange-correlation functionals suffer from a poor description of non-bonding van der Waals (vdW) forces. We examine here the vdW contribution to the interaction of small organic molecules (methane, methanol, formic acid and glycine) with the TiO2(110) surface, based on DFT calculations with the optB88-vdW functional, which incorporate non-local correlation. The adsorption geometries and energies at different configurations were also obtained in the standard generalized gradient approximation (GGA-PBE) for comparison. We find that the optB88-vdW consistently gives shorter surface adsorbate-to-surface distances and slightly stronger interactions than PBE for the weak (physisorbed) modes of adsorption. In the case of strongly adsorbed (chemisorbed) molecules both functionals give similar results for the adsorption geometries, and also similar values of the relative energies between different chemisorption modes for each molecule. In particular both functionals predict that dissociative adsorption is more favorable than molecular adsorption for methanol, formic acid and glycine, in general agreement with experiment. The dissociation energies obtained from both functionals are also very similar, indicating that vdW interactions do not affect the thermodynamics of surface deprotonation. However, the optB88-vdW always predicts stronger adsorption than PBE. The comparison of the methanol adsorption energies with values obtained from a Redhead analysis of temperature programmed desorption data suggests that optB88-vdW significantly overestimates the adsorption strength, although we warn about the uncertainties involved in such comparisons.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Adsorption", "Density functional theory", "Dispersion", "Small organic molecules", "TiO2(110)", "van der Waals"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adsorption of organic molecules", "Exchange-correlation functionals", "Generalized gradient approximations", "Small organic molecules", "Technological applications", "TiO2(110)", "Van der waals", "Van Der Waals interactions"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84908406139", "SubjectAreas": [["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Surfaces and Interfaces", "PHYS", "3110"], ["Surfaces, Coatings and Films", "MATE", "2508"], ["Materials Chemistry", "MATE", "2505"]], "AuthorData": {"56400784100": {"Name": "Tillotson M.J.", "AuthorID": "56400784100", "AffiliationID": "60013985", "AffiliationName": "Biomaterials and Tissue Engineering, UCL Eastman Dental Institute"}, "7007011274": {"Name": "Brett P.M.", "AuthorID": "7007011274", "AffiliationID": "60013985", "AffiliationName": "Biomaterials and Tissue Engineering, UCL Eastman Dental Institute"}, "55426170700": {"Name": "Bennett R.A.", "AuthorID": "55426170700", "AffiliationID": "60012197", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Reading"}, "8093195100": {"Name": "Grau-Crespo R.", "AuthorID": "8093195100", "AffiliationID": "60012197", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Reading"}}}
