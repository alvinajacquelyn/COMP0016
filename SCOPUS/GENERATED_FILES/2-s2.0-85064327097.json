People classified as primary angle closure suspects have a higher but poorly quantified risk of developing glaucoma. We aimed to assess efficacy and safety of laser peripheral iridotomy prophylaxis against primary angle-closure glaucoma in Chinese people classified as primary angle closure suspects. Methods: In this randomised controlled trial, bilateral primary angle closure suspects aged 50\u201370 years were enrolled at the Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center, a tertiary specialised hospital in Guangzhou, China. Eligible patients received laser peripheral iridotomy in one randomly selected eye, with the other remaining untreated. The primary outcome was incident primary angle closure disease as a composite endpoint of elevation of intraocular pressure, peripheral anterior synechiae, or acute angle-closure during 72 months of follow-up in an intention-to-treat analysis between treated eyes and contralateral controls. This trial is registered with the ISRCTN registry, number ISRCTN45213099. Findings: Of 11 991 screened individuals, 889 individuals were randomly assigned from June 19, 2008 (889 treated and 889 untreated eyes). Incidence of the primary outcome was 4\u00b719 per 1000 eye-years in treated eyes compared with 7\u00b797 per 1000 eye-years in untreated eyes (hazard ratio 0\u00b753; 95% CI 0\u00b730\u20130\u00b792; p=0\u00b7024). A primary outcome event occurred in 19 treated eyes and 36 untreated eyes with a statistically significant difference using pair-wise analysis (p=0\u00b70041). No serious adverse events were observed during follow-up. Interpretation: Incidence of angle-closure disease was very low among individuals classified as primary angle closure suspects identified through community-based screening. Laser peripheral iridotomy had a modest, albeit significant, prophylactic effect. In view of the low incidence rate of outcomes that have no immediate threat to vision, the benefit of prophylactic laser peripheral iridotomy is limited; therefore, widespread prophylactic laser peripheral iridotomy for primary angle-closure suspects is not recommended.
