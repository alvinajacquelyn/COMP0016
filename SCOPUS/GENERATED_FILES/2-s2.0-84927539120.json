Following the Great Famine of 1845-1849, it is argued, Ireland was transformed from a young, growing country to one that, by the end of the 19th century, had become 'prematurely' old. By the end of Victoria's reign, not only had Ireland grown 'old', but its older population were more likely to be identified as paupers. Later-life expectancy decreased and sickness and infirmity among the over-60 s increased. By employing a stricter form of 'less eligibility' in the drafting and implementation of the Irish Poor Law, proportionately more older people received indoor relief than outdoor relief compared with the rest of the British Isles. Not until the Old Age Pensions Act in 1908 did these disparities begin to change, by which time many of these 'other' Victorians had passed away.", "AuthorKeywords": ["aged poor", "Ireland", "social policy", "workhouses"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84927539120", "SubjectAreas": [["Social Psychology", "PSYC", "3207"], ["Health (social science)", "SOCI", "3306"], ["Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)", "ARTS", "1201"], ["Geriatrics and Gerontology", "MEDI", "2717"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"7003724737": {"Name": "Gilleard C.", "AuthorID": "7003724737", "AffiliationID": "100360585", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, Faculty of Brain Sciences, Charles Bell House"}}}
