We included 54 functional MRI studies that explicitly varied the semantic or syntactic processing load, while holding constant demands on earlier stages of processing. We included studies that introduced a syntactic/semantic ambiguity or anomaly, used a priming manipulation that specifically reduced the load on semantic/syntactic processing, or varied the level of syntactic complexity. The results confirmed the critical role of the posterior left Inferior Frontal Gyrus (LIFG) in semantic and syntactic processing. These results challenge models of sentence comprehension highlighting the role of anterior LIFG for semantic processing. In addition, the results emphasise the posterior (but not anterior) temporal lobe for both semantic and syntactic processing.", "AuthorKeywords": ["FMRI", "Meta-analysis", "Methodology", "Neuroimaging", "Semantics", "Syntax"], "IndexKeywords": ["Brain", "Brain Mapping", "Comprehension", "Humans", "Likelihood Functions", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Reading", "Regression Analysis", "Semantics", "Writing"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84920896541", "SubjectAreas": [["Language and Linguistics", "ARTS", "1203"], ["Experimental and Cognitive Psychology", "PSYC", "3205"], ["Linguistics and Language", "SOCI", "3310"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"], ["Speech and Hearing", "HEAL", "3616"]], "AuthorData": {"6701635982": {"Name": "Rodd J.", "AuthorID": "6701635982", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cognitive, Perceptual and Brain Sciences, University College London"}, "56300704700": {"Name": "Vitello S.", "AuthorID": "56300704700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cognitive, Perceptual and Brain Sciences, University College London"}, "7801582665": {"Name": "Adank P.", "AuthorID": "7801582665", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychological Sciences, University of Manchester"}, "9243750200": {"Name": "Woollams A.", "AuthorID": "9243750200", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychological Sciences, University of Manchester"}}}
