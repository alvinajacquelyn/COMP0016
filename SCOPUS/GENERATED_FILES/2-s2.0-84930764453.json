Spatiotemporal hedonic pricing (HP) and stated choice (SC) results reflect nonlinearities and stigma. The HP models reveal nonlinear noise depreciation increasing from 0.40 to 2.38 percent per decibel as noise increases, while the SC noise values are lower in an area with high long-term noise exposure. These nonlinearities are attributed to the spatial sorting of noise tolerant individuals. HP results from the same \"noisy\" area show a \"stigma\" from noise during the first year after the complete removal of aviation noise.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84930764453", "SubjectAreas": [["Development", "SOCI", "3303"], ["Environmental Science (miscellaneous)", "ENVI", "2301"]], "AuthorData": {"37108696100": {"Name": "Thanos S.", "AuthorID": "37108696100", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Energy Epidemiology, UCL Energy Institute, University College London"}, "7006226667": {"Name": "Bristow A.L.", "AuthorID": "7006226667", "AffiliationID": "60000891", "AffiliationName": "School of Civil and Building Engineering, Loughborough University"}, "6603815016": {"Name": "Wardman M.R.", "AuthorID": "6603815016", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Transport Studies, University of Leeds"}}}
