In this proof-of-concept study, we present, for the first time, comprehensive quantification of all the constituents in a set of tablets consisting of 5 components (3 APIs and 2 excipients) by this method. The nominal concentration of individual components ranged from 1 to 85% (w/w).Two multivariate partial least-squares approaches have been used to calibrate concentration models consisting of 40 handmade tablets covering 20 sample points. These models successfully predicted all the components in a set of 10 validation tablets covering 5 different sample points. A single model for all components (PLS2) and 5 individual models each optimised for one component (PLS1) performed similarity and have been used to demonstrate that specificity of prediction has been achieved through using a multifactor orthogonal DoE for sample preparation.The ability to determine multiple analyte concentrations in one single measurement further establishes this procedure and its benefits for assay and content uniformity testing.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Pharmaceutical formulations", "Quality control", "Quantitative analysis", "Transmission Raman spectroscopy"], "IndexKeywords": ["Acetaminophen", "Caffeine", "Calibration", "Excipients", "Least-Squares Analysis", "Models, Theoretical", "Multivariate Analysis", "Phenylephrine", "Reproducibility of Results", "Spectrum Analysis, Raman", "Tablets"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84938869871", "SubjectAreas": [["Analytical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1602"], ["Pharmaceutical Science", "PHAR", "3003"], ["Drug Discovery", "PHAR", "3002"], ["Spectroscopy", "CHEM", "1607"], ["Clinical Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1308"]], "AuthorData": {"56786075900": {"Name": "Griffen J.", "AuthorID": "56786075900", "AffiliationID": "114071378", "AffiliationName": "Cobalt Light Systems Ltd"}, "56768949500": {"Name": "Owen A.", "AuthorID": "56768949500", "AffiliationID": "114071378", "AffiliationName": "Cobalt Light Systems Ltd"}, "7005659005": {"Name": "Matousek P.", "AuthorID": "7005659005", "AffiliationID": "60023254, 60009523", "AffiliationName": "Central Laser Facility, Research Complex at Harwell, STFC Rutherford Appleton Laboratory"}}}
