Modeling DS is beginning to yield pharmaceutical therapeutic interventions for amelioration of intellectual disability, which are currently being tested in clinical trials. DS is also a unique genetic system for investigation of pathological and protective mechanisms for accelerated ageing, neurodegeneration, dementia, cancer, and other important common diseases. New drugs could be identified and disease mechanisms better understood by establishment of well-controlled cell model systems. We have developed a first nonintegration-reprogrammed isogenic human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) model of DS by reprogramming the skin fibroblasts from an adult individual with constitutional mosaicism for DS and separately cloning multiple isogenic T21 and euploid (D21) iPSC lines. Our model shows a very low number of reprogramming rearrangements as assessed by a high-resolution whole genome CGH-array hybridization, and it reproduces several cellular pathologies seen in primary human DS cells, as assessed by automated high-content microscopic analysis. Early differentiation shows an imbalance of the lineage-specific stem/progenitor cell compartments: T21 causes slower proliferation of neural and faster expansion of hematopoietic lineage. T21 iPSC-derived neurons show increased production of amyloid peptide-containing material, a decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential, and an increased number and abnormal appearance of mitochondria. Finally, T21-derived neurons show significantly higher number of DNA double-strand breaks than isogenic D21 controls. Our fully isogenic system therefore opens possibilities for modeling mechanisms of developmental, accelerated ageing, and neurodegenerative pathologies caused by T21.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Down syndrome", "Neurodegeneration", "Neurogenesis", "Neuronal differentiation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aging", "Animals", "Cell Differentiation", "Cells, Cultured", "Down Syndrome", "Fibroblasts", "Humans", "Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells", "Mitochondria", "Neurons"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84929738623", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Medicine", "BIOC", "1313"], ["Developmental Biology", "BIOC", "1309"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"56368548400": {"Name": "Murray A.", "AuthorID": "56368548400", "AffiliationID": "60022106", "AffiliationName": "LonDownS Consortium, Wellcome Trust"}, "8763182100": {"Name": "Canzonetta C.", "AuthorID": "8763182100", "AffiliationID": "60021435", "AffiliationName": "Blizard Institute, Barts and the London School of Medicine, Blizard Building"}, "56655163800": {"Name": "Abrehart R.", "AuthorID": "56655163800", "AffiliationID": "60021435", "AffiliationName": "Blizard Institute, Barts and the London School of Medicine, Blizard Building"}, "56079423000": {"Name": "Goh P.", "AuthorID": "56079423000", "AffiliationID": "60022106", "AffiliationName": "LonDownS Consortium, Wellcome Trust"}, "12791613800": {"Name": "Bishop C.", "AuthorID": "12791613800", "AffiliationID": "60021435", "AffiliationName": "Blizard Institute, Barts and the London School of Medicine, Blizard Building"}, "7801476527": {"Name": "Groet J.", "AuthorID": "7801476527", "AffiliationID": "60022109", "AffiliationName": "Stem Cell Laboratory, National Centre for Bowel Research and Surgical Innovation, Queen Mary University of London"}, "7003483313": {"Name": "Nizetic D.", "AuthorID": "7003483313", "AffiliationID": "60005510, 60118633", "AffiliationName": "Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine, Nanyang Technological University Singapore, Proteos Building"}, "24450451000": {"Name": "Letourneau A.", "AuthorID": "24450451000", "AffiliationID": "60026405", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genetic Medicine and Development, University of Geneva Medical School"}, "36049009800": {"Name": "Antonarakis S.", "AuthorID": "36049009800", "AffiliationID": "60026405", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genetic Medicine and Development, University of Geneva Medical School"}, "37027226700": {"Name": "Stathaki E.", "AuthorID": "37027226700", "AffiliationID": "60004718", "AffiliationName": "Service of Genetic Medicine, University Geneva Hospitals"}, "25651477900": {"Name": "Gimelli S.", "AuthorID": "25651477900", "AffiliationID": "60004718", "AffiliationName": "Service of Genetic Medicine, University Geneva Hospitals"}, "6504076121": {"Name": "Sloan-Bena F.", "AuthorID": "6504076121", "AffiliationID": "60004718", "AffiliationName": "Service of Genetic Medicine, University Geneva Hospitals"}, "56654609800": {"Name": "Lim S.", "AuthorID": "56654609800", "AffiliationID": "60005510, 60118633", "AffiliationName": "Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine, Nanyang Technological University Singapore, Proteos Building"}, "20533361700": {"Name": "Baldo C.", "AuthorID": "20533361700", "AffiliationID": "60018618", "AffiliationName": "Human Genetics Laboratory, Galliera Hospital"}, "56902735100": {"Name": "Dagna-Bricarelli F.", "AuthorID": "56902735100", "AffiliationID": "115267852", "AffiliationName": "Liguria Department of Genetics"}, "56654984900": {"Name": "Hannan S.", "AuthorID": "56654984900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology, University College London"}, "7006427065": {"Name": "Mortensen M.", "AuthorID": "7006427065", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology, University College London"}, "7102576252": {"Name": "Smart T.", "AuthorID": "7102576252", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology, University College London"}, "56654868800": {"Name": "Ballard D.", "AuthorID": "56654868800", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Forensic and Analytical Science, King's College"}, "8951289500": {"Name": "Syndercombe Court D.", "AuthorID": "8951289500", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Forensic and Analytical Science, King's College"}, "6602401673": {"Name": "Fusaki N.", "AuthorID": "6602401673", "AffiliationID": "60015682", "AffiliationName": "Precursory Research for Embryonic Science and Technology, Japan Science and Technology Agency"}, "7403099551": {"Name": "Hasegawa M.", "AuthorID": "7403099551", "AffiliationID": "115267954", "AffiliationName": "DNAVEC Corporation"}}}
