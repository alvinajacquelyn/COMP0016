Using a Pavlovian-instrumental transfer (PIT) task, we compared the influence of affectively valenced stimuli on decision-making in depression and generalized anxiety disorder compared with healthy controls; and related this to the longitudinal course of the illness. Method A total of 40 subjects with a current DSM-IV-TR diagnosis of major depressive disorder, dysthymia, generalized anxiety disorder, or a combination thereof, and 40 matched healthy controls performed a PIT task that assesses how instrumental approach and withdrawal behaviours are influenced by appetitive and aversive Pavlovian conditioned stimuli (CSs). Patients were followed up after 4-6 months. Analyses focused on patients with depression alone (n = 25). Results In healthy controls, Pavlovian CSs exerted action-specific effects, with appetitive CSs boosting active approach and aversive CSs active withdrawal. This action-specificity was absent in currently depressed subjects. Greater action-specificity in patients was associated with better recovery over the follow-up period. Conclusions Depression is associated with an abnormal influence of emotional reactions on decision-making in a way that may predict recovery.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Decision-making", "emotional reactions", "major depressive disorder", "Pavlovian-instrumental transfer"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Anxiety Disorders", "Berlin", "Conditioning, Classical", "Cues", "Decision Making", "Depression", "Depressive Disorder, Major", "Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders", "Emotions", "Female", "Humans", "Linear Models", "Male", "Sensitivity and Specificity", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84957605998", "SubjectAreas": [["Applied Psychology", "PSYC", "3202"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"14056255700": {"Name": "Huys Q.J.M.", "AuthorID": "14056255700", "AffiliationID": "60012614", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Addictive Disorders, Department of Psychiatry, Psychotherapy and Psychosomatics, Hospital of Psychiatry Z\u00fcrich, University of Z\u00fcrich"}, "55027467100": {"Name": "Dolan R.J.", "AuthorID": "55027467100", "AffiliationID": "60000762", "AffiliationName": "Berlin School of Mind and Brain, Humboldt-Universit\u00e4t zu Berlin"}, "7006914663": {"Name": "Dayan P.", "AuthorID": "7006914663", "AffiliationID": "60084280, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit, University College London"}, "39660985200": {"Name": "G\u00f6lzer M.", "AuthorID": "39660985200", "AffiliationID": "60026245", "AffiliationName": "Charit\u00e9 Universit\u00e4tsmedizin Berlin, Campus Charit\u00e9 Mitte"}, "55884238500": {"Name": "Friedel E.", "AuthorID": "55884238500", "AffiliationID": "60026245", "AffiliationName": "Charit\u00e9 Universit\u00e4tsmedizin Berlin, Campus Charit\u00e9 Mitte"}, "57201513357": {"Name": "Heinz A.", "AuthorID": "57201513357", "AffiliationID": "60026245", "AffiliationName": "Charit\u00e9 Universit\u00e4tsmedizin Berlin, Campus Charit\u00e9 Mitte"}, "7003766203": {"Name": "Cools R.", "AuthorID": "7003766203", "AffiliationID": "60002573", "AffiliationName": "Radboud University Medical Center, Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour, Centre for Cognitive Neuroimaging"}}}
