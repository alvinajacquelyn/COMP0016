The definition of \u2018caste\u2019 has been debated over the last 50 years, specifically with respect to the simplest insect societies; this raises the question of whether a simple categorisation of social behaviour by reproductive state alone is helpful. Gene-level analyses of behaviours of individuals in hymenopteran social insect societies now provide a new empirical base-line for defining caste and understanding the evolution and maintenance of a reproductive division of labour. We review this literature to identify a set of potential molecular signatures that, combined with behavioural, morphological and physiological data, help define caste more precisely; these signatures vary with the type of society, and are likely to be influenced by ecology, life-history, and stage in the colony cycle. We conclude that genomic approaches provide us with additional ways to help quantify and categorise caste, and behaviour in general.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Behavior, Animal", "Female", "Gene Expression", "Hymenoptera", "Phenotype", "Reproduction", "Social Behavior"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85036622715", "SubjectAreas": [["Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics", "AGRI", "1105"], ["Insect Science", "AGRI", "1109"]], "AuthorData": {"7005759495": {"Name": "Sumner S.", "AuthorID": "7005759495", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Biodiversity and Environmental Research, Medawar Building, University College London"}, "56583480600": {"Name": "Bell E.", "AuthorID": "56583480600", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "School of Biological Sciences, Bristol Life Sciences Building, University of Bristol"}, "57195579711": {"Name": "Taylor D.", "AuthorID": "57195579711", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "School of Biological Sciences, Bristol Life Sciences Building, University of Bristol"}}}
