The CREST scheme, a student-run science project managed by the British Science Association, is currently being implemented in schools across the UK to increase student engagement and motivation in science. Through implementing a rigorous quasi-experimental research design using two intervention conditions and one control group with immediate as well as 3-month delayed post-test data, the results documented both the immediate and longer-term positive impact of CREST participation on students\u2019 self-reported levels of self-regulation. The present study also investigates changes in teachers\u2019 perceptions of students\u2019 self-regulated learning through CREST programme participation. Group differences regarding changes in student self-reported self-regulation were not matched when looking at the teacher-reported self-regulated learning results at both immediate post-test and delayed post-test. These discrepancies are discussed in relation to analyses conducted on the other motivational constructs measured.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Inquiry", "Motivation", "Science", "Self-regulation", "Teacher perceptions"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85021836707", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"]], "AuthorData": {"57190948899": {"Name": "Moote J.", "AuthorID": "57190948899", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "Department of Education, Practice and Society, UCL Institute of Education"}}}
