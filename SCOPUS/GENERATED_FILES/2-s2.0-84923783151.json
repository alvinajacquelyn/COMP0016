We therefore studied the association between tinned fruit consumption and mortality. We followed up participants from three prospective cohorts in the United Kingdom: 22,421 participants from the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)-Norfolk cohort (1993- 2012), 52,625 participants from the EPIC-Oxford cohort (1993-2012), and 7440 participants from the Whitehall II cohort (1991-2012), all reporting no history of heart attack, stroke, or cancer when entering these studies. We estimated the association between frequency of tinned fruit consumption and all cause mortality (primary outcome measure) using Cox regression models within each cohort, and pooled hazard ratios across cohorts using random-effects meta-analysis. Tinned fruit consumption was assessed with validated food frequency questionnaires including specific questions about tinned fruit. During 1,305,330 person years of follow-up, 8857 deaths occurred. After adjustment for lifestyle factors and risk markers the pooled hazard ratios (95% confidence interval) of all cause mortality compared with the reference group of tinned fruit consumption less often than one serving per month were: 1.05 (0.99, 1.12) for one to three servings per month, 1.10 (1.03, 1.18) for one serving per week, and 1.13 (1.04, 1.23) for two or more servings per week. Analysis of cause-specific mortality showed that tinned fruit consumption was associated with mortality from cardiovascular causes and from non-cardiovascular, non-cancer causes. In a pooled analysis of three prospective cohorts from the United Kingdom self-reported tinned fruit consumption in the 1990s was weakly but positively associated with mortality during long-term follow-up. These findings raise questions about the evidence underlying dietary recommendations to promote tinned fruit consumption as part of a healthy diet.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Cause of Death", "Diet", "Feeding Behavior", "Female", "Food, Preserved", "Fruit", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Mortality", "Proportional Hazards Models", "Prospective Studies", "Public Health Surveillance", "Risk Factors", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "United Kingdom", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84923783151", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"15759315200": {"Name": "Aasheim E.T.", "AuthorID": "15759315200", "AffiliationID": "60031101, 60009969", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council Epidemiology Unit, University of Cambridge"}, "24367076500": {"Name": "Sharp S.J.", "AuthorID": "24367076500", "AffiliationID": "60031101, 60009969", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council Epidemiology Unit, University of Cambridge"}, "34668706300": {"Name": "Wareham N.J.", "AuthorID": "34668706300", "AffiliationID": "60031101, 60009969", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council Epidemiology Unit, University of Cambridge"}, "7006332366": {"Name": "Appleby P.N.", "AuthorID": "7006332366", "AffiliationID": "60002634", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Epidemiology Unit, Nuffield Department of Population Health, University of Oxford"}, "7102740999": {"Name": "Key T.J.", "AuthorID": "7102740999", "AffiliationID": "60002634", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Epidemiology Unit, Nuffield Department of Population Health, University of Oxford"}, "7103265845": {"Name": "Shipley M.J.", "AuthorID": "7103265845", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Department of Epidemiology and Public Health"}, "24576354300": {"Name": "Brunner E.", "AuthorID": "24576354300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Department of Epidemiology and Public Health"}, "35261917400": {"Name": "Lentjes M.A.H.", "AuthorID": "35261917400", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Public Health and Primary Care, University of Cambridge"}, "57202570778": {"Name": "Khaw K.T.", "AuthorID": "57202570778", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Public Health and Primary Care, University of Cambridge"}}}
