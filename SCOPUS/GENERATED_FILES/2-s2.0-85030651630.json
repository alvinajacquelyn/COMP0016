A classical integral sliding mode control scheme and a nonparallel distributed compensation (Non-PDC) integral sliding mode control scheme are presented. It is shown that two restrictive assumptions previously adopted developing sliding mode controllers for Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy stochastic systems are not required with the proposed framework. A unified framework for sliding mode control of T-S fuzzy systems is formulated. The proposed Non-PDC integral sliding mode control scheme encompasses existing schemes when the previously imposed assumptions hold. Stability of the sliding motion is analyzed and the sliding mode controller is parameterized in terms of the solutions of a set of linear matrix inequalities which facilitates design. The methodology is applied to an inverted pendulum model to validate the effectiveness of the results presented.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Integral sliding mode control", "inverted pendulum", "nonparallel distributed compensation (Non-PDC)", "robust stabilization", "Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy stochastic descriptor systems"], "IndexKeywords": ["Descriptor systems", "Integral sliding mode control", "Inverted pendulum", "non-PDC", "Robust stabilization", "Symmetric matrices"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85030651630", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Control and Systems Engineering", "ENGI", "2207"], ["Information Systems", "COMP", "1710"], ["Human-Computer Interaction", "COMP", "1709"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"55367209000": {"Name": "Li J.", "AuthorID": "55367209000", "AffiliationID": "60119041, 60031863", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Systems Science, State Key Laboratory of Synthetical Automation for Process Industries, Northeastern University"}, "7406719568": {"Name": "Zhang Q.", "AuthorID": "7406719568", "AffiliationID": "60119041, 60031863", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Systems Science, State Key Laboratory of Synthetical Automation for Process Industries, Northeastern University"}, "7403595938": {"Name": "Yan X.G.", "AuthorID": "7403595938", "AffiliationID": "60010818", "AffiliationName": "Instrumentation, Control and Embedded Systems Research Group, School of Engineering and Digital Arts, University of Kent"}, "7005642573": {"Name": "Spurgeon S.K.", "AuthorID": "7005642573", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}}}
