This is primarily due to short instrumental records and a lack of long high-resolution palaeoclimate proxy records. Here we present an annually resolved 91,000 year Early Pleistocene record of hydroclimate from the early homininbearing Makapansgat Valley, South Africa. Changes in speleothem annual band thickness are dominated by precession over four consecutive orbital cycles with strong millennial-scale periodicity. The frequency of interannual variability (2.0-6.5 yr oscillations) does not change systematically, yet its amplitude is modulated by the orbital forcing. These long-term characteristics of interannual variability are reproduced with transient climate model simulations of water balance for South Africa from the Late Pleistocene to Recent. Based on these results, we suggest that the frequency of interannual variations in southern African rainfall is likely to be stable under anthropogenic warming, but that the size of year-to-year variations may increase. We see an orbitally forced increase in the amplitude of interannual climate variability between 1.8 Ma and 1.7 Ma coincident with the first evidence for the Acheulean stone tool technology.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Anthropogenic warming", "Climate model simulations", "Future climate projections", "Interannual climate variability", "Interannual rainfall", "Interannual variability", "Interannual variation", "Orbital precession"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85050466297", "SubjectAreas": [["Geology", "EART", "1907"]], "AuthorData": {"12902641800": {"Name": "Hopley P.J.", "AuthorID": "12902641800", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences, Birkbeck, University of London"}, "7004024532": {"Name": "Weedon G.P.", "AuthorID": "7004024532", "AffiliationID": "60018258", "AffiliationName": "Met Office"}, "25635521800": {"Name": "Brierley C.M.", "AuthorID": "25635521800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Environmental Change Research Centre, Department of Geography, University College London"}, "6602690023": {"Name": "Thrasivoulou C.", "AuthorID": "6602690023", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University College London"}, "6507251186": {"Name": "Herries A.I.R.", "AuthorID": "6507251186", "AffiliationID": "60000717", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Anthropological Research, University of Johannesburg"}, "57203095487": {"Name": "Dinckal A.", "AuthorID": "57203095487", "AffiliationID": "60006925", "AffiliationName": "Department of Archaeology and History, LaTrobe University"}, "35088657700": {"Name": "Richards D.A.", "AuthorID": "35088657700", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "School of Geographical Sciences, University of Bristol"}, "54405165200": {"Name": "Nita D.C.", "AuthorID": "54405165200", "AffiliationID": "60024417", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Environmental Science and Engineering, Babe\u015f-Bolyai University"}, "7102184603": {"Name": "Parrish R.R.", "AuthorID": "7102184603", "AffiliationID": "60022706, 60007317", "AffiliationName": "NERC Isotope Geoscience Laboratory, British Geological Survey"}, "7202129803": {"Name": "Roberts N.M.W.", "AuthorID": "7202129803", "AffiliationID": "60022706, 60007317", "AffiliationName": "NERC Isotope Geoscience Laboratory, British Geological Survey"}, "35790583000": {"Name": "Sahy D.", "AuthorID": "35790583000", "AffiliationID": "60022706, 60007317", "AffiliationName": "NERC Isotope Geoscience Laboratory, British Geological Survey"}, "36926330100": {"Name": "Smith C.L.", "AuthorID": "36926330100", "AffiliationID": "60033125", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography, University of Leicester"}}}
