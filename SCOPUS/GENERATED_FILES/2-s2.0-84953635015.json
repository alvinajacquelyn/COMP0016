Previously we demonstrated that interneurons from Robo1 knockout (Robo1-/-) mice contain reduced levels of neuropilin 1 (Nrp1) and PlexinA1 receptors, rendering them less responsive to the chemorepulsive actions of semaphorin ligands expressed in the striatum and affecting their course of migration (Hernandez-Miranda et al. [2011] J. Neurosci. 31:6174-6187). Earlier studies have highlighted the importance of Nrp1 and Nrp2 in interneuron migration, and here we assess the role of PlexinA1 in this process. We observed significantly fewer cells expressing the interneuron markers Gad67 and Lhx6 in the cortex of PlexinA1-/- mice compared with wild-type littermates at E14.5 and E18.5. Although the level of apoptosis was similar in the mutant and control forebrain, proliferation was significantly reduced in the former. Furthermore, progenitor cells in the MGE of PlexinA1-/- mice appeared to be poorly anchored to the ventricular surface and showed reduced adhesive properties, which may account for the observed reduction in proliferation. Together our data uncover a novel role for PlexinA1 in forebrain development.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Forebrain", "Interneurons", "Neuronal migration", "Plexin", "Proliferation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Apoptosis", "Cell Adhesion", "Cell Movement", "Cell Proliferation", "Cells, Cultured", "Cerebral Cortex", "Glutamate Decarboxylase", "Green Fluorescent Proteins", "Immunohistochemistry", "In Situ Hybridization", "Interneurons", "LIM-Homeodomain Proteins", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Mice, Knockout", "Nerve Tissue Proteins", "Neural Stem Cells", "Neurogenesis", "Receptors, Cell Surface", "Transcription Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84953635015", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"]], "AuthorData": {"35197934600": {"Name": "Andrews W.D.", "AuthorID": "35197934600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University College London"}, "7006265542": {"Name": "Parnavelas J.G.", "AuthorID": "7006265542", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University College London"}, "56704478300": {"Name": "Davidson K.", "AuthorID": "56704478300", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Visual Science and Molecular Genetics, Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}, "6602149137": {"Name": "Ruhrberg C.", "AuthorID": "6602149137", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Visual Science and Molecular Genetics, Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}, "7004244773": {"Name": "Tamamaki N.", "AuthorID": "7004244773", "AffiliationID": "60162105, 60021120", "AffiliationName": "Department of Morphological Neural Science, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kumamoto University"}}}
