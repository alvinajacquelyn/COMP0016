Neurosurgery to remove or disconnect the seizure focus is often curative but frequently contraindicated by risks of irreversible impairment to brain function. Novel therapies are therefore required that better balance seizure suppression against the risks of side effects. Among experimental gene therapies, chemogenetics has the major advantage that the action on the epileptogenic zone can be modulated on demand. Two broad approaches are to use a designer G-protein-coupled receptor or a modified ligand gated ion channel, targeted to specific neurons in the epileptogenic zone using viral vectors and cell-type selective promoters. The receptor can be activated on demand by either an exogenous compound or by pathological levels of extracellular glutamate that occur in epileptogenic tissue. We review the principal designer receptor technologies and their modes of action. We compare the drawbacks and benefits of each designer receptor with particular focus on the drug activators and the potential for clinical translation in epilepsy.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Chemogenetics", "Designer receptor", "DREADD", "GluCl", "hM4D(Gi)", "PSAM"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Drug Design", "Epilepsy", "Humans", "Ion Channel Gating", "Ligands", "Molecular Targeted Therapy", "Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship", "Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85065255347", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"37034425400": {"Name": "Lieb A.", "AuthorID": "37034425400", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Experimental Epilepsy, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "57208422625": {"Name": "Weston M.", "AuthorID": "57208422625", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Experimental Epilepsy, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "7006451604": {"Name": "Kullmann D.M.", "AuthorID": "7006451604", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Experimental Epilepsy, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology, University College London"}}}
