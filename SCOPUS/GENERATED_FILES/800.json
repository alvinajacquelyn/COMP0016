We evaluate the additional lifetime healthcare cost incurred due to living with HIV. Methods: We used a stochastic computer simulation model to project the distribution of lifetime outcomes and costs of men-who-have-sex-with-men (MSM) infected with HIV in 2013 aged 30, over 10,000 simulations. We assumed a resource-rich setting with no loss to follow-up, and that standards and costs of healthcare management remain as now. Results: Based on a median (interquartile range) life expectancy of 71.5 (45.0-81.5) years for MSM in such a setting, the estimated mean lifetime cost of treating one person was \u00a3360,800 ($567,000 or \u20ac480,000). With 3.5% discounting, it was \u00a3185,200 ($291,000 or \u20ac246,000). The largest proportion (68%) of these costs was attributed to antiretroviral drugs. If patented drugs are replaced by generic versions (at 20% cost of patented prices), estimated mean lifetime costs reduced to \u00a3179,000 ($281,000 or \u20ac238,000) and \u00a3101,200 ($158,900 or \u20ac134,600) discounted. Conclusions: If 3,000 MSM had been infected in 2013, then future lifetime costs relating to HIV care is likely to be in excess of \u00a31 billion. It is imperative for investment into prevention programmes to be continued or scaled-up in settings with good access to HIV care services. Costs would be reduced considerably with use of generic antiretroviral drugs.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Antiretroviral Therapy, Highly Active", "Drugs, Generic", "Health Care Costs", "HIV Infections", "Humans", "Models, Economic", "Patents as Topic"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84930627632", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"54385574100": {"Name": "Nakagawa F.", "AuthorID": "54385574100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Infection and Population Health, UCL"}, "7501658889": {"Name": "Smith C.", "AuthorID": "7501658889", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Infection and Population Health, UCL"}, "35361474300": {"Name": "Cambiano V.", "AuthorID": "35361474300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Infection and Population Health, UCL"}, "35372648800": {"Name": "Phillips A.", "AuthorID": "35372648800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Infection and Population Health, UCL"}, "57203479433": {"Name": "Miners A.", "AuthorID": "57203479433", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Health Services Research and Policy, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "35171543400": {"Name": "Simmons R.", "AuthorID": "35171543400", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "HIV and STI Department, Public Health England"}, "10440140300": {"Name": "Delpech V.", "AuthorID": "10440140300", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "HIV and STI Department, Public Health England"}, "6603001447": {"Name": "Lodwick R.", "AuthorID": "6603001447", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Primary Care and Population Health, UCL"}, "35307337700": {"Name": "Lundgren J.", "AuthorID": "35307337700", "AffiliationID": "60030840", "AffiliationName": "Copenhagen HIV Programme (CHIP), Department of Infectious Diseases (8632), University of Copenhagen"}}}
