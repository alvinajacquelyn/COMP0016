However, there is now greater recognition of fertility being an important issue for this group of patients. Currently, gonadal tissue that may have fertility potential is not being stored for individuals with DSD and, where gonadectomy forms part of management, is often discarded. The area of fertility preservation has been predominantly driven by oncofertility which is a field dedicated to preserving the fertility of patients undergoing gonadotoxic cancer treatment. The use of fertility preservation techniques could be expanded to include individuals with DSD where functioning gonads are present. Methods: This is a systematic literature review evaluating original research articles and relevant reviews between 1974 and 2018 addressing DSD and fertility, in vitro maturation of sperm, and histological/ultrastructural assessment of gonadal tissue in complete and partial androgen insensitivity syndrome, 17\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 3 and 5\u03b1-reductase deficiency. Conclusion: Successful clinical outcomes of ovarian tissue cryopreservation are paving the way for similar research being conducted using testicular tissue and sperm. There have been promising results from both animal and human studies leading to cryopreservation of testicular tissue now being offered to boys prior to cancer treatment. Although data are limited, there is evidence to suggest the presence of reproductive potential in the gonads of some individuals with DSD. Larger, more detailed studies are required, but if these continue to be encouraging, individuals with DSD should be given the same information, opportunities and access to fertility preservation as other patient groups.", "AuthorKeywords": ["androgen insensitivity syndrome", "androgen synthesis defects", "differences in sex development", "fertility preservation", "in vitro maturation", "spermatogonial cells", "testicular tissue cryopreservation"], "IndexKeywords": ["3-Oxo-5-alpha-Steroid 4-Dehydrogenase", "Cryopreservation", "Disorder of Sex Development, 46,XY", "Disorders of Sex Development", "Female", "Fertility Preservation", "Humans", "Hypospadias", "Male", "Ovary", "Reproduction", "Spermatozoa", "Steroid Metabolism, Inborn Errors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85065420795", "SubjectAreas": [["Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism", "MEDI", "2712"], ["Endocrinology", "BIOC", "1310"]], "AuthorData": {"57209132402": {"Name": "Islam R.", "AuthorID": "57209132402", "AffiliationID": "60008323, 60170323", "AffiliationName": "Department of Reproductive Medicine, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford University Hospitals"}, "8885113300": {"Name": "Lane S.", "AuthorID": "8885113300", "AffiliationID": "60008323, 60170323", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Oncology and Haematology, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford University Hospitals"}, "7404835595": {"Name": "Williams S.A.", "AuthorID": "7404835595", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851, 60008323", "AffiliationName": "Nuffield Department of Women\u2019s and Reproductive Health, Women\u2019s Centre, John Radcliffe Hospital, University of Oxford"}, "7402823446": {"Name": "Becker C.M.", "AuthorID": "7402823446", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60008323, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Nuffield Department of Women\u2019s and Reproductive Health, Oxford Endometriosis CaRe Centre, Women\u2019s Centre, John Radcliffe Hospital University of Oxford"}, "35475924300": {"Name": "Conway G.S.", "AuthorID": "35475924300", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Endocrinology, University College London Hospitals"}, "7006425955": {"Name": "Creighton S.M.", "AuthorID": "7006425955", "AffiliationID": "60024544, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Elizabeth Garrett Anderson UCL Institute of Women\u2019s Health, University College London Hospitals"}}}
