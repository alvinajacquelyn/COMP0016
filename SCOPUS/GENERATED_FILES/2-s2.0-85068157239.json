Treatment with recombinant human growth hormone (GH) promotes longitudinal growth and likely enables children with CKD and short stature to reach normal adult height. Here, members of the European Society for Paediatric Nephrology (ESPN) CKD\u2013Mineral and Bone Disorder (MBD), Dialysis and Transplantation working groups present clinical practice recommendations for the use of GH in children with CKD on dialysis and after renal transplantation. These recommendations have been developed with input from an external advisory group of paediatric endocrinologists, paediatric nephrologists and patient representatives. We recommend that children with stage 3\u20135 CKD or on dialysis should be candidates for GH therapy if they have persistent growth failure, defined as a height below the third percentile for age and sex and a height velocity below the twenty-fifth percentile, once other potentially treatable risk factors for growth failure have been adequately addressed and provided the child has growth potential. In children who have received a kidney transplant and fulfil the above growth criteria, we recommend initiation of GH therapy 1 year after transplantation if spontaneous catch-up growth does not occur and steroid-free immunosuppression is not a feasible option. GH should be given at dosages of 0.045\u20130.05 mg/kg per day by daily subcutaneous injections until the patient has reached their final height or until renal transplantation. In addition to providing treatment recommendations, a cost-effectiveness analysis is provided that might help guide decision-making.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85068157239", "SubjectAreas": [["Nephrology", "MEDI", "2727"]], "AuthorData": {"23003834900": {"Name": "Drube J.", "AuthorID": "23003834900", "AffiliationID": "60024052", "AffiliationName": "Center for Congenital Kidney Diseases, Center for Rare Diseases, Hannover Medical School"}, "7005877632": {"Name": "Haffner D.", "AuthorID": "7005877632", "AffiliationID": "60024052", "AffiliationName": "Center for Congenital Kidney Diseases, Center for Rare Diseases, Hannover Medical School"}, "55814329600": {"Name": "Wan M.", "AuthorID": "55814329600", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Renal Unit, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children"}, "22956754100": {"Name": "Shroff R.", "AuthorID": "22956754100", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Renal Unit, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children"}, "36130877600": {"Name": "Bonthuis M.", "AuthorID": "36130877600", "AffiliationID": "60002483, 60001157", "AffiliationName": "ESPN/ERA-EDTA Registry, Department of Medical Informatics, Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam"}, "34879883900": {"Name": "Harambat J.", "AuthorID": "34879883900", "AffiliationID": "60021564", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatrics, Pediatric Nephrology Unit, Bordeaux University Hospital"}, "7004871436": {"Name": "W\u00fchl E.", "AuthorID": "7004871436", "AffiliationID": "60003280", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatrics I, University Children\u2019s Hospital"}, "7005057465": {"Name": "T\u00f6nshoff B.", "AuthorID": "7005057465", "AffiliationID": "60003280", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatrics I, University Children\u2019s Hospital"}, "23491355700": {"Name": "Bacchetta J.", "AuthorID": "23491355700", "AffiliationID": "100597593", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatric Nephrology, Rheumatology and Dermatology, University Children\u2019s Hospital"}, "7202141204": {"Name": "Santos F.", "AuthorID": "7202141204", "AffiliationID": "60016862", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatrics, Hospital Universitario Central de Asturias (HUCA), Health Service of the Principality of Asturias, SESPA"}, "13606275800": {"Name": "Grenda R.", "AuthorID": "13606275800", "AffiliationID": "60087496", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nephrology, Kidney Transplantation and Arterial Hypertension, The Children\u2019s Memorial Health Institute"}, "7005490471": {"Name": "Edefonti A.", "AuthorID": "7005490471", "AffiliationID": "60007067", "AffiliationName": "Fondazione IRCCS Ca\u2019 Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico"}, "null": {"Name": null, "AuthorID": null, "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
