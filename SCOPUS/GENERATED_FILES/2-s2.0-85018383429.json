KGaA, WeinheimTo quantify and characterize the potentially toxic protein aggregates associated with neurodegenerative diseases, a high-throughput assay based on measuring the extent of aggregate-induced Ca2+ entry into individual lipid vesicles has been developed. This approach was implemented by tethering vesicles containing a Ca2+ sensitive fluorescent dye to a passivated surface and measuring changes in the fluorescence as a result of membrane disruption using total internal reflection microscopy. Picomolar concentrations of A\u03b242 oligomers could be observed to induce Ca2+ influx, which could be inhibited by the addition of a naturally occurring chaperone and a nanobody designed to bind to the A\u03b2 peptide. We show that the assay can be used to study aggregates from other proteins, such as \u03b1-synuclein, and to probe the effects of complex biofluids, such as cerebrospinal fluid, and thus has wide applicability.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alzheimer's disease", "fluorescence imaging", "nano-scale biophysics", "neurodegeneration", "protein aggregation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Alzheimer's disease", "High-throughput assays", "Membrane disruption", "Nano scale", "Neurodegeneration", "Protein aggregation", "Total internal reflection microscopy", "Ultrasensitive measurement", "Alzheimer Disease", "Amyloid beta-Peptides", "Calcium", "Clusterin", "Fluorescent Dyes", "Humans", "Kinetics", "Lipid Bilayers", "Optical Imaging", "Protein Aggregates", "Protein Binding", "Single-Domain Antibodies"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85018383429", "SubjectAreas": [["Catalysis", "CENG", "1503"], ["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"]], "AuthorData": {"56495561900": {"Name": "Flagmeier P.", "AuthorID": "56495561900", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge"}, "41561224100": {"Name": "De S.", "AuthorID": "41561224100", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge"}, "57190954856": {"Name": "Wirthensohn D.C.", "AuthorID": "57190954856", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge"}, "56965835700": {"Name": "Lee S.F.", "AuthorID": "56965835700", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge"}, "14012356200": {"Name": "Knowles T.P.J.", "AuthorID": "14012356200", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge"}, "56623994700": {"Name": "Dobson C.M.", "AuthorID": "56623994700", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge"}, "7004374922": {"Name": "Klenerman D.", "AuthorID": "7004374922", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge"}, "8622097100": {"Name": "Vincke C.", "AuthorID": "8622097100", "AffiliationID": "60026810", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Cellular and Molecular Immunology, Vrije Universiteit Brussel"}, "7005810441": {"Name": "Muyldermans S.", "AuthorID": "7005810441", "AffiliationID": "60026810", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Cellular and Molecular Immunology, Vrije Universiteit Brussel"}, "9739583500": {"Name": "Gandhi S.", "AuthorID": "9739583500", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}}}
