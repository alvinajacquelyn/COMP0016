The engineered magnetic polymeric nanocapsules m-NCs are ~200 nm in size with negative Zeta potential and shown to be spherical in shape. The loading efficiency of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles in the m-NC was ~100%. Up to ~3- and ~2.2-fold increase in tumour uptake at 1 and 24 h was achieved, when a static magnetic field was applied to the tumour for 1 hour. m-NCs, with multiple imaging probes (e.g. indocyanine green, superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles and indium-111), were capable of triple-modal imaging (fluorescence/magnetic resonance/nuclear imaging) in vivo. Using triple-modal imaging is to overcome the intrinsic limitations of single modality imaging and provides complementary information on the spatial distribution of the nanocarrier within the tumour. The significant findings of this study could open up new research perspectives in using novel magnetically-responsive nanomaterials in magnetic-drug targeting combined with multi-modal imaging.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Magnetic resonance imaging", "Magnetic targeting", "Nuclear imaging", "Optical imaging", "PEGylated PLGA"], "IndexKeywords": ["Administration, Intravenous", "Animals", "Disease Models, Animal", "Female", "Ferric Compounds", "Magnetics", "Mice, Inbred BALB C", "Multimodal Imaging", "Nanocapsules", "Neoplasms"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84969752803", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (miscellaneous)", "MEDI", "2701"], ["Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics (miscellaneous)", "PHAR", "3001"]], "AuthorData": {"56714522800": {"Name": "Bai J.", "AuthorID": "56714522800", "AffiliationID": "60177635", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Pharmaceutical Science, Faculty of Life Sciences and Medicine, King's College London"}, "57208676106": {"Name": "Wang J.T.W.", "AuthorID": "57208676106", "AffiliationID": "60177635", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Pharmaceutical Science, Faculty of Life Sciences and Medicine, King's College London"}, "36763483900": {"Name": "Rubio N.", "AuthorID": "36763483900", "AffiliationID": "60177635", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Pharmaceutical Science, Faculty of Life Sciences and Medicine, King's College London"}, "57200641345": {"Name": "Al-Jamal K.T.", "AuthorID": "57200641345", "AffiliationID": "60177635", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Pharmaceutical Science, Faculty of Life Sciences and Medicine, King's College London"}, "25930563600": {"Name": "Protti A.", "AuthorID": "25930563600", "AffiliationID": "60011520, 60100024", "AffiliationName": "Cardiovascular Division, James Black Centre, King's College London British Heart Foundation Centre of Excellence"}, "7403209323": {"Name": "Shah A.M.", "AuthorID": "7403209323", "AffiliationID": "60011520, 60100024", "AffiliationName": "Cardiovascular Division, James Black Centre, King's College London British Heart Foundation Centre of Excellence"}, "56004172900": {"Name": "Heidari H.", "AuthorID": "56004172900", "AffiliationID": "60012937", "AffiliationName": "Electron Microscopy for Materials Research (EMAT), University of Antwerp"}, "6602082124": {"Name": "Bals S.", "AuthorID": "6602082124", "AffiliationID": "60012937", "AffiliationName": "Electron Microscopy for Materials Research (EMAT), University of Antwerp"}, "56049520500": {"Name": "Elgogary R.", "AuthorID": "56049520500", "AffiliationID": "60016618", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Pharmacy, Ain Shams University"}, "26432363000": {"Name": "Southern P.", "AuthorID": "26432363000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Healthcare Biomagnetics Laboratory, University College London"}, "7006435054": {"Name": "Pankhurst Q.A.", "AuthorID": "7006435054", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Healthcare Biomagnetics Laboratory, University College London"}, "35315677300": {"Name": "Al-Jamal W.T.", "AuthorID": "35315677300", "AffiliationID": "60000112, 60176145", "AffiliationName": "School of Pharmacy, University of East Anglia, Norwich Research Park"}, "6505973330": {"Name": "Sosabowski J.", "AuthorID": "6505973330", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Molecular Oncology, Bart's Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London"}}}
