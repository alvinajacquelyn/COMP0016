This study aims to examine whether, among public sector providers, the poor are more likely to receive free contraception and to compare how OOP payment for injectables and implants-two popular methods-differs by public/private provider type and user's sociodemographic characteristics. Design, setting and participants Secondary analyses of nationally representative, cross-sectional household data from the 2014 Kenya Demographic and Health Survey. Respondents were women of reproductive age (15-49 years). The sample comprised 5717 current modern contraception users, including 2691 injectable and 1073 implant users with non-missing expenditure values. Main outcome Respondent's self-reported source and payment to obtain their current modern contraceptive method. Methods We used multivariable logistic regression to examine predictors of free public sector contraception and compared average expenditure for injectable and implant. Quintile ratios examined progressivity of non-zero expenditure by wealth. Results Half of public sector users reported free contraception; this varied considerably by method and region. Users of implants, condoms, pills and intrauterine devices were all more likely to report receiving their method for free (p<0.001) compared with injectable users. The poorest were as likely to pay for contraception as the wealthiest users at public providers (OR: 1.10, 95% CI: 0.64 to 1.91). Across all providers, among users with non-zero expenditure, injectable and implant users reported a mean OOP payment of Kenyan shillings (KES) 80 (US$0.91), 95% CI: KES 78 to 82 and KES 378 (US$4.31), 95% CI: KES 327 to 429, respectively. In the public sector, expenditure was pro-poor for injectable users yet weakly pro-rich for implant users. Conclusions More attention is needed to targeting subsidies to the poorest and ensuring government facilities are equipped to cope with lost user fee revenue.", "AuthorKeywords": ["demographic & health survey", "family planning", "government provision", "Kenya", "private sector", "user fees"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Contraception", "Contraceptive Agents", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Family Planning Services", "Female", "Health Expenditures", "Humans", "Kenya", "Middle Aged", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85061963302", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"57196066136": {"Name": "Radovich E.", "AuthorID": "57196066136", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Epidemiology and Population Health, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "57188684436": {"Name": "Dennis M.L.", "AuthorID": "57188684436", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Epidemiology and Population Health, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "55657327500": {"Name": "Cavallaro F.L.", "AuthorID": "55657327500", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Epidemiology and Population Health, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "57195681367": {"Name": "Wong K.L.M.", "AuthorID": "57195681367", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Epidemiology and Population Health, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "24281684500": {"Name": "Lynch C.A.", "AuthorID": "24281684500", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Epidemiology and Population Health, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "36930789600": {"Name": "Lyons-Amos M.", "AuthorID": "36930789600", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Epidemiology and Population Health, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "55195291600": {"Name": "Benova L.", "AuthorID": "55195291600", "AffiliationID": "60028863", "AffiliationName": "Department of Public Health, Instituut voor Tropische Geneeskunde"}, "36676955500": {"Name": "Barasa E.", "AuthorID": "36676955500", "AffiliationID": "60066705", "AffiliationName": "Health Economics Research Unit, KEMRI-Wellcome Trust Research Programme"}, "6603053391": {"Name": "Borghi J.", "AuthorID": "6603053391", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Public Health and Policy, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "6504801909": {"Name": "Abuya T.", "AuthorID": "6504801909", "AffiliationID": "60057416", "AffiliationName": "Population Council Kenya"}}}
