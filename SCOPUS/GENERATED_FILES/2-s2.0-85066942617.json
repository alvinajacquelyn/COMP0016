Management of a post-auricular cutaneous mastoid fistula can be challenging for the surgeon.Objective This paper describes a surgical refinement for post-auricular cutaneous mastoid fistula closure, involving a fibro-muscular-periosteal flap to cover the mastoid cavity, combined with a bilobed flap from the mastoid and lateral neck regions for skin closure.Method and results A case of a post-auricular cutaneous mastoid fistula developed after revision tympanoplasty for a cholesteatoma. The condition was successfully treated with the presented technique. Pre- and post-operative photographs are provided for demonstration.Conclusion The fibro-muscular-periosteal flap combined with a bilobed flap from the mastoid and lateral neck regions, in our view, can be considered a valid option for post-auricular cutaneous mastoid fistula closure.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cholesteatoma", "Cutaneous Fistula", "Hearing Loss", "Mastoid", "Tympanoplasty"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Cholesteatoma, Middle Ear", "Cutaneous Fistula", "Humans", "Male", "Mastoid", "Surgical Flaps", "Treatment Outcome", "Tympanoplasty"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85066942617", "SubjectAreas": [["Otorhinolaryngology", "MEDI", "2733"]], "AuthorData": {"57208940637": {"Name": "Pendolino A.", "AuthorID": "57208940637", "AffiliationID": "60000481", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurosciences (DNS), Otolaryngology Section, University of Padova"}, "57209211123": {"Name": "Pavone C.", "AuthorID": "57209211123", "AffiliationID": "60000481", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurosciences (DNS), Otolaryngology Section, University of Padova"}, "6508251192": {"Name": "Zanoletti E.", "AuthorID": "6508251192", "AffiliationID": "60000481", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurosciences (DNS), Otolaryngology Section, University of Padova"}}}
