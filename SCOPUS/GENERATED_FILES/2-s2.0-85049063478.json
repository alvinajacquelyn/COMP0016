However, relating single-synapse release events and local astroglial responses to sensory stimuli in an intact animal has not hitherto been feasible. Here, we present a multiplexed multiphoton excitation imaging approach for assessing the relationship between presynaptic Ca 2+ entry at thalamocortical axonal boutons and perisynaptic astrocytic Ca 2+ elevations, induced by whisker stimulation in the barrel cortex of C57BL/6 mice. We find that, unexpectedly, Ca 2+ elevations in the perisynaptic astrocytic regions consistently precede local presynaptic Ca 2+ signals during spontaneous brain activity associated with anaesthesia. The methods described here can be adapted to a variety of optical sensors and are compatible with experimental designs that might necessitate repeated sampling of single synapses over a longitudinal behavioural paradigm.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Astrocytes", "Multiphoton imaging", "Neurotransmission", "Tripartite synapse"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Astrocytes", "Axons", "Brain", "Calcium", "Calcium Signaling", "Female", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Microscopy, Fluorescence, Multiphoton", "Neurons", "Presynaptic Terminals", "Somatosensory Cortex", "Synapses"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85049063478", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"]], "AuthorData": {"56915216400": {"Name": "Reynolds J.", "AuthorID": "56915216400", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "25937590000": {"Name": "Zheng K.", "AuthorID": "25937590000", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "7005393308": {"Name": "Rusakov D.", "AuthorID": "7005393308", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Neurology, University College London"}}}
