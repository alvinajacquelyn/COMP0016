It is unknown whether the improved healthcare response to domestic violence and abuse demonstrated in a cluster randomised controlled trial of IRIS (Identification and Referral to Improve Safety), a complex intervention, including general practice based training, support and referral programme, can be achieved outside a trial setting. Aim: To evaluate the impact over four years of a system wide implementation of IRIS, sequentially into multiple areas, outside the setting of a trial. Methods: An interrupted time series analysis of referrals received by domestic violence and abuse workers from 201 general practices, in five northeast London boroughs; alongside a mixed methods process evaluation and qualitative analysis. Segmented regression interrupted time series analysis to estimate impact of the IRIS intervention over a 53-month period. A secondary analysis compares the segmented regression analysis in each of the four implementation boroughs, with a fifth comparator borough. Discussion: This is the first interrupted time series analysis of an intervention to improve the health care response to domestic violence. The findings will characterise the impact of IRIS implementation outside a trial setting and its suitability for national implementation in the United Kingdom.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Domestic violence abuse complex intervention implementation evaluation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Child", "Child Abuse", "Cluster Analysis", "Domestic Violence", "Female", "General Practice", "Health Plan Implementation", "Humans", "Interrupted Time Series Analysis", "London", "Male", "Primary Health Care", "Process Assessment (Health Care)", "Qualitative Research", "Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic", "Referral and Consultation", "Regression Analysis", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85051086649", "SubjectAreas": [["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"56670957700": {"Name": "Sohal A.H.", "AuthorID": "56670957700", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Queen Mary University of London, Centre for Primary Care and Public Health, Barts, London School of Medicine and Dentistry"}, "57191581409": {"Name": "Beresford L.", "AuthorID": "57191581409", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Queen Mary University of London, Centre for Primary Care and Public Health, Barts, London School of Medicine and Dentistry"}, "56321710600": {"Name": "Dowrick A.", "AuthorID": "56321710600", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Queen Mary University of London, Centre for Primary Care and Public Health, Barts, London School of Medicine and Dentistry"}, "57203179378": {"Name": "El-Shogri F.", "AuthorID": "57203179378", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Queen Mary University of London, Centre for Primary Care and Public Health, Barts, London School of Medicine and Dentistry"}, "57193512604": {"Name": "Lewis N.", "AuthorID": "57193512604", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Queen Mary University of London, Centre for Primary Care and Public Health, Barts, London School of Medicine and Dentistry"}, "35085224700": {"Name": "Nightingale C.", "AuthorID": "35085224700", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Queen Mary University of London, Centre for Primary Care and Public Health, Barts, London School of Medicine and Dentistry"}, "57195594527": {"Name": "Boomla K.", "AuthorID": "57195594527", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Queen Mary University of London, Centre for Primary Care and Public Health, Barts, London School of Medicine and Dentistry"}, "7004645125": {"Name": "Eldridge S.", "AuthorID": "7004645125", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Queen Mary University of London, Centre for Primary Care and Public Health, Barts, London School of Medicine and Dentistry"}, "55228809500": {"Name": "Griffiths C.", "AuthorID": "55228809500", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Queen Mary University of London, Centre for Primary Care and Public Health, Barts, London School of Medicine and Dentistry"}, "55749172200": {"Name": "Feder G.", "AuthorID": "55749172200", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "School of Social and Community Medicine, University of Bristol"}, "57203187464": {"Name": "Barbosa E.", "AuthorID": "57203187464", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Applied Health Research, University College London"}, "56449994300": {"Name": "Morris S.", "AuthorID": "56449994300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Applied Health Research, University College London"}, "24775572600": {"Name": "Howell A.", "AuthorID": "24775572600", "AffiliationID": "121063055", "AffiliationName": "IRISi"}, "43661247000": {"Name": "Johnson M.", "AuthorID": "43661247000", "AffiliationID": "121063055", "AffiliationName": "IRISi"}}}
