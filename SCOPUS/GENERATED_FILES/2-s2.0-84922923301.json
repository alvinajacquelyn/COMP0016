KGaA, Weinheim.Developing inorganic materials that can mimic nature's ability to selectively oxidise inert C-H bonds remains a topic of intense scientific research. In recent years, zeolitic materials containing Fe and/or Cu have been shown to be highly active, heterogeneous catalysts for the selective oxidation of alkanes (including methane), amongst a range of other related oxidation challenges. By using resonance-enhanced Raman spectroscopy, we demonstrate that, following high-temperature pre-treatment (activation), Fe-containing ZSM-5 possesses an active binuclear core, and forms a key Fe-OOH intermediate upon activation with H2O2. Both factors are reminiscent of biological oxidation catalysts, and may account for the unique ability of this material to selectively oxidise methane to methanol at low temperature. A pre-ferryl cat: Through insitu resonance-enhanced Raman spectroscopy, we identify an active, binuclear Fe-O(H)-Fe core and an FeIII-OOH intermediate in Fe-containing ZSM-5 following activation with H2O2. The pre-ferryl nature of this biomimetic intermediate may account for the unique ability of this solid catalyst to selectively oxidise methane to methanol under mild conditions.", "AuthorKeywords": ["biomimetic catalysis", "C-H activation", "insitu analysis", "methane oxidation", "zeolites"], "IndexKeywords": ["Biological oxidations", "Biomimetic catalysis", "Biomimetic oxidation", "C-h activation", "Heterogeneous catalyst", "In-situ analysis", "Methane oxidation", "Scientific researches"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84922923301", "SubjectAreas": [["Catalysis", "CENG", "1503"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"], ["Organic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1605"], ["Inorganic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1604"]], "AuthorData": {"36521187700": {"Name": "Hammond C.", "AuthorID": "36521187700", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "Cardiff Catalysis Institute, Cardiff University, School of Chemistry"}, "6507384807": {"Name": "Dimitratos N.", "AuthorID": "6507384807", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "Cardiff Catalysis Institute, Cardiff University, School of Chemistry"}, "7003641991": {"Name": "Hermans I.", "AuthorID": "7003641991", "AffiliationID": "60032179", "AffiliationName": "University of Wisconsin-Madison, Department of Chemistry"}}}
