This has led not only to an expansion of medical activity in a whole variety of new areas but also to the emergence of new groups of individuals defined or defining themselves through their experiences, diagnosis and treatment. Through analysis of in-depth interviews with 27 of the now-adult survivors of the pioneer cohort of children receiving liver transplants in Britain in the early 1980s and 1990s, this paper presents how this group not only illustrate the capacities of modern medicine and healthcare to transform the survival prospects of a more diversified population, but also create new narratives of embodied identity. Specifically, we examine how childhood identities were shaped in three settings; home, hospital and school. At home, parents appeared to shape their child's identity through controlling tightly a daily medical regime focused on the concept of \u2018body as machine\u2019, celebrating their survival as a transplant recipient, yet at the same time socialising their child as a \u2018normal\u2019 child, albeit one who had a serious illness. The hospital appeared instrumental in shaping parents' focus on their child's body, and offered a way, through other patients with liver disease, for children to feel \u2018normal\u2019 in their difference. It was in school, through interaction with \u2018healthy\u2019 children and teachers, that corporeality and embodiment appeared most salient, and where social identity was negotiated and more often held in contention. Adult survivors of childhood liver transplant straddle the different discourses of normality and difference as their embodied experiences shape their narratives of identity and shed light on an underexplored aspect of the relationship between medicine and society.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Childhood", "Corporeality", "Embodiment", "Identity", "New ageing populations", "Organ transplant", "Qualitative", "United Kingdom"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aging", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Cohort Studies", "Disease Management", "Female", "Humans", "Liver Transplantation", "Male", "Pediatrics", "Qualitative Research", "Social Identification", "Survivors", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84995704312", "SubjectAreas": [["Health (social science)", "SOCI", "3306"], ["History and Philosophy of Science", "ARTS", "1207"]], "AuthorData": {"6603095751": {"Name": "Lowton K.", "AuthorID": "6603095751", "AffiliationID": "60017317", "AffiliationName": "Department of Sociology, University of Sussex"}, "57191982761": {"Name": "Hiley C.", "AuthorID": "57191982761", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Gerontology, King's College London"}, "35726525300": {"Name": "Higgs P.", "AuthorID": "35726525300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, University College London"}}}
