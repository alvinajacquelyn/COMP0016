However, there is little evidence on the longitudinal predictive relationships between language and reading in this population. Aims: To determine the extent to which differences in spoken language ability in childhood predict reading ability in D/HH adolescents. Methods: and procedures: Participants were drawn from a population-based cohort study and comprised 53 D/HH teenagers, who used spoken language, and a comparison group of 38 normally hearing teenagers. All had completed standardised measures of spoken language (expression and comprehension) and reading (accuracy and comprehension) at 6\u201310 and 13\u201319 years of age. Outcomes: and results: Forced entry stepwise regression showed that, after taking reading ability at age 8 years into account, language scores at age 8 years did not add significantly to the prediction of Reading Accuracy z-scores at age 17 years (change in R2 = 0.01, p =.459) but did make a significant contribution to the prediction of Reading Comprehension z-scores at age 17 years (change in R2 = 0.17, p <.001). Conclusions: and implications: In D/HH individuals who are spoken language users, expressive and receptive language skills in middle childhood predict reading comprehension ability in adolescence. Continued intervention to support language development beyond primary school has the potential to benefit reading comprehension and hence educational access for D/HH adolescents.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Expressive language", "Language comprehension", "Longitudinal design", "Permanent childhood hearing loss", "Reading accuracy", "Reading comprehension"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Case-Control Studies", "Child", "Cohort Studies", "Comprehension", "Deafness", "Female", "Hearing Loss", "Humans", "Language Development", "Longitudinal Studies", "Male", "Prognosis", "Reading", "Speech", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85045388552", "SubjectAreas": [["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"], ["Clinical Psychology", "PSYC", "3203"]], "AuthorData": {"13605005100": {"Name": "Worsfold S.", "AuthorID": "13605005100", "AffiliationID": "60025287", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton"}, "26650178200": {"Name": "Pimperton H.", "AuthorID": "26650178200", "AffiliationID": "60025287", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton"}, "55749016900": {"Name": "Kennedy C.", "AuthorID": "55749016900", "AffiliationID": "60000703", "AffiliationName": "University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust"}, "8726278400": {"Name": "Mahon M.", "AuthorID": "8726278400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Language and Cognition Research Department, UCL"}, "7402960884": {"Name": "Stevenson J.", "AuthorID": "7402960884", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "Psychology, Faculty of Social and Human Sciences, University of Southampton"}}}
