What, exactly, can be considered a module, how do they operate, can they be subdivided and do they act individually or in concert are only some of the key questions discussed in this consensus paper. Experts studying cerebellar compartmentalization give their insights on the structure and function of cerebellar modules, with the aim of providing an up-to-date review of the extensive literature on this subject. Starting with an historical perspective indicating that the basis of the modular organization is formed by matching olivocorticonuclear connectivity, this is followed by consideration of anatomical and chemical modular boundaries, revealing a relation between anatomical, chemical, and physiological borders. In addition, the question is asked what the smallest operational unit of the cerebellum might be. Furthermore, it has become clear that chemical diversity of Purkinje cells also results in diversity of information processing between cerebellar modules. An additional important consideration is the relation between modular compartmentalization and the organization of the mossy fiber system, resulting in the concept of modular plasticity. Finally, examination of cerebellar output patterns suggesting cooperation between modules and recent work on modular aspects of emotional behavior are discussed. Despite the general consensus that the cerebellum has a modular organization, many questions remain. The authors hope that this joint review will inspire future cerebellar research so that we are better able to understand how this brain structure makes its vital contribution to behavior in its most general form.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Aldolase C", "Cerebellum", "Climbing fibers", "Compartments", "Functional organization", "Longitudinal stripes", "Microzones", "Mossy fibers", "Purkinje cells", "Zebrin"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Cerebellum", "Humans"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85048050764", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"7003344014": {"Name": "Apps R.", "AuthorID": "7003344014", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "School of Physiology, Pharmacology and Neuroscience, University of Bristol"}, "55761085500": {"Name": "Lawrenson C.", "AuthorID": "55761085500", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "School of Physiology, Pharmacology and Neuroscience, University of Bristol"}, "7004037745": {"Name": "Lumb B.", "AuthorID": "7004037745", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "School of Physiology, Pharmacology and Neuroscience, University of Bristol"}, "7102868438": {"Name": "Hawkes R.", "AuthorID": "7102868438", "AffiliationID": "60192954, 60002306", "AffiliationName": "Hotchkiss Brain Institute, University of Calgary"}, "36664310000": {"Name": "Aoki S.", "AuthorID": "36664310000", "AffiliationID": "60032114", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Erasmus MC Rotterdam"}, "12797203200": {"Name": "Schonewille M.", "AuthorID": "12797203200", "AffiliationID": "60032114", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Erasmus MC Rotterdam"}, "7005869810": {"Name": "Voogd J.", "AuthorID": "7005869810", "AffiliationID": "60032114", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Erasmus MC Rotterdam"}, "7005528584": {"Name": "Ruigrok T.J.H.", "AuthorID": "7005528584", "AffiliationID": "60032114", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Erasmus MC Rotterdam"}, "13610350800": {"Name": "Bengtsson F.", "AuthorID": "13610350800", "AffiliationID": "60018674, 60029170", "AffiliationName": "Department of Experimental Medical Sciences, Lund University"}, "35609755400": {"Name": "J\u00f6rntell H.", "AuthorID": "35609755400", "AffiliationID": "60018674, 60029170", "AffiliationName": "Department of Experimental Medical Sciences, Lund University"}, "57075764300": {"Name": "Brown A.M.", "AuthorID": "57075764300", "AffiliationID": "60008978", "AffiliationName": "Jan and Dan Duncan Neurological Research Institute at Texas Children\u2019s Hospital"}, "56013090100": {"Name": "Lackey E.P.", "AuthorID": "56013090100", "AffiliationID": "60008978", "AffiliationName": "Jan and Dan Duncan Neurological Research Institute at Texas Children\u2019s Hospital"}, "57204972610": {"Name": "Sillitoe R.V.", "AuthorID": "57204972610", "AffiliationID": "60002441", "AffiliationName": "Program in Developmental Biology, Baylor College of Medicine"}, "36709461600": {"Name": "Chen G.", "AuthorID": "36709461600", "AffiliationID": "60029445", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, University of Minnesota"}, "7004554313": {"Name": "Ebner T.J.", "AuthorID": "7004554313", "AffiliationID": "60029445", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, University of Minnesota"}, "6602366495": {"Name": "Isope P.", "AuthorID": "6602366495", "AffiliationID": "60103368, 60157969, 60008134", "AffiliationName": "Institut des Neurosciences Cellulaires et Int\u00e9gratives, CNRS, Universit\u00e9 de Strasbourg"}, "57202369119": {"Name": "Spaeth L.", "AuthorID": "57202369119", "AffiliationID": "60103368, 60157969, 60008134", "AffiliationName": "Institut des Neurosciences Cellulaires et Int\u00e9gratives, CNRS, Universit\u00e9 de Strasbourg"}, "54908741500": {"Name": "Valera A.", "AuthorID": "54908741500", "AffiliationID": "60103368, 60157969, 60008134", "AffiliationName": "Institut des Neurosciences Cellulaires et Int\u00e9gratives, CNRS, Universit\u00e9 de Strasbourg"}, "7004547805": {"Name": "Sugihara I.", "AuthorID": "7004547805", "AffiliationID": "60003303", "AffiliationName": "Department of Systems Neurophysiology, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Tokyo Medical and Dental University"}, "7007114592": {"Name": "Wylie D.R.", "AuthorID": "7007114592", "AffiliationID": "60030835", "AffiliationName": "Neuroscience and Mental Health Institute, University of Alberta"}}}
