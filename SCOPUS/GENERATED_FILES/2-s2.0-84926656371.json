Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of ERA-EDTA. All rights reserved.Primary systemic vasculitides of the young are relatively rare diseases, but are associated with significant morbidity and mortality, particularly if there is diagnostic delay. We provide an overview of paediatric vasculitides with emphasis on key differences in vasculitis presentation and management between children and adults. Significant advances in the field of paediatric vasculitis research include the development of classification criteria and disease outcome tools for paediatric disease; inclusion of paediatric patients in international multicentre randomized controlled trials of therapies in vasculitis; and development of rare disease trial designs for therapeutic trials of paediatric vasculitis. The continuation of unmet needs as well as the exploration of potential therapeutic avenues and considerations in the design of future trials are also discussed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["children", "clinical trials", "systemic vasculitis", "vasculitis outcome measures"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Child", "Humans", "Pediatrics", "Vasculitis"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84926656371", "SubjectAreas": [["Nephrology", "MEDI", "2727"], ["Transplantation", "MEDI", "2747"]], "AuthorData": {"24757952100": {"Name": "Eleftheriou D.", "AuthorID": "24757952100", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Paediatric and Adolescent Rheumatology, UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "7004602186": {"Name": "Brogan P.", "AuthorID": "7004602186", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Paediatric and Adolescent Rheumatology, UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "36518100100": {"Name": "Batu E.", "AuthorID": "36518100100", "AffiliationID": "60020484", "AffiliationName": "Paediatric Rheumatology Department, Hacettepe University"}, "7103280649": {"Name": "Ozen S.", "AuthorID": "7103280649", "AffiliationID": "60020484", "AffiliationName": "Paediatric Rheumatology Department, Hacettepe University"}}}
