American Geophysical Union. All Rights Reserved.The inner boundary of Saturn's electron radiation belts, near the planet's A ring (\u223c2.27 Rs), is studied using Cassini's proximal orbit measurements. We find that variable convective flows transport energetic electrons to the A ring, which absorbs them instantaneously, forming the inner belt boundary. These flows are also responsible for a variable and longitudinally asymmetric boundary configuration. Prenoon, the boundary oscillates toward and away from the A ring with a 2-week period. Postnoon, it maps persistently near the F ring (\u223c2.32 Rs) and coexists with localized MeV electron intensity enhancements (microbelts). We propose that the microbelts contain electrons in drift resonance with corotation, trapped in local time-confined trajectories, which result from the aforementioned convective flows. The microbelts' collocation with the F ring implies either a local, secondary electron production due to galactic cosmic ray collisions with F ring dust or an enhanced resonant electron trapping due to an electrodynamic interaction between the F ring and Saturn's magnetosphere.", "AuthorKeywords": ["convection", "corotating interaction regions", "galactic cosmic rays", "radiation belts", "rings", "Saturn"], "IndexKeywords": ["Boundary configuration", "Corotating interaction regions", "Electrodynamic interaction", "Electron radiation belt", "Galactic cosmic rays", "Orbit measurements", "Saturn", "Secondary electrons"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85054350494", "SubjectAreas": [["Geophysics", "EART", "1908"], ["Earth and Planetary Sciences (all)", "EART", "1900"]], "AuthorData": {"16064559500": {"Name": "Roussos E.", "AuthorID": "16064559500", "AffiliationID": "60017695", "AffiliationName": "Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research"}, "22134695900": {"Name": "Krupp N.", "AuthorID": "22134695900", "AffiliationID": "60017695", "AffiliationName": "Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research"}, "35746553100": {"Name": "Kollmann P.", "AuthorID": "35746553100", "AffiliationID": "60022054", "AffiliationName": "Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory"}, "6602411908": {"Name": "Paranicas C.", "AuthorID": "6602411908", "AffiliationID": "60022054", "AffiliationName": "Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory"}, "57203296630": {"Name": "Mitchell D.G.", "AuthorID": "57203296630", "AffiliationID": "60022054", "AffiliationName": "Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory"}, "24530849200": {"Name": "Krimigis S.M.", "AuthorID": "24530849200", "AffiliationID": "60003185", "AffiliationName": "Office of Space Research and Technology, Academy of Athens"}, "15831262300": {"Name": "Dialynas K.", "AuthorID": "15831262300", "AffiliationID": "60084281", "AffiliationName": "UCL Mullard Space Science Laboratory"}, "55224172000": {"Name": "Jones G.H.", "AuthorID": "55224172000", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60162133", "AffiliationName": "The Centre for Planetary Sciences at UCL/Birkbeck"}, "7406078953": {"Name": "Cooper J.F.", "AuthorID": "7406078953", "AffiliationID": "60006337", "AffiliationName": "NASA Goddard Space Flight Center"}}}
