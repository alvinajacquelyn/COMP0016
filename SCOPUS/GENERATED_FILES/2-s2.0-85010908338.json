Immunological Reviews published by John Wiley & Sons LtdBeginning in 2009, studies of the humoral responses of HIV-positive individuals have led to the identification of scores, if not hundreds, of antibodies that are both broadly reactive and potently neutralizing. This development has provided renewed impetus toward an HIV vaccine and led directly to the development of novel immunogens. Advances in identification of donors with the most potent and broad anti-HIV serum neutralizing responses were crucial in this effort. Equally, development of methods for the rapid generation of human antibodies from these donors was pivotal. Primarily these methods comprise single B-cell culture coupled to high-throughput neutralization screening and flow cytometry-based sorting of single B cells using HIV envelope protein baits. In this review, the advantages and disadvantages of these methodologies are discussed in the context of the specificities targeted by individual antibodies and the need for further improvements to evaluate HIV vaccine candidates.", "AuthorKeywords": ["B cells", "HIV", "monoclonal antibody isolation", "neutralization"], "IndexKeywords": ["AIDS Vaccines", "Animals", "Antibodies, Neutralizing", "B-Lymphocytes", "Epitopes", "HIV Antibodies", "HIV Antigens", "HIV Infections", "HIV-1", "Humans", "Single-Cell Analysis", "Viral Envelope Proteins"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85010908338", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"]], "AuthorData": {"36630795600": {"Name": "McCoy L.", "AuthorID": "36630795600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection & Immunity, University College London"}, "7401577043": {"Name": "Burton D.", "AuthorID": "7401577043", "AffiliationID": "60022195, 60029929, 60009982", "AffiliationName": "Ragon Institute of Massachusetts General Hospital, Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard University"}}}
