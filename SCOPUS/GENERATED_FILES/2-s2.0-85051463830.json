Transport across quantum networks underlies many problems, from state transfer on a spin network to energy transport in photosynthetic complexes. However, networks can contain dark subspaces that block the transportation, and various methods used to enhance transfer on quantum networks can be viewed as equivalently avoiding, modifying, or destroying the dark subspace. Here, we exploit graph theoretical tools to identify the dark subspaces and show that asymptotically almost surely they do not exist for large networks, while for small ones they can be suppressed by properly perturbing the coupling rates between the network nodes. More specifically, we apply these results to describe the recently experimentally observed and robust transport behaviour of the electronic excitation travelling on a genetically-engineered light-harvesting cylinder (M13 virus) structure. We believe that these mainly topological tools may allow us to better infer which network structures and dynamics are more favourable to enhance transfer of energy and information towards novel quantum technologies.", "AuthorKeywords": ["bio-engineered structures", "dynamics", "network structure", "Quantum networks", "transport"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85051463830", "SubjectAreas": [["Statistical and Nonlinear Physics", "PHYS", "3109"], ["Statistics and Probability", "MATH", "2613"], ["Modeling and Simulation", "MATH", "2611"], ["Mathematical Physics", "MATH", "2610"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"57203386239": {"Name": "Le T.", "AuthorID": "57203386239", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "57203399305": {"Name": "Donati L.", "AuthorID": "57203399305", "AffiliationID": "60021859", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Florence"}, "8984521800": {"Name": "Severini S.", "AuthorID": "8984521800", "AffiliationID": "60025084", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Natural Sciences, Shanghai Jiao Tong University"}, "56503159700": {"Name": "Caruso F.", "AuthorID": "56503159700", "AffiliationID": "60082853, 60021859", "AffiliationName": "LENS, QSTAR, Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Florence"}}}
