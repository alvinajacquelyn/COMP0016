This approach is effective but can have urinary, sexual, and rectal side effects. Objective: To report on 5-yr PCa control following focal high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) therapy to treat individual areas of cancer within the prostate. Design, setting, and participants: This was a prospective study of 625 consecutive patients with nonmetastatic clinically significant PCa undergoing focal HIFU therapy (Sonablate) in secondary care centres between January 1, 2006 and December 31, 2015. A minimum of 6-mo follow-up was available for599 patients. Intermediate- or high-risk PCa was found in 505 patients (84%). Intervention: Disease was localised using multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) combined with targeted and systematic biopsies, or transperineal mapping biopsies. Areas of significant disease were treated. Follow-up included prostate-specific antigen (PSA) measurement, mpMRI, and biopsies. Outcome measurements and statistical analysis: The primary endpoint, failure-free survival (FFS), was defined as freedom from radical or systemic therapy, metastases, and cancer-specific mortality. Results and limitations: The median follow-up was 56 mo (interquartile range [IQR] 35\u201370). The median age was 65 yr (IQR 61\u201371) and median preoperative PSA was 7.2 ng/ml (IQR 5.2\u201310.0). FFS was 99% (95% confidence interval [CI] 98\u2013100%) at 1 yr, 92% (95% CI 90\u201395%) at 3 yr, and 88% (95% 85\u201391%) at 5 yr. For the whole patient cohort, metastasis-free, cancer-specific, and overall survival at 5 yr was 98% (95% CI 97\u201399%), 100%, and 99% (95% CI 97\u2013100%), respectively. Among patients who returned validated questionnaires, 241/247 (98%) achieved complete pad-free urinary continence and none required more than 1 pad/d. Limitations include the lack of long-term follow-up. Conclusions: Focal therapy for select patients with clinically significant nonmetastatic prostate cancer is effective in the medium term and has a low probability of side effects. Patient summary: In this multicentre study of 625 patients undergoing focal therapy using high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU), failure-free survival, metastasis-free survival, cancer-specific survival, and overall survival were 88%, 98%, 100%, and 99%, respectively. Urinary incontinence (any pad use) was 2%. Focal HIFU therapy for patients with clinically significant prostate cancer that has not spread has a low probability of side effects and is effective at 5 yr. Our study shows that at median follow-up of approximately 5 yr after focal high-intensity focused ultrasound, nine out of ten patients with predominantly intermediate- or high-risk prostate cancer are able to avoid surgery, radiotherapy, and systemic therapy. Prostate cancer\u2013specific survival was 100%. There was a low probability of urinary incontinence (2%), erectile dysfunction (15%), and rectal side effects (rare).", "AuthorKeywords": ["Focal therapy", "High-intensity focused ultrasound", "Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging", "Targeted biopsy", "Transperineal biopsy"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Biopsy", "Follow-Up Studies", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Neoplasm Staging", "Outcome Assessment (Health Care)", "Prospective Studies", "Prostate", "Prostate-Specific Antigen", "Prostatic Neoplasms", "Registries", "Survival Analysis", "Ultrasonic Waves", "Ultrasound, High-Intensity Focused, Transrectal", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85048997896", "SubjectAreas": [["Urology", "MEDI", "2748"]], "AuthorData": {"56344279400": {"Name": "Guillaumier S.", "AuthorID": "56344279400", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, UCLH NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7004357370": {"Name": "Charman S.", "AuthorID": "7004357370", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Surgery and Interventional Sciences, University College London"}, "57202678884": {"Name": "Hosking-Jervis F.", "AuthorID": "57202678884", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Division of Surgery, Department of Surgery and Cancer, Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London"}, "54382137700": {"Name": "McCartan N.", "AuthorID": "54382137700", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, UCLH NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7402982572": {"Name": "Moore C.M.", "AuthorID": "7402982572", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, UCLH NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57214656565": {"Name": "Shah K.", "AuthorID": "57214656565", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Surgery and Interventional Sciences, University College London"}, "7004667094": {"Name": "Emberton M.", "AuthorID": "7004667094", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, UCLH NHS Foundation Trust"}, "8147855500": {"Name": "Ahmed H.U.", "AuthorID": "8147855500", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Division of Surgery, Department of Surgery and Cancer, Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London"}, "7005977360": {"Name": "Arya M.", "AuthorID": "7005977360", "AffiliationID": "60026336", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, The Princess Alexandra Hospital NHS Trust"}, "55334701600": {"Name": "Peters M.", "AuthorID": "55334701600", "AffiliationID": "60032724", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiotherapy, University Medical Centre"}, "7201542866": {"Name": "Winkler M.", "AuthorID": "7201542866", "AffiliationID": "60012558, 60111785, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "Imperial Urology, Charing Cross Hospital, Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"}, "14027657700": {"Name": "Virdi J.", "AuthorID": "14027657700", "AffiliationID": "60026336", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, The Princess Alexandra Hospital NHS Trust"}, "7006158288": {"Name": "Afzal N.", "AuthorID": "7006158288", "AffiliationID": "60006365", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, Dorset County Hospital NHS Trust"}, "6602737512": {"Name": "Dudderidge T.", "AuthorID": "6602737512", "AffiliationID": "60000703", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, University Hospital Southampton NHS Trust"}, "6603779879": {"Name": "Hindley R.G.", "AuthorID": "6603779879", "AffiliationID": "60170281", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, Basingstoke and North Hampshire Hospital, Hampshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7004649709": {"Name": "Lewi H.", "AuthorID": "7004649709", "AffiliationID": "125111141", "AffiliationName": "Springfield Hospital"}, "26667018400": {"Name": "Nigam R.", "AuthorID": "26667018400", "AffiliationID": "60028760", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, Royal County Surrey Hospital NHS Trust"}, "7005808886": {"Name": "Ogden C.", "AuthorID": "7005808886", "AffiliationID": "60017166", "AffiliationName": "Department of Academic Urology, The Royal Marsden Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "35467356700": {"Name": "Persad R.", "AuthorID": "35467356700", "AffiliationID": "60016447, 60027676", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, Southmead Hospital, North Bristol NHS Trust"}, "7102799145": {"Name": "van der Meulen J.", "AuthorID": "7102799145", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}}}
