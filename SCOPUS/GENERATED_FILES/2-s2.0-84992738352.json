Geometrical parameters including shape and redshift functions are obtained for these solutions. We adopt the formalism of the Noether gauge symmetry approach in order to find symmetries, Lie brackets and invariants (conserved quantities). Furthermore by imposing specific forms of potential function, we are able to calculate metric coefficients and discuss their geometrical behavior.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84992738352", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (miscellaneous)", "PHYS", "3101"]], "AuthorData": {"55811800800": {"Name": "Bahamonde S.", "AuthorID": "55811800800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University College London"}, "55948874000": {"Name": "Camci U.", "AuthorID": "55948874000", "AffiliationID": "60010104", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Faculty of Sciences, Akdeniz University"}, "7005315122": {"Name": "Capozziello S.", "AuthorID": "7005315122", "AffiliationID": "60069252", "AffiliationName": "Tomsk State Pedagogical University"}, "24076168500": {"Name": "Jamil M.", "AuthorID": "24076168500", "AffiliationID": "60059937", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, School of Natural Sciences (SNS), National University of Sciences and Technology (NUST)"}}}
