Karger AG, Basel.Craniosynostosis is a common craniofacial birth defect. This review focusses on the advances that have been achieved through studying the pathogenesis of craniosynostosis using mouse models. Classic methods of gene targeting which generate individual gene knockout models have successfully identified numerous genes required for normal development of the skull bones and sutures. However, the study of syndromic craniosynostosis has largely benefited from the production of knockin models that precisely mimic human mutations. These have allowed the detailed investigation of downstream events at the cellular and molecular level following otherwise unpredictable gain-of-function effects. This has greatly enhanced our understanding of the pathogenesis of this disease and has the potential to translate into improvement of the clinical management of this condition in the future.", "AuthorKeywords": ["FGFR mutations", "Mouse models"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85049924965", "SubjectAreas": [["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Genetics (clinical)", "MEDI", "2716"]], "AuthorData": {"57204619322": {"Name": "Lee K.K.L.", "AuthorID": "57204619322", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "7006454348": {"Name": "Stanier P.", "AuthorID": "7006454348", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "6603376392": {"Name": "Pauws E.", "AuthorID": "6603376392", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}}}
