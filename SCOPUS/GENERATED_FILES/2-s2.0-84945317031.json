It examines a case study based around one of the largest archaeological investigations of the Stonehenge landscape, the Stonehenge Riverside Project. A bespoke layer for Google Earth was developed to communicate the discoveries of the research by creating an engaging, interactive and informative multimedia application that could be viewed by users across the world. The article describes the creation of the layer: Google UndertheEarth: Seeing Beneath Stonehenge, and the public uptake and response to this. The project was supported by a Google Research Award, and working alongside Google enabled a 'free to download' platform for users to view the data within in the form of Google Earth, as well as the integration of a variety of applications including: Google SketchUp, YouTube, and Flickr. In addition, the integration of specialist software, such as Esri ArcGIS, was fundamental to the integration of the spatial data gathered by the project. Methodologies used to create the application are documented here, including how different outputs were integrated such as geophysical survey, 3D reconstructions and landscape tours. The future possibilities for utilising Google Earth for public engagement and understanding in the discipline are examined.", "AuthorKeywords": ["3D Reconstructions", "Archaeology", "Excavations", "Google Earth", "Landscape", "Open Source", "Public Engagement", "Seeing Beneath Stonehenge", "Spatial Data", "Stonehenge Riverside Project", "Survey", "Virtual Globe", "Web GIS"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84945317031", "SubjectAreas": [["Archeology (arts and humanities)", "ARTS", "1204"], ["Archeology", "SOCI", "3302"]], "AuthorData": {"22136554700": {"Name": "Welham K.", "AuthorID": "22136554700", "AffiliationID": "60029336", "AffiliationName": "Department of Archaeology, Anthropology and Forensic Science, Faculty of Science and Technology, Bournemouth University"}, "56924459500": {"Name": "Shaw L.", "AuthorID": "56924459500", "AffiliationID": "115897630", "AffiliationName": "Heritage Mapping and Data Officer, New Forest National Park Authority"}, "56925046700": {"Name": "Dover M.", "AuthorID": "56925046700", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography and Environment, University of Southampton"}, "55572820600": {"Name": "Manley H.", "AuthorID": "55572820600", "AffiliationID": "60029336", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Science and Technology, Bournemouth University"}, "8836086000": {"Name": "Pearson M.", "AuthorID": "8836086000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Archaeology, University College"}, "7202662466": {"Name": "Pollard J.", "AuthorID": "7202662466", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "Department of Archaeology, Faculty of Humanities, University of Southampton"}, "7201656149": {"Name": "Richards C.", "AuthorID": "7201656149", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "Department of Archaeology, School of Arts, Languages and Cultures, University of Manchester"}, "7406562866": {"Name": "Thomas J.", "AuthorID": "7406562866", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "Department of Archaeology, School of Arts, Languages and Cultures, University of Manchester"}, "7004437168": {"Name": "Tilley C.", "AuthorID": "7004437168", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anthropology, University College London"}}}
