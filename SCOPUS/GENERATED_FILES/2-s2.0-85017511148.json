The four patterns are centralized urban model, green corridor urban model, decentralized urban model (satellite city model), and resource-based city model. Landscape ecology risk assessments based on simulation results show that the decentralized urban model is superior to the centralized urban model in terms of long-term landscape ecological development and environmental protection. The study also analyzed the relationships between the patch spacing index and the evaluation index.", "AuthorKeywords": ["City patterns", "GIS", "Landscape ecological risk assessment", "System dynamics model", "Urban development"], "IndexKeywords": ["City patterns", "Ecological development", "Ecological risk assessment", "Environmental pollutions", "Landscape ecology", "Resource-based city", "System dynamics model", "Urban development"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85017511148", "SubjectAreas": [["Civil and Structural Engineering", "ENGI", "2205"], ["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"], ["Development", "SOCI", "3303"], ["Urban Studies", "SOCI", "3322"]], "AuthorData": {"57188689461": {"Name": "Xu J.", "AuthorID": "57188689461", "AffiliationID": "60019616", "AffiliationName": "School of Architecture, Harbin Institute of Technology"}, "55485135500": {"Name": "Kang J.", "AuthorID": "55485135500", "AffiliationID": "60001881", "AffiliationName": "School of Architecture, Univ. of Sheffield"}}}
