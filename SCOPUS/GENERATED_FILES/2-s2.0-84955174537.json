We investigated the predictive value of defined clinical parameters to formulate a model of risk estimations for subpopulations of brain tumor patients. Methods We enclosed 650 patients > 18 years of age who underwent brain tumor surgery and included a number of clinical data. Logistic regressions were performed to determine the effect sizes of seizure-related risk factors and to develop prognostic scores for the occurrence of preoperative and early postoperative seizures. Results A total of 492 patients (334 gliomas) were eligible for logistic regression for preoperative seizures, and 338 patients for early postoperative seizures. Age \u2264 60 years (odds ratio [OR] = 1.66, p = 0.020), grades I and II glioma (OR = 4.00, p = 0.0002), total tumor/edema volume \u2264 64cm3 (OR = 2.18, p = 0.0003), and frontal location (OR = 2.28, p = 0.034) demonstrated an increased risk for preoperative seizures. Isocitrate-dehydrogenase mutations (OR = 2.52, p = 0.026) were an independent risk factor in the glioma subgroup. Age \u2265 60 years (OR = 3.32, p = 0.041), total tumor/edema volume \u2264 64cm3 (OR = 3.17, p = 0.034), complete resection (OR = 15.50, p = 0.0009), diencephalic location (OR = 12.2, p = 0.013), and high-grade tumors (OR = 5.67, p = 0.013) were significant risk factors for surgery-related seizures. Antiepileptics (OR = 1.20, p = 0.60) did not affect seizure occurrence. For seizure occurrence, patients could be stratified into 3 prognostic preoperative and into 2 prognostic early postoperative groups. Interpretation Based on the developed prognostic scores, seizure prophylaxis should be considered in high-risk patients and patient stratification for prospective studies may be feasible in the future.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Brain Neoplasms", "Female", "Glioma", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Neoplasm Metastasis", "Postoperative Complications", "Postoperative Period", "Prognosis", "Retrospective Studies", "Risk Factors", "Seizures"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84955174537", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"6506977146": {"Name": "Skardelly M.", "AuthorID": "6506977146", "AffiliationID": "60022653, 60017246", "AffiliationName": "Neuro-Oncology Center, Comprehensive Cancer Center T\u00fcbingen, University Hospital T\u00fcebingen, Eberhard Karls University of T\u00fcebingen"}, "57000295800": {"Name": "Brendle E.", "AuthorID": "57000295800", "AffiliationID": "60022653, 60017246", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurosurgery, University Hospital T\u00fcbingen, Eberhard Karls University T\u00fcbingen"}, "22939169000": {"Name": "Noell S.", "AuthorID": "22939169000", "AffiliationID": "60022653, 60017246", "AffiliationName": "Neuro-Oncology Center, Comprehensive Cancer Center T\u00fcbingen, University Hospital T\u00fcebingen, Eberhard Karls University of T\u00fcebingen"}, "56766140100": {"Name": "Behling F.", "AuthorID": "56766140100", "AffiliationID": "60022653, 60017246", "AffiliationName": "Neuro-Oncology Center, Comprehensive Cancer Center T\u00fcbingen, University Hospital T\u00fcebingen, Eberhard Karls University of T\u00fcebingen"}, "8291317300": {"Name": "Wuttke T.", "AuthorID": "8291317300", "AffiliationID": "60084331, 60017246", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology and Epileptology, Hertie Institute for Clinical Brain Research, Eberhard Karls University T\u00fcbingen"}, "6603113826": {"Name": "Rona S.", "AuthorID": "6603113826", "AffiliationID": "60022653, 60017246", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurosurgery, University Hospital T\u00fcbingen, Eberhard Karls University T\u00fcbingen"}, "55263777100": {"Name": "Tatagiba M.", "AuthorID": "55263777100", "AffiliationID": "60022653, 60017246", "AffiliationName": "Neuro-Oncology Center, Comprehensive Cancer Center T\u00fcbingen, University Hospital T\u00fcebingen, Eberhard Karls University of T\u00fcebingen"}, "8681891400": {"Name": "Tabatabai G.", "AuthorID": "8681891400", "AffiliationID": "60017246", "AffiliationName": "Center for Personalized Medicine, Eberhard Karls University of T\u00fcebingen"}, "15021259200": {"Name": "Schittenhelm J.", "AuthorID": "15021259200", "AffiliationID": "60022653, 60017246", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Pathology and Neuropathology, Division of Neuropathology, University Hospital T\u00fcbingen, Eberhard Karls University T\u00fcbingen"}, "14627355000": {"Name": "Bisdas S.", "AuthorID": "14627355000", "AffiliationID": "60022653, 60017246", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroradiology, University Hospital T\u00fcbingen, Eberhard Karls University T\u00fcbingen"}, "7003981627": {"Name": "Meisner C.", "AuthorID": "7003981627", "AffiliationID": "60022653, 60017246", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Clinical Epidemiology and Applied Biometry, University Hospital T\u00fcbingen, Eberhard Karls University T\u00fcbingen"}}}
