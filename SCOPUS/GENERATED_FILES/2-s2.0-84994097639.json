The thrombin-PAR-1 signalling axis contributes to the activation of latent TGF\u03b2 in response to tissue injury via an av\u03b26 integrin-mediated mechanism. TGF\u03b2 is a pleiotropic cytokine that acts as a tumour suppressor in normal and dysplastic cells but switches into a tumour promoter in advanced tumours. In this study we demonstrate that TGF\u03b2 is a positive regulator of PAR-1 expression in A549 lung adenocarcinoma cells, which in turn increases the sensitivity of these cells to thrombin signalling. We further demonstrate that this effect is Smad3-, ERK1/2-and Sp1-dependent. We also show that TGF\u03b2-mediated PAR-1 upregulation is accompanied by increased expression of integrin av and \u03b26 subunits. Finally, TGF\u03b2 pre-stimulation promotes increased migratory potential of A549 to thrombin. These data have important implications for our understanding of the interplay between coagulation and TGF\u03b2 signalling responses in lung cancer.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cancer", "PAR-1", "TGF\u03b2", "Thrombin"], "IndexKeywords": ["A549 Cells", "Adenocarcinoma", "Blood Coagulation", "Cell Movement", "Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic", "Humans", "Integrin alpha5", "Integrin beta Chains", "Lung Neoplasms", "MAP Kinase Signaling System", "Protein Kinases", "Receptor, PAR-1", "Smad3 Protein", "Thrombin", "Transforming Growth Factor beta", "Up-Regulation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84994097639", "SubjectAreas": [["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"]], "AuthorData": {"55318032600": {"Name": "Smoktunowicz N.", "AuthorID": "55318032600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Inflammation and Tissue Repair, UCL Respiratory, University College London"}, "16481042900": {"Name": "Plat\u00e9 M.", "AuthorID": "16481042900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Inflammation and Tissue Repair, UCL Respiratory, University College London"}, "6504053711": {"Name": "Stern A.O.", "AuthorID": "6504053711", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Inflammation and Tissue Repair, UCL Respiratory, University College London"}, "57216082803": {"Name": "D'Antongiovanni V.", "AuthorID": "57216082803", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Inflammation and Tissue Repair, UCL Respiratory, University College London"}, "8766774500": {"Name": "Scotton C.J.", "AuthorID": "8766774500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Inflammation and Tissue Repair, UCL Respiratory, University College London"}, "35478426700": {"Name": "Chambers R.C.", "AuthorID": "35478426700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Inflammation and Tissue Repair, UCL Respiratory, University College London"}, "56708061100": {"Name": "Robinson E.", "AuthorID": "56708061100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "24536976100": {"Name": "Chudasama V.", "AuthorID": "24536976100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "7006818968": {"Name": "Caddick S.", "AuthorID": "7006818968", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "55676848100": {"Name": "Jarai G.", "AuthorID": "55676848100", "AffiliationID": "117743299", "AffiliationName": "Novartis Institutes of Biomedical Research"}}}
