A novel proton tracking detector is described and experimental demonstrations at a therapy facility are reported. A new type of proton CT reconstructing relative \"scattering power\" rather than \"stopping power\" is also demonstrated. Notably, this new type of imaging does not require the measurement of the residual energies of the protons. Methods: A large area, silicon microstrip tracker with high spatial and temporal resolution has been developed by the Proton Radiotherapy Verification and Dosimetry Applications consortium and commissioned using beams of protons at iThemba LABS, Medical Radiation Department, South Africa. The tracker comprises twelve planes of silicon developed using technology from high energy physics with each plane having an active area of \u223c 10\u00d710 cm segmented into 2048 microstrips. The tracker is organized into four separate units each containing three detectors at 60\u00b0 to one another creating an x-u-v coordinate system. Pairs of tracking units are used to reconstruct vertices for protons 6129 M entering and exiting a phantom containing tissue equivalent inserts. By measuring the position and direction of each proton before and after the phantom, the nonlinear path for each proton through an object can be reconstructed. Results: Experimental results are reported for tracking the path of protons with initial energies of 125 and 191 MeV. A spherical phantom of 75 mm diameter was imaged by positioning it between the entrance and exit detectors of the tracker. Positions and directions of individual protons were used to create angular distributions and 2D fluence maps of the beam. These results were acquired for 36 equally spaced projections spanning 180\u00b0, allowing, for the first time, an experimental CT image based upon the relative scattering power of protons to be reconstructed. Conclusions: Successful tracking of protons through a thick target (phantom) has demonstrated that the tracker discussed in this paper can provide the precise directional information needed to perform proton radiography and tomography. When synchronized with a range telescope, this could enable the reconstruction of proton CT images of stopping power. Furthermore, by measuring the deflection of many protons through a phantom, it was demonstrated that it is possible to reconstruct a new kind of CT image (scattering power) based upon this tracking information alone.", "AuthorKeywords": ["dosimetry", "particle therapy", "proton computed tomography", "proton therapy", "silicon strip detector"], "IndexKeywords": ["Directional information", "Experimental demonstrations", "Particle therapy", "Proton computed tomography", "Proton therapy", "Silicon microstrip trackers", "Silicon Strip Detectors", "Spatial and temporal resolutions", "Humans", "Image Processing, Computer-Assisted", "Protons", "Radiometry", "Silicon", "Tomography, X-Ray Computed"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84994045062", "SubjectAreas": [["Biophysics", "BIOC", "1304"], ["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"57214095668": {"Name": "Taylor J.T.", "AuthorID": "57214095668", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of Liverpool"}, "7004370223": {"Name": "Casse G.L.", "AuthorID": "7004370223", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of Liverpool"}, "55939030800": {"Name": "Poludniowski G.", "AuthorID": "55939030800", "AffiliationID": "60021097", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Vision Speech and Signal Processing, Faculty of Engineering and Physical Sciences, University of Surrey"}, "57220203026": {"Name": "Evans P.M.", "AuthorID": "57220203026", "AffiliationID": "60021097", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Vision Speech and Signal Processing, Faculty of Engineering and Physical Sciences, University of Surrey"}, "57200072436": {"Name": "Price T.", "AuthorID": "57200072436", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "School of Physics and Astronomy, University of Birmingham"}, "56224636200": {"Name": "Allport P.P.", "AuthorID": "56224636200", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "School of Physics and Astronomy, University of Birmingham"}, "7403569150": {"Name": "Green S.", "AuthorID": "7403569150", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "School of Physics and Astronomy, University of Birmingham"}, "57199462330": {"Name": "Parker D.J.", "AuthorID": "57199462330", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "School of Physics and Astronomy, University of Birmingham"}, "6603633753": {"Name": "Waltham C.", "AuthorID": "6603633753", "AffiliationID": "60026830", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Vision Engineering, School of Computer Science, University of Lincoln"}, "36961064600": {"Name": "Esposito M.", "AuthorID": "36961064600", "AffiliationID": "60026830", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Vision Engineering, School of Computer Science, University of Lincoln"}, "24521258200": {"Name": "Allinson N.M.", "AuthorID": "24521258200", "AffiliationID": "60026830", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Vision Engineering, School of Computer Science, University of Lincoln"}, "57140741400": {"Name": "Manger S.", "AuthorID": "57140741400", "AffiliationID": "60022020", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of Warwick"}, "6701509027": {"Name": "Manolopoulos S.", "AuthorID": "6701509027", "AffiliationID": "60006343", "AffiliationName": "University Hospitals Coventry, Warwickshire NHS Trust"}, "56158307900": {"Name": "Nieto-Camero J.", "AuthorID": "56158307900", "AffiliationID": "60016780", "AffiliationName": "IThemba LABS"}, "56808151400": {"Name": "Symons J.", "AuthorID": "56808151400", "AffiliationID": "60016780", "AffiliationName": "IThemba LABS"}}}
