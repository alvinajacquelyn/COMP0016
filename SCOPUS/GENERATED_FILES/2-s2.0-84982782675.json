Administration of supplemental oxygen is common in paediatric intensive care. We explored the current practice of oxygen administration using a case vignette in paediatric intensive care units (PICU) in the United Kingdom. Methods. We conducted an online survey of Paediatric Intensive Care Society members in the UK. The survey outlined a clinical scenario followed by questions on oxygenation targets for 5 common diagnoses seen in critically ill children. Results. Fifty-three paediatric intensive care unit members from 10 institutions completed the survey. In a child with moderate ventilatory requirements, 21 respondents (42%) did not follow arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) targets. In acute respiratory distress syndrome, cardiac arrest, and sepsis, there was a trend to aim for lower PaO2 as the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) increased. Conversely, in traumatic brain injury and pulmonary hypertension, respondents aimed for normal PaO2 even as the FiO2 increased. Conclusions. In this sample of clinicians PaO2 targets were not commonly used. Clinicians target lower PaO2 as FiO2 increases in acute respiratory distress syndrome, cardiac arrest, and sepsis whilst targeting normal range irrespective of FiO2 in traumatic brain injury and pulmonary hypertension.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84982782675", "SubjectAreas": [["Critical Care and Intensive Care Medicine", "MEDI", "2706"]], "AuthorData": {"36022965700": {"Name": "Raman S.", "AuthorID": "36022965700", "AffiliationID": "60018207, 60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Respiratory, Critical Care and Anaesthesia Group, Infection, Immunity, Inflammation and Physiological Medicine Programme, Institute of Child Health, University College London and Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "56801266700": {"Name": "Ray S.", "AuthorID": "56801266700", "AffiliationID": "60018207, 60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Respiratory, Critical Care and Anaesthesia Group, Infection, Immunity, Inflammation and Physiological Medicine Programme, Institute of Child Health, University College London and Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "7402415882": {"Name": "Peters M.J.", "AuthorID": "7402415882", "AffiliationID": "60018207, 60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Respiratory, Critical Care and Anaesthesia Group, Infection, Immunity, Inflammation and Physiological Medicine Programme, Institute of Child Health, University College London and Great Ormond Street Hospital"}}}
