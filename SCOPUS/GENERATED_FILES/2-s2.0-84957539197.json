Here we demonstrate that spectral domain optical coherence phase microscopy (SD-OCPM), which combines the principles of optical coherence tomography (OCT) and confocal microscopy, is particularly well-suited for characterization of both morphology and the ciliary dynamics of mouse trachea. We present micro-anatomical images of mouse trachea, where different cell types can be clearly visualized. The phase contrast, which measures the sub-nanometer changes in axial optical pathlength is used to determine the frequency and direction of cilia beatings.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Anatomical images", "Cell types", "Optical coherence phase microscopy", "Optical path lengths", "Phase contrasts", "Spectral domains", "Sub nanometers"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84957539197", "SubjectAreas": [["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"]], "AuthorData": {"24069910700": {"Name": "Ansari R.", "AuthorID": "24069910700", "AffiliationID": "60012408", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Biomedical Optics, University of L\u00fcbeck"}, "56394392400": {"Name": "Buj C.", "AuthorID": "56394392400", "AffiliationID": "60012408", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Biomedical Optics, University of L\u00fcbeck"}, "6701727108": {"Name": "H\u00fcttmann G.", "AuthorID": "6701727108", "AffiliationID": "113740961", "AffiliationName": "Airway Research Center North (ARCN), German Center for Lung Research (DZL)"}, "56678411700": {"Name": "Pieper M.", "AuthorID": "56678411700", "AffiliationID": "113740961", "AffiliationName": "Airway Research Center North (ARCN), German Center for Lung Research (DZL)"}, "56271100400": {"Name": "K\u00f6nig P.", "AuthorID": "56271100400", "AffiliationID": "113740961", "AffiliationName": "Airway Research Center North (ARCN), German Center for Lung Research (DZL)"}, "6603931368": {"Name": "Schweikard A.", "AuthorID": "6603931368", "AffiliationID": "60012408", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Robotics and Cognitive Systems, University of L\u00fcbeck"}}}
