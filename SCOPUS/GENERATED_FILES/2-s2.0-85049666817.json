The adjoint of the associated continuous forward operator is derived, and a numerical framework for computing this adjoint based on a k-space pseudo-spectral method is presented. We analytically show that the derived continuous adjoint matches the adjoint of an associated discretised forward operator. We include this adjoint in a first-order positivity constrained optimisation algorithm that is regularised by total variation minimisation, and show that the iterates monotonically converge to a minimiser of an objective function, even in the presence of some error in estimating the physical parameters of the medium.", "AuthorKeywords": ["absorption and dispersion", "brain", "continuous adjoint", "fractional Laplacian", "frequency power law", "photo-acoustic tomography"], "IndexKeywords": ["Continuous adjoint", "Fractional Laplacian", "Fractional laplacian operators", "Objective functions", "Physical dispersion", "Power-law", "Propagation of sounds", "Pseudospectral methods"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85049666817", "SubjectAreas": [["Theoretical Computer Science", "MATH", "2614"], ["Signal Processing", "COMP", "1711"], ["Mathematical Physics", "MATH", "2610"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"57217338029": {"Name": "Javaherian A.", "AuthorID": "57217338029", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "School of Mathematics, University of Manchester"}, "35102289500": {"Name": "Holman S.", "AuthorID": "35102289500", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "School of Mathematics, University of Manchester"}}}
