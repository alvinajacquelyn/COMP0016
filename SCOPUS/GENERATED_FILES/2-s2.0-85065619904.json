The aim was to identify knowledge gaps that could be targeted in screening information materials or public education campaigns. We used a cross-sectional design to survey women aged 25 to 64 years living in Great Britain, identified as cervical screening non-participants through self-report questions. Data were collected via a household survey. Survey questions measured awareness of risk factors for cervical cancer and socio-demographic factors. Screening non-participants were included in the study (n = 793) and classified into non-participant groups based on the Precaution Adoption Process Model. Across the sample, 57% of participants identified \u2018not going for regular smear tests\u2019 as a risk factor for cervical cancer. Women who intended to be screened were more likely to identify this risk factor than other non-participant groups (OR = 2.13, 95% CI: 1.51\u20132.99). Women age 55\u201364 years (OR = 0.60, 95% CI: 0.39\u20130.93) and women from non-white ethnic backgrounds (OR = 0.70, 95% CI: 0.52\u20130.94) were less likely to recognise this risk factor. Recognition was lower for \u2018infection with human papillomavirus\u2019 (41%). Just over half the sample were aware that screening non-attendance is associated with increased cervical cancer risk, suggesting that non\u2013attendance at screening is not always based on an accurate understanding of the offer. Overall, non-participants are poorly informed about cervical cancer risk factors and further work is needed to ensure that women are making informed choices about (non-) participation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cervical cancer screening", "HPV", "Informed choice", "Knowledge", "Sexual health"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Demography", "Early Detection of Cancer", "Female", "Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice", "Humans", "Middle Aged", "Papillomavirus Infections", "Patient Acceptance of Health Care", "Risk Factors", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "United Kingdom", "Uterine Cervical Neoplasms"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85065619904", "SubjectAreas": [["Epidemiology", "MEDI", "2713"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"57208719314": {"Name": "Ryan M.", "AuthorID": "57208719314", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL, Research Department of Behavioural Science and Health, Institute of Epidemiology & Health Care"}, "6508131110": {"Name": "Marlow L.", "AuthorID": "6508131110", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL, Research Department of Behavioural Science and Health, Institute of Epidemiology & Health Care"}, "57191898211": {"Name": "Waller J.", "AuthorID": "57191898211", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL, Research Department of Behavioural Science and Health, Institute of Epidemiology & Health Care"}}}
