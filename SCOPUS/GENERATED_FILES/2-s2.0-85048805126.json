Methods: Multicentre cohort study of 668 adults, aged 16 to 70, admitted to 4 UK NHS hospital trusts. Data on injury, socio-demographic characteristics and health status was collected at recruitment. Depression, anxiety and post-traumatic distress were measured at 1, 2, 4 and 12 months post-injury. Multilevel linear regression assessed associations between patient and injury characteristics and psychological outcomes over 12 months follow-up. Results: Depression, anxiety and post-traumatic distress scores were highest 1 month post-injury, and remained above baseline at 2, 4 and 12 months post-injury. Moderate or severe injuries, previous psychiatric diagnoses, higher pre-injury depression and anxiety scores, middle age (45\u201364 years), greater deprivation and lower pre-injury quality of life (QoL) were associated with higher depression scores post-injury. Previous psychiatric diagnoses, higher pre-injury depression and anxiety scores, middle age, greater deprivation and lower pre-injury QoL were associated with higher anxiety scores post-injury. Traffic injuries or injuries from being struck by objects, multiple injures (\u22653), being female, previous psychiatric diagnoses, higher pre-injury anxiety scores and greater deprivation were associated with higher post-traumatic distress scores post-injury. Conclusion: A range of risk factors, identifiable shortly after injury, are associated with psychological morbidity occurring up to 12 months post-injury in a general trauma population. Further research is required to explore the utility of these, and other risk factors in predicting psychological morbidity on an individual patient basis.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Anxiety", "Depression", "Injury", "PTSD", "Trauma"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Anxiety", "Cohort Studies", "Depression", "Female", "Hospitalization", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Quality of Life", "Risk Factors", "Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic", "Wounds and Injuries", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85048805126", "SubjectAreas": [["Clinical Psychology", "PSYC", "3203"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"7006870304": {"Name": "Kendrick D.", "AuthorID": "7006870304", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "Division of Primary Care, School of Medicine, University of Nottingham"}, "56601036600": {"Name": "Baker R.", "AuthorID": "56601036600", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "Division of Primary Care, School of Medicine, University of Nottingham"}, "55680916900": {"Name": "Hill T.", "AuthorID": "55680916900", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "Division of Primary Care, School of Medicine, University of Nottingham"}, "7003598940": {"Name": "Coupland C.", "AuthorID": "7003598940", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "Division of Primary Care, School of Medicine, University of Nottingham"}, "55928549900": {"Name": "Beckett K.", "AuthorID": "55928549900", "AffiliationID": "60019611", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Health & Clinical Research, University of the West of England"}, "25931569700": {"Name": "Kellezi B.", "AuthorID": "25931569700", "AffiliationID": "60006029", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Nottingham Trent University"}, "34770520100": {"Name": "Joseph S.", "AuthorID": "34770520100", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "School of Education, University of Nottingham"}, "55415843900": {"Name": "Barnes J.", "AuthorID": "55415843900", "AffiliationID": "60000891", "AffiliationName": "Loughborough Design School, Loughborough University"}, "23111755700": {"Name": "Sleney J.", "AuthorID": "23111755700", "AffiliationID": "60021097", "AffiliationName": "Department of Sociology, University of Surrey"}, "57210406972": {"Name": "Christie N.", "AuthorID": "57210406972", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Transport Studies, University College London"}, "7004056331": {"Name": "Morriss R.", "AuthorID": "7004056331", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry and Applied Psychology, University of Nottingham"}}}
