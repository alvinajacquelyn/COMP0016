We conducted a multi-centre cross-sectional study in 278 COPD patients aged 41\u201392 years in London, UK. Details of potential environmental determinants of vitamin D status and COPD symptom control and severity were collected by questionnaire, and blood samples were taken for analysis of serum 25(OH)D concentration and DNA extraction. All participants performed spirometry and underwent measurement of weight and height. Quadriceps muscle strength (QS) was measured in 134 participants, and sputum induction with enumeration of lower airway eosinophil and neutrophil counts was performed for 44 participants. Thirty-seven single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in 11 genes in the vitamin D pathway (DBP, DHCR7, CYP2R1, CYP27B1, CYP24A1, CYP27A1, CYP3A4, LRP2, CUBN, RXRA, and VDR) were typed using Taqman allelic discrimination assays. Linear regression was used to identify environmental and genetic factors independently associated with serum 25(OH)D concentration and to determine whether vitamin D status or genetic factors independently associated with % predicted forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), % predicted forced vital capacity (FVC), the ratio of FEV1 to FVC (FEV1:FVC), daily inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) dose, respiratory quality of life (QoL), QS, and the percentage of eosinophils and neutrophils in induced sputum. Mean serum 25(OH)D concentration was 45.4 nmol/L (SD 25.3); 171/278 (61.5%) participants were vitamin D deficient (serum 25[OH]D concentration <50 nmol/L). Lower vitamin D status was independently associated with higher body mass index (P = 0.001), lower socio-economic position (P = 0.037), lack of vitamin D supplement consumption (P < 0.001), sampling in Winter or Spring (P for trend = 0.006) and lack of a recent sunny holiday (P = 0.002). Vitamin D deficiency associated with reduced % predicted FEV1 (P for trend = 0.060) and % predicted FVC (P for trend = 0.003), but it did not associate with FEV1:FVC, ICS dose, QoL, QS, or the percentage of eosinophils or neutrophils in induced sputum. After correction for multiple comparisons testing, genetic variation in the vitamin D pathway was not found to associate with serum 25(OH)D concentration or clinical correlates of COPD severity. Vitamin D deficiency was common in this group of COPD patients in the UK, and it associated independently with reduced % predicted FEV1 and FVC. However, genetic variation in the vitamin D pathway was not associated with vitamin D status or severity of COPD.", "AuthorKeywords": ["COPD", "FEV1", "FVC", "Single nucleotide polymorphism", "Spirometry", "Vitamin D"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Body Mass Index", "Continental Population Groups", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System", "DNA-Binding Proteins", "Eosinophils", "Female", "Gene Expression Regulation", "Humans", "London", "Low Density Lipoprotein Receptor-Related Protein-2", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Neutrophils", "Oxidoreductases Acting on CH-CH Group Donors", "Prevalence", "Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive", "Receptors, Calcitriol", "Receptors, Cell Surface", "Respiratory Function Tests", "Severity of Illness Index", "Transcription Factors", "Vitamin D", "Vitamin D Deficiency"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85012914310", "SubjectAreas": [["Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism", "MEDI", "2712"], ["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Molecular Medicine", "BIOC", "1313"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Endocrinology", "BIOC", "1310"], ["Clinical Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1308"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"55535210400": {"Name": "Jolliffe D.A.", "AuthorID": "55535210400", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Primary Care and Public Health, Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London"}, "23974560100": {"Name": "James W.Y.", "AuthorID": "23974560100", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Primary Care and Public Health, Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London"}, "7103282229": {"Name": "Hooper R.L.", "AuthorID": "7103282229", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Primary Care and Public Health, Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London"}, "57203032627": {"Name": "Barnes N.C.", "AuthorID": "57203032627", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60111945, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Asthma UK Centre for Applied Research, Blizard Institute, Queen Mary University of London"}, "55981268300": {"Name": "Greiller C.L.", "AuthorID": "55981268300", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Primary Care and Public Health, Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London"}, "57217626794": {"Name": "Islam K.", "AuthorID": "57217626794", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Primary Care and Public Health, Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London"}, "7202400704": {"Name": "Walton R.T.", "AuthorID": "7202400704", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Primary Care and Public Health, Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London"}, "55228809500": {"Name": "Griffiths C.J.", "AuthorID": "55228809500", "AffiliationID": "60011520, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC and the Asthma UK Centre for Allergic Mechanisms in Asthma, King's College London"}, "6701779026": {"Name": "Martineau A.R.", "AuthorID": "6701779026", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60111945, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Asthma UK Centre for Applied Research, Blizard Institute, Queen Mary University of London"}, "7006533792": {"Name": "Bhowmik A.", "AuthorID": "7006533792", "AffiliationID": "60005523", "AffiliationName": "Homerton University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, Homerton Row"}, "57203138021": {"Name": "Timms P.M.", "AuthorID": "57203138021", "AffiliationID": "60005523", "AffiliationName": "Homerton University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, Homerton Row"}, "7801616080": {"Name": "Rajakulasingam R.K.", "AuthorID": "7801616080", "AffiliationID": "60005523", "AffiliationName": "Homerton University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, Homerton Row"}, "23974559800": {"Name": "Choudhury A.B.", "AuthorID": "23974559800", "AffiliationID": "60007937", "AffiliationName": "Queen's Hospital, Rom Valley Way, Romford"}, "16836963600": {"Name": "Simcock D.E.", "AuthorID": "16836963600", "AffiliationID": "60010088", "AffiliationName": "Royal London Hospital"}, "55884875400": {"Name": "Hypp\u00f6nen E.", "AuthorID": "55884875400", "AffiliationID": "60108899, 60031846", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Population Health Research, School of Health Sciences and Sansom Institute of Health Research, University of South Australia South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute"}, "7005858267": {"Name": "Corrigan C.J.", "AuthorID": "7005858267", "AffiliationID": "60011520, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC and the Asthma UK Centre for Allergic Mechanisms in Asthma, King's College London"}}}
