In mice exhibiting a genetically engineered block of the visual cycle, vision was recently successfully restored by oral administration of 9-cis-retinyl acetate (QLT091001). Safety and visual outcomes of a once-daily oral dose of 40 mg/m2/day QLT091001 for 7 consecutive days was investigated in an international, multi-center, open-label, proof-of-concept study in 18 patients with RPE65- or LRAT-related retinitis pigmentosa. Eight of 18 patients (44%) showed a \u226520% increase and 4 of 18 (22%) showed a \u226540% increase in functional retinal area determined from Goldmann visual fields; 12 (67%) and 5 (28%) of 18 patients showed a \u22655 and \u226510 ETDRS letter score increase of visual acuity, respectively, in one or both eyes at two or more visits within 2 months of treatment. In two patients who underwent fMRI, a significant positive response was measured to stimuli of medium contrast, moving, pattern targets in both left and right hemispheres of the occipital cortex. There were no serious adverse events. Treatment-related adverse events were transient and the most common included headache, photophobia, nausea, vomiting, and minor biochemical abnormalities. Measuring the outer segment length of the photoreceptor layer with high-definition optical coherence tomography was highly predictive of treatment responses with responders having a significantly larger baseline outer segment thickness (11.7 \u00b1 4.8 \u03bcm, mean \u00b1 95% CI) than non-responders (3.5 \u00b1 1.2 \u03bcm). This structure-function relationship suggests that treatment with QLT091001 is more likely to be efficacious if there is sufficient photoreceptor integrity.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Acyltransferases", "Administration, Oral", "Adult", "Anticarcinogenic Agents", "Cerebral Cortex", "Child", "cis-trans-Isomerases", "Drug Dosage Calculations", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide", "Radiography", "Retinal Ganglion Cells", "Retinal Neurons", "Retinitis Pigmentosa", "Treatment Outcome", "Visual Acuity", "Visual Fields", "Vitamin A", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84955599907", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"7006706337": {"Name": "Scholl H.P.N.", "AuthorID": "7006706337", "AffiliationID": "60015891, 60005248", "AffiliationName": "Wilmer Eye Institute, Johns Hopkins University"}, "35268008200": {"Name": "Bittner A.", "AuthorID": "35268008200", "AffiliationID": "60019600", "AffiliationName": "Nova Southeastern University, College of Optometry"}, "54793970600": {"Name": "Bowles K.", "AuthorID": "54793970600", "AffiliationID": "60005837", "AffiliationName": "College of Optometry, University of Houston"}, "57014524200": {"Name": "Fletcher E.C.", "AuthorID": "57014524200", "AffiliationID": "116281270", "AffiliationName": "Gloucester Royal NHS Foundation Trust, Gloucester Royal Hospitals"}, "7003576503": {"Name": "Dagnelie G.", "AuthorID": "7003576503", "AffiliationID": "60015891, 60005248", "AffiliationName": "Wilmer Eye Institute, Johns Hopkins University"}, "56573251100": {"Name": "Moore A.T.", "AuthorID": "56573251100", "AffiliationID": "60023691", "AffiliationName": "Dept. of Ophthalmology, University of California San Francisco"}, "57079241700": {"Name": "Eposti S.D.", "AuthorID": "57079241700", "AffiliationID": "60016691, 60022148, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital, Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}, "7101991490": {"Name": "Michaelides M.", "AuthorID": "7101991490", "AffiliationID": "60016691, 60022148, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital, Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}, "7004058713": {"Name": "Koenekoop R.K.", "AuthorID": "7004058713", "AffiliationID": "60006558", "AffiliationName": "McGill University Health Centre"}, "6603714979": {"Name": "Mendola J.D.", "AuthorID": "6603714979", "AffiliationID": "60006558", "AffiliationName": "McGill University Health Centre"}, "36859753100": {"Name": "Wen Y.", "AuthorID": "36859753100", "AffiliationID": "60031742", "AffiliationName": "Baylor Visual Function Center, Baylor University Medical Center"}, "56852126400": {"Name": "Birch D.G.", "AuthorID": "56852126400", "AffiliationID": "60026695", "AffiliationName": "Ophthalmology, UT Southwestern"}, "57203917402": {"Name": "Fishman G.A.", "AuthorID": "57203917402", "AffiliationID": "109539828", "AffiliationName": "Chicago Lighthouse, Pangere Center for Inherited Retinal Diseases"}, "55948506300": {"Name": "Collison F.T.", "AuthorID": "55948506300", "AffiliationID": "109539828", "AffiliationName": "Chicago Lighthouse, Pangere Center for Inherited Retinal Diseases"}, "6602839807": {"Name": "Van Den Born L.I.", "AuthorID": "6602839807", "AffiliationID": "60070145", "AffiliationName": "Rotterdam Eye Hospital and Ophthalmic Institute"}, "7005835926": {"Name": "Saperstein D.A.", "AuthorID": "7005835926", "AffiliationID": "60022724", "AffiliationName": "QLT Inc."}, "6603863868": {"Name": "Schuchard R.A.", "AuthorID": "6603863868", "AffiliationID": "60032838", "AffiliationName": "Stanford Univ School of Medicine"}, "7401646215": {"Name": "Barnes C.", "AuthorID": "7401646215", "AffiliationID": "60028084", "AffiliationName": "VA Palo Alto Health Care System"}, "6505871526": {"Name": "Zein W.", "AuthorID": "6505871526", "AffiliationID": "60007651, 60006577", "AffiliationName": "Division of Epidemiology and Clinical Research, National Eye Institute, National Institutes of Health"}, "36103632100": {"Name": "Zobor D.", "AuthorID": "36103632100", "AffiliationID": "60017246", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Ophthalmic Research, Center for Ophthalmology, University of T\u00fcbingen"}, "7102983509": {"Name": "Zrenner E.", "AuthorID": "7102983509", "AffiliationID": "60017246", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Ophthalmic Research, Center for Ophthalmology, University of T\u00fcbingen"}}}
