We investigate these interactions during LAM of stainless steel SS316L and 13-93 bioactive glass powders using a custom built LAM process replicator (LAMPR) with in situ and operando synchrotron X-ray real-time radiography. This reveals a wide range of melt track solidification phenomena as well as spatter and porosity formation. We hypothesise that the SS316L powder absorbs the laser energy at its surface while the trace elements in the 13-93 bioactive glass powder absorb and remit the infra-red radiation. Our results show that a low viscosity melt, e.g. 8 mPa s for SS316L, tends to generate spatter (diameter up to 250 \u03bcm and an average spatter velocity of 0.26 m s \u22121 ) and form a melt track by molten pool wetting. In contrast, a high viscosity melt, e.g. 2 Pa s for 13-93 bioactive glass, inhibits spatter formation by damping the Marangoni convection, forming a melt track via viscous flow. The viscous flow in 13-93 bioactive glass resists pore transport; combined with the reboil effect, this promotes pore growth during LAM, resulting in a pore size up to 600 times larger than that exhibited in the SS316L sample.", "AuthorKeywords": ["13-93 bioactive glass", "In situ", "Molten pool dynamics", "SS316L", "X-ray imaging"], "IndexKeywords": ["Laser additive manufacturing", "Laser-matter interactions", "Marangoni convection", "Molten pool", "Real-time radiography", "SS316L", "Synchrotron x rays", "Xray imaging"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85054452064", "SubjectAreas": [["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Engineering (miscellaneous)", "ENGI", "2201"], ["Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering", "ENGI", "2209"]], "AuthorData": {"57201552479": {"Name": "Leung C.L.A.", "AuthorID": "57201552479", "AffiliationID": "60023254", "AffiliationName": "Research Complex at Harwell, Science & Technology Facilities Council, Rutherford Appleton Laboratory"}, "8504683300": {"Name": "Lee P.D.", "AuthorID": "8504683300", "AffiliationID": "60023254", "AffiliationName": "Research Complex at Harwell, Science & Technology Facilities Council, Rutherford Appleton Laboratory"}, "57201556830": {"Name": "Marussi S.", "AuthorID": "57201556830", "AffiliationID": "60003771, 60176593", "AffiliationName": "Henry Royce Institute, School of Materials, The University of Manchester"}, "7004415080": {"Name": "Towrie M.", "AuthorID": "7004415080", "AffiliationID": "60023254, 60009523", "AffiliationName": "Central Laser Facility, Research Complex at Harwell, UK Research & Innovation - Science & Technology Facilities Council, Rutherford Appleton Laboratory"}, "7102893317": {"Name": "Withers P.J.", "AuthorID": "7102893317", "AffiliationID": "60003771, 60176593", "AffiliationName": "Henry Royce Institute, School of Materials, The University of Manchester"}, "56522729400": {"Name": "del Val Garcia J.", "AuthorID": "56522729400", "AffiliationID": "60026134", "AffiliationName": "Applied Physics Department, University of Vigo, EEI, Lagoas-Marcosende"}, "7004160996": {"Name": "Atwood R.C.", "AuthorID": "7004160996", "AffiliationID": "60104663", "AffiliationName": "Diamond Light Source Ltd, Harwell Science & Innovation Campus"}, "57064238500": {"Name": "Bodey A.J.", "AuthorID": "57064238500", "AffiliationID": "60104663", "AffiliationName": "Diamond Light Source Ltd, Harwell Science & Innovation Campus"}, "7408055653": {"Name": "Jones J.R.", "AuthorID": "7408055653", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials, Imperial College London, South Kensington Campus"}}}
