We assessed the relationship of pubertal timing, in both men (n = 672) and women (n = 713), with vascular (carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT), pulse wave velocity (PWV)) and cardiac (left ventricular (LV) structure and function) measures recorded at age 60\u201364 yrs in a British birth cohort study. Regression models found that earlier menarche was associated with higher (more adverse) LV mass, LV end diastolic volume and left atrial volume, but not with other cardiac measures, cIMT or PWV. Associations were attenuated after adjustment for either adult or childhood BMI (e.g. mean difference in LV mass per year later menarche: \u22124.2 g (95% CI:\u22127.0,\u22121.4) reducing to \u22122.2 g (95% CI:\u22124.7,0.4) after adjustment for adult BMI). There were no associations among men, despite those fully mature at 15 yrs having higher blood pressure than the least mature group by 10.21 mmHg (95% CI:19.45,0.98). Any effect of pubertal timing on vascular and cardiac structure and function is likely to be small and primarily confounded by pre-pubertal BMI and/or mediated through adult adiposity.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adrenarche", "Cardiovascular Diseases", "Carotid Arteries", "Female", "Heart", "Hemodynamics", "Humans", "Male", "Menarche", "Middle Aged", "Tunica Intima"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85069931427", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"57204025615": {"Name": "Hardy R.", "AuthorID": "57204025615", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Unit for Lifelong Health and Ageing at UCL, Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}, "55577193000": {"Name": "Maddock J.", "AuthorID": "55577193000", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Unit for Lifelong Health and Ageing at UCL, Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}, "57207789660": {"Name": "Hughes A.D.", "AuthorID": "57207789660", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Unit for Lifelong Health and Ageing at UCL, Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}, "8329745200": {"Name": "Kuh D.", "AuthorID": "8329745200", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Unit for Lifelong Health and Ageing at UCL, Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}, "47161200500": {"Name": "Ghosh A.K.", "AuthorID": "47161200500", "AffiliationID": "60004093", "AffiliationName": "Barts Heart Centre, St Bartholomew\u2019s Hospital"}}}
