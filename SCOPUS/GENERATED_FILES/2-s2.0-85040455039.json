Despite increasing interest, specific and effective treatment strategies for post-traumatic sleep-wake disturbances are still missing. With the present work, therefore, we aimed at studying acute and chronic sleep-wake disturbances by electrophysiological means, and at assessing their histological correlates after closed diffuse traumatic brain injury in rats with the ultimate goal of generating a model of post-traumatic sleep-wake disturbances and associated histopathological findings that accurately represents the human condition. We assessed sleep-wake behavior by means of standard electrophysiological recordings before and 1, 7, and 28 days after sham or traumatic brain injury procedures. Sleep-wake findings were then correlated to immunohistochemically labeled and stereologically quantified neuronal arousal systems. Compared with control animals, we found that closed diffuse traumatic brain injury caused increased sleep need one month after trauma, and sleep was more consolidated. As histological correlate, we found a reduced number of histamine immunoreactive cells in the tuberomammillary nucleus, potentially related to increased neuroinflammation. Monoaminergic and hypocretinergic neurotransmitter systems in the hypothalamus and rostral brainstem were not affected, however. These results suggest that our rat traumatic brain injury model reflects human post-traumatic sleep-wake disturbances and associated histopathological findings very accurately, thus providing a study platform for novel treatment strategies for affected patients.", "AuthorKeywords": ["histamine", "orexin/hypocretin", "post-traumatic pleiosomnia", "rat model of sleep-wake disturbances", "sleep-wake centers", "sleep-wake disturbances", "traumatic brain injury", "tuberomammillary nucleus"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Brain", "Brain Injuries, Traumatic", "Disease Models, Animal", "Histamine", "Male", "Neurons", "Rats", "Rats, Sprague-Dawley", "Sleep Disorders, Circadian Rhythm"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85040455039", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"6504326570": {"Name": "Noain D.", "AuthorID": "6504326570", "AffiliationID": "60019636, 60019619, 60012614", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, University Hospital of Zurich, University of Zurich"}, "26038974900": {"Name": "B\u00fcchele F.", "AuthorID": "26038974900", "AffiliationID": "60019636, 60019619, 60012614", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, University Hospital of Zurich, University of Zurich"}, "53867273100": {"Name": "Schreglmann S.", "AuthorID": "53867273100", "AffiliationID": "60019636, 60019619, 60012614", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, University Hospital of Zurich, University of Zurich"}, "24281992400": {"Name": "Valko P.", "AuthorID": "24281992400", "AffiliationID": "60019636, 60019619, 60012614", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, University Hospital of Zurich, University of Zurich"}, "36870403200": {"Name": "Gavrilov Y.", "AuthorID": "36870403200", "AffiliationID": "60019636, 60019619, 60012614", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, University Hospital of Zurich, University of Zurich"}, "57188556523": {"Name": "Morawska M.", "AuthorID": "57188556523", "AffiliationID": "60019636, 60019619, 60012614", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, University Hospital of Zurich, University of Zurich"}, "6507251817": {"Name": "Imbach L.", "AuthorID": "6507251817", "AffiliationID": "60019636, 60019619, 60012614", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, University Hospital of Zurich, University of Zurich"}, "8510916500": {"Name": "Baumann C.", "AuthorID": "8510916500", "AffiliationID": "60019636, 60019619, 60012614", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, University Hospital of Zurich, University of Zurich"}}}
