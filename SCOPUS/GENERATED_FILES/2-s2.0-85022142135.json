Viewed in this light, children's enactment of uncaused and reversible deaths in ludic activity is considered evidence of developmental \u2018immaturity\u2019. Such interpretations, however, fundamentally misplace the contestive and transformative aspects of play [Henricks, T. S. (2006). Play reconsidered: Sociological perspectives on human expression. Urbana: University of Illinois Press]. In contrast, this article argues for the importance of figurative interpretations of children's play. Drawing on data generated in an ethnographic study at an early years setting in West London, it will be suggested that the death trope served as a generative metaphor in the peer culture, its everyday world characteristics provoking relatively stable responses in the face of uncertainties and ambiguities encountered in ludic activity. The use of the death trope made intimate, caring touch between children permissible, rather than just a by-product of small play spaces filled with many bodies.", "AuthorKeywords": ["childhood", "death", "generative metaphor", "imaginative play", "peer culture", "touch"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85022142135", "SubjectAreas": [["Cultural Studies", "SOCI", "3316"], ["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"], ["Anthropology", "SOCI", "3314"]], "AuthorData": {"35726898900": {"Name": "Rosen R.", "AuthorID": "35726898900", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "Social Science Research Unit, UCL Institute of Education"}}}
