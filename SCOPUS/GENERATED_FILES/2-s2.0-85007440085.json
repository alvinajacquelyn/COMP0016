It is a long process with large dimensions. Nowadays, satellite provides a regular platform to take measurements of all sensitivity factors of Earth. However, measurements taken from satellite platform is only available in a limited region on Earth with a short observing time. This is a new challenge for the purpose to observe large scale, long period Earth phenomena. In recent years, there has been a renewed interest in the development of robotic and manned exploration missions to the Moon. Here we propose the possibility of observing large-scale Earth phenomena from a lunar base. Atmospheric gravity waves, which is of interest to atmospheric research and important to the global change, are discussed as a sensitivity factor for lunar-based observation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["atmospheric gravity waves", "global change", "lunar base"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85007440085", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Earth and Planetary Sciences (all)", "EART", "1900"]], "AuthorData": {"56767589600": {"Name": "Kaufmann M.", "AuthorID": "56767589600", "AffiliationID": "60007774", "AffiliationName": "Forschungszentrum J\u00fclich GmbH, Institute of Energy and Climate Research, Stratosphere (IEK-7)"}, "55760765100": {"Name": "Song R.", "AuthorID": "55760765100", "AffiliationID": "60007774", "AffiliationName": "Forschungszentrum J\u00fclich GmbH, Institute of Energy and Climate Research, Stratosphere (IEK-7)"}}}
