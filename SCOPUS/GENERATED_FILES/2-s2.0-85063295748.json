This enduring concept of disease definition and classification based on the clinicopathologic phenotype was pioneered in the premolecular era. Advances in molecular genetics have brought into focus the increased blurring of the original seemingly \u201cwatertight\u201d categories through broadening of the clinical phenotypes in existing genes, and continuous identification of novel genetic backgrounds. This review summarizes the histopathologic landscape of the 4 \u201cclassical\u201d subtypes of CM\u2014nemaline myopathies, core myopathies, centronuclear myopathies, and congenital fiber type disproportion and some of the emerging and novel genetic diseases with a CM presentation.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Humans", "Muscle Weakness", "Muscle, Skeletal", "Mutation", "Myopathies, Structural, Congenital", "Phenotype"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85063295748", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"26535084400": {"Name": "Phadke R.", "AuthorID": "26535084400", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology"}}}
