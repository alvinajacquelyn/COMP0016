We find that the projected dark matter density profile - under the assumption of a Chabrier stellar initial mass function - shows significant variation from galaxy to galaxy. Those with an outermost image beyond ~10 kpc are very well fit by a projected Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile; those with images within 10 kpc appear to be more concentrated than NFW, as expected if their dark haloes contract due to baryonic cooling. We find that over several half-light radii, the dark matter haloes of these lenses are rounder than their stellar mass distributions. While the haloes are never more elliptical than edm = 0.2, their stars can extend to e* > 0.2. Galaxies with high dark matter ellipticity and weak external shear show strong alignment between light and dark; those with strong shear (\u03b3 \u2272 0.1) can be highly misaligned. This is reassuring since isolated misaligned galaxies are expected to be unstable. Our results provide a new constraint on galaxy formation models. For a given cosmology, these must explain the origin of both very round dark matter haloes and misaligned strong-lens systems.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Galaxies: elliptical and lenticular, cD", "Galaxies: formation", "Galaxies: haloes", "Galaxies: structure", "Gravitational lensing: strong"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84959542846", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"56513926300": {"Name": "Bruderer C.", "AuthorID": "56513926300", "AffiliationID": "60025858", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Astronomy, Department of Physics, ETH Zurich"}, "7202392051": {"Name": "Read J.I.", "AuthorID": "7202392051", "AffiliationID": "60021097", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of Surrey"}, "24281359900": {"Name": "Coles J.P.", "AuthorID": "24281359900", "AffiliationID": "60012614", "AffiliationName": "Physik-Institut, University of Zurich"}, "7203029486": {"Name": "Saha P.", "AuthorID": "7203029486", "AffiliationID": "60012614", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Computational Science, University of Zurich"}, "35229834300": {"Name": "Leier D.", "AuthorID": "35229834300", "AffiliationID": "60028218", "AffiliationName": "Dipartimento di Fisica e Astronomia, Universit\u00e0 di Bologna"}, "7005024171": {"Name": "Falco E.E.", "AuthorID": "7005024171", "AffiliationID": "60020680", "AffiliationName": "Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics"}, "7004053948": {"Name": "Ferreras I.", "AuthorID": "7004053948", "AffiliationID": "60084281, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Mullard Space Science Laboratory, University College London, Holmbury St Mary"}}}
