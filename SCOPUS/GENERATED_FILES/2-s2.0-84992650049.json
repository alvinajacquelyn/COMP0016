Pre-clinical data demonstrate two mechanisms of action: mu-opioid receptor agonist activity and noradrenaline re-uptake inhibition. From these, one may predict that tapentadol would be applicable across a broad spectrum of pain from nociceptive to neuropathic. The evidence in animal models suggests that norepinephrine re-uptake inhibition (NRI) is a key mechanism and may even predominate over opioid actions in chronic (and especially neuropathic) pain states, reinforcing that tapentadol is different to classical opioids and may, therefore, be an a priori choice for the treatment of neuropathic and mixed pain. The clinical studies and subsequent practice experience and surveillance support the concept of opioid and non-opioid mechanisms of action. The reduced incidence of some of the typical opioid-induced side effects, compared to equianalgesic doses of classical opioids, supports the hypothesis that tapentadol analgesia is only partially mediated by opioid agonist mechanisms. Both the pre-clinical and clinical profiles appear to be differentiated from those of classical opioids.", "AuthorKeywords": ["analgesic mechanisms of action", "analgesics", "opioids", "pain pharmacology", "Tapentadol"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84992650049", "SubjectAreas": [["Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine", "MEDI", "2703"]], "AuthorData": {"7005693802": {"Name": "Langford R.M.", "AuthorID": "7005693802", "AffiliationID": "60159931", "AffiliationName": "Barts Health NHS Trust"}, "6602949940": {"Name": "Knaggs R.", "AuthorID": "6602949940", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "University of Nottingham"}, "36159491000": {"Name": "Farquhar-Smith P.", "AuthorID": "36159491000", "AffiliationID": "60027057", "AffiliationName": "Royal Marsden Hospital"}, "7101706308": {"Name": "Dickenson A.H.", "AuthorID": "7101706308", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
