The result of fluidifying discrete Petri nets are the so called Fluid or Continuous Petri nets. As with any relaxation technique, discrepancies among the behaviours of the discrete and the relaxed model may appear. Moreover, such discrepancies may have a comparatively bigger effect when the population of the system, the marking in Petri net terms, is \u201crelatively\u201d small. This paper proposes two complementary approaches to obtain a better fluid approximation of discrete Petri nets. The first one focuses on untimed systems and is based on the addition of places that are implicit in the untimed discrete system but not in the continuous. The idea is to cut undesired spurious solutions whose existence worsens the fluidization. The second one focuses on a particular situation that can severely affect the quality of fluidization in timed systems. Namely, such a situation arises when the enabling degree of a transition is equal to 1. This last approach aims to alleviate such a state of affairs, which is termed the bound reaching problem, on systems under infinite servers semantics.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Continuous Petri nets", "Discrete event dynamic systems", "Fluidization", "Petri nets", "Relaxed models", "Throughput approximation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Continuous Petri net", "Discrete event dynamic systems", "Discrete Petri nets", "Fluid approximation", "Integrality constraints", "Relaxation techniques", "Spurious solutions", "Throughput approximation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85015065374", "SubjectAreas": [["Control and Systems Engineering", "ENGI", "2207"], ["Modeling and Simulation", "MATH", "2611"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"55367695700": {"Name": "Fraca E.", "AuthorID": "55367695700", "AffiliationID": "60016809", "AffiliationName": "Instituto de Investigaci\u00f3n en Ingenier\u00eda de Arag\u00f3n (I3A), Universidad de Zaragoza"}, "7005478140": {"Name": "J\u00falvez J.", "AuthorID": "7005478140", "AffiliationID": "60016809", "AffiliationName": "Instituto de Investigaci\u00f3n en Ingenier\u00eda de Arag\u00f3n (I3A), Universidad de Zaragoza"}, "35303484100": {"Name": "Silva M.", "AuthorID": "35303484100", "AffiliationID": "60016809", "AffiliationName": "Instituto de Investigaci\u00f3n en Ingenier\u00eda de Arag\u00f3n (I3A), Universidad de Zaragoza"}}}
