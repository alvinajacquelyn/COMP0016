Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.VPS33B and VIPAR comprise the two known components of the recently christened class C Homologues in Endosome\u2013Vesicle Interaction (CHEVI) complex, thought to act as a tethering complex in endosomal trafficking distinct from the HOPS and CORVET complexes in mammalian cells. A recent paper in The Journal of Pathology further explores the role of the CHEVI complex in the biogenesis of \u03b1-granules in megakaryocytes, identifying two novel interactors of this complex: \u03b1-tubulin and SEC22B, and demonstrating that VPS33B expression is required for the localization of SEC22B and the \u03b1-granule cargo VWF to proplatelets in megakaryocytes. These findings advance the current knowledge of the function of the CHEVI complex in \u03b1-granule biogenesis and together with studies in other systems, corroborate its role in the specialized delivery of cargo in different cell types.
