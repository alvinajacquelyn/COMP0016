This review aims to synthesize the current literature on health behavior change interventions created specifically for TYA-aged cancer survivors. Method: MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and CINAHL databases were searched for studies investigating interventions targeting one or more health behaviors, including: physical activity, diet, smoking cessation, and alcohol consumption. Studies were eligible for review if the study population were defined as TYA cancer survivors and the mean age of the sample was younger than 30 years of age. Results: Twelve studies were identified, of which nine were randomized controlled trials. Physical activity was the most commonly targeted health behavior. Six of the 12 interventions included within this review were successful in changing health behavior. Due to the heterogeneity of intervention characteristics, the relationship between intervention efficacy or outcome and intervention content, delivery mode, or theoretical framework was not discernible. Nevertheless, trends emerged relating to the delivery and content of health behavior interventions designed specifically for TYA cancer survivors. Conclusion: More research is required to identify the most effective means of promoting health behavior change among the TYA cancer survivor population. Specifically, future research should focus on providing evidence of the efficiency and feasibility of interventions that use online technologies to facilitate remote intervention delivery and peer support.", "AuthorKeywords": ["alcohol use", "diet", "physical activity", "risk behavior", "survivorship", "tobacco use"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Behavior Therapy", "Cancer Survivors", "Diet", "Exercise", "Female", "Health Behavior", "Humans", "Male", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85006210757", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"]], "AuthorData": {"57192403645": {"Name": "Pugh G.", "AuthorID": "57192403645", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Health Behaviour Research Centre, Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "7102146930": {"Name": "Wardle J.", "AuthorID": "7102146930", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Health Behaviour Research Centre, Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "56660238600": {"Name": "Fisher A.", "AuthorID": "56660238600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Health Behaviour Research Centre, Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "57192402155": {"Name": "Gravestock H.L.", "AuthorID": "57192402155", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Communications and Campaigning, CLIC Sargent"}, "9941088900": {"Name": "Hough R.E.", "AuthorID": "9941088900", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, University College London Hospital"}, "57192406475": {"Name": "King W.M.", "AuthorID": "57192406475", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, University College London Hospital"}}}
