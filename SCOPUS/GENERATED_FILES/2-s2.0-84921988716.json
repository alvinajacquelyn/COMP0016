Poly(9,9-di-n-octylfluorene-alt-benzothiadiazole) (F8BT) integration into 3D silicon microstructures is investigated by means of three different deposition techniques, namely, spin-coating, dip-coating and drop-casting/ slow solvent evaporation. The microstructure is fabricated by electrochemical micromachining (ECM) technology and integrates 2D arrays of square holes with different sizes (about 40 and 4 \u03bcm), spatial periods (about 70 and 10 \u03bcm), and aspect ratios (ARs) (about one and ten). Notably, square holes with higher AR can be selectively filled with polymer using spin-coating and drop-casting techniques, whereas dip-coating technique allows selective polymer filling of square holes with lower AR. Independently of size, period and AR, each polymer-infiltrated hole behaves as a single light source, thus enabling the effective synthesis of 2D photoluminescent light source arrays.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Deposition technique", "Dip coating techniques", "Electrochemical micro-machining", "Selective infiltrations", "Silicon microstructures", "Solvent evaporation", "Threedimensional (3-d)", "Two Dimensional (2 D)"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84921988716", "SubjectAreas": [["Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering", "ENGI", "2209"]], "AuthorData": {"55962616900": {"Name": "Polito G.", "AuthorID": "55962616900", "AffiliationID": "60028868", "AffiliationName": "Dipartimento di Ingegneria dell\u2019Informazione, Universit\u00e0 di Pisa"}, "35191137800": {"Name": "Surdo S.", "AuthorID": "35191137800", "AffiliationID": "60028868", "AffiliationName": "Dipartimento di Ingegneria dell\u2019Informazione, Universit\u00e0 di Pisa"}, "6603446550": {"Name": "Barillaro G.", "AuthorID": "6603446550", "AffiliationID": "60028868", "AffiliationName": "Dipartimento di Ingegneria dell\u2019Informazione, Universit\u00e0 di Pisa"}, "55668072300": {"Name": "Robbiano V.", "AuthorID": "55668072300", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy and London Centre for Nanotechnology, University College London"}, "55562231300": {"Name": "Tregnago G.", "AuthorID": "55562231300", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy and London Centre for Nanotechnology, University College London"}, "7006071546": {"Name": "Cacialli F.", "AuthorID": "7006071546", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy and London Centre for Nanotechnology, University College London"}}}
