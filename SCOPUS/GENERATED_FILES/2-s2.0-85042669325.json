MCNs have a malignant potential and thus surgery is frequently performed. The aim of this cohort study was to define better the criteria for surgical resection in patients with MCN. Methods: This multicentre retrospective study included all resected MCNs between 2003 and 2015 in participating centres. Lesions without ovarian-type stroma were excluded. Patient characteristics, preoperative findings, histopathology findings and follow-up data were recorded. Results: The study included 211 patients; their median age was 53 (range 18\u201382) years, and 202 (95\u00b77 per cent) were women. Median preoperative tumour size was 55 (range 12\u2013230) mm. Thirty-four of the 211 (16\u00b71 per cent) were malignant, and high-grade dysplasia (HGD) was found in a further 13 (6\u00b72 per cent). One-third of MCNs in men were associated with invasive cancer, compared with 15\u00b73 per cent in women. Five cases of malignant transformation occurred in MCNs smaller than 4 cm. All cases of malignancy or HGD were associated with symptoms or features of concern on preoperative cross-sectional imaging. In multivariable analysis, raised carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (odds ratio (OR) 10\u00b754, 95 per cent c.i. 2\u00b785 to 218\u00b723; P < 0\u00b7001), tumour size (OR 4\u00b723, 3\u00b702 to 11\u00b703; P = 0\u00b7001), mural nodules (OR 3\u00b755, 1\u00b731 to 20\u00b755; P = 0\u00b7002) and weight loss (OR 3\u00b740, 2\u00b734 to 12\u00b734; P = 0\u00b7034) were independent factors predictive of malignant transformation. Conclusions: Small indeterminate MCNs with no symptoms or features of concern may safely be observed as they have a low risk of malignant transformation.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Cystadenocarcinoma, Mucinous", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Pancreatectomy", "Pancreatic Neoplasms", "Retrospective Studies", "Risk", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85042669325", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"]], "AuthorData": {"56516225000": {"Name": "Keane M.G.", "AuthorID": "56516225000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Liver and Digestive Health, University College London"}, "55944100900": {"Name": "Pereira S.P.", "AuthorID": "55944100900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Liver and Digestive Health, University College London"}, "57189573664": {"Name": "Shamali A.", "AuthorID": "57189573664", "AffiliationID": "60000703", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery, Southampton University Hospital"}, "6603941546": {"Name": "Abu Hilal M.", "AuthorID": "6603941546", "AffiliationID": "60000703", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery, Southampton University Hospital"}, "57213507137": {"Name": "Hoskins T.", "AuthorID": "57213507137", "AffiliationID": "60018514", "AffiliationName": "Department of Hepato-Pancreato-Biliary Surgery, Freeman Hospital"}, "25960350600": {"Name": "Robinson S.", "AuthorID": "25960350600", "AffiliationID": "60018514", "AffiliationName": "Department of Hepato-Pancreato-Biliary Surgery, Freeman Hospital"}, "56583423500": {"Name": "Nilsson L.N.", "AuthorID": "56583423500", "AffiliationID": "60019295", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery, Karolinska University Hospital"}, "55864601100": {"Name": "Del Chiaro M.", "AuthorID": "55864601100", "AffiliationID": "60019295", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery, Karolinska University Hospital"}, "56242838200": {"Name": "Antila A.", "AuthorID": "56242838200", "AffiliationID": "60008760", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gastroenterology and Alimentary Tract Surgery, Tampere University Hospital"}, "57200938068": {"Name": "Vaalavuo Y.", "AuthorID": "57200938068", "AffiliationID": "60008760", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gastroenterology and Alimentary Tract Surgery, Tampere University Hospital"}, "6508221412": {"Name": "Laukkarinen J.", "AuthorID": "6508221412", "AffiliationID": "60008760", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gastroenterology and Alimentary Tract Surgery, Tampere University Hospital"}, "57191749209": {"Name": "Millastre Bocos J.", "AuthorID": "57191749209", "AffiliationID": "60022336", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gastroenterology, Miguel Servet University Hospital"}, "57191756373": {"Name": "Marijinissen Van Zanten M.", "AuthorID": "57191756373", "AffiliationID": "60002573", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, Nijmegen University Hospital"}, "55308195100": {"Name": "Verdejo Gil C.", "AuthorID": "55308195100", "AffiliationID": "112740601", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gastroenterology, Ciudad Real University Hospital"}, "7005932083": {"Name": "Maisonneuve P.", "AuthorID": "7005932083", "AffiliationID": "60030442", "AffiliationName": "European Institute of Oncology"}, "35323893900": {"Name": "Ceyhan G.O.", "AuthorID": "35323893900", "AffiliationID": "60103459, 60019722", "AffiliationName": "Surgical Clinic, Klinikum rechts der Isar, Technical University of Munich"}}}
