All rights reserved.The treatment of permanent facial paralysis presents a challenge to the clinician. When embarking on facial reanimation, the surgeon is attempting to reproduce the efforts of the 17 muscles involved with facial expression with only one. The primary goal is to restore function, so that the eye can be protected, oral continence restored, speech improved and symmetry of the face made more aesthetic. In order to reanimate the face, spontaneous symmetrical movement is desired and is typically achieved by free functional muscle transfer; however this is not always possible. Facial paralysis can affect all age groups and treatment must be tailored to the individual, taking into consideration patient needs, modalities available and the underlying cause. This chapter covers the relevant anatomy, aetiology, clinical examination, diagnostic investigations and management of facial palsy in all age groups, including the static options for when reanimation is not possible.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bell's palsy", "Facial palsy", "Free functional muscle transfer", "Mobius syndrome", "Reanimation"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85018416908", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"55346428400": {"Name": "Leckenby J.I.", "AuthorID": "55346428400", "AffiliationID": "60009982", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, Harvard University"}, "15851075100": {"Name": "Grobbelaar A.O.", "AuthorID": "15851075100", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Department of Plastic Surgery, The Royal Free Hospital"}}}
