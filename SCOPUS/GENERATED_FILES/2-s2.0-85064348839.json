Here we use ensemble simulation protocols, termed ESMACS (enhanced sampling of molecular dynamics with approximation of continuum solvent), to investigate the sensitivity of the popular molecular mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann surface area (MMPBSA) methodology. Using the bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4) system bound to a diverse set of ligands as our target, we show that robust rankings can be produced only through combining ensemble sampling with multiple trajectories and enhanced solvation via an explicit ligand hydration shell.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Molecular Dynamics Simulation", "Protein Conformation", "Solvents", "Thermodynamics", "Transcription Factors", "Water"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85064348839", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"56673346700": {"Name": "Wright D.W.", "AuthorID": "56673346700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Computational Science, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "7202726029": {"Name": "Wan S.", "AuthorID": "7202726029", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Computational Science, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "7005747590": {"Name": "Coveney P.V.", "AuthorID": "7005747590", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Computational Science, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "57212741468": {"Name": "Meyer C.", "AuthorID": "57212741468", "AffiliationID": "60072269", "AffiliationName": "Janssen Research & Development"}, "6603020559": {"Name": "van Vlijmen H.", "AuthorID": "6603020559", "AffiliationID": "60072269", "AffiliationName": "Janssen Research & Development"}, "6602462139": {"Name": "Tresadern G.", "AuthorID": "6602462139", "AffiliationID": "60072269", "AffiliationName": "Janssen Research & Development"}}}
