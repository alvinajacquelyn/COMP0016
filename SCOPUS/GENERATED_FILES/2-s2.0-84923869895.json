Strongly activated small-polaron hopping is implied by the activation energies of the Arrhenius conductivities (about 300 meV) greatly exceeding the energies characterizing the falls of the Seebeck coefficients' magnitudes with increasing temperature (about 50 meV). Small-polaron hopping is further evidenced by the measured Hall mobility in the ab-plane (10-1cm2V-1s-1 at 300 K) being larger and much less strongly activated than the deduced drift mobility (about 5 \u00d7 10-5cm2V-1s-1 at 300 K). The conductivity and n-type Seebeck coefficient is found to be anisotropic with the conductivity larger and the Seebeck coefficient's magnitude smaller and less temperature dependent for motion within the ab-plane than that in the c-direction. These anisotropies are addressed by considering highly anisotropic next-nearest-neighbor (\u22485 \u00c5) transfers in addition to the somewhat shorter (\u22484 \u00c5), nearly isotropic nearest-neighbor transfers.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Bismuth vanadates", "DC electrical conductivity", "Drift mobilities", "Hall coefficient", "Increasing temperatures", "Nearest neighbors", "Small polaron hopping", "Temperature dependent"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84923869895", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (miscellaneous)", "PHYS", "3101"]], "AuthorData": {"55201215900": {"Name": "Rettie A.J.E.", "AuthorID": "55201215900", "AffiliationID": "60013372", "AffiliationName": "McKetta Department of Chemical Engineering, University of Texas at Austin"}, "55234573000": {"Name": "Mullins C.B.", "AuthorID": "55234573000", "AffiliationID": "60013372", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Texas at Austin"}, "55053258700": {"Name": "Chemelewski W.D.", "AuthorID": "55053258700", "AffiliationID": "60013372", "AffiliationName": "Texas Materials Institute, University of Texas at Austin"}, "55338525700": {"Name": "Marshall L.G.", "AuthorID": "55338525700", "AffiliationID": "60028628", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, Northeastern University"}, "8302439800": {"Name": "Zhou J.", "AuthorID": "8302439800", "AffiliationID": "60013372", "AffiliationName": "Texas Materials Institute, University of Texas at Austin"}, "7003750012": {"Name": "Lindemuth J.", "AuthorID": "7003750012", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Lake Shore Cryotronics"}, "22951405100": {"Name": "McCloy J.S.", "AuthorID": "22951405100", "AffiliationID": "60018208", "AffiliationName": "Materials Science and Engineering Program, Washington State University"}, "57201525182": {"Name": "Emin D.", "AuthorID": "57201525182", "AffiliationID": "60033021", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of New Mexico"}}}
