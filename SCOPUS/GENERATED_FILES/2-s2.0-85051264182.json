But these same critically-stressed systems sometimes fail in drawn-out sequences of smaller earthquakes over days or years instead. These two modes of failure have vastly different implications for seismic hazard and it is not known why fault systems sometimes fail in one mode or the other, or what controls the termination and reinitiation of slip in protracted seismic sequences. A paucity of modern observations of seismic sequences has hampered our understanding to-date, but a series of three Mw>6 earthquakes from August to November 2016 in Central Italy represents a uniquely well-observed example. Here we exploit a wealth of geodetic, seismological and field data to understand the spatio-temporal evolution of the sequence. Our results suggest that intersections between major and subsidiary faults controlled the extent and termination of rupture in each event in the sequence, and that fluid diffusion, channelled along these same fault intersections, may have also determined the timing of rupture reinitiation. This dual control of subsurface structure on the stop-start rupture in seismic sequences may be common; future efforts should focus on investigating its prevalence.", "AuthorKeywords": ["earthquakes", "fault segmentation", "fluid diffusion", "InSAR", "seismic sequence"], "IndexKeywords": ["Fault segmentation", "Fluid diffusion", "InSAR", "Modes of failure", "Seismic hazards", "Seismic sequence", "Spatiotemporal evolution", "Subsurface structures"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85051264182", "SubjectAreas": [["Geophysics", "EART", "1908"], ["Geochemistry and Petrology", "EART", "1906"], ["Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)", "EART", "1901"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"55953398100": {"Name": "Walters R.J.", "AuthorID": "55953398100", "AffiliationID": "60022175", "AffiliationName": "COMET, Department of Earth Sciences, Durham University"}, "14060223900": {"Name": "Gregory L.C.", "AuthorID": "14060223900", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "COMET, School of Earth & Environment, University of Leeds"}, "56320537900": {"Name": "Wedmore L.N.J.", "AuthorID": "56320537900", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "COMET, School of Earth Sciences, University of Bristol"}, "36162360400": {"Name": "Craig T.J.", "AuthorID": "36162360400", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "COMET, School of Earth & Environment, University of Leeds"}, "35263810700": {"Name": "Elliott J.R.", "AuthorID": "35263810700", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "COMET, School of Earth & Environment, University of Leeds"}, "57194707860": {"Name": "Goodall H.", "AuthorID": "57194707860", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "COMET, School of Earth & Environment, University of Leeds"}, "7004524357": {"Name": "McCaffrey K.", "AuthorID": "7004524357", "AffiliationID": "60022175", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, Durham University"}, "37073949800": {"Name": "Wilkinson M.", "AuthorID": "37073949800", "AffiliationID": "60022175", "AffiliationName": "Geospatial Research Ltd., Department of Earth Sciences, Durham University"}, "55200941900": {"Name": "Chen J.", "AuthorID": "55200941900", "AffiliationID": "60006222", "AffiliationName": "COMET, School of Engineering, Newcastle University"}, "57215232129": {"Name": "Li Z.", "AuthorID": "57215232129", "AffiliationID": "60006222", "AffiliationName": "COMET, School of Engineering, Newcastle University"}, "56419852600": {"Name": "Iezzi F.", "AuthorID": "56419852600", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences, Birkbeck, University of London"}, "7403399232": {"Name": "Roberts G.", "AuthorID": "7403399232", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences, Birkbeck, University of London"}, "16024940800": {"Name": "Livio F.", "AuthorID": "16024940800", "AffiliationID": "60005400", "AffiliationName": "Dipartimento di Scienza e Alta tecnologia, Universit\u00e0 degli Studi dell'Insubria"}, "57201312286": {"Name": "Michetti A.M.", "AuthorID": "57201312286", "AffiliationID": "60005400", "AffiliationName": "Dipartimento di Scienza e Alta tecnologia, Universit\u00e0 degli Studi dell'Insubria"}, "6603882629": {"Name": "Vittori E.", "AuthorID": "6603882629", "AffiliationID": "60113282", "AffiliationName": "Servizio Geologico d'Italia, ISPRA"}}}
