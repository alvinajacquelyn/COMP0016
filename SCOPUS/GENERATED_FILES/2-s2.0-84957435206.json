The Course Resource Appraisal Model (CRAM) provides accurate cost-benefit information so that institutions are able to make more meaningful decisions about which kind of courses\u2014online, blended or traditional face-to-face\u2014make sense for them to provide. The tool calculates the difference between expenses and income over three iterations of the course and presents a pedagogical analysis of the learning experience provided. The article draws on a CRAM analysis of the costs and learning benefits of a massive open online course to show how the tool can illuminate the pedagogical and financial viability of a course of this kind.", "AuthorKeywords": ["academic workload", "cost of distance education", "cost-benefit model", "online learning"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84957435206", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"]], "AuthorData": {"57189003416": {"Name": "Kennedy E.", "AuthorID": "57189003416", "AffiliationID": "60117699, 60006242", "AffiliationName": "London Knowledge Lab, UCL Institute of Education"}, "6602915354": {"Name": "Laurillard D.", "AuthorID": "6602915354", "AffiliationID": "60117699, 60006242", "AffiliationName": "London Knowledge Lab, UCL Institute of Education"}, "23389065800": {"Name": "Horan B.", "AuthorID": "23389065800", "AffiliationID": "60117699, 60006242", "AffiliationName": "London Knowledge Lab, UCL Institute of Education"}, "56903884400": {"Name": "Charlton P.", "AuthorID": "56903884400", "AffiliationID": "60117699, 60006242", "AffiliationName": "London Knowledge Lab, UCL Institute of Education"}}}
