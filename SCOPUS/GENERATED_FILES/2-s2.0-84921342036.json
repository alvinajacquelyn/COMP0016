BACKGROUND: RIC, using transient limb ischemia and reperfusion, can protect the heart against acute ischemia-reperfusion injury. Whether RIC can reduce MI size, assessed by cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR), is unknown. METHODS: We randomly assigned 197 ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction patients with TIMI (Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction) flow grade 0 to receive RIC (four 5-min cycles of upper arm cuff inflation/deflation) or control (uninflated cuff placed on upper arm for 40 min) protocols prior to PPCI. The primary study endpoint was MI size, measured by CMR in 83 subjects on days 3 to 6 after admission. RESULTS: RIC reduced MI size by 27%, when compared with the MI size of control subjects (18.0 \u00b1 10% [n = 40] vs. 24.5 \u00b1 12.0% [n = 43]; p = 0.009). At 24 h, high-sensitivity troponin T was lower with RIC (2,296 \u00b1 263 ng/l [n = 89] vs. 2,736 \u00b1 325 ng/l [n = 84]; p = 0.037). RIC also reduced the extent of myocardial edema measured by T2-mapping CMR (28.5 \u00b1 9.0% vs. 35.1 \u00b1 10.0%; p = 0.003) and lowered mean T2 values (68.7 \u00b1 5.8 ms vs. 73.1 \u00b1 6.1 ms; p = 0.001), precluding the use of CMR edema imaging to correctly estimate the area at risk. Using CMR-independent coronary angiography jeopardy scores to estimate the area at risk, RIC, when compared with the control protocol, was found to significantly improve the myocardial salvage index (0.42 \u00b1 0.29 vs. 0.28 \u00b1 0.29; p = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: This randomized study demonstrated that in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction patients treated by PPCI, RIC, initiated prior to PPCI, reduced MI size, increased myocardial salvage, and reduced myocardial edema.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Acute myocardial infarction", "Cardiovascular magnetic resonance", "Myocardial edema", "Primary percutaneous coronary intervention", "Remote ischemic conditioning", "Reperfusion injury"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Biomarkers", "Coronary Angiography", "Edema, Cardiac", "England", "Female", "Humans", "Ischemic Preconditioning, Myocardial", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Myocardial Infarction", "Myocardium", "Percutaneous Coronary Intervention", "Predictive Value of Tests", "Time Factors", "Treatment Outcome", "Troponin T", "Upper Extremity"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84921342036", "SubjectAreas": [["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"55083542800": {"Name": "White S.K.", "AuthorID": "55083542800", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Heart Hospital"}, "7103223278": {"Name": "Yellon D.M.", "AuthorID": "7103223278", "AffiliationID": "60024544, 60029950", "AffiliationName": "Hatter Cardiovascular Institute, NIHR University College London Hospitals Biomedical Research Centre, University College London Hospital and Medical School"}, "6602976997": {"Name": "Hausenloy D.J.", "AuthorID": "6602976997", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Heart Hospital"}, "7003584976": {"Name": "Frohlich G.M.", "AuthorID": "7003584976", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Heart Hospital"}, "57203175810": {"Name": "Sado D.M.", "AuthorID": "57203175810", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Heart Hospital"}, "55355501300": {"Name": "Maestrini V.", "AuthorID": "55355501300", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Heart Hospital"}, "16306839900": {"Name": "Fontana M.", "AuthorID": "16306839900", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Heart Hospital"}, "15754511800": {"Name": "Treibel T.A.", "AuthorID": "15754511800", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Heart Hospital"}, "54382431400": {"Name": "Tehrani S.", "AuthorID": "54382431400", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Heart Hospital"}, "7201724322": {"Name": "Meier P.", "AuthorID": "7201724322", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Heart Hospital"}, "7403231345": {"Name": "Moon J.C.", "AuthorID": "7403231345", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Heart Hospital"}, "6701780469": {"Name": "Flett A.S.", "AuthorID": "6701780469", "AffiliationID": "60000703", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, University Hospital Southampton National Health Service Foundation Trust"}, "36975257100": {"Name": "Ariti C.", "AuthorID": "36975257100", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "56939639900": {"Name": "Davies J.R.", "AuthorID": "56939639900", "AffiliationID": "60170154, 60170321", "AffiliationName": "Essex Cardiothoracic Centre, Basildon University Hospital, Nethermayne"}}}
