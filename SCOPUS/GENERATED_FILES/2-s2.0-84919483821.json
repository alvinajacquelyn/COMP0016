While there are many different empirical ways to address this question, the use of faces in such research has proven exceptionally fruitful. We review here what has been learned about unconscious processing through the use of faces and face-selective neural correlates. A large number of cognitive systems can be explored with faces, including emotions, social cueing and evaluation, attention, multisensory integration, and various aspects of face processing.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Face-selective biomarkers", "Faces", "Invisible stimuli", "Unconscious processing"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cognitive science", "Face processing", "Faces", "Invisible stimuli", "Multisensory integration", "Neural correlate", "Animals", "Brain", "Facial Recognition", "Humans", "Social Perception", "Unconscious (Psychology)"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84919483821", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuropsychology and Physiological Psychology", "PSYC", "3206"], ["Experimental and Cognitive Psychology", "PSYC", "3205"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"]], "AuthorData": {"36131066600": {"Name": "Axelrod V.", "AuthorID": "36131066600", "AffiliationID": "60109771, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London (UCL) Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, University College London"}, "7007159918": {"Name": "Bar M.", "AuthorID": "7007159918", "AffiliationID": "60002765", "AffiliationName": "The Gonda Multidisciplinary Brain Research Center, Bar Ilan University"}, "7202374409": {"Name": "Rees G.", "AuthorID": "7202374409", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60084279", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, University College London"}}}
