Whereas the exploitation of self-citations has been extensively documented, the impact of reciprocated citations has not yet been studied. We study reciprocity in a citation network of authors, and compare it with the average reciprocity computed in an ensemble of null network models. We show that obtaining citations through reciprocity correlates negatively with an impactful career in the long term. Nevertheless, at the aggregate level we show evidence of a steady increase in reciprocity over the years, largely fuelled by the citations reciprocated between coauthors. Our results characterize the structure of author networks in a time of increasing emphasis on citation-based indicators, and we discuss their implications towards a fairer assessment of academic impact.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Academic career", "Network science", "Reciprocity", "Statistical validation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Academic careers", "Bibliometric indicators", "Citation networks", "Network models", "Network science", "Reciprocity", "Statistical validation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85066472150", "SubjectAreas": [["Modeling and Simulation", "MATH", "2611"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Computational Mathematics", "MATH", "2605"]], "AuthorData": {"56920868100": {"Name": "Li W.", "AuthorID": "56920868100", "AffiliationID": "60003059, 60159833", "AffiliationName": "Systemic Risk Centre, London School of Economics and Political Science"}, "7003460450": {"Name": "Aste T.", "AuthorID": "7003460450", "AffiliationID": "60003059, 60159833", "AffiliationName": "Systemic Risk Centre, London School of Economics and Political Science"}, "24775109100": {"Name": "Caccioli F.", "AuthorID": "24775109100", "AffiliationID": "113459879", "AffiliationName": "London Mathematical Laboratory"}, "35366644500": {"Name": "Livan G.", "AuthorID": "35366644500", "AffiliationID": "60003059, 60159833", "AffiliationName": "Systemic Risk Centre, London School of Economics and Political Science"}}}
