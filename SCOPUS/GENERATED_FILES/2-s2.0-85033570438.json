Their mechanism of activation (ligands such as NAADP/PI(3,5)P2 versus voltage) and ion selectivity (Ca2+ versus Na+) is debated. Here we report that a cluster of arginine residues in the first domain required for selective voltage-gating of TPC1 map not to the voltage-sensing fourth transmembrane region (S4) but to a cytosolic downstream region (S4-S5 linker). These residues are conserved between TPC isoforms suggesting a generic role in TPC activation. Accordingly, mutation of residues in TPC1 but not the analogous region in the second domain prevents Ca2+ release by NAADP in intact cells. Our data affirm the role of TPCs in NAADP-mediated Ca2+ signalling and unite differing models of channel activation through identification of common domain-specific residues.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Amino Acid Sequence", "Arginine", "Calcium Channels", "Calcium Signaling", "Cell Line", "Humans", "Mutation", "NADP", "Structure-Activity Relationship"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85033570438", "SubjectAreas": [["Physiology", "BIOC", "1314"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"7403902620": {"Name": "Patel S.", "AuthorID": "7403902620", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University College London"}, "8271743900": {"Name": "Churamani D.", "AuthorID": "8271743900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University College London"}, "6603936682": {"Name": "Brailoiu E.", "AuthorID": "6603936682", "AffiliationID": "60013936, 60030398", "AffiliationName": "Center for Substance Abuse Research, Lewis Katz School of Medicine at Temple University"}}}
