Patients who self-reported their ethnic origin either as European Caucasian (EC) or South Asian (SA) were included. Exclusion criteria included trauma, previous vitreoretinal procedures, age under 18 years, complicated cataract surgery and the presence of syndromes known to be associated with a high prevalence of RD. Detailed phenotypic data were collected. Descriptive and comparative statistical analyses were undertaken.Results1269 Patients were recruited. 1173 (92.4%) were EC. Mean age of onset was 58.3 years (EC) and 54.5 years (SA) (P=0.006). 75.3% EC and 58.4% SA were phakic (P<0.001). 12.8% of EC and 19.4% of SA patients had a lattice retinal degeneration in the affected eye (P=0.003). Refractive myopia was greater in SA patients (mean: -6.1DS) than EC (-4.2DS) (P=0.032). Additionally, SA patients had a greater mean axial length (25.65 mm) than EC (25.06 mm) (P=0.014). No differences were demonstrated in laterality, family history, type of retinal break or macular status.ConclusionsSA patients present with RD at an earlier age and have a more severe phenotype than ECs. Future management strategies for RD may need to reflect these differences.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Age Distribution", "Age of Onset", "Aged", "Asian Continental Ancestry Group", "European Continental Ancestry Group", "Female", "Humans", "Lens, Crystalline", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Myopia", "Prospective Studies", "Retinal Detachment", "Sex Distribution", "Visual Acuity"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84930826383", "SubjectAreas": [["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"], ["Sensory Systems", "NEUR", "2809"]], "AuthorData": {"16038403700": {"Name": "Chandra A.", "AuthorID": "16038403700", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Vitreoretinal Department, Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "55622180600": {"Name": "Banerjee P.", "AuthorID": "55622180600", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Vitreoretinal Department, Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "7003299563": {"Name": "Charteris D.", "AuthorID": "7003299563", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Vitreoretinal Department, Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "55350725000": {"Name": "Davis D.", "AuthorID": "55350725000", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Public Health and Primary Care, University of Cambridge"}}}
