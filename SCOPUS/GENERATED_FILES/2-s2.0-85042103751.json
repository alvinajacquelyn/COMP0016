This study selected six morphological parameters and used noise-mapping techniques to estimate the noise attenuation in 60 village sites. The results indicate that \u2018quiet areas\u2019 increase by approximately 10% for each additional 100 m increase in the distance between the elevated road and the village. The best strategy for noise reduction is keeping the elevated road 1,000 m away from the village and raising the road height to 20 m. The building fa\u00e7ade conditions only affect the traffic noise level attenuation when the buildings are within 100 m of the elevated road. It was found that the cost-effective length of the road noise barrier is 600 m on both sides of the village parallel to the road. The results highlight the importance of using morphology to improve the traffic noise resistance of villages. The landscape shape indices of buildings and roads are the most important parameters that affect the traffic noise attenuation of elevated roads.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Elevated road", "morphology", "noise attenuation", "traffic noise", "village"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85042103751", "SubjectAreas": [["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"], ["Water Science and Technology", "ENVI", "2312"], ["Environmental Science (all)", "ENVI", "2300"], ["Fluid Flow and Transfer Processes", "CENG", "1507"], ["Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law", "ENVI", "2308"]], "AuthorData": {"55119880200": {"Name": "Yu W.L.", "AuthorID": "55119880200", "AffiliationID": "60019616", "AffiliationName": "Heilongjiang Cold Region Architectural Science Key Laboratory, School of Architecture, Harbin Institute of Technology"}, "55485135500": {"Name": "Kang J.", "AuthorID": "55485135500", "AffiliationID": "60001881", "AffiliationName": "School of Architecture, University of Sheffield"}}}
