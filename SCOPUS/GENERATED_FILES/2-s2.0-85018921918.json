All rights reserved.Marine protected areas (MPAs) are increasingly being used globally to conserve marine resources. However, whether many MPAs are being effectively and equitably managed, and how MPA management influences substantive outcomes remain unknown. We developed a global database of management and fish population data (433 and 218 MPAs, respectively) to assess: MPA management processes; the effects of MPAs on fish populations; and relationships between management processes and ecological effects. Here we report that many MPAs failed to meet thresholds for effective and equitable management processes, with widespread shortfalls in staff and financial resources. Although 71% of MPAs positively influenced fish populations, these conservation impacts were highly variable. Staff and budget capacity were the strongest predictors of conservation impact: MPAs with adequate staff capacity had ecological effects 2.9 times greater than MPAs with inadequate capacity. Thus, continued global expansion of MPAs without adequate investment in human and financial capacity is likely to lead to sub-optimal conservation outcomes.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Aquatic Organisms", "Biomass", "Conservation of Natural Resources", "Ecology", "Fishes", "Goals", "Internationality", "Population Dynamics"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85018921918", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"56900570600": {"Name": "Gill D.A.", "AuthorID": "56900570600", "AffiliationID": "60018319", "AffiliationName": "George Mason University"}, "7005538353": {"Name": "Mascia M.B.", "AuthorID": "7005538353", "AffiliationID": "60030089", "AffiliationName": "Moore Center for Science, Conservation International"}, "55191372800": {"Name": "Ahmadia G.N.", "AuthorID": "55191372800", "AffiliationID": "60020069", "AffiliationName": "World Wildlife Fund US"}, "18037163200": {"Name": "Glew L.", "AuthorID": "18037163200", "AffiliationID": "60020069", "AffiliationName": "World Wildlife Fund US"}, "7202912215": {"Name": "Fox H.E.", "AuthorID": "7202912215", "AffiliationID": "60028297", "AffiliationName": "National Geographic Society"}, "8134852700": {"Name": "Lester S.E.", "AuthorID": "8134852700", "AffiliationID": "60002092", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography, Florida State University"}, "56517567900": {"Name": "Barnes M.", "AuthorID": "56517567900", "AffiliationID": "60013791", "AffiliationName": "Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Management, University of Hawaii"}, "55257946900": {"Name": "Craigie I.", "AuthorID": "55257946900", "AffiliationID": "60019870, 60189142", "AffiliationName": "ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies, James Cook University"}, "25947394300": {"Name": "Darling E.S.", "AuthorID": "25947394300", "AffiliationID": "60001012", "AffiliationName": "Wildlife Conservation Society"}, "55900547100": {"Name": "Free C.M.", "AuthorID": "55900547100", "AffiliationID": "60119141", "AffiliationName": "Department of Marine and Coastal Sciences, Rutgers University"}, "9242529900": {"Name": "Jensen O.P.", "AuthorID": "9242529900", "AffiliationID": "60119141", "AffiliationName": "Department of Marine and Coastal Sciences, Rutgers University"}, "8407497100": {"Name": "Geldmann J.", "AuthorID": "8407497100", "AffiliationID": "60030840", "AffiliationName": "Center for Macroecology, Evolution and Climate, Natural History Museum of Denmark, University of Copenhagen"}, "57194152638": {"Name": "Holst S.", "AuthorID": "57194152638", "AffiliationID": "60027716", "AffiliationName": "NOAA Coral Reef Conservation Program"}, "7404187384": {"Name": "White A.T.", "AuthorID": "7404187384", "AffiliationID": "60017383", "AffiliationName": "Indo-Pacific Division, Nature Conservancy"}, "8508409300": {"Name": "Basurto X.", "AuthorID": "8508409300", "AffiliationID": "60008724", "AffiliationName": "Nicholas School of the Environment, Duke University"}, "26633525100": {"Name": "Coad L.", "AuthorID": "26633525100", "AffiliationID": "60069393", "AffiliationName": "Centre for International Forestry Research"}, "7102178009": {"Name": "Gates R.D.", "AuthorID": "7102178009", "AffiliationID": "60021013, 60013791", "AffiliationName": "Hawaii Institute of Marine Biology, University of Hawaii at Manoa"}, "6503864235": {"Name": "Guannel G.", "AuthorID": "6503864235", "AffiliationID": "60012708", "AffiliationName": "Natural Capital Project, Stanford University"}, "7003596162": {"Name": "Mumby P.J.", "AuthorID": "7003596162", "AffiliationID": "60031004, 60189142", "AffiliationName": "Marine Spatial Ecology Lab, School of Biological Sciences and ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies, University of Queensland, St Lucia Campus"}, "56431954300": {"Name": "Thomas H.", "AuthorID": "56431954300", "AffiliationID": "60111356", "AffiliationName": "UNEP-World Conservation Monitoring Centre"}, "36121679200": {"Name": "Whitmee S.", "AuthorID": "36121679200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "CBER-University College London"}, "7003322282": {"Name": "Woodley S.", "AuthorID": "7003322282", "AffiliationID": "116424171", "AffiliationName": "WCPA-SSC Joint Task Force on Biodiversity and Protected Areas, International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN)"}}}
