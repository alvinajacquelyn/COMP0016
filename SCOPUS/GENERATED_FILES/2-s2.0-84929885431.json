Elucidation of the transcriptional networks regulating HC fate determination and differentiation is crucial not only to understand inner ear development but also to improve cell replacement therapies for hearing disorders. Here, we show that combined expression of the transcription factors Gfi1, Pou4f3 and Atoh1 can induce direct programming towards HC fate, both during in vitro mouse embryonic stem cell differentiation and following ectopic expression in chick embryonic otic epithelium. Induced HCs (iHCs) express numerous HC-specific markers and exhibit polarized membrane protrusions reminiscent of stereociliary bundles. Transcriptome profiling confirms the progressive establishment of a HC-specific gene signature during in vitro iHC programming. Overall, this work provides a novel approach to achieve robust and highly efficient HC production in vitro, which could be used as a model to study HC development and to drive inner ear HC regeneration.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Atoh1", "Cell type programming", "Gene regulation", "Gfi1", "Hair cells"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Cell Differentiation", "Cell Lineage", "Cell Shape", "Cellular Reprogramming", "Chick Embryo", "Embryonic Stem Cells", "Fluorescence", "Gene Expression Profiling", "Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental", "Genes, Reporter", "Hair Cells, Auditory", "Mice", "Receptors, Notch", "Signal Transduction", "Transcription Factors", "Transcriptome", "Tretinoin"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84929885431", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Developmental Biology", "BIOC", "1309"]], "AuthorData": {"56655873400": {"Name": "Costa A.", "AuthorID": "56655873400", "AffiliationID": "60014873, 60027272", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Integrative Physiology and MRC Centre for Regenerative Medicine, School of Biological Sciences, University of Edinburgh"}, "26425260000": {"Name": "Sanchez-Guardado L.", "AuthorID": "26425260000", "AffiliationID": "60113882", "AffiliationName": "Champalimaud Centre for the Unknown"}, "7004015571": {"Name": "Henrique D.", "AuthorID": "7004015571", "AffiliationID": "60113882", "AffiliationName": "Champalimaud Centre for the Unknown"}, "56656629600": {"Name": "Juniat S.", "AuthorID": "56656629600", "AffiliationID": "60011326, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Ear Institute, University College London"}, "7101993331": {"Name": "Gale J.E.", "AuthorID": "7101993331", "AffiliationID": "60011326, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Ear Institute, University College London"}, "6602796921": {"Name": "Daudet N.", "AuthorID": "6602796921", "AffiliationID": "60011326, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Ear Institute, University College London"}}}
