Recent work has called for more innovative methods in sensorial scholarship and the use of creative approaches to explore the senses. While applauding this move, in this article the authors show the importance of a focus on micro-behavioural actions in studying the senses. Drawing on ethnomethodology and conversation analysis, they analyse video recordings of near vision tests in optometry consultations illustrating the highly routinised, but also the embodied and improvised character of the actions through which the vision is made available for scrutiny. They argue that sensorial scholarship has sidelined the study of social context as a lived-order and demonstrate the importance of treating sensorial actions as routinised, embodied and improvisatory. The authors agree that using more creative methods would be valuable but caution against relying exclusively on methods that do not sufficiently contextualise the senses as a lived and practical social accomplishment.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Conversation analysis", "ethnomethodology", "optometry", "social interaction", "sociology of the senses", "vision"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85070250636", "SubjectAreas": [["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"]], "AuthorData": {"55588397700": {"Name": "Gibson W.", "AuthorID": "55588397700", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "University College London Institute of Education"}, "55663157600": {"Name": "Vom Lehn D.", "AuthorID": "55663157600", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "King\u2019s College London"}}}
