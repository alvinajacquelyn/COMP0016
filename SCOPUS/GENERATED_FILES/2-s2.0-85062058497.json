Layered carbon nitrides have also been identified as of significant interest within these fields of application. However, most carbon nitride materials studied to date have poor crystallinity and therefore their properties cannot be readily controlled or easily related to their molecular level or nanoscale structures. Here we report a process for forming a range of crystalline layered carbon nitrides with polytriazine imide (PTI) structures that can be interconverted by simple ion exchange processes, permitting the tunability of their optoelectronic and chemical properties. Notable outcomes of our work are (a) the creation of a crystalline, guest-ion-free PTI compound that (b) can be re-intercalated with ions or molecules using \u201csoft chemistry\u201d approaches. This includes the intercalation of HCl, demonstrating a new ambient pressure route to the layered PTI\u00b7xHCl material that was previously only available by a high-pressure-high-temperature route (c). Our work also shows (d) that the intercalant-free (IF-) PTI material spontaneously absorbs up to 10 weight% H2O from the ambient atmosphere and that this process is reversible, leading to potential applications for membranes and water capture in dry environments.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Ambient atmosphere", "Crystalline carbon nitride", "Generation technologies", "High pressure high temperature", "Ion exchange process", "Nanoscale structure", "Nitride materials", "Poor crystallinity"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85062058497", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"]], "AuthorData": {"57191578548": {"Name": "Suter T.M.", "AuthorID": "57191578548", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electrochemical Innovation Lab, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "7005206877": {"Name": "Cockcroft J.K.", "AuthorID": "7005206877", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "7102384385": {"Name": "Aliev A.E.", "AuthorID": "7102384385", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "57205868517": {"Name": "Wilding M.C.", "AuthorID": "57205868517", "AffiliationID": "60032204", "AffiliationName": "Materials and Engineering Research Institute, Sheffield Hallam University, City Campus"}, "14062500300": {"Name": "Sella A.", "AuthorID": "14062500300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "55944154200": {"Name": "Cor\u00e0 F.", "AuthorID": "55944154200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "7101707324": {"Name": "McMillan P.F.", "AuthorID": "7101707324", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "55307742600": {"Name": "Miller T.S.", "AuthorID": "55307742600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electrochemical Innovation Lab, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "7202774632": {"Name": "Howard C.A.", "AuthorID": "7202774632", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy and London Centre for Nanotechnology, University College London"}}}
