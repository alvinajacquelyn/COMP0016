We aimed to identify whether hypertension or other risk factors, including HIV-related factors, differ in their associations with stroke subtypes in people living with HIV (PLWHIV). Methods: HIV-1-positive individuals from the Data collection on Adverse events of anti-HIV Drugs (D:A:D) study were followed from the time of first blood pressure (BP) measurement after 1/1/1999 or study entry until the first of a validated stroke, 6 months after last follow-up or 1/2/2014. Stroke events were centrally validated using standardized criteria. Hypertension was defined as one systolic BP \u2265 140 mm Hg and/or diastolic BP \u2265 90 mm Hg. Poisson and Cox proportional hazards regression models determined associations of established cerebro/cardiovascular disease and HIV-related risk factors with stroke and tested whether these differed by stroke subtype. Findings: 590 strokes (83 hemorrhagic, 296 ischemic, 211 unknown) occurred over 339,979 person-years (PYRS) (incidence rate/1000 PYRS 1.74 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.60\u20131.88]). Common predictors of both hemorrhagic and ischemic strokes were hypertension (relative hazard 3.55 [95% CI 2.29\u20135.50] and 2.24 [1.77\u20132.84] respectively) and older age (1.28 [1.17\u20131.39] and 1.19 [1.12\u20131.25]). Male gender (1.62 [1.14\u20132.31] and 0.60 [0.35\u20130.91]), previous cardiovascular events (4.03 [2.91\u20135.57] and 1.44 [0.66\u20133.16]) and smoking (1.90 [1.41\u20132.56] and 1.08 [0.68\u20131.71]) were stronger predictors of ischemic then hemorrhagic strokes, whereas hypertension, hepatitis C (1.32 [0.72\u20132.40] and 0.46 [0.30\u20130.70]) and estimated glomerular filtration rate < 60 mL/min/1.72 m3 (4.80 [2.47\u20139.36] and 1.04 [0.67\u20131.60]) were stronger predictors of hemorrhagic than ischemic strokes. A CD4 count < 200 cells/\u03bcL was associated with an increased risk of hemorrhagic stroke only. Interpretation: Risk factors for stroke may differ by subtype in PLWHIV, emphasizing the importance of further research to increase the precision of stroke risk estimation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cerebrovascular disease", "Hemorrhagic stroke", "HIV", "Ischemic stroke", "Risk factors", "Stratified risk prediction", "Stroke"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85070254960", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"56058392600": {"Name": "Hatleberg C.I.", "AuthorID": "56058392600", "AffiliationID": "60030840, 60006564", "AffiliationName": "Centre of Excellence for Health, Immunity and Infections (CHIP), Department of Infectious Diseases, Rigshospitalet, University of Copenhagen"}, "54924488100": {"Name": "Ryom L.", "AuthorID": "54924488100", "AffiliationID": "60030840, 60006564", "AffiliationName": "Centre of Excellence for Health, Immunity and Infections (CHIP), Department of Infectious Diseases, Rigshospitalet, University of Copenhagen"}, "7005723136": {"Name": "Kirk O.", "AuthorID": "7005723136", "AffiliationID": "60030840, 60006564", "AffiliationName": "Centre of Excellence for Health, Immunity and Infections (CHIP), Department of Infectious Diseases, Rigshospitalet, University of Copenhagen"}, "35307337700": {"Name": "Lundgren J.D.", "AuthorID": "35307337700", "AffiliationID": "60030840, 60006564", "AffiliationName": "Centre of Excellence for Health, Immunity and Infections (CHIP), Department of Infectious Diseases, Rigshospitalet, University of Copenhagen"}, "43561184200": {"Name": "Kamara D.", "AuthorID": "43561184200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Global Health, UCL"}, "57202558738": {"Name": "Phillips A.", "AuthorID": "57202558738", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Global Health, UCL"}, "7006513758": {"Name": "Mocroft A.", "AuthorID": "7006513758", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Global Health, UCL"}, "56466212800": {"Name": "Sabin C.", "AuthorID": "56466212800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Global Health, UCL"}, "57203665572": {"Name": "De Wit S.", "AuthorID": "57203665572", "AffiliationID": "60029852, 60000145", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infectious Diseases, Saint Pierre University Hospital, Universit\u00e9 Libre de Bruxelles"}, "55556254800": {"Name": "Law M.", "AuthorID": "55556254800", "AffiliationID": "60026655, 60028333", "AffiliationName": "The Kirby Institute, UNSW Australia"}, "7005073010": {"Name": "Reiss P.", "AuthorID": "7005073010", "AffiliationID": "60172322", "AffiliationName": "HIV Monitoring Foundation"}, "57203678221": {"Name": "D'Arminio Monforte A.", "AuthorID": "57203678221", "AffiliationID": "60016182", "AffiliationName": "Dipartimento di Scienze della Salute, Clinica di Malattie Infettive e Tropicali, Azienda Ospedaliera-Polo Universitario San Paolo"}, "57208854241": {"Name": "Pradier C.", "AuthorID": "57208854241", "AffiliationID": "60030964", "AffiliationName": "Department of Public Health, Nice University Hospital"}, "25723285100": {"Name": "Kovari H.", "AuthorID": "25723285100", "AffiliationID": "60019619, 60012614", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infectious Diseases and Hospital Epidemiology, University Hospital of Zurich, University of Zurich"}, "55845420177": {"Name": "Bonnet F.", "AuthorID": "55845420177", "AffiliationID": "60102125, 60000905, 60116091, 60021564", "AffiliationName": "Universit\u00e9 de Bordeaux, ISPED, INSERM U1219, CHU de Bordeaux"}, "57202563904": {"Name": "El-Sadr W.", "AuthorID": "57202563904", "AffiliationID": "60030162, 60006781", "AffiliationName": "ICAP-Columbia University, Harlem Hospital"}}}
