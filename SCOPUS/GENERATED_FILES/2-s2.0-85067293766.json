OPAT services differ nationwide, with a paucity of high-quality outcome data to enable benchmarking. A retrospective review of clinical outcomes and adverse events (AEs) of all patients treated during 2008\u20132017 was performed to identify factors associated with success and failure. Regression models were used to identify factors associated with OPAT success, and AEs were described for the study population using definitions recommended by BSAC. In the 10-year period, 2870 patient episodes resulted in 69 610 days of treatment, with a 91.7% rate of successful therapy completion and 92.0% of infections cured or improved. We encountered 196 AEs, including 1 case of Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhoea. AEs occurred in 10.9% of patient episodes. Adverse drug and line events occurred at a rate of 3.3 and 1.78 per 1000 treatment days, respectively. Rashes, blood dyscrasias and hepatitis were the most common drug AEs. The odds of OPAT success was greater for patients who spent more time (>14 days) on OPAT therapy (OR = 2.32; P < 0.01), utilised a peripheral line (OR = 1.83; P < 0.01), were treated in the clinic compared with self-administration (OR = 2.1; P < 0.02) and did not experience an AE (OR = 0.23; P < 0.01). In our setting, the odds of a successful OPAT episode were associated with longer treatment course, OPAT delivered via a peripheral line, administration in an OPAT clinic setting, and no adverse line or drug events.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Adverse events", "Antimicrobial stewardship", "Intravenous antibiotics", "OPAT"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Ambulatory Care", "Anti-Bacterial Agents", "Bacterial Infections", "Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions", "Female", "Health Services Research", "Humans", "London", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Outpatients", "Retrospective Studies", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85067293766", "SubjectAreas": [["Microbiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2726"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"55899249900": {"Name": "Hatcher J.", "AuthorID": "55899249900", "AffiliationID": "60012558, 60111785", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infection, Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, Charing Cross Hospital"}, "57209306193": {"Name": "Cele R.", "AuthorID": "57209306193", "AffiliationID": "60012558, 60111785", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infection, Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, Charing Cross Hospital"}, "57209311073": {"Name": "Viljanen A.", "AuthorID": "57209311073", "AffiliationID": "60012558, 60111785", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infection, Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, Charing Cross Hospital"}, "36341165800": {"Name": "Samarasinghe D.", "AuthorID": "36341165800", "AffiliationID": "60012558, 60111785", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infection, Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, Charing Cross Hospital"}, "25626807100": {"Name": "Satta G.", "AuthorID": "25626807100", "AffiliationID": "60012558, 60111785", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infection, Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, Charing Cross Hospital"}, "6506985148": {"Name": "Brannigan E.", "AuthorID": "6506985148", "AffiliationID": "60012558, 60111785", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infection, Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, Charing Cross Hospital"}, "55650159300": {"Name": "De Barra E.", "AuthorID": "55650159300", "AffiliationID": "60012558, 60111785", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infection, Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, Charing Cross Hospital"}, "57220401609": {"Name": "Sanderson F.", "AuthorID": "57220401609", "AffiliationID": "60012558, 60111785", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infection, Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, Charing Cross Hospital"}, "57210091962": {"Name": "Gilchrist M.", "AuthorID": "57210091962", "AffiliationID": "60012558, 60111785", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infection, Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, Charing Cross Hospital"}, "24780732400": {"Name": "Costelloe C.", "AuthorID": "24780732400", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Primary Care and Public Health, School of Public Health, Imperial College London"}}}
