Fluxes of PCBs at all but one location prone to significant sediment resuspension peaked in the late-1960s/early-1990s, before declining thereafter. Input fluxes of HBCDs at all sites increased from first emergence in the mid-1960s. Thereafter, fluxes peaked in the late-1980s/early-2000s, before declining through to the present, except at the most urban site where HBCD fluxes are still increasing. Trends of PBDEs predominant in the Penta-BDE and Octa-BDE formulations vary between sites. While at some locations, fluxes peaked in the late-1990s/early-2000s; at others, fluxes are still increasing. This suggests the full impact of EU restrictions on these formulations has yet to be felt. Fluxes of BDE-209 have yet to peak at all except one location, suggesting little discernible environmental response to recent EU restrictions on the Deca-BDE product. Strikingly, fluxes of BDE-209 in the most recent core slices either exceed or approach peak fluxes of \u03c3PCBs, implying substantial UK use of Deca-BDE. Excepting HBCDs, inventories of our target contaminants correlated significantly with local population density, implying substantial urban sources.", "AuthorKeywords": ["English lakes", "HBCDs", "PBDEs", "PCBs", "Sediment core"], "IndexKeywords": ["Environmental response", "HBCDs", "Hexabromocyclododecanes", "PBDEs", "Polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDEs)", "Polychlorinated biphenyl (PCBs)", "Sediment core", "Sediment re suspensions", "Environmental Monitoring", "Geologic Sediments", "Halogenated Diphenyl Ethers", "Hydrocarbons, Brominated", "Lakes", "Polychlorinated Biphenyls", "Water Pollutants, Chemical", "Water Pollution, Chemical"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84943338995", "SubjectAreas": [["Environmental Engineering", "ENVI", "2305"], ["Environmental Chemistry", "ENVI", "2304"], ["Waste Management and Disposal", "ENVI", "2311"], ["Pollution", "ENVI", "2310"]], "AuthorData": {"35212450100": {"Name": "Yang C.", "AuthorID": "35212450100", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "School of Geography, Earth, and Environmental Sciences, University of Birmingham"}, "56264443000": {"Name": "Harrad S.", "AuthorID": "56264443000", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "School of Geography, Earth, and Environmental Sciences, University of Birmingham"}, "57203203579": {"Name": "Rose N.", "AuthorID": "57203203579", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Environmental Change Research Centre, Department of Geography, University College London"}, "7402275188": {"Name": "Turner S.", "AuthorID": "7402275188", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Environmental Change Research Centre, Department of Geography, University College London"}, "37035480700": {"Name": "Yang H.", "AuthorID": "37035480700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Environmental Change Research Centre, Department of Geography, University College London"}, "7005206390": {"Name": "Goldsmith B.", "AuthorID": "7005206390", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Environmental Change Research Centre, Department of Geography, University College London"}, "25922652200": {"Name": "Losada S.", "AuthorID": "25922652200", "AffiliationID": "60016939", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science, Cefas Lowestoft Laboratory"}, "7402350646": {"Name": "Barber J.", "AuthorID": "7402350646", "AffiliationID": "60016939", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science, Cefas Lowestoft Laboratory"}}}
