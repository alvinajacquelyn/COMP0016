Solubilities were also determined at 298.15 K for 23 crystalline nonelectrolyte organic compounds in triethylene glycol based on spectroscopic absorbance measurements. The experimental results of the headspace chromatographic and spectroscopic solubility measurements were converted to gas-to-triethylene glycol and water-to-triethylene glycol partition coefficients, and molar solubility ratios using standard thermodynamic relationships. Expressions were derived for solute transfer into triethylene glycol by combining our measured experimental values with published literature data. Mathematical correlations based on the Abraham model describe the observed partition coefficient and solubility data to within 0.16 log10 units (or less).", "AuthorKeywords": ["Headspace chromatographic analysis", "Infinite dilution activity coefficients", "Molar solubility ratios", "Partition Coefficients", "Solute transfer processes"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85033446208", "SubjectAreas": [["Biophysics", "BIOC", "1304"], ["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"]], "AuthorData": {"57200148048": {"Name": "Sedov I.", "AuthorID": "57200148048", "AffiliationID": "60070941", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Kazan Federal University"}, "56724070200": {"Name": "Magsumov T.", "AuthorID": "56724070200", "AffiliationID": "60070941", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Kazan Federal University"}, "56222214400": {"Name": "Hart E.", "AuthorID": "56222214400", "AffiliationID": "60024438", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of North Texas"}, "57191852124": {"Name": "Ramirez A.", "AuthorID": "57191852124", "AffiliationID": "60024438", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of North Texas"}, "57189996952": {"Name": "Cheeran S.", "AuthorID": "57189996952", "AffiliationID": "60024438", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of North Texas"}, "55485915700": {"Name": "Barrera M.", "AuthorID": "55485915700", "AffiliationID": "60024438", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of North Texas"}, "57190491364": {"Name": "Horton M.", "AuthorID": "57190491364", "AffiliationID": "60024438", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of North Texas"}, "56221718600": {"Name": "Wadawadigi A.", "AuthorID": "56221718600", "AffiliationID": "60024438", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of North Texas"}, "57194716404": {"Name": "Zha O.", "AuthorID": "57194716404", "AffiliationID": "60024438", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of North Texas"}, "57194870112": {"Name": "Tong X.", "AuthorID": "57194870112", "AffiliationID": "60024438", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of North Texas"}, "35496753700": {"Name": "Acree W.", "AuthorID": "35496753700", "AffiliationID": "60024438", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of North Texas"}, "7202901240": {"Name": "Abraham M.", "AuthorID": "7202901240", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}}}
