Such models are unable to recover fine details of atrophy patterns; they tend to impose an assumption of strong spatial correlation within each ROI and no correlation among ROIs. Such assumptions may be violated by the influence of underlying brain network connectivity on pathology propagation \u2013 a strong hypothesis e.g. in Alzheimer's Disease. Here we present DIVE: Data-driven Inference of Vertexwise Evolution. DIVE is an image-based disease progression model with single-vertex resolution, designed to reconstruct long-term patterns of brain pathology from short-term longitudinal data sets. DIVE clusters vertex-wise (i.e. point-wise) biomarker measurements on the cortical surface that have similar temporal dynamics across a patient population, and concurrently estimates an average trajectory of vertex measurements in each cluster. DIVE uniquely outputs a parcellation of the cortex into areas with common progression patterns, leading to a new signature for individual diseases. DIVE further estimates the disease stage and progression speed for every visit of every subject, potentially enhancing stratification for clinical trials or management. On simulated data, DIVE can recover ground truth clusters and their underlying trajectory, provided the average trajectories are sufficiently different between clusters. We demonstrate DIVE on data from two cohorts: the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and the Dementia Research Centre (DRC), UK. The DRC cohort contains patients with Posterior Cortical Atrophy (PCA) as well as typical Alzheimer's disease (tAD). DIVE finds similar spatial patterns of atrophy for tAD subjects in the two independent datasets (ADNI and DRC), and further reveals distinct patterns of pathology in different diseases (tAD vs PCA) and for distinct types of biomarker data \u2013 cortical thickness from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) vs amyloid load from Positron Emission Tomography (PET). We demonstrate that DIVE stages have potential clinical relevance, despite being based only on imaging data, by showing that the stages correlate with cognitive test scores. Finally, DIVE can be used to estimate a fine-grained spatial distribution of pathology in the brain using any kind of voxelwise or vertexwise measures including Jacobian compression maps, fractional anisotropy (FA) maps from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) or other PET measures.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alzheimer's disease", "Cortical thickness", "Disease progression model", "Posterior cortical atrophy", "Vertex-wise measures"], "IndexKeywords": ["Disease Progression", "Humans", "Models, Neurological", "Neurodegenerative Diseases", "Neuroimaging"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85062822224", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"]], "AuthorData": {"56878724200": {"Name": "Marinescu R.V.", "AuthorID": "56878724200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Image Computing, University College London"}, "26654433200": {"Name": "Lorenzi M.", "AuthorID": "26654433200", "AffiliationID": "60110693, 60013373", "AffiliationName": "Epione Research-Project, Inria, France and Universit\u00e9 C\u00f4te D'Azur"}, "56341184500": {"Name": "Young A.L.", "AuthorID": "56341184500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Image Computing, University College London"}, "6603551622": {"Name": "Oxtoby N.P.", "AuthorID": "6603551622", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Image Computing, University College London"}, "55884894500": {"Name": "Garbarino S.", "AuthorID": "55884894500", "AffiliationID": "60110693, 60013373", "AffiliationName": "Epione Research-Project, Inria, France and Universit\u00e9 C\u00f4te D'Azur"}, "7402830766": {"Name": "Alexander D.C.", "AuthorID": "7402830766", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Image Computing, University College London"}, "35795206700": {"Name": "Eshaghi A.", "AuthorID": "35795206700", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148, 60176027", "AffiliationName": "Queen Square Multiple Sclerosis Centre, UCL Institute of Neurology, Faculty of Brain Sciences, University College London"}, "6602191607": {"Name": "Crutch S.J.", "AuthorID": "6602191607", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dementia Research Centre, University College London Institute of Neurology"}, "null": {"Name": null, "AuthorID": null, "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
