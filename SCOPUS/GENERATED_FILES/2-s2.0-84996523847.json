To date, no pyrophosphatase has been identified that employs an arginine finger fulfilling all of the above properties; all essential arginine fingers are used to catalyze the cleavage of the \u03b3-phosphate. Here, we identify and unveil the role of a conserved arginine residue in trimeric dUTPases that meets all the criteria established for arginine fingers. We found that the conserved arginine adjacent to the P-loop-like motif enables structural organization of the active site for efficient catalysis via its nucleotide coordination, while its direct electrostatic role in transition state stabilization is secondary. An exhaustive structure-based comparison of analogous, conserved arginines from nucleotide hydrolases and transferases revealed a consensus amino acid location and orientation for contacting the \u03b3-phosphate of the substrate nucleotide. Despite the structurally equivalent position, functional differences between arginine fingers of dUTPases and NTPases are explained on the basis of the unique chemistry performed by the pyrophosphatase dUTPases.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Active site", "Arginine residue", "Pyrophosphatases", "Structural characterization", "Structural organization", "Structure-based", "Transition state stabilization", "Arginine", "Molecular Dynamics Simulation", "Molecular Structure", "Mycobacterium tuberculosis", "Pyrophosphatases", "Quantum Theory"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84996523847", "SubjectAreas": [["Catalysis", "CENG", "1503"], ["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Colloid and Surface Chemistry", "CENG", "1505"]], "AuthorData": {"56732469900": {"Name": "Nagy G.N.", "AuthorID": "56732469900", "AffiliationID": "60027811, 60001296, 60182609", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Enzymology, Research Centre for Natural Sciences, Hungarian Academy of Sciences"}, "16022284800": {"Name": "Leveles I.", "AuthorID": "16022284800", "AffiliationID": "60027811, 60001296, 60182609", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Enzymology, Research Centre for Natural Sciences, Hungarian Academy of Sciences"}, "7004513602": {"Name": "V\u00e9rtessy B.G.", "AuthorID": "7004513602", "AffiliationID": "60027811, 60001296, 60182609", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Enzymology, Research Centre for Natural Sciences, Hungarian Academy of Sciences"}, "36150950700": {"Name": "Lopata A.", "AuthorID": "36150950700", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "Astbury Centre for Structural Molecular Biology, Faculty of Biological Sciences, University of Leeds"}, "35386742300": {"Name": "T\u00f3th J.", "AuthorID": "35386742300", "AffiliationID": "60027811, 60001296, 60182609", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Enzymology, Research Centre for Natural Sciences, Hungarian Academy of Sciences"}, "14521613800": {"Name": "Suard\u00edaz R.", "AuthorID": "14521613800", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, King's College London"}, "8556311000": {"Name": "Rosta E.", "AuthorID": "8556311000", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, King's College London"}, "25646145800": {"Name": "Ozohanics O.", "AuthorID": "25646145800", "AffiliationID": "60027811, 60182609", "AffiliationName": "MS Proteomics Research Group, Institute of Organic Chemistry, Research Centre for Natural Sciences, Hungarian Academy of Sciences"}, "7005060014": {"Name": "V\u00e9key K.", "AuthorID": "7005060014", "AffiliationID": "60026055", "AffiliationName": "Szent Istvan University, Ybl Miklos Faculty of Architecture and Civil Engineering"}, "7201573094": {"Name": "Brooks B.R.", "AuthorID": "7201573094", "AffiliationID": "60005281, 60006577", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Computational Biology, National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health"}}}
