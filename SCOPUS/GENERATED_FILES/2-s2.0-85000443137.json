Methods An online questionnaire was sent to all European Paediatric Surgeons' Association (EUPSA) members. Results A total of 294 members (61 countries) answered (response rate: 61%). Diagnosis: All respondents perform rectal biopsies (61% rectal suction [RSBs], 39% open full-thickness), 96% contrast enema, and 31% anorectal manometry. At RSB, 17% take the most distal biopsy 1 cm above the dentate line, 34% take 2 cm, 30% take 3 cm, and 19% take > 3 cm. Rectal biopsy staining's are hematoxylin/eosin (77%), acetylcholinesterase (74%), calretinin (31%), S100 (2%), nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-tetrazolium reductase (2%), succinate dehydrogenase (1%), and neuron-specific enolase (1%). A total of 85% respondents recognize entities including hypoganglionosis (69%), intestinal neuronal dysplasia (55%), and ultrashort segment HD (50%). Surgery: Pull-through (PT) is performed at diagnosis by 33% or delayed by 67% (4 months or > 5 kg). Awaiting definitive surgery, 77% perform rectal irrigations, 22% rectal dilatation/stimulations, and 33% perform a stoma. The preferred type of PT is the Soave approach (65%), performed with transanal technique by 70% respondents. If symptoms persist after PT, most opt for conservative approach (enemas/laxatives = 76%; botulinum toxin = 27%), 30% would redo the PT. Total colonic aganglionosis: PT is performed in neonates (4%), at 1 to 6 months (29%), 6 to 12 months (37%) or older (30%). If required, a stoma is sited in the ileum (31%), according to intraoperative biopsies (54%), macroscopic impression (13%), and radiology (2%). Duhamel PT is performed by 52%, Soave by 31%, and Swenson by 17%. Overall, 31% would perform a J-pouch. Conclusions Most aspects of HD management lack consensus with wide variations in obtaining a diagnosis. Transanal Soave PT is the most common technique in standard segment HD. Guidelines should be developed to avoid such variability in management and to facilitate research studies.", "AuthorKeywords": ["aganglionosis", "congenital megacolon", "Duhamel", "Soave", "transanal"], "IndexKeywords": ["Digestive System Surgical Procedures", "Europe", "Hirschsprung Disease", "Humans", "Pediatrics", "Postoperative Care", "Practice Patterns, Physicians'", "Societies, Medical", "Specialties, Surgical"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85000443137", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"]], "AuthorData": {"7003624486": {"Name": "Zani A.", "AuthorID": "7003624486", "AffiliationID": "60032350", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Surgery, Sapienza University of Rome"}, "7102181886": {"Name": "Eaton S.", "AuthorID": "7102181886", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatric Surgery, University College London Institute of Child Health"}, "7004052737": {"Name": "Morini F.", "AuthorID": "7004052737", "AffiliationID": "60017905", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical and Surgical Neonatology, Bambino Gesu Children's Research Hospital"}, "7003559399": {"Name": "Bagolan P.", "AuthorID": "7003559399", "AffiliationID": "60017905", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical and Surgical Neonatology, Bambino Gesu Children's Research Hospital"}, "56000309600": {"Name": "Puri P.", "AuthorID": "56000309600", "AffiliationID": "112740561", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Surgery, National Children's Research Centre"}, "7005746997": {"Name": "Rintala R.", "AuthorID": "7005746997", "AffiliationID": "60021365", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Surgery, Hospital for Children and Adolescents"}, "55409357600": {"Name": "Heurn E.v.", "AuthorID": "55409357600", "AffiliationID": "60001157, 60001997", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatric Surgery, AMC/VUMC"}, "7003769857": {"Name": "Lukac M.", "AuthorID": "7003769857", "AffiliationID": "60069693", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neonatal Surgery, University Children's Hospital"}, "7004658320": {"Name": "Kuebler J.F.", "AuthorID": "7004658320", "AffiliationID": "60024052", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatric Surgery, Hannover Medical School"}, "43561373600": {"Name": "Friedmacher F.", "AuthorID": "43561373600", "AffiliationID": "60021923", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Surgery, King's College Hospital"}, "36884031700": {"Name": "Hoellwarth M.E.", "AuthorID": "36884031700", "AffiliationID": "60021923", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Surgery, King's College Hospital"}, "6701675712": {"Name": "Wijnen R.", "AuthorID": "6701675712", "AffiliationID": "60015627, 60032114", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatric Surgery Sophia Children's Hospital, ErasmusMC"}, "7101686384": {"Name": "Tovar J.A.", "AuthorID": "7101686384", "AffiliationID": "60028162", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatric Surgery, Hospital Universitario La Paz"}, "7007034902": {"Name": "Pierro A.", "AuthorID": "7007034902", "AffiliationID": "60030319", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Surgery, Hospital for Sick Children"}}}
