An assumption is it will result in social and economic benefits. However, it can be difficult to achieve because of cost, level of disruption and regulations. We present an alternative approach that provides an injection of playfulness into \"drab\" office buildings. A lightweight technology intervention was designed-Mood Squeezer-that asks people to reflect on their mood by squeezing a colored ball from a box set. The squeezes are mirrored back as an aggregate colorful visualization on a public floor display. An in-The-wild study showed how this intervention was successful at getting people to squeeze their mood, leading to a diversity of conversations throughout the building. We discuss how this lightweight approach to office augmentation can provide new opportunities for opening up a \"closed\" workplace.", "AuthorKeywords": ["In the wild", "Mood", "Physical computing", "Playful technology", "Public visualization", "Tangible interface", "Work"], "IndexKeywords": ["Colored balls", "Economic benefits", "Lightweight technology", "Mood", "Physical computing", "Tangible interfaces", "Work"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84968877309", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"]], "AuthorData": {"35810143200": {"Name": "Gallacher S.", "AuthorID": "35810143200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "7003925319": {"Name": "Rogers Y.", "AuthorID": "7003925319", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "7003753918": {"Name": "Capra L.", "AuthorID": "7003753918", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "22975444500": {"Name": "Harrison D.", "AuthorID": "22975444500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "57191485447": {"Name": "Marshall P.", "AuthorID": "57191485447", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "56649819800": {"Name": "O'Connor J.", "AuthorID": "56649819800", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Imperial College London"}, "57209025408": {"Name": "Bird J.", "AuthorID": "57209025408", "AffiliationID": "60025704", "AffiliationName": "City University London"}}}
