All rights reserved.Tankyrases-1 and -2 (TNKS-1 and TNKS-2) have three cellular roles which make them important targets in cancer. Using NAD+ as a substrate, they poly(ADP-ribosyl)ate TRF1 (regulating lengths of telomeres), NuMA (facilitating mitosis) and axin (in wnt/\u03b2-catenin signalling). Using molecular modelling and the structure of the weak inhibitor 5-aminoiso quinolin-1-one, 3-aryl-5-substituted-isoquinolin-1-ones were designed as inhibitors to explore the structure-activity relationships (SARs) for binding and to define the shape of a hydrophobic cavity in the active site. 5-Amino-3-arylisoquinolinones were synthesised by Suzuki-Miyaura coupling of arylboronic acids to 3-bromo-1-methoxy-5-nitro-isoquinoline, reduction and O-demethylation. 3-Aryl-5-methylisoquinolin-1-ones, 3-aryl-5-fluoroisoquinolin-1-ones and 3-aryl-5-methoxyisoquinolin-1-ones were accessed by deprotonation of 3-substituted-N,N,2-trimethylbenzamides and quench with an appropriate benzonitrile. SAR around the isoquinolinone core showed that aryl was required at the 3-position, optimally with a para-substituent. Small meta-substituents were tolerated but groups in the ortho-positions reduced or abolished activity. This was not due to lack of coplanarity of the rings, as shown by the potency of 4,5-dimethyl-3-phenylisoquinolin-1-one. Methyl and methoxy were optimal at the 5-position. SAR was rationalised by modelling and by crystal structures of examples with TNKS-2. The 3-aryl unit was located in a large hydrophobic cavity and the para-substituents projected into a tunnel leading to the exterior. Potency against TNKS-1 paralleled potency against TNKS-2. Most inhibitors were highly selective for TNKSs over PARP-1 and PARP-2. A range of highly potent and selective inhibitors is now available for cellular studies.", "AuthorKeywords": ["7-Aryl-1-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-1,6-naphthyridin-5-one", "Crystal structure", "Naphthyridinone", "Tankyrase", "TNKS"], "IndexKeywords": ["Binding Sites", "Molecular Structure", "Structure-Activity Relationship", "Tankyrases"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84946119528", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Molecular Medicine", "BIOC", "1313"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Pharmaceutical Science", "PHAR", "3003"], ["Drug Discovery", "PHAR", "3002"], ["Clinical Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1308"], ["Organic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1605"]], "AuthorData": {"55782466700": {"Name": "Paine H.", "AuthorID": "55782466700", "AffiliationID": "60030480", "AffiliationName": "Medicinal Chemistry, Department of Pharmacy and Pharmacology, University of Bath"}, "23976517100": {"Name": "Nathubhai A.", "AuthorID": "23976517100", "AffiliationID": "60030480", "AffiliationName": "Medicinal Chemistry, Department of Pharmacy and Pharmacology, University of Bath"}, "8845545300": {"Name": "Woon E.", "AuthorID": "8845545300", "AffiliationID": "60017161", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacy, National University of Singapore"}, "15021396100": {"Name": "Sunderland P.", "AuthorID": "15021396100", "AffiliationID": "60030480", "AffiliationName": "Medicinal Chemistry, Department of Pharmacy and Pharmacology, University of Bath"}, "7402901964": {"Name": "Wood P.", "AuthorID": "7402901964", "AffiliationID": "60030480", "AffiliationName": "Medicinal Chemistry, Department of Pharmacy and Pharmacology, University of Bath"}, "14620832200": {"Name": "Lloyd M.", "AuthorID": "14620832200", "AffiliationID": "60030480", "AffiliationName": "Medicinal Chemistry, Department of Pharmacy and Pharmacology, University of Bath"}, "57209640739": {"Name": "Thompson A.", "AuthorID": "57209640739", "AffiliationID": "60030480", "AffiliationName": "Medicinal Chemistry, Department of Pharmacy and Pharmacology, University of Bath"}, "7007083713": {"Name": "Threadgill M.", "AuthorID": "7007083713", "AffiliationID": "60030480", "AffiliationName": "Medicinal Chemistry, Department of Pharmacy and Pharmacology, University of Bath"}, "7102995178": {"Name": "Mahon M.", "AuthorID": "7102995178", "AffiliationID": "60030480", "AffiliationName": "X-ray Crystallographic Suite, Department of Chemistry, University of Bath"}, "24721070700": {"Name": "Haikarainen T.", "AuthorID": "24721070700", "AffiliationID": "60012954", "AffiliationName": "Biocenter Oulu and Faculty of Biochemistry and Molecular Medicine, University of Oulu"}, "54978331600": {"Name": "Narwal M.", "AuthorID": "54978331600", "AffiliationID": "60012954", "AffiliationName": "Biocenter Oulu and Faculty of Biochemistry and Molecular Medicine, University of Oulu"}, "6507478836": {"Name": "Lehti\u00f6 L.", "AuthorID": "6507478836", "AffiliationID": "60012954", "AffiliationName": "Biocenter Oulu and Faculty of Biochemistry and Molecular Medicine, University of Oulu"}}}
