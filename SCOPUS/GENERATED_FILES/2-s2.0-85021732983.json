More recently, some early apartments have been demolished and replaced by high-rise or non-residential buildings, but others have acquired heritage status. Small-scale, originally walk-up apartments on inner suburban residential streets are praised for their domestic and homely characteristics, precisely what they were thought to lack when first erected. Through a series of brief case studies, this article traces the changing fortunes of pre-First World War apartment houses in Toronto and Montreal. It charts both their 'real' experience of neglect, abandonment, reuse, conservation or renovation, and their representation in literature and on screen: as 'bohemian', 'modern', home to dysfunctional or marginal characters, or complex mixtures of semi-public and semi-private space. While survival or demolition has sometimes been a matter of chance, it is also evident that geography is critical in determining their fate.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Apartments", "Film", "Housing", "Literary representation", "Montreal", "Toronto", "Urban planning"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85021732983", "SubjectAreas": [["Cultural Studies", "SOCI", "3316"], ["History", "ARTS", "1202"], ["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"], ["Literature and Literary Theory", "ARTS", "1208"]], "AuthorData": {"7201358499": {"Name": "Dennis R.", "AuthorID": "7201358499", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
