Within the last three decades, two of its members (MED and MEAM1) have become some of the world\u2019s most damaging agricultural pests invading countries across Europe, Africa, Asia and the Americas and affecting a vast range of agriculturally important food and fiber crops through both feeding-related damage and the transmission of numerous plant viruses. For some time now, researchers have relied on a single mitochondrial gene and/or a handful of nuclear markers to study this species complex. Here, we move beyond this by using 38,041 genome-wide Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms, and show that the two invasive members of the complex are closely related species with signatures of introgression with a third species (IO). Gene flow patterns were traced between contemporary invasive populations within MED and MEAM1 species and these were best explained by recent international trade. These findings have profound implications for delineating the B. tabaci species status and will impact quarantine measures and future management strategies of this global pest.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85041109500", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"26424179900": {"Name": "Elfekih S.", "AuthorID": "26424179900", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Zoology, University of Cambridge"}, "7004685553": {"Name": "Tay W.", "AuthorID": "7004685553", "AffiliationID": "60029470", "AffiliationName": "CSIRO, Black Mountain Laboratories"}, "7202358006": {"Name": "Gordon K.", "AuthorID": "7202358006", "AffiliationID": "60029470", "AffiliationName": "CSIRO, Black Mountain Laboratories"}, "57194090538": {"Name": "Etter P.", "AuthorID": "57194090538", "AffiliationID": "60012317", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Molecular Biology, University of Oregon"}, "55731245000": {"Name": "Johnson E.", "AuthorID": "55731245000", "AffiliationID": "60012317", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Molecular Biology, University of Oregon"}, "35361943100": {"Name": "Fumagalli M.", "AuthorID": "35361943100", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Life Sciences, Silwood Park Campus, Imperial College London"}, "6701432818": {"Name": "De Barro P.", "AuthorID": "6701432818", "AffiliationID": "60029470", "AffiliationName": "CSIRO, Ecosciences Precinct"}}}
