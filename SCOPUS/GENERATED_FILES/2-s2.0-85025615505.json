Historically, the application of external fields in non-equilibrium molecular dynamics has been restricted, by and large, to relatively inexpensive, more or less sophisticated, empirical models. Here, we report long-time non-equilibrium ab initio molecular dynamics in both static and oscillating (time-dependent) external electric fields, therefore opening up a new vista in rigorous studies of electric-field effects on dynamical systems with the full arsenal of electronic-structure methods. In so doing, we apply this to liquid water with state-of-the-art non-local treatment of dispersion, and we compute a range of field effects on structural and dynamical properties, such as diffusivities and hydrogen-bond kinetics.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Ab initio molecular dynamics", "Alternating electric field", "Dynamical properties", "Empirical model", "External electric field", "External fields", "Non equilibrium molecular dynamic (NEMD)", "State of the art"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85025615505", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"]], "AuthorData": {"32067636300": {"Name": "Futera Z.", "AuthorID": "32067636300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "7004765766": {"Name": "English N.", "AuthorID": "7004765766", "AffiliationID": "60005141", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemical and Bioprocess Engineering, University College Dublin"}}}
