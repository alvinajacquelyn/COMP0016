After a brief introduction of normal histological changes in paediatric liver, we discuss the histological approach to neonatal cholestasis. A second paragraph provides a more general description of the histological patterns observed in infants and older children with metabolic disorders outside the context of neonatal cholestasis. The emphasis is on the histological interpretation at light microscopy on paraffin sections.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Copper", "Liver", "Liver biopsy", "Metabolic disorders", "Neonatal cholestasis", "Siderosis", "Steatosis", "Storage disorder"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84938978402", "SubjectAreas": [["Pathology and Forensic Medicine", "MEDI", "2734"], ["Histology", "MEDI", "2722"]], "AuthorData": {"57032486200": {"Name": "Rosini F.", "AuthorID": "57032486200", "AffiliationID": "60021923", "AffiliationName": "Department of Liver Histopathology, King's College Hospital"}, "55357692500": {"Name": "Quaglia A.", "AuthorID": "55357692500", "AffiliationID": "60021923, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "Liver Histopathology, Institute of Liver Studies, King's College Hospital/ King's College London"}}}
