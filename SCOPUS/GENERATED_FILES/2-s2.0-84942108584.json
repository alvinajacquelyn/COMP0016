Design/methodology/approach \u2013 In all, 50 treatment studies (n=13,886) were examined using a random effects meta-analysis model. Findings \u2013 Results indicated a positive effect of treatment for both sexual (OR=0.58, 95%, CI 0.45-0.74, p < 0.0001), and general recidivism (OR=0.54, 95%, CI 0.42-0.69, p < 0.0001), indicating that the likelihood of being reconvicted after treatment was around half compared to no treatment. RCTs showed no significant effect for sexual or general, recidivism. Significant effects were found for non-RCT designs (i.e. incidental cohort, completers vs non-completers designs). Assignment based on need (i.e. giving treatment to those who were high-risk) indicated a negative effect of treatment. Practical implications \u2013 The results highlight the importance of considering study design when considering treatment efficacy. Originality/value \u2013 The current research reports studies identified up until 2009, and examined both published, and unpublished, research originating from a variety of samples employing a random effects model. Consequently, it can be argued that the results are both original and are reflective not only of identified studies, but are also representative of a random set of observations drawn from the common population distribution (Fleiss, 1993). The results of the study suggest that what is required in future research is methodological rigour, and consistency, in the way in which researchers measure the effectiveness of sexual offender treatment.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Biases", "Meta-analysis", "Random effects models", "Research designs", "Sex offenders", "Treatment"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84942108584", "SubjectAreas": [["Social Psychology", "PSYC", "3207"], ["Health (social science)", "SOCI", "3306"], ["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"], ["Law", "SOCI", "3308"]], "AuthorData": {"7004753810": {"Name": "Beech A.", "AuthorID": "7004753810", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, University of Birmingham"}, "57204674407": {"Name": "Freemantle N.", "AuthorID": "57204674407", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Primary Care and Population Health, University College London"}, "56865505000": {"Name": "Power C.", "AuthorID": "56865505000", "AffiliationID": "101882935", "AffiliationName": "Psychology Department, Partnerships in Care"}, "7403343762": {"Name": "Fisher D.", "AuthorID": "7403343762", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "The University of Birmingham"}}}
