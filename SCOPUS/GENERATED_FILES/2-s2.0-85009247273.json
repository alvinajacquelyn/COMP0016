The \u03ba values of these composites, fabricated by spark plasma sintering (SPS), are independently analyzed for the two characteristic directions defined by the GNPs orientation within the ceramic matrix; that is to say, perpendicular and parallel to the SPS pressing axis. Conversely to other ceramic/graphene systems, AlN composites experience a reduction of \u03ba with the graphene addition for both orientations; actually the decrease of \u03ba for the in-plane graphene orientation results rather unusual. This behavior is conveniently reproduced when an interface thermal resistance is introduced in effective media thermal conductivity models. Also remarkable is the change in the electrical properties of AlN becoming an electrical conductor (200 S m\u22121) for graphene contents above 5 vol.%.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Aluminum nitride (AlN)", "Composites", "Electrical conductivity", "Graphene", "Interface thermal resistence", "Thermal conductivity"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aluminum nitride (AlN)", "Aluminum nitride ceramics", "Electrical conductivity", "Electrical conductors", "Graphene nanoplatelets", "Interface thermal resistance", "Thermal and electrical properties", "Thermal conductivity model"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85009247273", "SubjectAreas": [["Ceramics and Composites", "MATE", "2503"], ["Materials Chemistry", "MATE", "2505"]], "AuthorData": {"57192944009": {"Name": "Simsek I.N.G.", "AuthorID": "57192944009", "AffiliationID": "60032711", "AffiliationName": "Bulent Ecevit University Incivez"}, "36721979400": {"Name": "Nistal A.", "AuthorID": "36721979400", "AffiliationID": "60029738", "AffiliationName": "School of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, Queen \u0301s University Belfast"}, "7402249990": {"Name": "Garc\u00eda E.", "AuthorID": "7402249990", "AffiliationID": "60011966, 60006754", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Ceramics and Glass (ICV), CSIC"}, "8873779500": {"Name": "P\u00e9rez-Coll D.", "AuthorID": "8873779500", "AffiliationID": "60194551, 60024825", "AffiliationName": "Nanotechnology Research Division, Centre for Mechanical Technology and Automation, Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Aveiro"}, "7003944724": {"Name": "Miranzo P.", "AuthorID": "7003944724", "AffiliationID": "60011966, 60006754", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Ceramics and Glass (ICV), CSIC"}, "7003462423": {"Name": "Osendi M.I.", "AuthorID": "7003462423", "AffiliationID": "60011966, 60006754", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Ceramics and Glass (ICV), CSIC"}}}
