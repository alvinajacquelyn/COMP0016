However, this mode of inspection is ineffectual when dealing with mature classes of threat, for which adversaries have refined effective concealment techniques. Furthermore, these methods may be unable to detect potential threats that have never been seen before. Therefore, in this paper, we investigate an anomaly detection framework, at X-ray image patch-level, based on: (i) image representations, and (ii) the detection of anomalies relative to those representations. We present encouraging preliminary results, using representations learnt using convolutional neural networks, as well as several contributions to a general-purpose anomaly detection algorithm based on decision-tree learning.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Anomaly detection", "cargo screening", "deep learning", "machine learning", "representation-learning", "security imaging", "X-ray imaging"], "IndexKeywords": ["Anomaly detection", "Cargo screening", "representation-learning", "Security imaging", "Xray imaging"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85025174120", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"57195068529": {"Name": "Andrews J.", "AuthorID": "57195068529", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Security Science Doctoral Research Training Centre, University College London"}, "15135989700": {"Name": "Jaccard N.", "AuthorID": "15135989700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "56411613900": {"Name": "Rogers T.", "AuthorID": "56411613900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Security Science Doctoral Research Training Centre, University College London"}, "7102753156": {"Name": "Griffin L.", "AuthorID": "7102753156", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}}}
