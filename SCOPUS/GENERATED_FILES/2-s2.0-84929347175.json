The former group of processes includes ecological filtering and convergent or parallel evolution, the latter competitive exclusion, character displacement and divergent evolution. We used a unique eco-evolutionary study system composed of two independent pairs of coexisting amphipod species (genus Niphargus) from the sulfidic caves Movile in Romania and Frasassi in Italy to study the relative contribution and interaction of both processes. We looked at the shape of the multifunctional ventral channel as a trait ostensibly related to oxygenation and sulfide detoxification, and at body size as a resource-related trait. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that the sulfidic caves were colonized separately by ancestors of each species. Species within pairs were more dissimilar in their morphology than expected according to a null model based on regional species pool. This might indicate competitive interactions shaping the morphology of these amphipod species. Moreover, our results suggest that the shape of the ventral channel is not subject to long-term convergent selection or to the process of environmental filtering, and as such probably does not play a role in sulfide tolerance. Nevertheless, the ancestral conditions reconstructed using the comparative method tended to be more similar than null-model expectations. This shift in patterns may reflect a temporal hierarchy of eco-evolutionary processes, in which initial environmental filtering became later on superseded by character displacement or other competition-driven divergent evolutionary processes.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Amphipoda", "Animals", "Biological Evolution", "Caves", "Phylogeny", "Sulfides"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84929347175", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"14618981100": {"Name": "Fi\u0161er C.", "AuthorID": "14618981100", "AffiliationID": "60031106", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biology, Biotechnical Faculty, University of Ljubljana"}, "26532976100": {"Name": "Lu\u0161trik R.", "AuthorID": "26532976100", "AffiliationID": "60031106", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biology, Biotechnical Faculty, University of Ljubljana"}, "6601977767": {"Name": "Trontelj P.", "AuthorID": "6601977767", "AffiliationID": "60000762, 60072319", "AffiliationName": "Museum f\u00fcr Naturkunde, Leibniz-Institut f\u00fcr Evolutions- und Biodiversit\u00e4tsforschung an der Humboldt-Universit\u00e4t zu Berlin"}, "6603485558": {"Name": "Sarbu S.", "AuthorID": "6603485558", "AffiliationID": "114270178", "AffiliationName": "Grupul de Explor ri Subacvatice \u015fi Speologice"}, "14069862900": {"Name": "Flot J.", "AuthorID": "14069862900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genetics, Evolution and Environment, University College London"}}}
