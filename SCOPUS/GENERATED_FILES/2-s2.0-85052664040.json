Published by S. Karger AG, Basel.Caries is the most prevalent chronic condition worldwide and the association between high-level intake of sugars and dental decay is strong and well established. Interestingly, to combat caries, dental practitioners and public health dentists in many countries have focused mainly on the application of different kinds of fluorides and fissure sealants but not on the reduction of sugar intake. Furthermore, for many years, sugars have not been the focus of dental research activities presented at the annual conferences of the European Organisation for Caries Research (ORCA) and the European Association of Dental Public Health (EADPH). In 2015, following the publication of the new WHO guidelines on the intake of sugars, the boards of ORCA and EADPH agreed to organize a common symposium entitled \"Joint ORCA-ADPH Symposium on Sugar: The Oral Health Perspective\". This symposium was organized by a scientific committee and took place on July 6, 2016, in association with the 63rd ORCA Congress in Athens, Greece. It included 9 lectures highlighting different aspects of sugar consumption, contribution of sugar to dental caries, measuring sugar consumption, and fighting against sugar on a patient and public health basis. The purpose of this commentary is to give background information about the rationale of the above-mentioned symposium.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Caries", "Oral health", "Sugar"], "IndexKeywords": ["Dental Caries", "Dietary Sugars", "Greece", "Humans", "Oral Health", "Pit and Fissure Sealants", "Sugars"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85052664040", "SubjectAreas": [["Dentistry (all)", "DENT", "3500"]], "AuthorData": {"7102494745": {"Name": "Schulte A.", "AuthorID": "7102494745", "AffiliationID": "60022113", "AffiliationName": "Department of Special Care Dentistry, Dental School, Witten/Herdecke University"}, "57204336866": {"Name": "Tsakos G.", "AuthorID": "57204336866", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}}}
