As well as developing foundational theory, we give existence, non-existence and classification results for these instantons. We particularly focus on R4\u00d7 S3 with its two explicitly known distinct holonomy G2 metrics, which have different volume growths at infinity, exhibiting the different behaviour of instantons in these settings. We also give an explicit example of sequences of G2-instantons where \u201cbubbling\u201d and \u201cremovable singularity\u201d phenomena occur in the limit.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85040073213", "SubjectAreas": [["Mathematics (all)", "MATH", "2600"]], "AuthorData": {"20734663500": {"Name": "Lotay J.D.", "AuthorID": "20734663500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University College London"}, "56417231100": {"Name": "Oliveira G.", "AuthorID": "56417231100", "AffiliationID": "60008724", "AffiliationName": "Mathematics Department, Duke University"}}}
