These features are functionally organized into a hierarchy that precisely controls stepping in a stereotypic, speed-dependent fashion. Here, we show that a specific component of the locomotor pattern can be independently manipulated. Silencing spinal L2 interneurons that project to L5 selectively disrupts hindlimb alternation allowing a continuum of walking to hopping to emerge from the otherwise intact network. This perturbation, which is independent of speed and occurs spontaneously with each step, does not disrupt multi-joint movements or forelimb alternation, nor does it translate to a non-weight-bearing locomotor activity. Both the underlying rhythm and the usual relationship between speed and spatiotemporal characteristics of stepping persist. These data illustrate that hindlimb alternation can be manipulated independently from other core features of stepping, revealing a striking freedom in an otherwise precisely controlled system.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Biomechanical Phenomena", "Cell Count", "Electromyography", "Female", "Forelimb", "Hindlimb", "Interneurons", "Locomotion", "Models, Animal", "Motor Neurons", "Muscle, Skeletal", "Nerve Net", "Neural Pathways", "Rats", "Rats, Sprague-Dawley", "Spatio-Temporal Analysis", "Spinal Cord", "Spinal Cord Injuries", "Synapses", "Walking", "Walking Speed"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85038418906", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"57199836809": {"Name": "Pocratsky A.M.", "AuthorID": "57199836809", "AffiliationID": "60020633", "AffiliationName": "Kentucky Spinal Cord Injury Research Center, University of Louisville"}, "55432809300": {"Name": "States G.J.R.", "AuthorID": "55432809300", "AffiliationID": "60020633", "AffiliationName": "Kentucky Spinal Cord Injury Research Center, University of Louisville"}, "35493373800": {"Name": "Whittemore S.R.", "AuthorID": "35493373800", "AffiliationID": "60020633", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurological Surgery, University of Louisville"}, "35512160200": {"Name": "Magnuson D.S.K.", "AuthorID": "35512160200", "AffiliationID": "60020633", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurological Surgery, University of Louisville"}, "7403247663": {"Name": "Burke D.A.", "AuthorID": "7403247663", "AffiliationID": "60020633", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurological Surgery, University of Louisville"}, "35737672900": {"Name": "Morehouse J.R.", "AuthorID": "35737672900", "AffiliationID": "60020633", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurological Surgery, University of Louisville"}, "35736736100": {"Name": "Beare J.E.", "AuthorID": "35736736100", "AffiliationID": "60020633", "AffiliationName": "Cardiovascular Innovation Institute, Department of Physiology and Biophysics, University of Louisville"}, "57199844614": {"Name": "Riegler A.S.", "AuthorID": "57199844614", "AffiliationID": "60020633", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurological Surgery, University of Louisville"}, "6604050486": {"Name": "Tsoulfas P.", "AuthorID": "6604050486", "AffiliationID": "60021519, 60009932", "AffiliationName": "Miami Project to Cure Paralysis, Department of Neurological Surgery, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine"}}}
