International Journal of Cancer published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of UICCWe used a cross-sectional survey to examine short-term anxiety and distress in women receiving different results following routine human papillomavirus (HPV) primary testing at cervical screening. Participants were women aged 24\u201365 (n = 1,127) who had attended screening at one of five sites piloting HPV primary screening in England, including a control group with normal cytology who were not tested for HPV. Women completed a postal questionnaire ~2 weeks after receiving their screening result. Unadjusted mean anxiety scores ranged from 32.9 (standard deviation [SD] = 12.2) in HPV-negative women to 42.1 (SD = 14.9) in women who were HPV-positive with abnormal cytology. In adjusted analyses, anxiety was significantly higher in women testing HPV-positive with either normal cytology (mean difference [MD] = 3.5, CI: 0.6\u20136.4) or abnormal cytology (MD = 7.2, CI: 3.7\u201310.6), than the control group. Distress was slightly higher in women who tested HPV-positive with abnormal cytology (MD = 0.9, CI: 0.02\u20131.8), than the control group. We also found increased odds of very high anxiety in women who tested HPV-positive with normal or abnormal cytology compared to the control group. This pattern of results was only observed among women receiving their first HPV-positive result, not among women found to have persistent HPV at 12-month follow-up. Testing HPV-positive with normal cytology for the first time, is associated with elevated anxiety despite carrying very low immediate cervical cancer risk. However, receiving the same test result at 12-month early recall does not appear to be associated with higher anxiety, suggesting anxiety may normalise with repeated exposure and/or over time.", "AuthorKeywords": ["cancer screening", "human papillomavirus", "psychological impact", "psychological wellbeing", "women"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Anxiety", "Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia", "Cervix Uteri", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Female", "Humans", "Mass Screening", "Middle Aged", "Papillomaviridae", "Papillomavirus Infections", "Precancerous Conditions", "Risk", "Stress, Psychological", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "Vaginal Smears", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85069909348", "SubjectAreas": [["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Cancer Research", "BIOC", "1306"]], "AuthorData": {"57192714631": {"Name": "McBride E.", "AuthorID": "57192714631", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Behavioural Science and Health, Institute of Epidemiology and Health Care, University College London"}, "6508131110": {"Name": "Marlow L.A.V.", "AuthorID": "6508131110", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Behavioural Science and Health, Institute of Epidemiology and Health Care, University College London"}, "16300728600": {"Name": "Forster A.S.", "AuthorID": "16300728600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Behavioural Science and Health, Institute of Epidemiology and Health Care, University College London"}, "57191898211": {"Name": "Waller J.", "AuthorID": "57191898211", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Behavioural Science and Health, Institute of Epidemiology and Health Care, University College London"}, "6701886920": {"Name": "Ridout D.", "AuthorID": "6701886920", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Population, Policy and Practice Programme, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "35451402200": {"Name": "Kitchener H.", "AuthorID": "35451402200", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "Women's Cancer Centre, Institute of Cancer Sciences, University of Manchester"}, "56231743100": {"Name": "Patnick J.", "AuthorID": "56231743100", "AffiliationID": "60002634", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Epidemiology Unit, Nuffield Department of Population Health, University of Oxford"}}}
