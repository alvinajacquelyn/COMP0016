When looking up or downwind these models represent the strong correlation between mean Doppler shift and local spectrum intensity. When combined with random fluctuations of spectrum width, these characteristics give the spectra a temporal and spatial variability. The models are used to predict clutter spectrum statistics as a function of Doppler frequency and these are compared with statistics derived from the original data. It is also shown how realistic range-varying coherent clutter returns can be simulated using the models.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Airborne platforms", "Doppler frequency", "Doppler spectra", "High range resolution", "Model assessment", "Random fluctuation", "Strong correlation", "Temporal and spatial variability"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84955456227", "SubjectAreas": [["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"7202546334": {"Name": "Watts S.", "AuthorID": "7202546334", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL"}, "36186273500": {"Name": "Ritchie M.", "AuthorID": "36186273500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL"}, "9840409300": {"Name": "Rosenberg L.", "AuthorID": "9840409300", "AffiliationID": "60009512", "AffiliationName": "University of Adelaide"}, "56372160700": {"Name": "Bocquet S.", "AuthorID": "56372160700", "AffiliationID": "60003480", "AffiliationName": "Defence Science and Technology Group"}}}
