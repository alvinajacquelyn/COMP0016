Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Royal Astronomical Society.We measure the effect of high column density absorbing systems of neutral hydrogen (H I) on the one-dimensional (1D) Lyman \u03b1 forest flux power spectrum using cosmological hydrodynamical simulations from the Illustris project. High column density absorbers (which we define to be those with HI column densities N(H I) > 1.6 \u00d7 1017 atoms cm-2) cause broadened absorption lines with characteristic damping wings. These damping wings bias the 1D Lyman \u03b1 forest flux power spectrum by causing absorption in quasar spectra away from the location of the absorber itself. We investigate the effect of high column density absorbers on the Lyman \u03b1 forest using hydrodynamical simulations for the first time. We provide templates as a function of column density and redshift, allowing the flexibility to accurately model residual contamination, i.e. if an analysis selectively clips out the largest damping wings. This flexibility will improve cosmological parameter estimation, for example, allowing more accurate measurement of the shape of the power spectrum, with implications for cosmological models containing massive neutrinos or a running of the spectral index. We provide fitting functions to reproduce these results so that they can be incorporated straightforwardly into a data analysis pipeline.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cosmology: theory", "Large-scale structure of universe"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85040234035", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"57190816407": {"Name": "Rogers K.K.", "AuthorID": "57190816407", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "23991274600": {"Name": "Peiris H.V.", "AuthorID": "23991274600", "AffiliationID": "60028378", "AffiliationName": "Oskar Klein Centre for Cosmoparticle Physics, Stockholm University, AlbaNova"}, "22036053000": {"Name": "Pontzen A.", "AuthorID": "22036053000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "27267690300": {"Name": "Font-Ribera A.", "AuthorID": "27267690300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "25630446200": {"Name": "Bird S.", "AuthorID": "25630446200", "AffiliationID": "60005248", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, Johns Hopkins University"}, "55151435200": {"Name": "Leistedt B.", "AuthorID": "55151435200", "AffiliationID": "60021784", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, New York University"}}}
