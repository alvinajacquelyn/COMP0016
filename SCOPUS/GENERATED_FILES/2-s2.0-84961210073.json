A small evidence base of conflicting findings has emerged for psychological interventions, including Cognitive Therapy (CT), in alleviating self-stigma. The aim of this study was to examine the experiences of service users who had undertaken a CT intervention targeting self-stigma in psychosis. Eight service users with experiences of psychosis took part in this study. They had all undertaken an individual CT intervention for self-stigma as part of a pilot randomised controlled trial. A semi-structured interview was conducted examining their subjective experiences of the intervention. Data were analysed using thematic analysis methodology. The analysis identified three distinct themes: what helped, what hindered and what came of it. What helped incorporated the beneficial change mechanisms of the CT intervention; what hindered identified specific challenges of the intervention; and what came of it described the consequences and outcomes of receiving the intervention. Overall, CT for self-stigma was found to be valuable by the majority of participants. The therapeutic relationship, psychoeducation, and normalisation were identified as the most important factors of therapy.", "AuthorKeywords": ["CBT", "internalised stigma", "service user perspectives", "stigma"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84961210073", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"7202513618": {"Name": "Wood L.", "AuthorID": "7202513618", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "Division of Clinical Psychology, School of Psychological Sciences, The University of Manchester"}, "56489883100": {"Name": "Burke E.M.", "AuthorID": "56489883100", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "Division of Clinical Psychology, School of Psychological Sciences, The University of Manchester"}, "36099908000": {"Name": "Byrne R.", "AuthorID": "36099908000", "AffiliationID": "60122796", "AffiliationName": "Psychosis Research Unit, Greater Manchester West NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7402258312": {"Name": "Morrison A.", "AuthorID": "7402258312", "AffiliationID": "60122796", "AffiliationName": "Psychosis Research Unit, Greater Manchester West NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
