This study addresses the question: Has there been a shift in attitudes to Patient and Public Involvement (PPI) and Public Engagement in Science (PES) amongst researchers? Methods: Attitudes to PPI and PES within a cluster of three NIHR supported Biomedical Research Centres were explored through in-depth interviews with 19 researchers. Results: Participants distinguished PPI (as an activity involving patients and carers in research projects and programmes) from PES (as an activity that aims to communicate research findings to the public, engage the public with broader issues of science policy or promote a greater understanding of the role of science in society). While participants demonstrated a range of attitudes to these practices, they shared a resistance to sharing power and control of the research process with the public and patients. Conclusion: While researchers were prepared to engage with the public and patients and listed the advantages of engagement, the study revealed few differences in their underlying attitudes towards the role of society in science (and science in society) to those reported in previous studies. To the participants science remains the preserve of scientists, with patients and the public invited to 'tinker at the edges'.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Attitudes", "Biomedical research", "Mode 1 and Mode 2", "Patient and Public involvement", "Public Engagement in Science", "Scientists"], "IndexKeywords": ["Attitude", "Attitude of Health Personnel", "Biomedical Research", "Humans", "Information Dissemination", "Interviews as Topic", "Patient Participation", "Professional-Patient Relations", "Research Personnel", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84964526802", "SubjectAreas": [["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"14011786700": {"Name": "Boaz A.", "AuthorID": "14011786700", "AffiliationID": "60029329, 60172339, 60033359", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Health, Social Care and Education, Kingston University, St George's, University of London"}, "57188984952": {"Name": "Biri D.", "AuthorID": "57188984952", "AffiliationID": "60176024, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Science, Technology, Engineering and Public Policy (UCL STEaPP), University College London"}, "6603848634": {"Name": "Mckevitt C.", "AuthorID": "6603848634", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "King's College London"}}}
