Toe phalangeal fractures are nevertheless common fracture clinic referrals. Our aim was to evaluate the injury characteristics of patients with toe fractures attending a fracture clinic and to understand how current management affects the fracture clinic workload. We retrospectively evaluated all new referrals to a subspecialized foot and ankle fracture clinic during a 12-month period at our institution under the care of 1 consultant. Data were collected regarding patient demographics, fracture type, patient outcome, and the number of clinic appointments attended, cancelled, or not attended. A total of 707 new patients (mean age 39 \u00b1 19 years; 345 males, 362 females) were seen in 47 foot and ankle fracture clinics within the study period. Seventy-four phalangeal fractures were identified in 65 patients. A total of 135 outpatient appointments were scheduled for these patients (initial and follow-up), with 93 (69%) attended, 25 (19%) not attended, and 15 (11%) cancelled and rescheduled at the patient's request. Seventeen patients (13%) failed to attend their first clinic appointment. The results of the present study highlight that 9% of all new patient referrals to a fracture clinic were for toe phalangeal fractures. Only 2 patients required surgery for significant loss of articular congruency or deformity. No patient subsequently developed a symptomatic malunion or required toe surgery during the following 2 years. We believe that undisplaced and stable toe phalangeal fractures do not need to be referred to the fracture clinic. This would result in a reduction of outpatient appointments for toe fractures by 52%.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Appointment", "Fracture", "Phalanx", "Toe"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aftercare", "Child", "Emergency Service, Hospital", "Female", "Fractures, Bone", "Humans", "Male", "Radiography", "Referral and Consultation", "Retrospective Studies", "Toe Phalanges"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84959472598", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Orthopedics and Sports Medicine", "MEDI", "2732"]], "AuthorData": {"56041427800": {"Name": "Eves T.B.", "AuthorID": "56041427800", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Trauma and Orthopaedics, University College London Hospitals National Health Service Foundation Trust"}, "57057403700": {"Name": "Oddy M.J.", "AuthorID": "57057403700", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Trauma and Orthopaedics, University College London Hospitals National Health Service Foundation Trust"}}}
