However, its significance for major evolutionary processes such as speciation is unclear, especially in vertebrates. We previously identified a sharp mtDNA-specific sequence divergence between morphologically indistinguishable chameleon populations (Chamaeleo chamaeleon recticrista) across an ancient Israeli marine barrier (Jezreel Valley). Because mtDNA introgression and gender-based dispersal were ruled out, we hypothesized that mtDNA spatial divisionwas maintained by mito-nuclear functional compensation. Here, we studied RNA-seq generated from each of ten chameleons representing the north and south populations and identified candidate nonsynonymous substitutions (NSSs) matching the mtDNA spatial distribution. The most prominent NSS occurred in 14 nDNA-encoded mitochondrial proteins. Increased chameleon sample size (N=70) confirmed the geographic differentiation in POLRMT, NDUFA5, ACO1, LYRM4, MARS2, andACAD9. Structural and functionality evaluation of these NSSs revealed high functionality. Mathematical modeling suggested that this mito-nuclear spatial divergence is consistent with hybrid breakdown. We conclude that our presented evidence and mathematical model underline mito-nuclear interactions as a likely role player in incipient speciation in vertebrates.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Mito-nuclear coevolution", "Mitochondrial DNA", "Nuclear DNA", "RNA-seq", "Speciation", "Transcriptome"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Evolution, Molecular", "Genes, Mitochondrial", "Genetic Speciation", "Iguanas", "Models, Genetic", "Polymorphism, Genetic"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84982126173", "SubjectAreas": [["Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics", "AGRI", "1105"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"]], "AuthorData": {"54079279800": {"Name": "Bar-Yaacov D.", "AuthorID": "54079279800", "AffiliationID": "60027161", "AffiliationName": "Department of Life Sciences, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev"}, "55925286200": {"Name": "Levin L.", "AuthorID": "55925286200", "AffiliationID": "60027161", "AffiliationName": "Department of Life Sciences, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev"}, "56447120600": {"Name": "Barshad G.", "AuthorID": "56447120600", "AffiliationID": "60027161", "AffiliationName": "Department of Life Sciences, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev"}, "6602715182": {"Name": "Zarivach R.", "AuthorID": "6602715182", "AffiliationID": "60027161", "AffiliationName": "Department of Life Sciences, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev"}, "6602572855": {"Name": "Bouskila A.", "AuthorID": "6602572855", "AffiliationID": "60027161", "AffiliationName": "Department of Life Sciences, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev"}, "7801384496": {"Name": "Mishmar D.", "AuthorID": "7801384496", "AffiliationID": "60027161", "AffiliationName": "Department of Life Sciences, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev"}, "55130612500": {"Name": "Hadjivasiliou Z.", "AuthorID": "55130612500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genetics, Evolution and Environment, UCL"}}}
