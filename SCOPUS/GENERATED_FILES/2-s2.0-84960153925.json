However, precise details of this charge transfer process are not known. We report two-photon photoemission (h\u03bd = 3.23 eV) measurements of rutile TiO2(110) as a function of exposure to water below room temperature. The two-photon resonance associated with bridging hydroxyls is enhanced following water exposure, reaching a maximum at a nominal coverage of one monolayer. Higher coverages attenuate the observed resonance. Ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy (h\u03bd = 21.22 eV) of the initial, band gap states shows little change up to one monolayer water coverage. It is likely that the enhancement arises from dissociation within the adsorbed water monolayer, although other mechanisms cannot be excluded.", "AuthorKeywords": ["2PPE", "Hydroxyls", "Photoexcitation", "TiO2", "Water"], "IndexKeywords": ["2PPE", "Charge transfer process", "Excited electrons", "Hydroxyls", "Metal oxide surfaces", "Two-photon photoemission", "Two-photon resonance", "Ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84960153925", "SubjectAreas": [["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Surfaces and Interfaces", "PHYS", "3110"], ["Surfaces, Coatings and Films", "MATE", "2508"], ["Materials Chemistry", "MATE", "2505"]], "AuthorData": {"57213869075": {"Name": "Payne D.T.", "AuthorID": "57213869075", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "London Centre for Nanotechnology, University College London"}, "57160580000": {"Name": "Zhang Y.", "AuthorID": "57160580000", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "London Centre for Nanotechnology, University College London"}, "7201425162": {"Name": "Pang C.L.", "AuthorID": "7201425162", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "London Centre for Nanotechnology, University College London"}, "7003283537": {"Name": "Fielding H.H.", "AuthorID": "7003283537", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "7102525027": {"Name": "Thornton G.", "AuthorID": "7102525027", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "London Centre for Nanotechnology, University College London"}}}
