The focus of this paper is on general mentalization-oriented approaches and specific interventions that aim to (1) disrupt the non-mentalizing cycles that can generate intra-family violence and (2) encourage the emergence of patterns of family interactions that provide the foundation for non-violent alternatives. Various playful exercises and activities are described, including the taking of \u201cmental state snapshots\u201d and \u201cselfies\u201d in sessions and staging inverted role-plays, as well as using theatrical masks and creating body\u2013mind maps and scans. These can make \u201cchronic\u201d relationship issues come alive in session and permit \u201chere and now\u201d experiences that generate a safe context for mentalizing to take place. At the core of the work is the continuous focus on integrating experience and reflection. Without acute awareness of the thoughts and feelings occurring in the sessions, mere reflection is not likely to enable change. By increasing mentalizing in the family system, family members\u2019 trusting attitudes grow, both within and outside the family.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Family", "Mentalization-Based Approach", "Mentalizing", "Violence"], "IndexKeywords": ["Domestic Violence", "Family Relations", "Family Therapy", "Humans", "Object Attachment", "Theory of Mind"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85011031830", "SubjectAreas": [["Social Psychology", "PSYC", "3207"], ["Clinical Psychology", "PSYC", "3203"], ["Social Sciences (miscellaneous)", "SOCI", "3301"]], "AuthorData": {"6603116802": {"Name": "Asen E.", "AuthorID": "6603116802", "AffiliationID": "60170329", "AffiliationName": "Anna Freud National Centre for Children and Families"}, "7004981532": {"Name": "Fonagy P.", "AuthorID": "7004981532", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London (UCL)"}}}
