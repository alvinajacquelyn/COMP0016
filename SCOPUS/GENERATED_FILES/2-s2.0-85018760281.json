However, the \u03c7c0 and \u03c7c2 decays to \u03b7\u2032 mesons, which proceed via a purely gluonic intermediate state and we would therefore na\u00efvely expect to be enhanced by such a component, are in fact relatively suppressed. We argue that this apparent contradiction may be resolved by a proper treatment of interference effects in the decay. In particular, by accounting for the destructive interference between the quark and gluon components of the \u03b7\u2032 distribution function, in combination with a model for strange quark mass effects, we demonstrate that the observed \u03c7c(0,2)\u2192\u03b7(\u2032)\u03b7(\u2032) branching ratios can be reproduced for a reasonable gluon component of the \u03b7\u2032, \u03b7 mesons.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85018760281", "SubjectAreas": [["Nuclear and High Energy Physics", "PHYS", "3106"]], "AuthorData": {"35589760900": {"Name": "Harland-Lang L.A.", "AuthorID": "35589760900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "7006885662": {"Name": "Khoze V.A.", "AuthorID": "7006885662", "AffiliationID": "60022175, 60176038", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Particle Physics Phenomenology, Durham University"}, "7005386952": {"Name": "Ryskin M.G.", "AuthorID": "7005386952", "AffiliationID": "60014977", "AffiliationName": "Petersburg Nuclear Physics Institute, NRC Kurchatov Institute"}, "7004361972": {"Name": "Shuvaev A.G.", "AuthorID": "7004361972", "AffiliationID": "60014977", "AffiliationName": "Petersburg Nuclear Physics Institute, NRC Kurchatov Institute"}}}
