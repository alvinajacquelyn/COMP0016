Despite the growing use of BIMs for new construction projects in recent years, most existing buildings today often do not have complete as-is information documents or a meaningful BIM. Thus, incomplete or even incorrect information in as-is records is still one of the main reasons for the low level of efficiency in facilities management for existing buildings. Furthermore, creating an as-is BIM for an existing building is considered a time-consuming and expensive process that requires great effort, time, costs, and skilled workers. Convenient, efficient, and economical approaches with high accuracy for constructing as-is BIMs would essentially be the foremost step for effective operation and maintenance of existing buildings. To this end, this study aims at categorizing and analyzing the state-of-the-art technologies in image-based BIM construction processes as the first step. For effective review, a general framework for image-based as-is BIM construction processes is proposed with the following key steps: (1) data capturing and processing, (2) object recognition, and (3) as-is BIM construction. Detailed comparative analyses of methods commonly used in each step were conducted and a prospective model is proposed. Finally, based on the prospective model, knowledge gaps and future development of image-based as-is BIM construction processes are identified. This paper presents the results of systematic review and analyses for image-based as-is BIM construction processes, contributing to the development and widespread adoption of this technology in the construction industry.", "AuthorKeywords": ["As-is building information model (BIM)", "Existing building", "Image", "Operations and maintenance"], "IndexKeywords": ["Building Information Model - BIM", "Comparative analysis", "Digital representations", "Facilities management", "Image", "Operation and maintenance", "Operations and maintenance", "State-of-the-art technology"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85018789155", "SubjectAreas": [["Civil and Structural Engineering", "ENGI", "2205"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"]], "AuthorData": {"56717065200": {"Name": "Lu Q.", "AuthorID": "56717065200", "AffiliationID": "60006541", "AffiliationName": "Univ. of Hong Kong, Hui Oi Chow Bldg."}, "57221452702": {"Name": "Lee S.", "AuthorID": "57221452702", "AffiliationID": "60006541", "AffiliationName": "Dept. of Civil Engineering, Univ. of Hong Kong, 6-19 Haking Wong Bldg."}}}
