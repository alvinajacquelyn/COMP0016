Published by BMJ.background Car hijacking, known as \u201ccarjacking\u201d, is a form of aggravated robbery of a vehicle from the driver frequently involving firearm and is common in South Africa. There is, however, little literature on the spectrum of injuries sustained by victims of car hijacking. The study aimed to describe the spectrum of gunshot wound-related (GSW) injuries and review our experience of management of victims of car hijacking in our trauma center based in South Africa. Methods A retrospective review was conducted during an 8-year period from January 2010 to January 2018 on all patients who presented with any form of GSW after a car hijacking incident. results During the 8-year study period, a total of 101 patients were identified. Seventy-four percent were male (75 of 101) and the mean age was 34 years. The mean time from injury to arrival at our trauma center was 7 hours (rural district: 10 hours, urban district: 4 hours; p<0.001). Seventy-five percent (76 of 101) of all patients sustained GSWs to multiple body regions, whereas the remaining 25% (25 of 101) were confined to a single body region. The most common region involved was the chest (48 cases), followed by the abdomen (46 cases) and neck (34 cases). Sixty-three of the 101 (62%) patients required one or more operative interventions. The most common procedure was laparotomy (28 cases), followed by vascular (20 cases) and neck (14) exploration. Eighteen percent (18 of 101) of all patients required intensive care unit admission. The mean length of hospital stay was 7 days. The overall morbidity was 13% (16 of 101) and the overall mortality was 18% (18 of 101). Discussion The spectrum of injuries from GSW related to car hijacking commonly involves close range GSWs to multiple body regions. Torso trauma is common and a substantial proportion of victims require major operative interventions. The mortality from these injuries is significant.Level of Evidence Level III.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85061275730", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Critical Care and Intensive Care Medicine", "MEDI", "2706"]], "AuthorData": {"31367491100": {"Name": "Kong V.", "AuthorID": "31367491100", "AffiliationID": "60010499", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery, University of KwaZulu Natal"}, "55439384700": {"Name": "Clarke D.", "AuthorID": "55439384700", "AffiliationID": "60010499", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery, University of KwaZulu Natal"}, "55650952200": {"Name": "Bruce J.", "AuthorID": "55650952200", "AffiliationID": "60010499", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery, University of KwaZulu Natal"}, "55372357000": {"Name": "Laing G.", "AuthorID": "55372357000", "AffiliationID": "60010499", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery, University of KwaZulu Natal"}, "57193522235": {"Name": "Weale R.", "AuthorID": "57193522235", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery, North West Deanery"}, "56333770000": {"Name": "Blodgett J.", "AuthorID": "56333770000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology, University College London"}}}
