However, a substantial proportion of health research using electronic health records, data collected and generated during routine clinical care, potentially cannot reproduced. With the complexity, volume and variety of electronic health records made available for research steadily increasing, it is critical to ensure that findings from such data are reproducible and replicable by researchers. In this paper, we present some preliminary findings on how a series of methods and tools utilized in adjunct scientific disciplines can be used to enhance the reproducibility of research using electronic health records.", "AuthorKeywords": ["electronic health records", "reproducibility"], "IndexKeywords": ["Clinical care", "Electronic health record", "Health research", "Observational research", "Reproducibilities", "Scientific discipline", "Scientific findings"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85040347157", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"]], "AuthorData": {"54902667300": {"Name": "Denaxas S.", "AuthorID": "54902667300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "24066757700": {"Name": "Gonzalez-Izquierdo A.", "AuthorID": "24066757700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "57195620801": {"Name": "Pikoula M.", "AuthorID": "57195620801", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "55636525700": {"Name": "Direk K.", "AuthorID": "55636525700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "7004055191": {"Name": "Fitzpatrick N.", "AuthorID": "7004055191", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "7004642497": {"Name": "Hemingway H.", "AuthorID": "7004642497", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "7003651182": {"Name": "Smeeth L.", "AuthorID": "7003651182", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, Electronic Health Records Research Group"}}}
