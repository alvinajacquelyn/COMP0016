A multidisciplinary, mixed-methods research design was deployed for the empirical iteration of the model. This choice was reinforced by the critical review of related literature, which revealed that a combination of evidence from multiple disciplines (psychology, sociology, and technology) could contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of play motivation. An iterative, hypothesis-testing research design was the strategy used to conduct multidisciplinary, mixed-methods research. The initial, theoretical version of the MGM was iterated twice, resulting in a thoroughly developed, empirically grounded version that requires future validation. The value of this approach lies in the fact that it provides to game design stakeholders a methodological tool for understanding play motivation as a multifaceted activity, which could inform their practices.", "AuthorKeywords": ["game motivation", "MGM", "mixed-methods", "multidisciplinary research"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84927641309", "SubjectAreas": [["Cultural Studies", "SOCI", "3316"], ["Communication", "SOCI", "3315"], ["Anthropology", "SOCI", "3314"], ["Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)", "ARTS", "1201"], ["Applied Psychology", "PSYC", "3202"], ["Human-Computer Interaction", "COMP", "1709"]], "AuthorData": {"37111011800": {"Name": "Herodotou C.", "AuthorID": "37111011800", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Education, University of London"}, "16204526900": {"Name": "Winters N.", "AuthorID": "16204526900", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Education, University of London"}, "57200611596": {"Name": "Kambouri M.", "AuthorID": "57200611596", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Education, University of London"}}}
