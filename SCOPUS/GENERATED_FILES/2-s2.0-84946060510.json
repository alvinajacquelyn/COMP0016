Tackling latent tuberculosis infection requires the identification and treatment of asymptomatic individuals to reduce the risk of progression to active disease. Diagnosis of latent tuberculosis infection is based on the detection of an immune response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigens using either the tuberculin skin test or interferon-\u03b3 release assays. Current treatment requires the use of antibiotics for at least 3 months. In this article, we review the current knowledge of the natural history, immunology, and pathogenesis of latent tuberculosis, describe key population groups for screening and risk assessment, discuss clinical management in terms of diagnosis and preventative treatment, and identify areas for future research.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Antitubercular Agents", "Humans", "Latent Tuberculosis", "Mycobacterium tuberculosis"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84946060510", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"57209125785": {"Name": "Mu\u00f1oz L.", "AuthorID": "57209125785", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Infection and Population Health, University College London"}, "55201612700": {"Name": "Stagg H.", "AuthorID": "55201612700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Infection and Population Health, University College London"}, "6602338051": {"Name": "Abubakar I.", "AuthorID": "6602338051", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Infection and Population Health, University College London"}}}
