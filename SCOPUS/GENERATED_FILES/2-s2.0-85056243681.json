This has been attributed to difficulties in forming adequate task representations that help navigate uncertain environments. Here, we investigate how, in older adults, inadequate task representations impact on model-based reversal learning. We combined computational modeling and pupillometry during a novel model-based reversal learning task, which allowed us to isolate the relevance of task representations at feedback evaluation. We find that older adults overestimate the changeability of task states and consequently are less able to converge on unequivocal task representations through learning. Pupillometric measures and behavioral data show that these unreliable task representations in older adults manifest as a reduced ability to focus on feedback that is relevant for updating task representations, and as a reduced metacognitive awareness in the accuracy of their actions. Instead, the data suggested older adults\u2019 choice behavior was more consistent with a guidance by uninformative feedback properties such as outcome valence. Our study highlights that an inability to form adequate task representations may be a crucial factor underlying older adults\u2019 impaired model-based inference.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Aging", "Decision-making", "Feedback evaluation", "Model-based inference", "Pupillometry", "Task representations"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Aging", "Cognition", "Decision Making", "Environment", "Female", "Formative Feedback", "Humans", "Middle Aged", "Reversal Learning", "Task Performance and Analysis", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85056243681", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Aging", "BIOC", "1302"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Developmental Biology", "BIOC", "1309"], ["Geriatrics and Gerontology", "MEDI", "2717"]], "AuthorData": {"35100283700": {"Name": "H\u00e4mmerer D.", "AuthorID": "35100283700", "AffiliationID": "60103674", "AffiliationName": "German Centre for Neurodegenerative Diseases"}, "57201978724": {"Name": "Gallagher M.", "AuthorID": "57201978724", "AffiliationID": "60020595", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Royal Holloway University of London"}, "6701771740": {"Name": "D\u00fczel E.", "AuthorID": "6701771740", "AffiliationID": "60103674", "AffiliationName": "German Centre for Neurodegenerative Diseases"}, "55866315900": {"Name": "Schwartenbeck P.", "AuthorID": "55866315900", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Oxford Centre for Functional MRI of the Brain, Nuffield Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Oxford"}, "26767602100": {"Name": "FitzGerald T.H.B.", "AuthorID": "26767602100", "AffiliationID": "60122566, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Max Planck\u2013UCL Centre for Computational Psychiatry and Ageing Research"}, "55027467100": {"Name": "Dolan R.J.", "AuthorID": "55027467100", "AffiliationID": "60122566, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Max Planck\u2013UCL Centre for Computational Psychiatry and Ageing Research"}}}
