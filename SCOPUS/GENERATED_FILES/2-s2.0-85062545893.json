KGaA, Weinheim Transition metal carbide compound has been extensively investigated as a catalyst for hydrogenation, for example, due to its noble metal-like properties. Herein a facile synthetic strategy is applied to control the thickness of atomic-layer Pt clusters strongly anchored on N-doped Mo 2 C nanorods (Pt/N-Mo 2 C) and it is found that the Pt atomic layers modify Mo 2 C function as a high-performance and robust catalyst for hydrogen evolution. The optimized 1.08 wt% Pt/N-Mo 2 C exhibits 25-fold, 10-fold, and 15-fold better mass activity than the benchmark 20 wt% Pt/C in neutral, acidic, and alkaline media, respectively. This catalyst also represents an extremely low overpotential of \u22128.3 mV at current density of 10 mA cm \u22122 , much better than the majority of reported electrocatalysts and even the commercial reference catalyst (20 wt%) Pt/C. Furthermore, it exhibits an outstanding long-term operational durability of 120 h. Theoretical calculation predicts that the ultrathin layer of Pt clusters on Mo-Mo 2 C yields the lowest absolute value of \u0394G H* . Experimental results demonstrate that the atomic layer of Pt clusters anchored on Mo 2 C substrate greatly enhances electron and mass transportation efficiency and structural stability. These findings could provide the foundation for developing highly effective and scalable hydrogen evolution catalysts.", "AuthorKeywords": ["activity", "catalyst", "hydrogen evolution", "Mo 2 C", "Pt"], "IndexKeywords": ["Hydrogen evolution", "Metal-like properties", "Mo2C", "Structural stabilities", "Synthetic strategies", "Theoretical calculations", "Transition metal carbide", "Transportation efficiency"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85062545893", "SubjectAreas": [["Biotechnology", "BIOC", "1305"], ["Biomaterials", "MATE", "2502"], ["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"]], "AuthorData": {"57201856643": {"Name": "Qiu Y.", "AuthorID": "57201856643", "AffiliationID": "60001604, 60001298", "AffiliationName": "Key Lab of Synthetic and Natural Functional Molecule Chemistry of Ministry of Education, and the College of Chemistry and Materials Science of Northwest University"}, "36140215900": {"Name": "Guo X.", "AuthorID": "36140215900", "AffiliationID": "60001604, 60001298", "AffiliationName": "Key Lab of Synthetic and Natural Functional Molecule Chemistry of Ministry of Education, and the College of Chemistry and Materials Science of Northwest University"}, "57207460479": {"Name": "Wen Z.", "AuthorID": "57207460479", "AffiliationID": "60089931, 60133772, 60019118", "AffiliationName": "Hefei National Laboratory of Physical Sciences at the Microscale, School of Chemistry of Materials Sciences, Synergetic Innovation of Quantum Information & Quantum Technology, CAS Key Lab of Materials for Energy Conversion, and CAS Excellent Center in Nanoscience, University of Science and Technology of China"}, "55598069500": {"Name": "Wu X.", "AuthorID": "55598069500", "AffiliationID": "60089931, 60133772, 60019118", "AffiliationName": "Hefei National Laboratory of Physical Sciences at the Microscale, School of Chemistry of Materials Sciences, Synergetic Innovation of Quantum Information & Quantum Technology, CAS Key Lab of Materials for Energy Conversion, and CAS Excellent Center in Nanoscience, University of Science and Technology of China"}, "56329410000": {"Name": "Jiang C.", "AuthorID": "56329410000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, UCL"}, "7404638641": {"Name": "Tang J.", "AuthorID": "7404638641", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, UCL"}, "6603357352": {"Name": "Si R.", "AuthorID": "6603357352", "AffiliationID": "60108609, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility, Shanghai Institute of Applied Physics, Chinese Academy of Science"}, "7201398627": {"Name": "Bao J.", "AuthorID": "7201398627", "AffiliationID": "60019118", "AffiliationName": "National Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory, University of Science and Technology of China"}, "55699299900": {"Name": "Zhang Q.", "AuthorID": "55699299900", "AffiliationID": "60012820, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "7202674863": {"Name": "Gu L.", "AuthorID": "7202674863", "AffiliationID": "60012820, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}}}
