Electrophysiological studies have revealed that the strength of the coupling between the phase of low- and the amplitude of high- frequency EEG activities (phase\u2013amplitude coupling - PAC) has an important role in brain function in general, and in preparation and execution of movement in particular. Using electrocorticographic (ECoG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data recorded simultaneously in humans performing a finger-tapping task, we investigated the single-trial relationship between the amplitude of the BOLD signal and the strength of PAC and the power of \u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b3 bands, at a local level. In line with previous studies, we found a positive correlation for the \u03b3 band, and negative correlations for the PAC\u03b2\u03b3 strength, and the \u03b1 and \u03b2 bands. More importantly, we found that the PAC\u03b2\u03b3 strength explained variance of the amplitude of the BOLD signal that was not explained by a combination of the \u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b3 band powers. Our main finding sheds further light on the distinct nature of PAC as a functionally relevant mechanism and suggests that the sensitivity of EEG-informed fMRI studies may increase by including the PAC strength in the BOLD signal model, in addition to the power of the low- and high- frequency EEG bands.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Electro-haemodynamic coupling", "fMRI", "Intracranial EEG", "Phase\u2013amplitude coupling"], "IndexKeywords": ["Brain Mapping", "Brain Waves", "Electrocorticography", "Electroencephalography", "Epilepsy", "Female", "Fingers", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Motor Activity", "Motor Cortex", "Psychomotor Performance", "Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85006320698", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"]], "AuthorData": {"53164472200": {"Name": "Murta T.", "AuthorID": "53164472200", "AffiliationID": "60004956, 60106051, 60104136", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Systems and Robotics and Department of Bioengineering, Instituto Superior T\u00e9cnico, Universidade de Lisboa"}, "7004000093": {"Name": "Chaudhary U.J.", "AuthorID": "7004000093", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Dept. of Clinical and Experimental Epilepsy, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "35722358600": {"Name": "Leite M.", "AuthorID": "35722358600", "AffiliationID": "60004956, 60106051, 60104136", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Systems and Robotics and Department of Bioengineering, Instituto Superior T\u00e9cnico, Universidade de Lisboa"}, "7005729118": {"Name": "Lemieux L.", "AuthorID": "7005729118", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Dept. of Clinical and Experimental Epilepsy, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "56903643700": {"Name": "Dias A.", "AuthorID": "56903643700", "AffiliationID": "60004956, 60106051, 60104136", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Systems and Robotics and Department of Bioengineering, Instituto Superior T\u00e9cnico, Universidade de Lisboa"}, "7003529050": {"Name": "Figueiredo P.", "AuthorID": "7003529050", "AffiliationID": "60004956, 60106051, 60104136", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Systems and Robotics and Department of Bioengineering, Instituto Superior T\u00e9cnico, Universidade de Lisboa"}, "56921739000": {"Name": "Tierney T.M.", "AuthorID": "56921739000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Child Heath"}, "8588211000": {"Name": "Carmichael D.W.", "AuthorID": "8588211000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Child Heath"}}}
