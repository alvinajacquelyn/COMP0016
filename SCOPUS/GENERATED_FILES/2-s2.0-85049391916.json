The instrument consists of a monolithic spatial heterodyne spectrometer (SHS), which is able to resolve the rotational structure of the R-branch of that band. The relative intensities of the emission lines follow a Boltzmann distribution and the ratio of the lines can be used to derive the kinetic temperature. The SHS operates at a Littrow wavelength of 761.8 nm and heterodynes a wavelength regime between 761.9 and 765.3 nm with a resolving power of about 8000 considering apodization effects. The size of the SHS is 38 \u00d7 38 \u00d7 27 mm3 and its acceptance angle is \u00b15\u00b0. It has an etendue of 0.01 cm2 sr. Complemented by front optics with an acceptance angle of \u00b10.65\u00b0 and detector optics, the entire optical system fits into a volume of about 1.5 L. This allows us to fly this instrument on a 3- or 6-unit CubeSat. The vertical field of view of the instrument is about 60 km at the Earth's limb when operated in a typical low Earth orbit. Integration times to obtain an entire altitude profile of nighttime temperatures are on the order of 1 min for a vertical resolution of 1.5 km and a random noise level of about 1.5 K. Daytime integration times are 1 order of magnitude shorter. This work presents the design parameters of the optics and a radiometric assessment of the instrument. Furthermore, it gives an overview of the required characterization and calibration steps. This includes the characterization of image distortions in the different parts of the optics, visibility, and phase determination as well as flat fielding.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85049391916", "SubjectAreas": [["Atmospheric Science", "EART", "1902"]], "AuthorData": {"56767589600": {"Name": "Kaufmann M.", "AuthorID": "56767589600", "AffiliationID": "60022995", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Atmospheric and Environmental Research, University of Wuppertal"}, "41261112100": {"Name": "Deiml M.", "AuthorID": "41261112100", "AffiliationID": "60085129", "AffiliationName": "OHB System AG"}, "57202804060": {"Name": "Liu J.", "AuthorID": "57202804060", "AffiliationID": "60022995", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Atmospheric and Environmental Research, University of Wuppertal"}, "55760765100": {"Name": "Song R.", "AuthorID": "55760765100", "AffiliationID": "60022995", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Atmospheric and Environmental Research, University of Wuppertal"}, "57193738871": {"Name": "Wroblowski O.", "AuthorID": "57193738871", "AffiliationID": "60022995", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Atmospheric and Environmental Research, University of Wuppertal"}, "57202806644": {"Name": "Wei D.", "AuthorID": "57202806644", "AffiliationID": "60022995", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Atmospheric and Environmental Research, University of Wuppertal"}, "56172377700": {"Name": "Zhu Y.", "AuthorID": "56172377700", "AffiliationID": "60007774", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Energy and Climate Research (IEK-7), Research Center Juelich"}, "56499447000": {"Name": "Riese M.", "AuthorID": "56499447000", "AffiliationID": "60022995", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Atmospheric and Environmental Research, University of Wuppertal"}, "9840502200": {"Name": "Olschewski F.", "AuthorID": "9840502200", "AffiliationID": "60022995", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Atmospheric and Environmental Research, University of Wuppertal"}, "57202802888": {"Name": "Chen Q.", "AuthorID": "57202802888", "AffiliationID": "60022995", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Atmospheric and Environmental Research, University of Wuppertal"}, "6506462546": {"Name": "Knieling P.", "AuthorID": "6506462546", "AffiliationID": "60022995", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Atmospheric and Environmental Research, University of Wuppertal"}, "56732937400": {"Name": "Toumpas P.", "AuthorID": "56732937400", "AffiliationID": "60022995", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Atmospheric and Environmental Research, University of Wuppertal"}, "26642957200": {"Name": "Koppmann R.", "AuthorID": "26642957200", "AffiliationID": "60022995", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Atmospheric and Environmental Research, University of Wuppertal"}, "7006610999": {"Name": "Mantel K.", "AuthorID": "7006610999", "AffiliationID": "60104272", "AffiliationName": "Max Planck Institute for the Science of Light"}, "57164813500": {"Name": "Loosen F.", "AuthorID": "57164813500", "AffiliationID": "60000765, 60074831", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Optics, Information and Photonics, University of Erlangen-Nuremberg"}, "7006514451": {"Name": "Solheim B.", "AuthorID": "7006514451", "AffiliationID": "60082766, 60033420", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Research in Earth and Space Science, York University"}, "7202811059": {"Name": "Shepherd G.", "AuthorID": "7202811059", "AffiliationID": "60082766, 60033420", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Research in Earth and Space Science, York University"}, "57202799070": {"Name": "Froehlich D.", "AuthorID": "57202799070", "AffiliationID": "60007774", "AffiliationName": "Central Institute for Engineering, Electronics and Analytics, Electronic Systems (ZEA-2), Research Centre Juelich"}, "56388439400": {"Name": "Neubert T.", "AuthorID": "56388439400", "AffiliationID": "60007774", "AffiliationName": "Central Institute for Engineering, Electronics and Analytics, Electronic Systems (ZEA-2), Research Centre Juelich"}, "55799555200": {"Name": "Rongen H.", "AuthorID": "55799555200", "AffiliationID": "60007774", "AffiliationName": "Central Institute for Engineering, Electronics and Analytics, Electronic Systems (ZEA-2), Research Centre Juelich"}, "7103076116": {"Name": "Shan J.", "AuthorID": "7103076116", "AffiliationID": "60033420", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth and Space Science and Engineering, York University"}, "23971918900": {"Name": "Tang G.", "AuthorID": "23971918900", "AffiliationID": "112854317", "AffiliationName": "Aerospace Flight Dynamics Laboratory"}, "57202805377": {"Name": "Wagner F.", "AuthorID": "57202805377", "AffiliationID": "60000765, 60074831", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Optics, Information and Photonics, University of Erlangen-Nuremberg"}}}
