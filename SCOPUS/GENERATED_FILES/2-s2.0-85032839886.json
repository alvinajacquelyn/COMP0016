The partially unfolded species possess an unstructured \u03b2-domain and C-helix with the rest of the \u03b1-domain remaining native-like. Here we use paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE) measured by NMR spectroscopy to study the transient intermolecular interactions between such intermediate species. Nitroxide spin labels, introduced specifically at three individual lysine residues, generate distinct PRE profiles, indicating the presence of intermolecular interactions between residues within the unfolded \u03b2-domain. This study describes the applicability to PRE NMR measurements of selective lysine labeling, at different sites within a protein, as an alternative to the introduction of spin labels via engineered cysteine residues. These results reveal the importance of the \u03b2-sheet region of lysozyme for initiating self-assembly into amyloid fibrils.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Amyloid", "Humans", "Lysine", "Muramidase", "Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, Biomolecular", "Protein Structure, Secondary", "Spin Labels"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85032839886", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"55487007600": {"Name": "Ahn M.", "AuthorID": "55487007600", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge"}, "57192249796": {"Name": "Bernardo-Gancedo A.", "AuthorID": "57192249796", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge"}, "6506968142": {"Name": "De Genst E.", "AuthorID": "6506968142", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge"}, "24775645800": {"Name": "Dhulesia A.", "AuthorID": "24775645800", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge"}, "56623994700": {"Name": "Dobson C.M.", "AuthorID": "56623994700", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge"}, "6602336675": {"Name": "Kumita J.R.", "AuthorID": "6602336675", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge"}, "28667456400": {"Name": "Waudby C.A.", "AuthorID": "28667456400", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60009016", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London, Birkbeck College"}, "55919826700": {"Name": "Christodoulou J.", "AuthorID": "55919826700", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60009016", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London, Birkbeck College"}, "6602617527": {"Name": "Salvatella X.", "AuthorID": "6602617527", "AffiliationID": "60002016, 60108879, 60032907", "AffiliationName": "ICREA and Institute for Research in Biomedicine (IRB Barcelona), Barcelona Institute of Science and Technology"}}}
