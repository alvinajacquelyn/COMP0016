Despite this, there is relatively little experimental information about the precise configuration of GPCR oligomers during these different biologically relevant states. While it may be possible to identify the experimental conditions necessary to crystallize a GPCR preferentially in a specific structural conformation, computational approaches afford a potentially more tractable means of describing the probability of formation of receptor dimers and higher order oligomers. Ensemble-based computational methods based on structurally determined dimers, coupled with a computational workflow that uses quantum mechanical methods to analyze the chemical nature of the molecular interactions at a GPCR dimer interface, will generate the reproducible and accurate predictions needed to predict previously unidentified GPCR dimers and to inform future advances in our ability to understand and begin to precisely manipulate GPCR oligomers in biological systems. It may also provide information needed to achieve an increase in the number of experimentally determined oligomeric GPCR structures.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Computational Biology", "Humans", "Models, Molecular", "Protein Multimerization", "Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85066425610", "SubjectAreas": [["Structural Biology", "BIOC", "1315"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"]], "AuthorData": {"6701753724": {"Name": "Townsend-Nicholson A.", "AuthorID": "6701753724", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural & Molecular Biology, Research Department of Structural & Molecular Biology, Division of Biosciences, University College London"}, "57194187267": {"Name": "Altwaijry N.", "AuthorID": "57194187267", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural & Molecular Biology, Research Department of Structural & Molecular Biology, Division of Biosciences, University College London"}, "57189244904": {"Name": "Potterton A.", "AuthorID": "57189244904", "AffiliationID": "60102134", "AffiliationName": "Evotec (UK) Ltd."}, "6603296449": {"Name": "Morao I.", "AuthorID": "6603296449", "AffiliationID": "60102134", "AffiliationName": "Evotec (UK) Ltd."}, "7003508743": {"Name": "Heifetz A.", "AuthorID": "7003508743", "AffiliationID": "60102134", "AffiliationName": "Evotec (UK) Ltd."}}}
