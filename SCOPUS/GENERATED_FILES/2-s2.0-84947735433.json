All rights reserved.The sol-to-gel transition of an alginate rich in \u03b2-d-mannuronic acid residues and at a concentration of 0.1% w/v in 15 mM NaCl in the presence of calcium ions of 0 to 3.5 mM was studied with dynamic light scattering. The dynamics of the different systems added further insight into the alginate gel forming mechanisms. Below a Ca2+ concentration of 0.7 mM, the build-up of small aggregates could be verified. Moreover, at a critical concentration, close to 0.9 mM Ca2+, a percolated, non-ergodic network started to form from some of these aggregates, with smaller aggregates still diffusing in the network. The system displayed strong non-ergodicy at high Ca2+ concentrations with a non-ergodicity parameter that appeared to form discontinuously from near zero to a clearly non-zero value at the critical Ca2+ concentration.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alginate", "Dynamic light scattering", "Gel", "Structure dynamics"], "IndexKeywords": ["Alginate gel", "Critical concentration", "Forming mechanism", "Low concentrations", "Mannuronic acids", "Nonergodicity", "Sol-to-gel transition", "Structure dynamics"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84947735433", "SubjectAreas": [["Organic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1605"], ["Polymers and Plastics", "MATE", "2507"], ["Materials Chemistry", "MATE", "2505"]], "AuthorData": {"56971641900": {"Name": "Khavari A.", "AuthorID": "56971641900", "AffiliationID": "60000990", "AffiliationName": "Applied Chemistry, Chemical and Biological Engineering, Chalmers University of Technology"}, "6603814579": {"Name": "L\u00f6froth J.", "AuthorID": "6603814579", "AffiliationID": "60000990", "AffiliationName": "Applied Chemistry, Chemical and Biological Engineering, Chalmers University of Technology"}, "6701575308": {"Name": "Bergenholtz J.", "AuthorID": "6701575308", "AffiliationID": "60016437", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Gothenburg"}, "35577381600": {"Name": "Nyd\u00e9n M.", "AuthorID": "35577381600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Energy and Resources, University College London"}}}
