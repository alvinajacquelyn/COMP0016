Practitioners need to have expertise in several aspects of radiology, including both plain radiographs and cross-sectional imaging modalities, knowledge of specialist techniques, and familiarity with the unique range of pathologies in this patient population, including perinatal pathology. Here we outline the training requirements that should be considered to establish such a service.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Autopsy", "Children", "Foetal", "MRI", "Perinatal", "Postmortem"], "IndexKeywords": ["Autopsy", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Diagnostic Imaging", "Europe", "Female", "Humans", "Infant", "Infant, Newborn", "Male", "Medicine", "Needs Assessment", "Pediatrics", "Practice Guidelines as Topic", "Radiology", "United States"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84926143925", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"6507902996": {"Name": "Arthurs O.J.", "AuthorID": "6507902996", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "7003453510": {"Name": "van Rijn R.R.", "AuthorID": "7003453510", "AffiliationID": "60001157, 60070178", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Emma Children\u2019s Hospital - Academic Medical Centre"}, "57195810900": {"Name": "Taylor A.M.", "AuthorID": "57195810900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cardiovascular Imaging, UCL Institute of Cardiovascular Science"}, "57049165000": {"Name": "Sebire N.J.", "AuthorID": "57049165000", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Child Health"}}}
