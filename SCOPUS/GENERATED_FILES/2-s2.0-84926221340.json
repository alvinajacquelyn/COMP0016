Several families have now been described with a late-onset hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy caused by truncation of prion protein (PrP), and associated with systemic amyloidosis, which was a profoundly unexpected phenotype. The chronic symptoms of this disorder, termed PrP systemic amyloidosis, can be very disabling, and are comparable to familial amyloid polyneuropathy (FAP) caused by transthyretin mutations. Patients require symptomatic therapies directed towards control of nausea, diarrhoea, incontinence, neuropathic pain and postural hypotension. Although the potential transmissibility of this new prion disease is probably extremely low, we advocate PrP gene analysis before biopsy in the investigation of peripheral and autonomic neuropathies, or for patients with unexplained diarrhoea and neuropathy. Prion diseases and the FAPs both display prominent effects of mutation type on clinical presentation and patterns of pathology-a fascinating but unexplained observation. Several neurodegenerative diseases associated with central protein misfolding, such as Huntington and Parkinson diseases, also have under-recognized peripheral components. Most of the familial amyloidoses can be explained by known gene mutations, but amino acid variants in proteins involved in other central neurodegenerative diseases might direct the initial pathology to the periphery.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Amyloidosis", "Diagnosis, Differential", "Humans", "Prion Diseases"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84926221340", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"]], "AuthorData": {"57203050579": {"Name": "Mead S.", "AuthorID": "57203050579", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60033212", "AffiliationName": "MRC Prion Unit, Department of Molecular Neurosciences, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "57203175311": {"Name": "Reilly M.", "AuthorID": "57203175311", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60033212", "AffiliationName": "MRC Prion Unit, Department of Molecular Neurosciences, UCL Institute of Neurology"}}}
