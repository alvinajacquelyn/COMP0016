Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Mixed metal oxides are promising heterogeneous catalysts for biofuel production from lipids via alcoholysis, however, the impact of solid acidity and/or basicity on reactivity is comparatively poorly understood. Two systematically related families of MgO\u2013ZrO2 mixed oxide catalysts were therefore prepared by different synthetic routes to elucidate the impact of surface acid-base properties on catalytic performance in the transesterification of tributyrin with methanol. The resulting materials were characterized by TGA-MS, ICP-OES, N2 porosimetry, XRD, TEM, XPS, DRIFTS, and CO2-temperature-programmed desorption (TPD). MgO\u2013ZrO2 catalysts prepared by both non-aqueous impregnation and citric acid-mediated sol\u2013gel routes exhibit excellent activity and stability. The citrate routes favor highly dispersed MgO and concomitant Lewis acid-base pair formation at the interface with zirconia. However, for both the citrate and impregnation routes, tributyrin transesterification occurs over a common, strongly basic MgO active site.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Biodiesel", "MgO", "Mixed oxide", "Solid base", "Transesterification"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85048157436", "SubjectAreas": [["Catalysis", "CENG", "1503"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"]], "AuthorData": {"55778031600": {"Name": "Rabee A.I.M.", "AuthorID": "55778031600", "AffiliationID": "60009750", "AffiliationName": "Chemistry Department, Faculty of Science, Minia University"}, "7202243750": {"Name": "Zaki M.I.", "AuthorID": "7202243750", "AffiliationID": "60009750", "AffiliationName": "Chemistry Department, Faculty of Science, Minia University"}, "56035830400": {"Name": "Manayil J.C.", "AuthorID": "56035830400", "AffiliationID": "60014551", "AffiliationName": "European Bioenergy Research Institute, School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Aston University"}, "55771300200": {"Name": "Isaacs M.A.", "AuthorID": "55771300200", "AffiliationID": "60014551", "AffiliationName": "European Bioenergy Research Institute, School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Aston University"}, "37119172200": {"Name": "Parlett C.M.A.", "AuthorID": "37119172200", "AffiliationID": "60014551", "AffiliationName": "European Bioenergy Research Institute, School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Aston University"}, "55758702600": {"Name": "Durndell L.J.", "AuthorID": "55758702600", "AffiliationID": "60014551", "AffiliationName": "European Bioenergy Research Institute, School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Aston University"}, "7405628120": {"Name": "Lee A.F.", "AuthorID": "7405628120", "AffiliationID": "60011362", "AffiliationName": "School of Science, RMIT University"}, "7403725899": {"Name": "Wilson K.", "AuthorID": "7403725899", "AffiliationID": "60011362", "AffiliationName": "School of Science, RMIT University"}}}
