In part this is because the science is quite demanding, in part it is because evolution is less readily observed than many other scientific phenomena, and in part it is because evolution clashes with certain readings of a number of the world\u2019s scriptures. This chapter examines what informal science educators might do to help teach evolution well. Learners in informal settings are often more motivated than they are in school. In addition, they are typically in smaller groups and are often accompanied by family members. This means that there can be greater opportunity for learning to be personalized and for the subject matter to be an immediate cause of animated conversation. Furthermore, informal settings often provide rare material (e.g. fossils) of a sort not usually available in schools, while those in informal settings responsible for the provision of teaching and information often make a commitment of time to the preparation of these that is beyond what a school teacher can manage. I argue that one can teach evolution in informal settings in ways that are true to the science and respectful of individuals who are uncomfortable with or antagonistic to the theory of evolution. It may often be better not to attempt to persuade informal leaners that the theory of evolution is correct but to attempt to get informal learners to understand why it is that some people, who may or may not have a sincere religious faith, accept the theory of evolution.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Defend", "Europe", "Palaeontology", "Photography", "Turkey"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85042835967", "SubjectAreas": [["Social Sciences (all)", "SOCI", "3300"]], "AuthorData": {"7202205455": {"Name": "Reiss M.", "AuthorID": "7202205455", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "University College London Institute of Education"}}}
