Method: In this cross-sectional study, 41 typically developing children (mean age: 8 years 0 months, range: 4 years 5 months to 11 years 10 months) and 27 children with diagnosed LLI (mean age: 8 years 10 months, range: 5 years 2 months to 11 years 6 months) completed a silent speech reading task and a speech-in-noise task with and without visual support from the talking face. The speech-in-noise task involved the identification of a target word in a carrier sentence with a single competing speaker as a masker. Results: Children in the LLI group showed a deficit in speech reading when compared with their typically developing peers. Beyond the single-word level, this deficit became more apparent in older children. On the speech-in-noise task, a substantial benefit of visual cues was found regardless of age or group membership, although the LLI group showed an overall developmental delay in speech perception. Conclusion: Although children with LLI were less accurate than their peers on the speech reading and speech-in noise tasks, both groups were able to make equivalent use of visual cues to boost performance accuracy when listening in noise.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Acoustic Stimulation", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Female", "Humans", "Language Development", "Language Development Disorders", "Language Tests", "Language Therapy", "Male", "Photic Stimulation", "Speech Perception", "Visual Perception"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84959237945", "SubjectAreas": [["Language and Linguistics", "ARTS", "1203"], ["Linguistics and Language", "SOCI", "3310"], ["Speech and Hearing", "HEAL", "3616"]], "AuthorData": {"35211121600": {"Name": "Knowland V.", "AuthorID": "35211121600", "AffiliationID": "60025704", "AffiliationName": "City University London"}, "57142020600": {"Name": "Snell C.", "AuthorID": "57142020600", "AffiliationID": "60025704", "AffiliationName": "City University London"}, "37025787600": {"Name": "Evans S.", "AuthorID": "37025787600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "7401609413": {"Name": "Rosen S.", "AuthorID": "7401609413", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
