We investigated whether responses to a questionnaire eliciting caregiver beliefs in medicines were associated with adherence of their child (median age 2.8 years), and whether this in turn was associated with viral suppression. We used the validated beliefs in medicine questionnaire (BMQ) to measure caregiver beliefs, and medication event monitoring system caps to measure adherence. We found significant associations between BMQ scores and adherence, and between adherence and viral suppression. Among children initiating Antiretroviral therapy (ART), we also found significant associations between BMQ \u2018necessity\u2019 scores, and BMQ \u2018necessity-concerns\u2019 scores, and later viral suppression. This suggests that the BMQ may be a valuable tool when used alongside other adherence measures, and that it remains important to keep caregivers well informed about the long-term necessity of their child\u2019s ART.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Adherence", "Antiretroviral therapy", "Beliefs in medicine", "Children", "Sub-Saharan Africa"], "IndexKeywords": ["Africa South of the Sahara", "Anti-HIV Agents", "Attitude to Health", "Benzoxazines", "Caregivers", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Dideoxynucleosides", "Female", "HIV Infections", "Humans", "Infant", "Lamivudine", "Linear Models", "Logistic Models", "Male", "Medication Adherence", "Multivariate Analysis", "Nevirapine", "Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic", "Stavudine", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "Uganda", "Zambia", "Zidovudine"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84991807764", "SubjectAreas": [["Social Psychology", "PSYC", "3207"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"26321047000": {"Name": "Abongomera G.", "AuthorID": "26321047000", "AffiliationID": "60012937", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Medicine, University of Antwerp"}, "56966747100": {"Name": "Abach J.", "AuthorID": "56966747100", "AffiliationID": "106929371", "AffiliationName": "Joint Clinical Research Centre"}, "35301739400": {"Name": "Colebunders R.", "AuthorID": "35301739400", "AffiliationID": "60012937", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Medicine, University of Antwerp"}, "37030689700": {"Name": "Cook A.", "AuthorID": "37030689700", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council Clinical Trials Unit at University College London"}, "9735572400": {"Name": "Thomason M.", "AuthorID": "9735572400", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council Clinical Trials Unit at University College London"}, "35402208300": {"Name": "Walker A.S.", "AuthorID": "35402208300", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council Clinical Trials Unit at University College London"}, "35495600000": {"Name": "Gibb D.M.", "AuthorID": "35495600000", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council Clinical Trials Unit at University College London"}, "17135681200": {"Name": "Musiime V.", "AuthorID": "17135681200", "AffiliationID": "60196602", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Paediatrics, Makerere University College of Health Sciences"}, "6602918610": {"Name": "Kityo C.", "AuthorID": "6602918610", "AffiliationID": "60071691", "AffiliationName": "Joint Clinical Research Centre"}, "55444254300": {"Name": "Chabala C.", "AuthorID": "55444254300", "AffiliationID": "60072805", "AffiliationName": "University Teaching Hospital"}, "14056702100": {"Name": "Mulenga V.", "AuthorID": "14056702100", "AffiliationID": "60072805", "AffiliationName": "University Teaching Hospital"}, "24069027300": {"Name": "Lamorde M.", "AuthorID": "24069027300", "AffiliationID": "60071676", "AffiliationName": "Infectious Diseases Institute"}, "21934132800": {"Name": "Kekitiinwa A.", "AuthorID": "21934132800", "AffiliationID": "116052147", "AffiliationName": "Baylor-Uganda"}}}
