Choosing well-registered atlases for label fusion is vital for an accurate segmentation. This choice becomes even more crucial when the segmentation involves organs characterized by a high anatomical and pathological variability. In this paper, we propose a new genetic atlas selection strategy (GAS) that automatically chooses the best subset of atlases to be used for segmenting the target image, on the basis of both image similarity and segmentation overlap. More precisely, the key idea of GAS is that if two images are similar, the performances of an atlas for segmenting each image are similar. Since the ground truth of each atlas is known, GAS first selects a predefined number of similar images to the target, then, for each one of them, finds a near-optimal subset of atlases by means of a genetic algorithm. All these near-optimal subsets are then combined and used to segment the target image. GAS was tested on single-label and multi-label segmentation problems. In the first case, we considered the segmentation of both the whole prostate and of the left ventricle of the heart from magnetic resonance images. Regarding multi-label problems, the zonal segmentation of the prostate into peripheral and transition zone was considered. The results showed that the performance of MAS algorithms statistically improved when GAS is used.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Atlas selection", "Genetic algorithm", "Multi-atlas based segmentation", "Multi-parametric MRI", "Prostate segmentation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Atlas selection", "Image similarity", "Left ventricles", "Multi atlas-based segmentations", "Multi-label problems", "Prostate segmentation", "Registration performance", "Transition zones", "Algorithms", "Heart Diseases", "Humans", "Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Pattern Recognition, Automated", "Prostatic Neoplasms"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85056965165", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiological and Ultrasound Technology", "HEAL", "3614"], ["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"], ["Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition", "COMP", "1707"], ["Health Informatics", "MEDI", "2718"], ["Computer Graphics and Computer-Aided Design", "COMP", "1704"]], "AuthorData": {"23392100500": {"Name": "Antonelli M.", "AuthorID": "23392100500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Image Computing, University College London"}, "36613715800": {"Name": "Presles B.", "AuthorID": "36613715800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Image Computing, University College London"}, "57204636980": {"Name": "Cardoso M.", "AuthorID": "57204636980", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "School of Biomedical Engineering and Imaging Science, Kings College London"}, "24376919100": {"Name": "Modat M.", "AuthorID": "24376919100", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "School of Biomedical Engineering and Imaging Science, Kings College London"}, "6602233595": {"Name": "Ourselin S.", "AuthorID": "6602233595", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "School of Biomedical Engineering and Imaging Science, Kings College London"}, "56053957500": {"Name": "Johnston E.", "AuthorID": "56053957500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Imaging, University College London"}, "56888721200": {"Name": "Appayya M.", "AuthorID": "56888721200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Imaging, University College London"}, "17036141700": {"Name": "Punwani S.", "AuthorID": "17036141700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Imaging, University College London"}}}
