But do they also change behaviour? We address this question by comparing the results of two identical randomized field experiments on ethnic discrimination in hiring that we conducted in Oslo. The first experiment was conducted before the 2011 terrorist attacks in Norway; the second experiment was conducted after the attacks. In both experiments, applicants with a typical Pakistani name were significantly less likely to get a job interview compared to those with a typical Norwegian name. But the ethnic gap in call-back rates were very similar in the two experiments. Thus, Pakistanis in Norway still experienced the same level of discrimination, despite claims that Norwegians have become more positive about migrants after the far-right, anti-migrant terrorist attacks of 2011.", "AuthorKeywords": ["ethnic discrimination", "field experiment", "Terrorist attack"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Emigrants and Immigrants", "Ethnic Groups", "Female", "Humans", "Job Application", "Male", "Norway", "Pakistan", "Personnel Selection", "Prejudice", "Random Allocation", "Regression Analysis", "Social Stigma", "Terrorism"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85041007891", "SubjectAreas": [["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"]], "AuthorData": {"6602845583": {"Name": "Birkelund G.", "AuthorID": "6602845583", "AffiliationID": "60010348", "AffiliationName": "University of Oslo"}, "57213124377": {"Name": "Chan T.", "AuthorID": "57213124377", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Education"}, "55524327300": {"Name": "Ugreninov E.", "AuthorID": "55524327300", "AffiliationID": "60010348, 60006413", "AffiliationName": "University of Oslo NOVA, Norwegian Social Research"}, "35339578300": {"Name": "Midtb\u00f8en A.", "AuthorID": "35339578300", "AffiliationID": "60016100", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Social Research"}, "25321018600": {"Name": "Rogstad J.", "AuthorID": "25321018600", "AffiliationID": "112632514", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Labour and Social Research"}}}
