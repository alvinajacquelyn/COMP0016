The scheme is nonlinear, but since an explicit time integration method is used the added cost due to the nonlinearity is not prohibitive. We prove the monotonicity preserving property for the forward Euler method and for a second order Runge-Kutta method. The convergence properties of the Runge-Kutta finite element method are verified on a numerical example.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Flux correction", "Monotonicity preserving", "Shock capturing", "Stabilized finite element method", "Transport equation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Flux corrections", "Monotonicity", "Shock-capturing", "Stabilized finite element methods", "Transport equation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84930944497", "SubjectAreas": [["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"7004271452": {"Name": "Burman E.", "AuthorID": "7004271452", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University College London"}}}
