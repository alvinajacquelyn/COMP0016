However, the underlying mechanisms in the combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) era are not fully understood. Interferon alpha (IFN\u03b1) is an antiviral cytokine found to be elevated in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of individuals with advanced HIV-associated dementia in the pre-cART era. In this cross-sectional study, we investigated the association between IFN\u03b1 and neurocognitive performance in ambulatory HIV-infected individuals with milder impairment. An eight-test neuropsychological battery representing six cognitive domains was administered. Individual scores were adjusted for demographic characteristics, and a composite neuropsychological score (NPT-8) was calculated. IFN\u03b1 and CSF neurofilament light chain (NFL) levels were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). There were 15 chronically infected participants with a history of significant immunocompromise (median nadir CD4+ of 49 cells/\u03bcl). Most participants were neurocognitively impaired (mean global deficit score of 0.86). CSF IFN\u03b1 negatively correlated with three individual tests (Trailmaking A, Trailmaking B, and Stroop Color-Word) as well as the composite NPT-8 score (r = \u22120.67, p = 0.006). These negative correlations persisted in multivariable analyses adjusting for chronic hepatitis B and C. Additionally, CSF IFN\u03b1 correlated strongly with CSF NFL, a marker of neuronal damage (rho = 0.748, p = 0.0013). These results extend findings from individuals with severe HIV-associated dementia in the pre-cART era and suggest that IFN\u03b1 may continue to play a role in HAND pathogenesis during the cART era. Further investigation into the role of IFN\u03b1 is indicated.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Aids", "HIV", "Interferon alpha", "Memory disorders"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "AIDS Dementia Complex", "Antiretroviral Therapy, Highly Active", "Antiviral Agents", "CD4 Lymphocyte Count", "CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes", "Cognition", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Female", "Gene Expression", "Humans", "Immunocompromised Host", "Interferon-alpha", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Neurofilament Proteins", "Neuropsychological Tests", "Outpatients"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84978036707", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"], ["Virology", "IMMU", "2406"]], "AuthorData": {"8502412300": {"Name": "Anderson A.M.", "AuthorID": "8502412300", "AffiliationID": "60002339", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Division of Infectious Diseases, Emory University School of Medicine"}, "7006197076": {"Name": "Lennox J.L.", "AuthorID": "7006197076", "AffiliationID": "60002339", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Division of Infectious Diseases, Emory University School of Medicine"}, "7102563329": {"Name": "Mulligan M.M.", "AuthorID": "7102563329", "AffiliationID": "60002339", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Division of Infectious Diseases, Emory University School of Medicine"}, "7006176503": {"Name": "Loring D.W.", "AuthorID": "7006176503", "AffiliationID": "60002339", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Emory University School of Medicine"}, "7801610812": {"Name": "Koneru R.", "AuthorID": "7801610812", "AffiliationID": "60002339", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Emory University School of Medicine"}, "7004251879": {"Name": "Tyor W.R.", "AuthorID": "7004251879", "AffiliationID": "60105810", "AffiliationName": "Atlanta Veterans Affairs Medical Center"}, "6701454676": {"Name": "Zetterberg H.", "AuthorID": "6701454676", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "56415176000": {"Name": "Blennow K.", "AuthorID": "56415176000", "AffiliationID": "60027675, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Neurochemistry Laboratory, Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, The Sahlgrenska Academy at University of Gothenburg"}, "56584519900": {"Name": "Kessing C.", "AuthorID": "56584519900", "AffiliationID": "60001462", "AffiliationName": "Department of Immunology and Microbial Science, The Scripps Research Institute"}, "7005681442": {"Name": "Easley K.", "AuthorID": "7005681442", "AffiliationID": "60025315, 60000928", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biostatistics, Emory University Rollins School of Public Health"}}}
