The optical and mechanical properties of the waveguides and pillar supports are modeled, and different MEMS actuation schemes are simulated. We also present fabrication and characterization results of the epitaxially grown sample structure and of the suspended waveguide device, exhibiting two parallel waveguides with submicron dimensions separated by a 400-nm air gap, and suspended at 40-\u03bcm intervals by S-shaped supports.", "AuthorKeywords": ["III-V semiconductor materials", "indium phosphide", "microelectromechanical systems", "optical buffering", "optical waveguides"], "IndexKeywords": ["Electrostatic actuation", "Epitaxially grown", "Fabrication and characterizations", "Optical and mechanical properties", "Optical buffering", "Parallel waveguides", "Submicron dimension", "Waveguide device"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84921878616", "SubjectAreas": [["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"56386662300": {"Name": "Ng W.H.", "AuthorID": "56386662300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "10141185300": {"Name": "Wu J.", "AuthorID": "10141185300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "15765485000": {"Name": "Liu H.", "AuthorID": "15765485000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "7005715736": {"Name": "Kenyon A.J.", "AuthorID": "7005715736", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "36554606500": {"Name": "Podoliak N.", "AuthorID": "36554606500", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "Optoelectronics Research Centre, University of Southampton"}, "7101868270": {"Name": "Horak P.", "AuthorID": "7101868270", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "Optoelectronics Research Centre, University of Southampton"}, "7402646699": {"Name": "Stewart W.J.", "AuthorID": "7402646699", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "Optoelectronics Research Centre, University of Southampton"}}}
