This study examined the factors associated with retention of low-SES smokers in the Australian Financial Interventions for Smoking Cessation Among Low-Income Smokers (FISCALS) trial. Design A two-group parallel block randomised open-label trial with allocation concealment. Setting Australia. The study was conducted primarily by telephone-based interviews with nicotine replacement therapy delivered via mail. Participants 1047 low-SES smokers interested in quitting smoking were randomised. Measurements Participants completed computer assisted telephone interviews (CATIs) at baseline, 2-month and 8-month follow-up. Smoking-related, substance use, mental or physical health, general psychological constructs, sociodemographic and recruitment sources association with retention at 8-month follow-up were examined using binary logistic regression. Findings 946 participants (90%) completed the 2-month follow-up interview and 880 participants (84%) completed the 8-month follow-up interview. Retention at 8-months was associated with higher motivation to quit (OR: 1.15; 95% CI: 1.04, 1.27 p < 0.01), more recent quit attempts (OR: 1.20; 95% CI: 1.04, 1.40 p < 0.05), increasing age (OR: 1.05; 95% CI: 1.03, 1.07 p < 0.01), and higher level of education (OR: 2.24; 95% CI: 1.45, 3.46 p < 0.01). Lower retention at 8-months occurred for those participants recruited from posters placed in Department of Human Service Centrelink Offices (OR: 0.56; 95% CI: 0.35, 0.89, p < 0.05) compared to participants recruited from Quitline services. No significant differences in retention were found for participants recruited via newspaper advertisements or word of mouth compared to Quitline services. No significant associations were found between health-related or behavioural factors and retention. Conclusions In the context of high overall retention rates from disadvantaged smokers in a randomised trial, retention was greater in those smokers with higher motivation to quit, more recent quit attempts, increased age, higher level of education and for those recruited through Quitline or newspaper advertisements.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Method", "Randomized controlled trial", "Retention", "Smoking cessation", "Socioeconomic factors"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Australia", "Cigarette Smoking", "Female", "Humans", "Interviews as Topic", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Patient Compliance", "Poverty", "Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic", "Reminder Systems", "Smoking Cessation", "Socioeconomic Factors", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84981328328", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (miscellaneous)", "MEDI", "2701"], ["Clinical Psychology", "PSYC", "3203"], ["Toxicology", "PHAR", "3005"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"55161599000": {"Name": "Courtney R.J.", "AuthorID": "55161599000", "AffiliationID": "60109564, 60028333", "AffiliationName": "National Drug & Alcohol Research Centre (NDARC), University of New South Wales (UNSW)"}, "56090849700": {"Name": "Clare P.", "AuthorID": "56090849700", "AffiliationID": "60109564, 60028333", "AffiliationName": "National Drug & Alcohol Research Centre (NDARC), University of New South Wales (UNSW)"}, "57218349049": {"Name": "Boland V.", "AuthorID": "57218349049", "AffiliationID": "60109564, 60028333", "AffiliationName": "National Drug & Alcohol Research Centre (NDARC), University of New South Wales (UNSW)"}, "24437449400": {"Name": "Martire K.A.", "AuthorID": "24437449400", "AffiliationID": "60028333", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, UNSW"}, "50961122100": {"Name": "Farrell M.", "AuthorID": "50961122100", "AffiliationID": "60109564, 60028333", "AffiliationName": "National Drug & Alcohol Research Centre (NDARC), University of New South Wales (UNSW)"}, "56962788900": {"Name": "Mattick R.P.", "AuthorID": "56962788900", "AffiliationID": "60109564, 60028333", "AffiliationName": "National Drug & Alcohol Research Centre (NDARC), University of New South Wales (UNSW)"}, "6603014592": {"Name": "Bonevski B.", "AuthorID": "6603014592", "AffiliationID": "60010571, 60183191, 60017054", "AffiliationName": "School of Medicine & Public Health, Faculty of Health and Medicine, University of Newcastle"}, "7402629359": {"Name": "Hall W.", "AuthorID": "7402629359", "AffiliationID": "60031004, 60110780", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Clinical Research, University of Queensland"}, "6603803167": {"Name": "Siahpush M.", "AuthorID": "6603803167", "AffiliationID": "60016261", "AffiliationName": "College of Public Health, University of Nebraska Medical Center"}, "7005900584": {"Name": "Borland R.", "AuthorID": "7005900584", "AffiliationID": "60001052", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Behavioural Research in Cancer, Cancer Council Victoria"}, "35576476000": {"Name": "Doran C.M.", "AuthorID": "35576476000", "AffiliationID": "60099247", "AffiliationName": "School of Human, Health and Social Sciences, Central Queensland University"}, "7402396010": {"Name": "West R.", "AuthorID": "7402396010", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Department of Epidemiology & Public Health, University College London"}}}
