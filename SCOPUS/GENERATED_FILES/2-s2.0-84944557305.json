The IWO algorithm is a new search strategy, which makes use of mechanisms inspired by the natural behavior of weeds in colonizing and finding a suitable place for growth and reproduction. All algorithmic components are explained in detail and computational results for the RACP are presented. The procedure is also executed to solve the RACP with tardiness (RACPT), in which lateness of the project is permitted with a predefined penalty.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Heuristic algorithms", "Invasive weed", "Project scheduling", "Resource availability", "Tardiness cost"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84944557305", "SubjectAreas": [["Economics, Econometrics and Finance (all)", "ECON", "2000"], ["Business, Management and Accounting (all)", "BUSI", "1400"]], "AuthorData": {"27868151100": {"Name": "Van peteghem V.", "AuthorID": "27868151100", "AffiliationID": "60109562", "AffiliationName": "EDHEC Business School"}, "6602303040": {"Name": "Vanhoucke M.", "AuthorID": "6602303040", "AffiliationID": "60033316", "AffiliationName": "Ghent University"}}}
