This study examined time trends in, and identified predictors of, anxiety and specific worries over 12 months. Methods Women attending two hospital-based colposcopy clinics for abnormal cervical cytology were invited to complete psychosocial questionnaires at 4, 8 and 12 months following colposcopy. General anxiety and screening-specific worries (about cervical cancer, having sex and future fertility) were measured. Generalised estimating equations were used to assess associations between socio-demographic, lifestyle and clinical variables and risk of psychological outcomes. Results Of 584 women initially recruited, 429, 343 and 303 completed questionnaires at 4, 8 and 12 months, respectively. Screening-specific worries declined significantly over time but were still relatively high at 12 months: 23%, 39% and 18% for worries about cervical cancer, fertility and having sex, respectively. Anxiety remained stable (20%) over time. Risks of cervical cancer worry and anxiety were both almost double in women without private health insurance (cervical cancer worry: OR = 1.80, 95% CI 1.25-2.61; anxiety: OR = 1.84, 95% CI 1.20-2.84). Younger women (<40 years) had higher risk of fertility worries. Non-Irish women had higher risk of anxiety (OR = 2.13, 95% CI 1.13-4.01). Conclusions Screening-specific worries declined over time but anxiety remained stable. Notable proportions of women still reported adverse outcomes 12 months following colposcopy, with predictors varying between outcomes. Women in socio-demographically vulnerable groups were at greatest risk of adverse psychological outcomes. This information could inform development of interventions to alleviate psychological distress post-colposcopy.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Anxiety", "Anxiety Disorders", "Colposcopy", "Female", "Humans", "Ireland", "Longitudinal Studies", "Middle Aged", "Pregnancy", "Prevalence", "Stress, Psychological", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "Uterine Cervical Neoplasms"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84945156810", "SubjectAreas": [["Experimental and Cognitive Psychology", "PSYC", "3205"], ["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"7402685953": {"Name": "O'Connor M.", "AuthorID": "7402685953", "AffiliationID": "60027144", "AffiliationName": "National Cancer Registry Ireland, Building 6800, Cork Airport Business Park"}, "55670667500": {"Name": "O'Leary E.", "AuthorID": "55670667500", "AffiliationID": "60027144", "AffiliationName": "National Cancer Registry Ireland, Building 6800, Cork Airport Business Park"}, "56147825400": {"Name": "McRae J.", "AuthorID": "56147825400", "AffiliationID": "60027144", "AffiliationName": "National Cancer Registry Ireland, Building 6800, Cork Airport Business Park"}, "57191898211": {"Name": "Waller J.", "AuthorID": "57191898211", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Health Behaviour Research Centre, University College London"}, "55438665900": {"Name": "Gallagher P.", "AuthorID": "55438665900", "AffiliationID": "60025059", "AffiliationName": "School of Nursing and Human Sciences, Dublin City University"}, "55757257900": {"Name": "D'Arcy T.", "AuthorID": "55757257900", "AffiliationID": "60027572", "AffiliationName": "Coombe Women and Infants University Hospital"}, "8636346100": {"Name": "Martin C.M.", "AuthorID": "8636346100", "AffiliationID": "60027572", "AffiliationName": "Coombe Women and Infants University Hospital"}, "57219284888": {"Name": "Prendiville W.", "AuthorID": "57219284888", "AffiliationID": "60027572", "AffiliationName": "Coombe Women and Infants University Hospital"}, "55867365800": {"Name": "Ruttle C.", "AuthorID": "55867365800", "AffiliationID": "60027572", "AffiliationName": "Coombe Women and Infants University Hospital"}, "12239281700": {"Name": "Pilkington L.", "AuthorID": "12239281700", "AffiliationID": "60027572", "AffiliationName": "Coombe Women and Infants University Hospital"}, "7202225810": {"Name": "O'Leary J.J.", "AuthorID": "7202225810", "AffiliationID": "60027572", "AffiliationName": "Coombe Women and Infants University Hospital"}, "6603907450": {"Name": "Flannelly G.", "AuthorID": "6603907450", "AffiliationID": "60032976", "AffiliationName": "National Maternity Hospital"}, "57212694600": {"Name": "White C.", "AuthorID": "57212694600", "AffiliationID": "60011149", "AffiliationName": "Trinity College Dublin"}, "7006781007": {"Name": "Sharp L.", "AuthorID": "7006781007", "AffiliationID": "60026712, 60006222", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Health and Society, Newcastle University"}}}
