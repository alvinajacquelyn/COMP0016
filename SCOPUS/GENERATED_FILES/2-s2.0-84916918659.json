We contrast a syntactically-represented account whereby people postulate a syntactic representation for the missing argument, with a syntactically-non-represented account whereby people do not postulate any syntactic representation for it. We report two structural priming experiments in Mandarin Chinese that showed that comprehension of a dative sentence with a missing direct-object argument primed the production of a full-form dative sentence (relative to an intransitive) and that it behaved similarly to a corresponding full-form dative sentence. The results suggest that people construct the same constituent structure for missing-argument sentences and full-form sentences, in accord with the syntactically-represented account. We discuss the implications for syntactic representations in language processing.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Argument structure", "Chinese", "Ellipsis", "Language processing", "Mental representation", "Structural priming"], "IndexKeywords": ["Comprehension", "Humans", "Language", "Linguistics"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84916918659", "SubjectAreas": [["Experimental and Cognitive Psychology", "PSYC", "3205"], ["Language and Linguistics", "ARTS", "1203"], ["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"], ["Linguistics and Language", "SOCI", "3310"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"]], "AuthorData": {"41661049700": {"Name": "Cai Z.", "AuthorID": "41661049700", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychological Sciences, University of Manchester"}, "7006461382": {"Name": "Pickering M.", "AuthorID": "7006461382", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, University of Edinburgh"}, "6603228182": {"Name": "Branigan H.", "AuthorID": "6603228182", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, University of Edinburgh"}, "56128487100": {"Name": "Wang R.", "AuthorID": "56128487100", "AffiliationID": "60005816", "AffiliationName": "Center for Studies of Psychological Application, School of Psychology, South China Normal University"}}}
