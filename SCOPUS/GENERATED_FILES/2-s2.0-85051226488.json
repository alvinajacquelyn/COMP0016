No comparative data exist assessing subperceptional versus perceptional SCS with sham stimulation in patients with OT. Methods: Two patients who had refractory OT were assessed at baseline and 3 months after SCS implantation using 3 different SCS modes: paraesthesia-free burst SCS (40 Hz), sham SCS, and paraesthesia-evoking tonic SCS (100\u2013130 Hz). Surface electromyography, standing time, stimulation parameters, and any adverse events were prospectively recorded. Results: Improved standing time was observed under burst and tonic mode versus stimulation off and compared with baseline in both patients (patient 1: baseline = 22-second; burst SCS [subperceptional]/ standing time = 2.8 minutes; stimulation off/ standing time = 28 seconds; and tonic SCS [perceptional]/ standing time = 1.2 minutes; patient 2: baseline = 47-second; burst SCS [subperceptional]/ standing time = 3.1 minutes; stimulation off/ standing time = 48 seconds; and tonic SCS [perceptional]/ standing time = 1.1 minute). The electromyography frequency demonstrated a decline in tremor frequency. Conclusion: Burst as a novel SCS paradigm may be co-considered in patients with refractory OT before more invasive deep-brain stimulation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["burst spinal cord stimulation (SCS)", "case report", "perceptional SCS waveforms", "refractory orthostatic tremor", "subperceptional SCS waveforms"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85051226488", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"24344729300": {"Name": "Pintea B.", "AuthorID": "24344729300", "AffiliationID": "60013088, 60005322", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurosurgery, University Hospital Bergmannsheil, Ruhr University Bochum"}, "39061254700": {"Name": "de Boni L.", "AuthorID": "39061254700", "AffiliationID": "60030465", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, University Hospital Bonn"}, "6506839379": {"Name": "Kinfe T.M.", "AuthorID": "6506839379", "AffiliationID": "60007493", "AffiliationName": "Division of Functional Neurosurgery and Neuromodulation, Department of Neurosurgery, Rheinische Friedrich Wilhelms University"}}}
