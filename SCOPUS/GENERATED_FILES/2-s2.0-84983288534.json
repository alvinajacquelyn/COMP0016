'Archaeology without context' is a rallying cry for the archaeological profession to mobilise its collective voice in order to petition against the sale of heritage where an object's history is opaque and very probably a result of destructive looting (Chippindale et al. 2001; Brodie 2006). The vocal campaign of the last decade to ensure that high-profile sales and museum acquisitions of material without documented collection histories do not encourage or sanction looting (e.g. Renfrew 2000; Brodie et al. 2006) has had some success, although objects without findspots continue to surface on the market (e.g. Gill & Tsirogiannis 2011).", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84983288534", "SubjectAreas": [["Archeology", "SOCI", "3302"], ["Arts and Humanities (all)", "ARTS", "1200"]], "AuthorData": {"55937136900": {"Name": "Stevenson A.", "AuthorID": "55937136900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology"}}}
