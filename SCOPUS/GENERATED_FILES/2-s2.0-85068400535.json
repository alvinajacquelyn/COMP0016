In this paper, Digital Image Correlation (DIC) and integrated finite element (FE) analyses have been used to characterise the crack-tip field beyond the small-scale yielding (SSY) regime in a stainless steel 316L of a compact-tension (CT) specimen under mode I loading conditions. The non-linear characteristics of the near-tip deformation field were verified by the poor fit to the William's regression and the overestimation of the stress intensity factor K. The extent of the crack tip plasticity was estimated using a detailed constitutive material model and compared with the estimated by Irwin. The displacement fields local to a stationary fatigue crack were mapped using DIC, and inputted into the FE model as boundary conditions so that an integrated FE analysis was carried out. Fatigue pre-cracking was simulated in the FE analysis prior to the full-field analysis of the fatigue crack tip, including stress/strain distributions ahead of the crack tip and the crack opening displacement (COD) under selected loading conditions. Although a distinct \u201cknee\u201d was captured as an indication of crack opening from the compliance curves in both the DIC measurements and the FE analyses, consistent with the existing knowledge on the phenomenon of crack closure, it does not appear to correlate with the crack driving force measured by the J-integral.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Compact tension specimen", "Constitutive materials", "Crack opening displacements", "Crack tip plasticity", "D. digital image correlation (DIC)", "Nonlinear characteristics", "Small-scale yielding", "Stainless steel 316L"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85068400535", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"55572667400": {"Name": "Lin B.", "AuthorID": "55572667400", "AffiliationID": "60025475", "AffiliationName": "Mechanical Behaviour of Materials Laboratory, School of Mechanical and Design Engineering, University of Portsmouth"}, "57200327510": {"Name": "Alshammrei S.", "AuthorID": "57200327510", "AffiliationID": "60025475", "AffiliationName": "Mechanical Behaviour of Materials Laboratory, School of Mechanical and Design Engineering, University of Portsmouth"}, "57200328573": {"Name": "Wigger T.", "AuthorID": "57200328573", "AffiliationID": "60025475", "AffiliationName": "Mechanical Behaviour of Materials Laboratory, School of Mechanical and Design Engineering, University of Portsmouth"}, "7202724363": {"Name": "Tong J.", "AuthorID": "7202724363", "AffiliationID": "60025475", "AffiliationName": "Mechanical Behaviour of Materials Laboratory, School of Mechanical and Design Engineering, University of Portsmouth"}}}
