Methods: Seventy-three stable COPD patients recorded on daily diary cards worsening of respiratory symptoms, peak expiratory flow rate, hours spent outside the home and the number of steps taken per day. Pedometry data was recorded on 16,478 days, an average of 267 days per patient (range 29-658). Daily data for atmospheric PM10 and ozone (O3) were obtained for Bloomsbury Square, Central London from the Air Quality Information Archive databases. Daily weather data were obtained for London Heathrow from the British Atmospheric Data Archive. Results: Colder weather below 22.5 \u00b0C, reduced daily step count by 43.3 steps day per\u00b0C (95 % CI 2.14 to 84.4; p = 0.039) and activity was lower on rainy than dry days (p = 0.002) and on overcast compared to sunny days (p < 0.001). Daily step count was 434 steps per day lower on Sunday than Saturday (p < 0.001) and 353 steps per day lower on Saturday than Friday (p < 0.001). After allowance for these effects, higher O3 levels decreased activity during the whole week (-8 steps/ug/m3; p = 0.005) and at weekends (-7.8 steps/ug/m3; p = 0.032). Whilst, during the week PM10 reduced activity (p = 0.018) but not during the weekend. Conclusions: Inactivity of COPD patients is greatest on cold, wet and overcast days and at the weekends. This study also provides evidence of an independent effect of atmospheric pollution at high levels.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Atmospheric pollution", "COPD", "Daily monitoring", "Daily step-count", "Physical activity", "Weather"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Air Pollution", "Cohort Studies", "Female", "Humans", "Longitudinal Studies", "Male", "Maximal Expiratory Flow Rate", "Middle Aged", "Motor Activity", "Particulate Matter", "Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive", "Seasons", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "Weather"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84935881528", "SubjectAreas": [["Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine", "MEDI", "2740"]], "AuthorData": {"56190710800": {"Name": "Alahmari A.", "AuthorID": "56190710800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Royal Free Campus, Centre for Respiratory Medicine"}, "55177860500": {"Name": "Mackay A.", "AuthorID": "55177860500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Royal Free Campus, Centre for Respiratory Medicine"}, "36105652400": {"Name": "Patel A.", "AuthorID": "36105652400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Royal Free Campus, Centre for Respiratory Medicine"}, "55921557900": {"Name": "Kowlessar B.", "AuthorID": "55921557900", "AffiliationID": "60010719, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "UK Airways Disease Section, National Heart and Lung Institute, Imperial College London"}, "57198437187": {"Name": "Singh R.", "AuthorID": "57198437187", "AffiliationID": "60010719, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "UK Airways Disease Section, National Heart and Lung Institute, Imperial College London"}, "54411806100": {"Name": "Brill S.", "AuthorID": "54411806100", "AffiliationID": "60010719, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "UK Airways Disease Section, National Heart and Lung Institute, Imperial College London"}, "55215508700": {"Name": "Allinson J.", "AuthorID": "55215508700", "AffiliationID": "60010719, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "UK Airways Disease Section, National Heart and Lung Institute, Imperial College London"}, "7005667185": {"Name": "Wedzicha J.", "AuthorID": "7005667185", "AffiliationID": "60010719, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "UK Airways Disease Section, National Heart and Lung Institute, Imperial College London"}, "56181613900": {"Name": "Donaldson G.", "AuthorID": "56181613900", "AffiliationID": "60010719, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "UK Airways Disease Section, National Heart and Lung Institute, Imperial College London"}}}
