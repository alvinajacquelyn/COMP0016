All Rights Reserved.Antibodies classically bind antigens via their complementarity-determining regions, but an alternative mode of interaction involving V-domain framework regions has been observed for some B cell \u201csuperantigens.\u201d We report the crystal structure of an antibody employing both modes of interaction simultaneously and binding two antigen molecules. This human antibody from an allergic individual binds to the grass pollen allergen Phl p 7. Not only are two allergen molecules bound to each antibody fragment (Fab) but also each allergen molecule is bound by two Fabs: One epitope is recognized classically, the other in a superantigen-like manner. A single allergen molecule thus cross-links two identical Fabs, contrary to the one-antibody\u2013one-epitope dogma, which dictates that a dimeric allergen at least is required for this to occur. Allergens trigger immediate hypersensitivity reactions by cross-linking receptor-bound IgE molecules on effector cells. We found that monomeric Phl p 7 induced degranulation of basophils sensitized solely with this monoclonal antibody expressed as an IgE, demonstrating that the dual specificity has functional consequences. The monomeric state of Phl p 7 and two structurally related allergens was confirmed by size-exclusion chromatography and multiangle laser light scattering, and the results were supported by degranulation studies with the related allergens, a second patient-derived allergen-specific antibody lacking the nonclassical binding site, and mutagenesis of the nonclassically recognized allergen epitope. The antibody dual reactivity and cross-linking mechanism not only have implications for understanding allergenicity and allergen potency but, importantly, also have broader relevance to antigen recognition by membrane Ig and cross-linking of the B cell receptor.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Allergen", "Antibody structure", "Basophil degranulation", "IgE", "Superantigen-like recognition"], "IndexKeywords": ["Antibodies, Monoclonal", "Antibody Specificity", "Antigens, Plant", "Basophils", "Calcium-Binding Proteins", "Cell Degranulation", "Cross Reactions", "Crystallography, X-Ray", "Epitopes", "Humans", "Immunoglobulin E", "Models, Molecular", "Protein Binding", "Protein Conformation", "Superantigens"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85053051284", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"57194567532": {"Name": "Mitropoulou A.N.", "AuthorID": "57194567532", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London"}, "7004285405": {"Name": "Bowen H.", "AuthorID": "7004285405", "AffiliationID": "60005518, 60011520, 60171763", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health Research Biomedical Research Centre, Guy\u2019s and St. Thomas\u2019 National Health Service Foundation Trust, King\u2019s College London"}, "37121787800": {"Name": "Dodev T.S.", "AuthorID": "37121787800", "AffiliationID": "60002517, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council, Asthma UK Centre in Allergic Mechanisms of Asthma"}, "7403658362": {"Name": "Davies A.M.", "AuthorID": "7403658362", "AffiliationID": "60002517, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council, Asthma UK Centre in Allergic Mechanisms of Asthma"}, "55355166500": {"Name": "Bax H.J.", "AuthorID": "55355166500", "AffiliationID": "60002517, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council, Asthma UK Centre in Allergic Mechanisms of Asthma"}, "6602676690": {"Name": "Beavil R.L.", "AuthorID": "6602676690", "AffiliationID": "60002517, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council, Asthma UK Centre in Allergic Mechanisms of Asthma"}, "6603327993": {"Name": "Beavil A.J.", "AuthorID": "6603327993", "AffiliationID": "60002517, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council, Asthma UK Centre in Allergic Mechanisms of Asthma"}, "7101817404": {"Name": "Gould H.J.", "AuthorID": "7101817404", "AffiliationID": "60002517, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council, Asthma UK Centre in Allergic Mechanisms of Asthma"}, "57200623383": {"Name": "James L.K.", "AuthorID": "57200623383", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Blizard Institute, Barts and the London School of Medicine, Queen Mary University of London"}, "7102842857": {"Name": "Sutton B.J.", "AuthorID": "7102842857", "AffiliationID": "60002517, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council, Asthma UK Centre in Allergic Mechanisms of Asthma"}}}
