Health functioning was assessed twice in occupational cohorts from Britain (1997-1999 and 2003-2004), Finland (2000-2002 and 2007) and Japan (1998-1999 and 2003). Widening inequalities were seen for British and Finnish men, whereas inequalities among British and Finnish women remained relatively stable. Japanese women showed reverse inequalities at follow up, but no health inequalities were seen among Japanese men. Health behaviours and social relations explained 4-37% of the magnitude in health inequalities, but not their widening.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Britain", "Finland", "Follow up", "Health inequalities", "Japan"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Cross-Cultural Comparison", "Female", "Finland", "Follow-Up Studies", "Health Status Disparities", "Humans", "Japan", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Occupations", "Socioeconomic Factors", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84920868546", "SubjectAreas": [["Health (social science)", "SOCI", "3306"], ["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"], ["Life-span and Life-course Studies", "SOCI", "3319"]], "AuthorData": {"7006143909": {"Name": "Lahelma E.", "AuthorID": "7006143909", "AffiliationID": "60002952", "AffiliationName": "Department of Public Health, University of Helsinki"}, "57216598264": {"Name": "Pietil\u00e4inen O.", "AuthorID": "57216598264", "AffiliationID": "60002952", "AffiliationName": "Department of Public Health, University of Helsinki"}, "7003352342": {"Name": "Rahkonen O.", "AuthorID": "7003352342", "AffiliationID": "60002952", "AffiliationName": "Department of Public Health, University of Helsinki"}, "7004391239": {"Name": "Kivim\u00e4ki M.", "AuthorID": "7004391239", "AffiliationID": "60002952", "AffiliationName": "Department of Public Health, University of Helsinki"}, "7103195317": {"Name": "Martikainen P.", "AuthorID": "7103195317", "AffiliationID": "60002952", "AffiliationName": "Department of Public Health, University of Helsinki"}, "55045633300": {"Name": "Ferrie J.", "AuthorID": "55045633300", "AffiliationID": "60002952", "AffiliationName": "Department of Public Health, University of Helsinki"}, "35418876900": {"Name": "Marmot M.", "AuthorID": "35418876900", "AffiliationID": "60002952", "AffiliationName": "Department of Public Health, University of Helsinki"}, "7103265845": {"Name": "Shipley M.", "AuthorID": "7103265845", "AffiliationID": "60002952", "AffiliationName": "Department of Public Health, University of Helsinki"}, "7201559934": {"Name": "Sekine M.", "AuthorID": "7201559934", "AffiliationID": "60002952", "AffiliationName": "Department of Public Health, University of Helsinki"}, "8505237100": {"Name": "Tatsuse T.", "AuthorID": "8505237100", "AffiliationID": "60002952", "AffiliationName": "Department of Public Health, University of Helsinki"}, "6508300634": {"Name": "Lallukka T.", "AuthorID": "6508300634", "AffiliationID": "60002952", "AffiliationName": "Department of Public Health, University of Helsinki"}}}
