Some types may, however, be regarded as a normal consequence of ageing; others may be observed in young age groups. They also occur in a number of inherited disorders and some systemic conditions. Whilst drusen are classically located external (sclerad) to the retinal pigment epithelium, accumulations of material internal (vitread to) this layer can display a drusen-like appearance, having been variously termed pseudodrusen or subretinal drusenoid deposits. This review first briefly presents an overview of drusen biogenesis and subclinical deposit. The (frequently overlapping) subtypes of clinically detectable deposit, seen usually in the context of ageing or AMD, are then described in more detail, together with appearance on imaging modalities: these include hard and soft drusen, cuticular drusen, reticular pseudodrusen and \"ghost drusen\". Eye disorders other than AMD which may exhibit drusen or drusen-like features are subsequently discussed: these include monogenic conditions as well as conditions with undefined inheritance, the latter including some types of early onset drusen such as large colloid drusen. A number of systemic conditions in which drusen-like deposits may be seen are also considered. Throughout this review, high resolution images are presented for most of the conditions discussed, particularly the rarer ones, providing a useful reference library for images of the range of conditions associated with drusen-like appearances. In the final section, some common themes are highlighted, as well as a brief discussion of some future avenues for research.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Macular degeneration", "Retinal drusen", "Retinal dystrophy"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aging", "Animals", "Eye Diseases, Hereditary", "Humans", "Macular Degeneration", "Retina", "Retinal Drusen", "Retinal Pigment Epithelium"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84967106626", "SubjectAreas": [["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"], ["Sensory Systems", "NEUR", "2809"]], "AuthorData": {"36646250000": {"Name": "Khan K.N.", "AuthorID": "36646250000", "AffiliationID": "60020454, 60023959", "AffiliationName": "Section of Ophthalmology and Neuroscience, Leeds Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Leeds, St James's University Hospital"}, "6507036910": {"Name": "Mahroo O.A.", "AuthorID": "6507036910", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Physiology, Development and Neuroscience, University of Cambridge"}, "35400601100": {"Name": "Bird A.", "AuthorID": "35400601100", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Medical Retina Service, Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "7101991490": {"Name": "Michaelides M.", "AuthorID": "7101991490", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Medical Retina Service, Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "15924308700": {"Name": "Tufail A.", "AuthorID": "15924308700", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Medical Retina Service, Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "56573251100": {"Name": "Moore A.T.", "AuthorID": "56573251100", "AffiliationID": "60031970", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, UCSF School of Medicine"}, "7004041333": {"Name": "McKibbin M.", "AuthorID": "7004041333", "AffiliationID": "60020454, 60023959", "AffiliationName": "Section of Ophthalmology and Neuroscience, Leeds Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Leeds, St James's University Hospital"}, "56231324300": {"Name": "Khan R.S.", "AuthorID": "56231324300", "AffiliationID": "60002370", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, Calderdale and Huddersfield NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7201586123": {"Name": "Mohamed M.D.", "AuthorID": "7201586123", "AffiliationID": "60005518", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, Guys and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
