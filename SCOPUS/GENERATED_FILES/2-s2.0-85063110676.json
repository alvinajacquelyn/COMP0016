However, palaeoecological associations appear to indicate a less cold woodland environment. Under such conditions, encounter and ambush (rather than pursuit) hunting \u2013 and thus muscular power and sprint (rather than endurance) capacity \u2013 would have been favoured. We hypothesise that the highly muscular Neanderthal body form reflects an adaptation to hunting conditions rather than cold, and here both review the palaeoecological evidence that they inhabited a mainly woodland environment, and present preliminary genetic analyses in support of this new hypothesis.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Encounter/ambush hunting", "Endurance", "Human evolution", "Power", "Running"], "IndexKeywords": ["Encounter/ambush hunting", "Genetic analysis", "Human evolution", "Neanderthals", "Power", "Running"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85063110676", "SubjectAreas": [["Global and Planetary Change", "ENVI", "2306"], ["Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics", "AGRI", "1105"], ["Archeology (arts and humanities)", "ARTS", "1204"], ["Archeology", "SOCI", "3302"], ["Geology", "EART", "1907"]], "AuthorData": {"8621347600": {"Name": "Stewart J.R.", "AuthorID": "8621347600", "AffiliationID": "60029336", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Science and Technology, Bournemouth University, Talbot Campus"}, "57204543953": {"Name": "Garc\u00eda-Rodr\u00edguez O.", "AuthorID": "57204543953", "AffiliationID": "60029336", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Science and Technology, Bournemouth University, Talbot Campus"}, "55073692700": {"Name": "Knul M.V.", "AuthorID": "55073692700", "AffiliationID": "60029336", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Science and Technology, Bournemouth University, Talbot Campus"}, "57200879023": {"Name": "Sewell L.", "AuthorID": "57200879023", "AffiliationID": "60029336", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Science and Technology, Bournemouth University, Talbot Campus"}, "35482685300": {"Name": "Montgomery H.", "AuthorID": "35482685300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Human Health and Performance: Institute for Sport, Exercise and Health"}, "8606206600": {"Name": "Thomas M.G.", "AuthorID": "8606206600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Genomics Institute (UGI), University College London"}, "16307081300": {"Name": "Diekmann Y.", "AuthorID": "16307081300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Genetics, Evolution and Environment, University College London"}}}
