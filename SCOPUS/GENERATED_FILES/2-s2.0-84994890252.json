Intriguingly, the core components of the Hippo pathway are conserved from yeast to man, with the yeast analogs of mammalian MST1/2 (fly Hippo), MOB1 (fly Mats), LATS1/2 (fly Warts), and NDR1/2 (fly Tricornered) functioning as essential components of the mitotic exit network (MEN). Here, we update our previous summary of mitotic functions of Hippo core components in Drosophila melanogaster and mammals, with particular emphasis on similarities between the yeast MEN pathway and mitotic Hippo signaling. Mitotic functions of YAP and TAZ, the two main effectors of Hippo signaling, are also discussed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cell cycle progression", "Kinase signaling", "Large tumor suppressor kinases", "Mammalian ste20-like kinases", "Mitosis", "MOB co-activator proteins", "Phosphorylation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Drosophila melanogaster", "Drosophila Proteins", "Humans", "Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins", "M Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints", "Mitosis", "Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases", "Signal Transduction"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84994890252", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"]], "AuthorData": {"6603634936": {"Name": "Hergovich A.", "AuthorID": "6603634936", "AffiliationID": "60109234, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Tumour Suppressor Signalling Networks Laboratory, UCL Cancer Institute, University College London"}}}
