Previous in vitro and small animal (murine) in vivo studies highlighted a porous hydroxyapatite/poly (DL-lactic acid) composite scaffold in combination with skeletal stem cells (SSCs) as a potential bone graft substitute candidate. The aim of the current study was to scale up the bone cell-scaffold construct to large animals and examine the potential for repair of a critical-sized defect via an ovine model. SSC seeded scaffolds (and unseeded scaffold controls) were implanted bilaterally into ovine femoral condyle critical defects for 3 months. A parallel in vitro analysis of ovine SSC seeded scaffolds was also performed. Post mortem mechanical indentation testing showed the bone strengths of the defect sites were 20% (controls) and 11% (SSC seeded scaffolds) those of normal cancellous bone (p < 0.01). MicroCT analysis demonstrated new bone formation within all defects with a mean increase of 13.4% in the control scaffolds over the SSC seeded scaffolds (p = 0.14). Histological examination confirmed these findings, with enhanced quality new bone within the control defects. This study highlights important issues and steps to overcome in scale-up and translation of tissue engineered products. The scaffold demonstrated encouraging results as an osteoconductive matrix; however, further work is required with cellular protocols before any human trials.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bone regeneration", "Polymer", "Progenitor cell", "Scaffold", "Skeletal stem cell"], "IndexKeywords": ["Bone graft substitutes", "Bone regeneration", "Critical sized defects", "Engineered porous hydroxyapatites", "Histological examination", "Porous hydroxyapatite", "Progenitor cell", "Tissue engineered products", "Alkaline Phosphatase", "Animals", "Bone Regeneration", "Durapatite", "Femur", "Humans", "Lymph Nodes", "Materials Testing", "Polymers", "Porosity", "Sheep, Domestic", "Stem Cells", "Stress, Mechanical", "Tissue Engineering", "Tissue Scaffolds", "X-Ray Microtomography"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84923572976", "SubjectAreas": [["Ceramics and Composites", "MATE", "2503"], ["Biomaterials", "MATE", "2502"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"], ["Metals and Alloys", "MATE", "2506"]], "AuthorData": {"23395473500": {"Name": "Tayton E.", "AuthorID": "23395473500", "AffiliationID": "60025287", "AffiliationName": "Bone and Joint Research Group, Centre for Human Development, Stem Cells and Regeneration, Human Development and Health, University of Southampton Medical School"}, "7410180362": {"Name": "Smith J.O.", "AuthorID": "7410180362", "AffiliationID": "60025287", "AffiliationName": "Bone and Joint Research Group, Centre for Human Development, Stem Cells and Regeneration, Human Development and Health, University of Southampton Medical School"}, "35388889100": {"Name": "Lanham S.", "AuthorID": "35388889100", "AffiliationID": "60025287", "AffiliationName": "Bone and Joint Research Group, Centre for Human Development, Stem Cells and Regeneration, Human Development and Health, University of Southampton Medical School"}, "35900399400": {"Name": "Dunlop D.G.", "AuthorID": "35900399400", "AffiliationID": "60025287", "AffiliationName": "Bone and Joint Research Group, Centre for Human Development, Stem Cells and Regeneration, Human Development and Health, University of Southampton Medical School"}, "7004135804": {"Name": "Oreffo R.O.C.", "AuthorID": "7004135804", "AffiliationID": "60025287", "AffiliationName": "Bone and Joint Research Group, Centre for Human Development, Stem Cells and Regeneration, Human Development and Health, University of Southampton Medical School"}, "54968431400": {"Name": "Purcell M.", "AuthorID": "54968431400", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, University Park, University of Nottingham"}, "7005110432": {"Name": "Howdle S.M.", "AuthorID": "7005110432", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, University Park, University of Nottingham"}, "7004564373": {"Name": "Shakesheff K.M.", "AuthorID": "7004564373", "AffiliationID": "100472251", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Orthopaedics and Musculoskeletal Science"}, "7006369437": {"Name": "Goodship A.", "AuthorID": "7006369437", "AffiliationID": "60000703", "AffiliationName": "Department of Histopathology, University Hospital Southampton"}, "7004735871": {"Name": "Blunn G.", "AuthorID": "7004735871", "AffiliationID": "60000703", "AffiliationName": "Department of Histopathology, University Hospital Southampton"}, "57220665600": {"Name": "Fowler D.", "AuthorID": "57220665600", "AffiliationID": "60000703", "AffiliationName": "Department of Histopathology, University Hospital Southampton"}}}
