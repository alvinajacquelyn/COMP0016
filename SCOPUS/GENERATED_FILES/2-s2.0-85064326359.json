Methods: An ethnographic study was conducted to understand the impact of bilateral GA secondary to AMD on daily functioning by observing regular activities performed at home and through semi-structured interviews. Eligible subjects had a definitive GA diagnosis, including presence of drusen, GA lesion size of at least one disc area in the better-seeing eye, and no other confounding ophthalmologic diagnosis. Data were collected via video recordings and field notes, and analyzed by coding video transcripts. Results: Functional impact domains affecting more than two of the 16 subjects from the United Kingdom, United States, or Germany were activities of daily living (difficulty reading, n = 16; driving, n = 12; and watching movies, television, or theater, n = 11), emotional (frustration, and fear of blindness, n = 7 each), social/leisure (interference with hobbies, n = 8, and diminished social activities, n = 4), physical (n = 4), and financial (n = 10). Subjects with a best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of 20/100 or better in the better-seeing eye (n = 10) reported similar functional impacts to those with a BCVA of worse than 20/100 in their better-seeing eye (n = 5). Conclusion: This study helps address gaps in patient-focused research into GA, which negatively impacts the day-to-day functioning of patients. Larger qualitative and quantitative studies are needed to quantify patient experiences and assess the correlation between BCVA score and impact of GA. Funding: F.
