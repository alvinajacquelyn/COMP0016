Here, the use of Diamond-like Carbon (DLC) interlayers between the substrate and the graphene is shown to offer the prospect of overcoming this problem. The DLC films used here, more properly known as a-C:H with \u223c25% hydrogen content, have been terminated with N or F moieties prior to graphene deposition. It is found that nitrogen terminations lead to an optical band gap shrinkage in the DLC, whilst fluorine groups reduce the DLC's surface energy. CVD monolayer graphene subsequently transferred to DLC, N terminated DLC, and F terminated DLC has then been studied with AFM, Raman and XPS analysis, and correlated with Hall effect measurements that give an insight into the heterostructures electrical properties. The results show that different terminations strongly affect the electronic properties of the graphene heterostructures. G-F-DLC samples were p-type and displayed considerably higher mobility than the other heterostructures, whilst G-N-DLC samples supported higher carrier densities, being almost metallic in character. Since it would be possible to locally pattern the distribution of these differing surface terminations, this work offers the prospect for 2D lateral control of the electronic properties of graphene layers for device applications.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Device application", "Diamond like carbon", "Electronic materials", "Electronic properties of graphene", "Hall effect measurement", "Hydrogen contents", "Other heterostructures", "Surface termination"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84924871239", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (miscellaneous)", "PHYS", "3101"]], "AuthorData": {"55825921200": {"Name": "Zhao F.", "AuthorID": "55825921200", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "London Centre for Nanotechnology, Electronic and Electrical Engineering Department, University College London"}, "57193966645": {"Name": "Afandi A.", "AuthorID": "57193966645", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "London Centre for Nanotechnology, Electronic and Electrical Engineering Department, University College London"}, "22992826600": {"Name": "Jackman R.B.", "AuthorID": "22992826600", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "London Centre for Nanotechnology, Electronic and Electrical Engineering Department, University College London"}}}
