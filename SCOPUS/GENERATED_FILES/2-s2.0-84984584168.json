The discretisation and evaluation is conducted by a commercial finite element package (ANSYS). The main difference to former models of the cochlea was the representation of the basilar membrane by a 3D elastic solid. The Young's moduli of this solid were modified to study their influence on the travelling wave. The lymph in the scala vestibuli and scala tympani was represented by a viscous and nearly incompressible fluid finite element approach. Our results show the maximum displacement for f = 2kHz at half of the length of the cochlea in accordance with former experiments. For low frequencies f <200 Hz nearly zero phase shifts were found, whereas for f =1 kHz it reaches values up to-12 cycles depending on the degree of orthotropy.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84984584168", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"6603555200": {"Name": "B\u00f6hnke F.", "AuthorID": "6603555200", "AffiliationID": "60019722", "AffiliationName": "Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Technical University of Munich"}, "56497157200": {"Name": "Semmelbauer S.", "AuthorID": "56497157200", "AffiliationID": "60019722", "AffiliationName": "Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Technical University of Munich"}, "16425864500": {"Name": "Marquardt T.", "AuthorID": "16425864500", "AffiliationID": "60011326, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Ear Institute, University College London"}}}
