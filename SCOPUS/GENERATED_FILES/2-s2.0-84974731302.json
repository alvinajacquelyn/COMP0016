Observational evidence suggests that influenza particularly predisposes children to bacterial complications. This study investigates general practitioners' (GPs') accounts of factors influencing their decision-making about antibiotic prescribing in the management of at-risk children with influenza-like illness (ILI). Design: Qualitative interview study using a maximum variation sample with thematic analysis through constant comparison. Setting: Semistructured telephone interviews with UK GPs using a case vignette of a child with comorbidities presenting with ILI. Participants: There were 41 GPs (41.5% men; 40 from England, 1 from Northern Ireland) with a range of characteristics including length of time in practice, paediatrics experience, practice setting and deprivation. Results: There was considerable uncertainty and variation in the way GPs responded to the case and difference of opinion about how long-term comorbidities should affect their antibiotic prescribing pattern. Factors influencing their decision included the child's case history and clinical examination; the GP's view of the parent's ability to self-manage; the GP's own confidence and experiences of managing sick children and assessment of individual versus abstract risk. GPs rarely mentioned potential influenza infection or asked about immunisation status. All said that they would want to see the child; views about delayed prescribing varied in relation to local health service provision including options for follow-up and paediatric services. Conclusions: The study demonstrates diagnostic uncertainty and wide variation in GP decision-making about prescribing antibiotics to children with comorbidity. Future guidelines might encourage consideration of a specific diagnosis such as influenza, and risk assessment tools could be developed to allow clinicians to quantify the levels of risk associated with different types of comorbidity. However, the wide range of clinical and non-clinical factors involved in decisionmaking during these consultations should also beconsidered in future guidelines.", "AuthorKeywords": ["PRIMARY CARE", "QUALITATIVE RESEARCH"], "IndexKeywords": ["Anti-Bacterial Agents", "Attitude of Health Personnel", "Child", "Clinical Decision-Making", "Female", "General Practitioners", "Humans", "Influenza, Human", "Interviews as Topic", "Male", "Practice Patterns, Physicians'", "Primary Health Care", "Qualitative Research", "Uncertainty", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84974731302", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"6507836354": {"Name": "Ashdown H.F.", "AuthorID": "6507836354", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Nuffield Department of Primary Care Health Sciences, University of Oxford"}, "26634173700": {"Name": "R\u00e4is\u00e4nen U.", "AuthorID": "26634173700", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Nuffield Department of Primary Care Health Sciences, University of Oxford"}, "38663813900": {"Name": "Wang K.", "AuthorID": "38663813900", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Nuffield Department of Primary Care Health Sciences, University of Oxford"}, "7003768248": {"Name": "Ziebland S.", "AuthorID": "7003768248", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Nuffield Department of Primary Care Health Sciences, University of Oxford"}, "6603975055": {"Name": "Harnden A.", "AuthorID": "6603975055", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Nuffield Department of Primary Care Health Sciences, University of Oxford"}, "53164478000": {"Name": "Perera-Salazar R.", "AuthorID": "53164478000", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Nuffield Department of Primary Care Health Sciences, University of Oxford"}, "7404164174": {"Name": "Yu L.M.", "AuthorID": "7404164174", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Nuffield Department of Primary Care Health Sciences, University of Oxford"}, "55814434300": {"Name": "Butler C.", "AuthorID": "55814434300", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Nuffield Department of Primary Care Health Sciences, University of Oxford"}, "57189702794": {"Name": "Carver T.T.", "AuthorID": "57189702794", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Nuffield Department of Primary Care Health Sciences, University of Oxford"}, "7006478127": {"Name": "Semple M.G.", "AuthorID": "7006478127", "AffiliationID": "60020661, 60172638", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Translational Medicine and National Institute for Health Research (NIHR), Health Protection Research Unit in Emerging and Zoonotic Infections, University of Liverpool"}, "57189234864": {"Name": "Mallett S.", "AuthorID": "57189234864", "AffiliationID": "60019702, 60033481", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Applied Health Sciences, College of Medical and Dental Sciences, University of Birmingham"}, "7006373221": {"Name": "Wolstenholme J.", "AuthorID": "7006373221", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Health Economics Research Centre, University of Oxford"}, "7201696810": {"Name": "Hay A.", "AuthorID": "7201696810", "AffiliationID": "60171764", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Academic Primary Care, School of Social and Community Medicine, University of Bristol"}, "7201984993": {"Name": "Little P.", "AuthorID": "7201984993", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "Primary Care and Population Sciences, University of Southampton"}, "15023021300": {"Name": "Moore M.", "AuthorID": "15023021300", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "Primary Care and Population Sciences, University of Southampton"}, "null": {"Name": null, "AuthorID": null, "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
