A detailed analysis of the internal structure of the wires is carried out, focusing on the stacking patterns of the molecules and the way side chains protrude from each molecular pillar and occupy the surrounding space. Coupled with dynamical studies that quantify the molecular mobility, this analysis helps draw a unified picture of the temporal behavior of the molecular wires.", "AuthorKeywords": ["graphene", "hexabenzocoronene", "molecular dynamics", "molecular nanowires", "simulations"], "IndexKeywords": ["Dynamical properties", "Empirical force fields", "Hexabenzocoronene", "Internal structure", "Molecular dynamics simulations", "Molecular mobility", "Molecular nanowires", "simulations"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84964407511", "SubjectAreas": [["Process Chemistry and Technology", "CENG", "1508"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"], ["Ceramics and Composites", "MATE", "2503"], ["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Surfaces, Coatings and Films", "MATE", "2508"]], "AuthorData": {"55578017900": {"Name": "Ziogos O.", "AuthorID": "55578017900", "AffiliationID": "60002947", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemical Engineering, National Technical University of Athens"}, "7005515056": {"Name": "Theodorou D.", "AuthorID": "7005515056", "AffiliationID": "60002947", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemical Engineering, National Technical University of Athens"}}}
