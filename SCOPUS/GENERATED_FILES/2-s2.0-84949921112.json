Produced with Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.Objective: To examine the epidemiology of Americans shooting themselves in the foot. Design: Data from the Firearm Injury Surveillance Study (1993e2010) collected using the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System were examined. Non-fatal firearm-related injuries were recorded during patients\u2019 initial emergency department visits. Setting: United States hospital emergency departments, 1993e2010. Participants: 69111 individuals admitted to US emergency departments after non-fatal firearm-related incidents. Main outcome measure: Demographic and incident characteristics of patients presenting with self-inflicted gunshot wounds to the foot. Results: Of the 69111 reported firearm-related injuries, 667 (1.0%) were self-inflicted gunshot wounds to the foot. Of these, 597 of the patients (89.6%) were men and 51.7% (345) were aged between 15 and 34 years. Patients generally presented with puncture wounds (265 patients, 39.7%), foreign bodies (164 patients, 24.6%) and bruised egos. Those who shot themselves in the foot were significantly more likely than individuals with other firearm-related injuries to be male (odds ratio [OR], 1.28) and married (OR, 2.6). As the festive season approached, the number of incidents increased; November and December were peak months for shooting oneself in the foot. Conclusions: The nature of and the circumstances surrounding self-inflicted gunshot wounds to the foot were unique when compared with other firearm-related injuries. Through the large-scale examination of the characteristics of these incidents, trends in the nature of Americans shooting themselves in the foot have been elucidated. Young married men are at particular risk of shooting themselves in the foot. Particular caution must be taken during the festive season to avoid being caught under the missing toe.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Female", "Firearms", "Foot Injuries", "Humans", "Incidence", "Male", "Retrospective Studies", "Risk Factors", "Seasons", "Self-Injurious Behavior", "United States", "Wounds, Gunshot", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84949921112", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"55948960700": {"Name": "Cosco T.", "AuthorID": "55948960700", "AffiliationID": "60009587, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Cambridge Institute of Public Health, University of Cambridge"}, "55370360000": {"Name": "King J.", "AuthorID": "55370360000", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Physiological Laboratory, University of Cambridge"}}}
