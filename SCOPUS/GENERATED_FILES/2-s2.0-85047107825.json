Recently, it has been shown that different number-related tasks also employ spatial attention shifts along with general cognitive processes. Here we investigated for the first time whether number line estimation and complex mental arithmetic recruit a common mechanism in healthy adults. Participants\u2019 performance in two-digit mental additions and subtractions using visual stimuli was compared with their performance in a mental bisection task using auditory numerical intervals. Results showed significant correlations between participants\u2019 performance in number line bisection and that in two-digit mental arithmetic operations, especially in additions, providing a first proof of a shared cognitive mechanism (or multiple shared cognitive mechanisms) between auditory number bisection and complex mental calculation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Mental number line", "Number bisection task", "Two-digit mental operations", "Verbal working memory"], "IndexKeywords": ["Acoustic Stimulation", "Adult", "Attention", "Cognition", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Mathematics", "Memory, Short-Term", "Mental Processes", "Photic Stimulation", "Problem Solving", "Visual Perception", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85047107825", "SubjectAreas": [["Experimental and Cognitive Psychology", "PSYC", "3205"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"], ["Artificial Intelligence", "COMP", "1702"]], "AuthorData": {"55735884100": {"Name": "Montefinese M.", "AuthorID": "55735884100", "AffiliationID": "60103766", "AffiliationName": "IRCCS San Camillo Hospital Foundation"}, "7006077078": {"Name": "Semenza C.", "AuthorID": "7006077078", "AffiliationID": "60103766", "AffiliationName": "IRCCS San Camillo Hospital Foundation"}}}
