However, we report in this paper that the joint Bayesian method, a successful classifier in this framework, suffers performance degradation due to its underuse of the expectation-maximization algorithm in its training phase. To rectify the underuse, we propose a new method termed advanced joint Bayesian (AJB). AJB has a good convergence property and achieves a higher verification rate than both the Joint Bayesian method and other state-of-the-art classifiers on the labeled faces in the wild face database.", "AuthorKeywords": ["expectation-maximization (EM)", "Face verification", "generative Bayesian models", "model training"], "IndexKeywords": ["Bayesian model", "Classifier design", "Convergence properties", "Expectation Maximization", "Expectation-maximization algorithms", "Face Verification", "Model training", "Performance degradation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84921377777", "SubjectAreas": [["Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality", "ENGI", "2213"], ["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"]], "AuthorData": {"55994014400": {"Name": "Liang Y.", "AuthorID": "55994014400", "AffiliationID": "60025278", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Intelligent Technology and Systems, Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University"}, "7401929138": {"Name": "Ding X.", "AuthorID": "7401929138", "AffiliationID": "60025278", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Intelligent Technology and Systems, Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University"}, "7202881908": {"Name": "Xue J.", "AuthorID": "7202881908", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Statistical Science, University College London"}}}
