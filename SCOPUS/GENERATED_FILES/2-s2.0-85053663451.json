The risk of metachronous neoplasia is reduced by ablation of residual BE by using radiofrequency ablation (RFA) or argon plasma coagulation (APC). These have not been compared directly. We aimed to recruit up to 100 patients with BE and HGD or T1A confirmed by ER over 1 year in 6 centers in a randomized pilot study. Methods: Randomization was 1:1 to RFA or APC (4 treatments allowed at 2-month intervals). Recruitment, retention, dysplasia clearance, clearance of benign BE, adverse events, healthcare costs, and quality of life by using EQ-5D, EORTC QLQ-C30, or OES18 were assessed up to the end of the trial at 12 months. Results: Of 171 patients screened, 76 were randomized to RFA (n = 36) or APC (n = 40). The mean age was 69.7 years, and 82% were male. BE was <5 cm (n = 27), 5 to 10 cm (n = 45), and >10 cm (n = 4). Sixty-five patients completed the trial. At 12 months, dysplasia clearance was RFA 79.4% and APC 83.8% (odds ratio [OR] 0.7; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.2-2.6); BE clearance was RFA 55.8%, and APC 48.3% (OR 1.4; 95% CI, 0.5-3.6). A total of 6.1% (RFA) and 13.3% (APC) had buried BE glands. Adverse events (including stricture rate after starting RFA 3/36 [8.3%] and APC 3/37 [8.1%]) and quality of life scores were similar, but RFA cost $27491 more per case than APC. Conclusion: This pilot study suggests similar efficacy and safety but a cost difference favoring APC. A fully powered non-inferiority trial is appropriate to confirm these findings.
