Circulating desmosine is a specific biomarker of elastin degradation. We investigated the association between plasma desmosine (pDES) and emphysema severity/progression, coronary artery calcium score (CACS) and mortality. pDES was measured in 1177 COPD patients and 110 healthy control subjects from two independent cohorts. Emphysema was assessed on chest computed tomography scans. Aortic arterial stiffness was measured as the aortic-femoral pulse wave velocity. pDES was elevated in patients with cardiovascular disease (p<0.005) and correlated with age (rho=0.39, p<0.0005), CACS (rho=0.19, p<0.0005) modified Medical Research Council dyspnoea score (rho=0.15, p<0.0005), 6-min walking distance (rho=-0.17, p<0.0005) and body mass index, airflow obstruction, dyspnoea, exercise capacity index (rho=0.10, p<0.01), but not with emphysema, emphysema progression or forced expiratory volume in 1 s decline. pDES predicted all-cause mortality independently of several confounding factors (p<0.005). In an independent cohort of 186 patients with COPD and 110 control subjects, pDES levels were higher in COPD patients with cardiovascular disease and correlated with arterial stiffness ( p<0.05). In COPD, excess elastin degradation relates to cardiovascular comorbidities, atherosclerosis, arterial stiffness, systemic inflammation and mortality, but not to emphysema or emphysema progression. pDES is a good biomarker of cardiovascular risk and mortality in COPD.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Biomarkers", "Body Composition", "Bronchodilator Agents", "Calcinosis", "Cardiovascular Diseases", "Case-Control Studies", "Coronary Vessels", "Desmosine", "Disease Progression", "Elastin", "Emphysema", "Female", "Forced Expiratory Volume", "Humans", "Inflammation", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive", "Pulmonary Emphysema", "Pulse Wave Analysis", "Respiratory Function Tests", "Risk Factors", "Smoking", "Vascular Stiffness"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84969785019", "SubjectAreas": [["Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine", "MEDI", "2740"]], "AuthorData": {"7005305609": {"Name": "Rabinovich R.A.", "AuthorID": "7005305609", "AffiliationID": "60017780", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Inflammation and Research, Edinburgh Lung and Environment Group Initiative (ELEGI)"}, "57189364147": {"Name": "Ranjit K.", "AuthorID": "57189364147", "AffiliationID": "60017780", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Inflammation and Research, Edinburgh Lung and Environment Group Initiative (ELEGI)"}, "7004359772": {"Name": "Drost E.", "AuthorID": "7004359772", "AffiliationID": "60017780", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Inflammation and Research, Edinburgh Lung and Environment Group Initiative (ELEGI)"}, "7005733436": {"Name": "Macnee W.", "AuthorID": "7005733436", "AffiliationID": "60017780", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Inflammation and Research, Edinburgh Lung and Environment Group Initiative (ELEGI)"}, "36544084500": {"Name": "Miller B.E.", "AuthorID": "36544084500", "AffiliationID": "60097308", "AffiliationName": "Respiratory Therapy Area Unit, GSK, King of Prussia"}, "6603373403": {"Name": "Tal-Singer R.", "AuthorID": "6603373403", "AffiliationID": "60097308", "AffiliationName": "Respiratory Therapy Area Unit, GSK, King of Prussia"}, "56531569200": {"Name": "Wrobel K.", "AuthorID": "56531569200", "AffiliationID": "60008877", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Institute, School of Medicine, University of Dundee"}, "8242997500": {"Name": "Huang J.T.J.", "AuthorID": "8242997500", "AffiliationID": "60008877", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Institute, School of Medicine, University of Dundee"}, "56409226600": {"Name": "Williams M.C.", "AuthorID": "56409226600", "AffiliationID": "60110825", "AffiliationName": "University/BHF Centre for Cardiovascular Science"}, "7201757920": {"Name": "Edwards L.D.", "AuthorID": "7201757920", "AffiliationID": "60095340", "AffiliationName": "PAREXEL International"}, "56892645500": {"Name": "Lomas D.A.", "AuthorID": "56892645500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Medical Sciences, University College London"}, "57202945380": {"Name": "Rennard S.I.", "AuthorID": "57202945380", "AffiliationID": "60004219", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Discovery Unit"}, "7101749378": {"Name": "Agust\u00ed A.", "AuthorID": "7101749378", "AffiliationID": "60102756, 60030315, 60001576, 60010814", "AffiliationName": "Hospital Clinic, Thorax Institute Servei de Pneumologia, IDIBAPS, Universitat de Barcelona and CIBER Enfermedades Respiratorias (CIBERES)"}, "34573970200": {"Name": "Vestbo J.", "AuthorID": "34573970200", "AffiliationID": "60120605", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Respiratory Medicine and Allergy, University Hospital South Manchester NHS Foundation Trust"}, "35395980800": {"Name": "Wouters E.F.M.", "AuthorID": "35395980800", "AffiliationID": "60018869", "AffiliationName": "Dept of Respiratory Medicine, Maastricht University Medical Centre"}, "55611345800": {"Name": "John M.", "AuthorID": "55611345800", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "Nottingham Respiratory Research Unit, School of Medicine, University of Nottingham"}, "7103238077": {"Name": "Bolton C.E.", "AuthorID": "7103238077", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "Nottingham Respiratory Research Unit, School of Medicine, University of Nottingham"}, "7006718817": {"Name": "Van Beek E.J.R.", "AuthorID": "7006718817", "AffiliationID": "115125720", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Research Imaging Centre"}, "6603825415": {"Name": "Murchison J.T.", "AuthorID": "6603825415", "AffiliationID": "60002975", "AffiliationName": "Dept of Radiology Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh"}}}
