At this time, the most useful is the light subunit of the neurofilament protein (NFL). This major structural component of myelinated axons is essential to maintain axonal caliber and to facilitate effective nerve conduction. CSF concentrations of NFL provide a sensitive marker of CNS injury in a number of neurological diseases, including HIV-related neuronal injury. Areas Covered: In this review, the authors describe CSF NFL concentrations across the spectrum of HIV-infection, from its early acute phase to severe immunosuppression, with and without neurological conditions, and with and without antiretroviral treatment (n = 516). Furthermore, in order to provide more precise estimates of age-related upper limits of CSF NFL concentrations, the authors present data from a large number (n = 359) of HIV-negative controls. Expert Commentary: Recently a new ultrasensitive diagnostic assay for quantification of NFL in plasma has been developed, providing a convenient way to assess neuronal damage without having to perform a lumbar puncture. This review also considers our current knowledge of plasma NFL in HIV CNS infection.", "AuthorKeywords": ["biomarker", "cerebrospinal fluid", "HIV", "neurodegeneration", "neurofilament light"], "IndexKeywords": ["Axons", "Biomarkers", "Demyelinating Diseases", "HIV Infections", "HIV-1", "Humans", "Neurofilament Proteins"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85021894583", "SubjectAreas": [["Pathology and Forensic Medicine", "MEDI", "2734"], ["Molecular Medicine", "BIOC", "1313"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"]], "AuthorData": {"7101627980": {"Name": "Yilmaz A.", "AuthorID": "7101627980", "AffiliationID": "60079626, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Biomedicine, Department of Infectious Diseases, University of Gothenburg"}, "20234417500": {"Name": "Hagberg L.", "AuthorID": "20234417500", "AffiliationID": "60079626, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Biomedicine, Department of Infectious Diseases, University of Gothenburg"}, "57201969798": {"Name": "Gissl\u00e9n M.", "AuthorID": "57201969798", "AffiliationID": "60079626, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Biomedicine, Department of Infectious Diseases, University of Gothenburg"}, "56415176000": {"Name": "Blennow K.", "AuthorID": "56415176000", "AffiliationID": "60031699", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Neurochemistry Laboratory, Sahlgrenska University Hospital"}, "6701454676": {"Name": "Zetterberg H.", "AuthorID": "6701454676", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "35479725000": {"Name": "Nilsson S.", "AuthorID": "35479725000", "AffiliationID": "60000990", "AffiliationName": "Mathematical Sciences, Chalmers University of Technology"}, "57213628929": {"Name": "Price R.W.", "AuthorID": "57213628929", "AffiliationID": "60023691", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, University of California San Francisco"}, "37015010800": {"Name": "Schouten J.", "AuthorID": "37015010800", "AffiliationID": "60138854, 60001157", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Academic Medical Center and Department of Global Health, Academic Medical Center, and Amsterdam Institute for Global Health and Development"}, "9278487100": {"Name": "Spudich S.", "AuthorID": "9278487100", "AffiliationID": "60005455", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Yale University"}, "47661632000": {"Name": "Underwood J.", "AuthorID": "47661632000", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infectious Diseases, Imperial College London"}}}
