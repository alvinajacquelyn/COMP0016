It is a consensus of the ISMRM Perfusion Study Group and the European ASL in Dementia consortium, both of whom met to reach this consensus in October 2012 in Amsterdam. Although ASL continues to undergo rapid technical development, we believe that current ASL methods are robust and ready to provide useful clinical information, and that a consensus statement on recommended implementations will help the clinical community to adopt a standardized approach. In this review, we describe the major considerations and trade-offs in implementing an ASL protocol and provide specific recommendations for a standard approach. Our conclusion is that as an optimal default implementation, we recommend pseudo-continuous labeling, background suppression, a segmented three-dimensional readout without vascular crushing gradients, and calculation and presentation of both label/control difference images and cerebral blood flow in absolute units using a simplified model.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Arterial spin labeling", "Cerebral blood flow", "Perfusion"], "IndexKeywords": ["Arterial spin labeling", "Background suppression", "Cerebral blood flow", "Clinical application", "Clinical information", "Difference images", "Perfusion", "Technical development", "Blood Flow Velocity", "Brain", "Cerebrovascular Circulation", "Dementia", "European Union", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Angiography", "Neurology", "Practice Guidelines as Topic", "Spin Labels"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84919839320", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"7005562785": {"Name": "Alsop D.C.", "AuthorID": "7005562785", "AffiliationID": "60002746, 60030058", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School"}, "7006351633": {"Name": "Detre J.A.", "AuthorID": "7006351633", "AffiliationID": "60006297", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology and Radiology, University of Pennsylvania"}, "7004309393": {"Name": "Golay X.", "AuthorID": "7004309393", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Brain Repair and Rehabilitation, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "7102455457": {"Name": "G\u00fcnther M.", "AuthorID": "7102455457", "AffiliationID": "60116242", "AffiliationName": "Mediri GmbH"}, "7003660124": {"Name": "Hendrikse J.", "AuthorID": "7003660124", "AffiliationID": "60032724", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, University Medical Center Utrecht"}, "6507222285": {"Name": "Hernandez-Garcia L.", "AuthorID": "6507222285", "AffiliationID": "60025778", "AffiliationName": "FMRI Laboratory, Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Michigan"}, "8386439700": {"Name": "Lu H.", "AuthorID": "8386439700", "AffiliationID": "60026695", "AffiliationName": "Advanced Imaging Research Center, UT Southwestern Medical Center"}, "7005993727": {"Name": "Macintosh B.J.", "AuthorID": "7005993727", "AffiliationID": "60029150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physical Sciences, Sunnybrook Research Institute"}, "6603675937": {"Name": "Parkes L.M.", "AuthorID": "6603675937", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Imaging Science, Institute of Population Health, University of Manchester"}, "56006797000": {"Name": "Smits M.", "AuthorID": "56006797000", "AffiliationID": "60032114", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Erasmus MC, University Medical Centre Rotterdam"}, "8148402200": {"Name": "Van Osch M.J.P.", "AuthorID": "8148402200", "AffiliationID": "60015618", "AffiliationName": "C.
