It can be treated with bypass surgery, but due to the limited availability of autologous grafts, there has been research into developing a completely tissue-engineered vascular graft. Our group has developed a small diameter, biodegradable nanocomposite graft which is non-thrombogenic and biostable. Objectives: This study looks at the eff ects of the growth factors, TGF-\u03b2 1 and BMP-4 on bone marrow-derived stem cell (BMSC) morphology on a POSS PCL scaff old. Materials and methods: BMSCs were seeded onto a new nanocomposite of POSS (polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane) and PCL (poly[caprolactone-urea]urethane) and TGF-\u03b2 1 and BMP-4 were used to induce diff erentiation of the cells to smooth muscle cells. The distribution of the cells was examined using confocal and electron microscopies and the phenotype of the cells was assessed using immunohistochemistry. Results: It was found that growth factor induction led to a decrease in cell growth on POSS PCL as compared to that of the control surface, and confocal microscopic analysis showed less cytoskeleton reorganization of these cells. After immunohistochemistry analysis, the BMSCs showed no diff erentiation to smooth muscle cells. Discussion: Growth factor induction on the static scaff old discs led to a change in morphology, with less spreading of the cells, a lower proliferation rate and no diff erentiation into SMCs. These fi ndings can be attributed to the POSS PCL being manufactured by a coagulation technique, resulting in a structure with low stiff ness.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bypass graft", "Congenital heart disease", "Growth factors", "Smooth muscle cells", "Tissue engineering"], "IndexKeywords": ["Biodegradable nanocomposites", "Bone marrowderived stem cells (BMSC)", "Bypass graft", "Congenital heart disease", "Growth factor", "Poss (polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane)", "Smooth muscle cells", "Tissue engineered vascular grafts", "Bone Marrow Cells", "Bone Morphogenetic Protein 4", "Cell Differentiation", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Myocytes, Smooth Muscle", "Nanocomposites", "Polyurethanes", "Stem Cells", "Tissue Scaffolds", "Transforming Growth Factor beta1"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84953875936", "SubjectAreas": [["Biotechnology", "BIOC", "1305"], ["Medicine (miscellaneous)", "MEDI", "2701"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"], ["Pharmaceutical Science", "PHAR", "3003"]], "AuthorData": {"57045782500": {"Name": "Lakhani H.A.", "AuthorID": "57045782500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Surgery and Interventional Science, Centre for Nanotechnology and Regenerative Medicine, University College London"}, "25635358300": {"Name": "De Mel A.", "AuthorID": "25635358300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Surgery and Interventional Science, Centre for Nanotechnology and Regenerative Medicine, University College London"}, "7005344804": {"Name": "Seifalian A.M.", "AuthorID": "7005344804", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Royal Free Hampstead NHS Trust Hospital"}}}
