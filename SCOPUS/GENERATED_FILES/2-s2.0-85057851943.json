The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of anatomic complexity on the efficiency of completion of defined stages of simulated carotid artery stenting as measured by VMA. Methods: Twenty interventionists each performed a standardized easy, medium, and difficult carotid artery stenting case in random order on an ANGIO Mentor (Simbionix, Airport City, Israel) simulator. Videos of all procedures were analyzed using VMA software, and performance was expressed in terms of two-dimensional guidewire tip trajectory distance (PL). Comparisons of PL were used to identify differences in cannulation performance of the participants between the three cases of varying difficulty. The procedure was subdivided into four procedural phases: arch navigation, common carotid artery (CCA) cannulation, external carotid manipulation, and carotid lesion crossing. Comparisons of PL were used to identify differences in performance between the three cases of varying difficulty for each of the procedural phases. Results: There were significant differences in PL in relation to anatomic complexity, with a stepwise increase in PL from easy to difficult cases: easy, median of 5000 pixels (interquartile range, 4075-5403 pixels); intermediate, 9059 (5974-14,553) pixels; difficult, 17,373 (11,495-26,594) pixels (P <.001). Similarly, during CCA cannulation, there was a stepwise increase in PL from easy to difficult cases: easy, 749 (603-1403) pixels; intermediate, 3274 (1544-8142) pixels; difficult, 8845 (5954-15,768) pixels (P <.001). There were no observed differences across the groups of anatomic difficulty for the phases of arch navigation, external carotid manipulation, and carotid lesion crossing. Conclusions: Increasing anatomic complexity leads to significant increases in PL of endovascular tools, in particular during CCA cannulation. This increase in tool movement may have a bearing on clinical outcome.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Anatomy", "Carotid", "Complexity", "Skill", "Video motion analysis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Angioplasty", "Carotid Stenosis", "Catheterization, Peripheral", "Clinical Competence", "Education, Medical, Graduate", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Motor Skills", "Prospective Studies", "Random Allocation", "Severity of Illness Index", "Simulation Training", "Stents", "Task Performance and Analysis", "Vascular Access Devices", "Video Recording"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85057851943", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"55575472700": {"Name": "Rolls A.E.", "AuthorID": "55575472700", "AffiliationID": "60111785, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "Imperial Vascular Unit, Imperial College Healthcare"}, "24345300300": {"Name": "Riga C.V.", "AuthorID": "24345300300", "AffiliationID": "60111785, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "Imperial Vascular Unit, Imperial College Healthcare"}, "57200121559": {"Name": "Rahim S.U.", "AuthorID": "57200121559", "AffiliationID": "60111785, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "Imperial Vascular Unit, Imperial College Healthcare"}, "6602660286": {"Name": "Hamady M.S.", "AuthorID": "6602660286", "AffiliationID": "60111785, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "Imperial Vascular Unit, Imperial College Healthcare"}, "7003912230": {"Name": "Cheshire N.J.", "AuthorID": "7003912230", "AffiliationID": "60111785, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "Imperial Vascular Unit, Imperial College Healthcare"}, "6701649965": {"Name": "Bicknell C.D.", "AuthorID": "6701649965", "AffiliationID": "60111785, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "Imperial Vascular Unit, Imperial College Healthcare"}, "55970309000": {"Name": "Willaert W.", "AuthorID": "55970309000", "AffiliationID": "101188573", "AffiliationName": "Department of Vascular Surgery, AZ Maria Middelares Hospitals"}, "22942703800": {"Name": "Van Herzeele I.", "AuthorID": "22942703800", "AffiliationID": "60068590", "AffiliationName": "Department of Thoracic and Vascular Surgery, Ghent University Hospital"}, "57203105770": {"Name": "Stoyanov D.V.", "AuthorID": "57203105770", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Image Computing and Department of Computer Science, University College London"}}}
