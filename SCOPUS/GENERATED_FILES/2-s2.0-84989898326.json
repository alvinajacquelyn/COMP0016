We analyzed data from 1,267 individuals without diabetes from five studies in Denmark, the Netherlands and the USA. Each study included between 5 and 11 measurements at different time points during a 2-h oral glucose tolerance test, resulting in 9,602 plasma glucose measurements. Latent class trajectories with a cubic specification for time were fitted to identify different patterns of plasma glucose change during the oral glucose tolerance test. Cardiometabolic risk factor profiles were compared between the identified groups. Using latent class trajectory analysis, five glucose response curves were identified. Despite similar fasting and 2-h values, glucose peaks and peak times varied greatly between groups, ranging from 7\u201312 mmol/L, and 35\u201370 min. The group with the lowest and earliest plasma glucose peak had the lowest estimated cardiovascular risk, while the group with the most delayed plasma glucose peak and the highest 2-h value had the highest estimated risk. One group, with normal fasting and 2-h values, exhibited an unusual profile, with the highest glucose peak and the highest proportion of smokers and men. The heterogeneity in glucose response curves and the distinct cardiometabolic risk profiles may reflect different underlying physiologies. Our results warrant more detailed studies to identify the source of the heterogeneity across the different phenotypes and whether these differences play a role in the development of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cardiometabolic risk", "Glucose response curve", "Latent class trajectory analysis", "Oral glucose tolerance test"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Blood Glucose", "Denmark", "Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2", "Fasting", "Female", "Glucose Intolerance", "Glucose Tolerance Test", "Hemoglobin A, Glycosylated", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Netherlands", "Sex Factors", "United States"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84989898326", "SubjectAreas": [["Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism", "MEDI", "2712"], ["Endocrinology", "BIOC", "1310"]], "AuthorData": {"55450518100": {"Name": "Hulman A.", "AuthorID": "55450518100", "AffiliationID": "60027332", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Informatics, University of Szeged"}, "57197805045": {"Name": "Witte D.R.", "AuthorID": "57197805045", "AffiliationID": "117938325", "AffiliationName": "Danish Diabetes Academy"}, "12239245000": {"Name": "Simmons R.K.", "AuthorID": "12239245000", "AffiliationID": "60025649, 60009969", "AffiliationName": "MRC Epidemiology Unit, University of Cambridge School of Clinical Medicine"}, "13404153300": {"Name": "Vistisen D.", "AuthorID": "13404153300", "AffiliationID": "60016428", "AffiliationName": "Steno Diabetes Center"}, "8577664900": {"Name": "F\u00e6rch K.", "AuthorID": "8577664900", "AffiliationID": "60016428", "AffiliationName": "Steno Diabetes Center"}, "7003480687": {"Name": "Tab\u00e1k A.G.", "AuthorID": "7003480687", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "7202456967": {"Name": "Dekker J.M.", "AuthorID": "7202456967", "AffiliationID": "60013243, 60001997", "AffiliationName": "EMGO+ Institute for Health and Care Research, VU Medical Center"}, "8203241800": {"Name": "Alssema M.", "AuthorID": "8203241800", "AffiliationID": "60018463", "AffiliationName": "Unilever Research and Development"}, "22942107200": {"Name": "Rutters F.", "AuthorID": "22942107200", "AffiliationID": "60013243, 60001997", "AffiliationName": "EMGO+ Institute for Health and Care Research, VU Medical Center"}, "55561203500": {"Name": "Koopman A.D.M.", "AuthorID": "55561203500", "AffiliationID": "60013243, 60001997", "AffiliationName": "EMGO+ Institute for Health and Care Research, VU Medical Center"}, "24366932200": {"Name": "Solomon T.P.J.", "AuthorID": "24366932200", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Metabolism and Systems Research, University of Birmingham"}, "7103099654": {"Name": "Kirwan J.P.", "AuthorID": "7103099654", "AffiliationID": "60021160", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathobiology, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic"}, "7401667966": {"Name": "Hansen T.", "AuthorID": "7401667966", "AffiliationID": "60013332, 60030840, 60006460", "AffiliationName": "Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Basic Metabolic Research, Section of Metabolic Genetics, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen"}, "57191675145": {"Name": "Jonsson A.", "AuthorID": "57191675145", "AffiliationID": "60013332, 60030840, 60006460", "AffiliationName": "Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Basic Metabolic Research, Section of Metabolic Genetics, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen"}, "6507800856": {"Name": "Gjesing A.P.", "AuthorID": "6507800856", "AffiliationID": "60013332, 60030840, 60006460", "AffiliationName": "Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Basic Metabolic Research, Section of Metabolic Genetics, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen"}, "35373396900": {"Name": "Pedersen O.", "AuthorID": "35373396900", "AffiliationID": "60013332, 60030840, 60006460", "AffiliationName": "Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Basic Metabolic Research, Section of Metabolic Genetics, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen"}, "36043939900": {"Name": "S\u00f8rensen T.I.A.", "AuthorID": "36043939900", "AffiliationID": "60083843, 60025840", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Preventive Medicine, Frederiksberg and Bispebjerg University Hospital, The Capital Region"}, "55530038800": {"Name": "Eiberg H.", "AuthorID": "55530038800", "AffiliationID": "60030840", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, University of Copenhagen"}, "7103121619": {"Name": "Astrup A.", "AuthorID": "7103121619", "AffiliationID": "60030840", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nutrition, Exercise and Sports, University of Copenhagen"}}}
