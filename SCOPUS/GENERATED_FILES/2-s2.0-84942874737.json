Slow oscillations of cerebral hemodynamics (0.05-0.003 Hz) are visible in multimodal neuromonitoring and may be analyzed to provide novel, surrogate measures of autoregulation. Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is an optical neuromonitoring technique, which shows promise for widespread clinical applicability because it is noninvasive and easily delivered across a wide range of clinical scenarios. The aim of this study is to identify the relationship between NIRS signal oscillations and multimodal neuromonitoring, examining the utility of near infrared derived indices of cerebrovascular reactivity. METHODS: Twenty-seven sedated, ventilated, brain-injured patients were included in this observational study. Intracranial pressure, transcranial Doppler-derived flow velocity in the middle cerebral artery, and ipsilateral cerebral NIRS variables were continuously monitored. Signals were compared using wavelet measures of phase and coherence to examine the spectral features involved in reactivity index calculations. Established indices of autoregulatory reserve such as the pressure reactivity index (PRx) and mean velocity index (Mx) and the NIRS indices such as total hemoglobin reactivity index (THx) and tissue oxygen reactivity index (TOx) were compared using correlation and Bland-Altman analysis. RESULTS: NIRS indices correlated significantly between PRx and THx (rs = 0.63, P < 0.001), PRx and TOx (r = 0.40, P = 0.04), and Mx and TOx (r = 0.61, P = 0.004) but not between Mx and THx (rs = 0.26, P = 0.28) and demonstrated wide limits between these variables: PRx and THx (bias, -0.06; 95% limits, -0.44 to 0.32) and Mx and TOx (bias, +0.15; 95% limits, -0.34 to 0.64). Analysis of slow-wave activity throughout the intracranial pressure, transcranial Doppler, and NIRS recordings revealed statistically significant interrelationships, which varied dynamically and were nonsignificant at frequencies <0.008 Hz. CONCLUSIONS: Although slow-wave activity in intracranial pressure, transcranial Doppler, and NIRS is significantly similar, it varies dynamically in both time and frequency, and this manifests as incomplete agreement between reactivity indices. Analysis informed by a priori knowledge of physiology underpinning NIRS variables combined with sophisticated analysis techniques has the potential to deliver noninvasive surrogate measures of autoregulation, guiding therapy.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Adult", "Blood Flow Velocity", "Blood Flow Velocity", "Brain Injuries", "Brain Injuries", "Cerebrovascular Circulation", "Cerebrovascular Circulation", "Female", "Female", "Hemodynamics", "Hemodynamics", "Homeostasis", "Homeostasis", "Humans", "Humans", "Hypnotics and Sedatives", "Hypnotics and Sedatives", "Intracranial Pressure", "Intracranial Pressure", "Male", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Middle Aged", "Middle Cerebral Artery", "Middle Cerebral Artery", "Monitoring, Physiologic", "Monitoring, Physiologic", "Oscillometry", "Oscillometry", "Predictive Value of Tests", "Predictive Value of Tests", "Regional Blood Flow", "Regional Blood Flow", "Respiration, Artificial", "Respiration, Artificial", "Spectroscopy, Near-Infrared", "Spectroscopy, Near-Infrared", "Time Factors", "Time Factors", "Ultrasonography, Doppler, Transcranial", "Ultrasonography, Doppler, Transcranial", "Wavelet Analysis", "Wavelet Analysis"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84942874737", "SubjectAreas": [["Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine", "MEDI", "2703"]], "AuthorData": {"55758036200": {"Name": "Highton D.", "AuthorID": "55758036200", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurocritical Care, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, University College London Hospitals NHS Trust"}, "57201244645": {"Name": "Ghosh A.", "AuthorID": "57201244645", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurocritical Care, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, University College London Hospitals NHS Trust"}, "55574239919": {"Name": "Smith M.", "AuthorID": "55574239919", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurocritical Care, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, University College London Hospitals NHS Trust"}, "6507301690": {"Name": "Tachtsidis I.", "AuthorID": "6507301690", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Bioengineering, University College London"}, "55390602700": {"Name": "Panovska-Griffiths J.", "AuthorID": "55390602700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Bioengineering, University College London"}, "7004171877": {"Name": "Elwell C.E.", "AuthorID": "7004171877", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Bioengineering, University College London"}}}
