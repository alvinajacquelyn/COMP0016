In vertebrates, the first neural processing steps generating orientation selectivity take place in the retina. Here, we dissect an orientation-selective circuit in the larval zebrafish retina and describe its underlying synaptic, cellular, and molecular mechanisms. We genetically identify a class of amacrine cells (ACs) with elongated dendritic arbors that show orientation tuning. Both selective optogenetic ablation of ACs marked by the cell-adhesion molecule Teneurin-3 (Tenm3) and pharmacological interference with their function demonstrate that these cells are critical components for orientation selectivity in retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) by being a source of tuned GABAergic inhibition. Moreover, our morphological analyses reveal that Tenm3+ ACs and orientation-selective RGCs co-stratify their dendrites in the inner plexiform layer, and that Tenm3+ ACs require Tenm3 to acquire their correct dendritic stratification. Finally, we show that orientation tuning is present also among bipolar cell presynaptic terminals. Our results define a neural circuit underlying orientation selectivity in the vertebrate retina and characterize cellular and molecular requirements for its assembly.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Nerve Tissue Proteins", "Orientation", "Retinal Ganglion Cells", "Zebrafish", "Zebrafish Proteins"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84978081086", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"]], "AuthorData": {"55910922000": {"Name": "Antinucci P.", "AuthorID": "55910922000", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Developmental Neurobiology, King's College London, Guy's Campus"}, "55837625400": {"Name": "Suleyman O.", "AuthorID": "55837625400", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Developmental Neurobiology, King's College London, Guy's Campus"}, "6603046161": {"Name": "Monfries C.", "AuthorID": "6603046161", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Developmental Neurobiology, King's College London, Guy's Campus"}, "6602828549": {"Name": "Hindges R.", "AuthorID": "6602828549", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Developmental Neurobiology, King's College London, Guy's Campus"}}}
