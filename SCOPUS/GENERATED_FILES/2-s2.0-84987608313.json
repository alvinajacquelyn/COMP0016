All previous examples rely on a photoisomerisation, ring-closing or dimerization. We show that photoreduction of a perylene bisimide gelator results in the formation of a stable radical anion. The formation of the radical anion results in a change in the packing of the perylene bisimides in the self-assembled aggregates, leading to a change in fibrous network and an increase in the rheological properties of the gels. An increase in the rheological properties is extremely rare for a photoresponsive gel; normally, irradiation results in a gel-to-sol transition, and the gel falling apart. As the radical anion decays, which takes several hours in air, the original gel properties are restored. This photoreduction can be cycled many times. Finally, we show that the mechanical properties are different between irradiated and nonirradiated sections in a patterned gel.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Fibrous networks", "Gel properties", "Low molecular weight", "Perylene bisimides", "Photo-reduction", "Photo-responsive", "Radical anions", "Rheological property"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84987608313", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"], ["Materials Chemistry", "MATE", "2505"]], "AuthorData": {"55619416900": {"Name": "Draper E.", "AuthorID": "55619416900", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Liverpool"}, "55015893700": {"Name": "Adams D.", "AuthorID": "55015893700", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Liverpool"}, "6602750161": {"Name": "Schweins R.", "AuthorID": "6602750161", "AffiliationID": "60007109", "AffiliationName": "Institut Laue-Langevin, Large Scale Structures Group"}, "8541918100": {"Name": "Akhtar R.", "AuthorID": "8541918100", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Materials and Structures, School of Engineering, University of Liverpool"}, "57191156932": {"Name": "Groves P.", "AuthorID": "57191156932", "AffiliationID": "60016418", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of York"}, "6603757123": {"Name": "Chechik V.", "AuthorID": "6603757123", "AffiliationID": "60016418", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of York"}, "6507121537": {"Name": "Zwijnenburg M.", "AuthorID": "6507121537", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}}}
