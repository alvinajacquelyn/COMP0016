An important epithelial product is the collectin Surfactant Protein D (SP-D). We found that SP-D concentrations increased in the lung following Nippostrongylus brasiliensis infection; this increase was dependent on key components of the type 2 immune response. We carried out loss and gain of function studies of SP-D to establish if SP-D was required for optimal immunity to the parasite. N. brasiliensis infection of SP-D-/- mice resulted in profound impairment of host innate immunity and ability to resolve infection. Raising pulmonary SP-D levels prior to infection enhanced parasite expulsion and type 2 immune responses, including increased numbers of IL-13 producing type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2), elevated expression of markers of alternative activation by alveolar macrophages (alvM) and increased production of the type 2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-13. Adoptive transfer of alvM from SP-D-treated parasite infected mice into na\u00efve recipients enhanced immunity to N. brasiliensis. Protection was associated with selective binding by the SP-D carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) to L4 parasites to enhance their killing by alvM. These findings are the first demonstration that the collectin SP-D is an essential component of host innate immunity to helminths.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Epithelial Cells", "Immunity, Innate", "Interleukin-13", "Interleukin-4", "Lung", "Macrophages, Alveolar", "Mice", "Nippostrongylus", "Pulmonary Surfactant-Associated Protein D", "Strongylida Infections"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84959564425", "SubjectAreas": [["Parasitology", "IMMU", "2405"], ["Microbiology", "IMMU", "2404"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Virology", "IMMU", "2406"]], "AuthorData": {"56628268400": {"Name": "Thawer S.", "AuthorID": "56628268400", "AffiliationID": "60000356, 60032694", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Infectious Disease and Molecular Medicine, International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology and Division of Immunology, University of Cape Town"}, "56089523400": {"Name": "Auret J.", "AuthorID": "56089523400", "AffiliationID": "60000356, 60032694", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Infectious Disease and Molecular Medicine, International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology and Division of Immunology, University of Cape Town"}, "56560891800": {"Name": "Chetty A.", "AuthorID": "56560891800", "AffiliationID": "60000356, 60032694", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Infectious Disease and Molecular Medicine, International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology and Division of Immunology, University of Cape Town"}, "57202479045": {"Name": "Smith K.", "AuthorID": "57202479045", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Infection and Immunity, University of Cardiff"}, "55843942200": {"Name": "Darby M.", "AuthorID": "55843942200", "AffiliationID": "60000356, 60032694", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Infectious Disease and Molecular Medicine, International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology and Division of Immunology, University of Cape Town"}, "7005215644": {"Name": "Brombacher F.", "AuthorID": "7005215644", "AffiliationID": "60000356, 60032694", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Infectious Disease and Molecular Medicine, International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology and Division of Immunology, University of Cape Town"}, "6504544319": {"Name": "Horsnell W.", "AuthorID": "6504544319", "AffiliationID": "60000356, 60032694", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Infectious Disease and Molecular Medicine, International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology and Division of Immunology, University of Cape Town"}, "24169832100": {"Name": "Schnoeller C.", "AuthorID": "24169832100", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Life Sciences, Imperial College London"}, "57149824400": {"Name": "Roberts L.", "AuthorID": "57149824400", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Life Sciences, Imperial College London"}, "7006441518": {"Name": "Selkirk M.", "AuthorID": "7006441518", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Life Sciences, Imperial College London"}, "55435435700": {"Name": "Mackay R.", "AuthorID": "55435435700", "AffiliationID": "60025225, 60021722", "AffiliationName": "Clinical & Experimental Sciences Academic Unit, Southampton General Hospital, University of Southampton"}, "35449178600": {"Name": "Madsen J.", "AuthorID": "35449178600", "AffiliationID": "60025225, 60021722", "AffiliationName": "Clinical & Experimental Sciences Academic Unit, Southampton General Hospital, University of Southampton"}, "7202405777": {"Name": "Clark H.", "AuthorID": "7202405777", "AffiliationID": "60025225, 60021722", "AffiliationName": "Clinical & Experimental Sciences Academic Unit, Southampton General Hospital, University of Southampton"}, "56884397100": {"Name": "Whitwell H.", "AuthorID": "56884397100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Proteomics, Institute for Women\u2019s Health, University College London"}, "7004011904": {"Name": "Timms J.", "AuthorID": "7004011904", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Proteomics, Institute for Women\u2019s Health, University College London"}}}
