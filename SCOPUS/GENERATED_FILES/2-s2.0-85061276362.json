However poor photoprotection is thought to be widespread. Purpose This study examines the influences on photoprotection behaviours in adults with XP. Design Inductive qualitative study with semistructured interviews. Analysis employed a framework approach. Setting National sample recruited through a specialist XP centre in London. Methods Semistructured interviews at patients' homes. All transcripts were coded and themes charted for each participant. Comparisons within and across cases identified common themes and differing motivations and approaches to photoprotection. Credibility of interpretations assessed through patient/carer input and clinic adherence scores. Participants 25 adults (17 male, eight female) aged 16-63 years with diagnosed XP attending a specialist centre. 18 lived outside London. Results Awareness of risks of ultraviolet radiation (UVR) and photoprotection was high. However, photoprotection behaviours varied according to perceived necessity and concerns. Three behavioural responses were identified: (1) 'dominated' by planning and routines to achieve a high level of photoprotection with significant activity restrictions and psychosocial impacts. (2) 'resistant' to photoprotection with priority given to avoiding an illness identity and enjoying a normal life. (3) Photoprotection' integrated' with an individual's life with little psychosocial impact. These responses were influenced by illness, personal and contextual factors including age, life stage and social support. Only the 'integrated' group achieved an equilibrium between perceived 'necessity' and 'concerns'. Conclusions The personal balance between perceived risks of UVR and social/psychological 'concerns' led to differing behavioural responses and contributes to an understanding of adaptation and normalisation in chronic illness. The study will also inform a series of individualised behavioural interventions to reduce measured UVR exposure among people with XP that are potentially applicable to other conditions with high risks of skin cancer.", "AuthorKeywords": ["adherence", "adult dermatology", "health behaviours", "photoprotection", "qualitative research"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Female", "Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Perception", "Protective Clothing", "Qualitative Research", "Risk", "Skin Neoplasms", "Sunburn", "Sunscreening Agents", "United Kingdom", "Xeroderma Pigmentosum", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85061276362", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"7403025385": {"Name": "Morgan M.", "AuthorID": "7403025385", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "School of Cancer and Pharmaceutical Sciences, King's College London"}, "57192894962": {"Name": "Anderson R.", "AuthorID": "57192894962", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "School of Cancer and Pharmaceutical Sciences, King's College London"}, "6602567226": {"Name": "Walburn J.", "AuthorID": "6602567226", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "School of Cancer and Pharmaceutical Sciences, King's College London"}, "7101645313": {"Name": "Weinman J.", "AuthorID": "7101645313", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "School of Cancer and Pharmaceutical Sciences, King's College London"}, "6603148339": {"Name": "Sarkany R.", "AuthorID": "6603148339", "AffiliationID": "60005518", "AffiliationName": "National Xeroderma Pigmentosum Service, Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
