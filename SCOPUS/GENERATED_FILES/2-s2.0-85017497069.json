Brain Pathology published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of International Society of NeuropathologyAdamantinomatous craniopharyngioma (ACP) is the commonest tumor of the sellar region in childhood. Two genetically engineered mouse models have been developed and are giving valuable insights into ACP biology. These models have identified novel pathways activated in tumors, revealed an important function of paracrine signalling and extended conventional theories about the role of organ-specific stem cells in tumorigenesis. In this review, we summarize these mouse models, what has been learnt, their limitations and open questions for future research. We then discussed how these mouse models may be used to test novel therapeutics against potentially targetable pathways recently identified in human ACP.", "AuthorKeywords": ["craniopharyngioma", "mouse model"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Animals, Genetically Modified", "Craniopharyngioma", "Disease Models, Animal", "Humans", "Mice", "Pituitary Neoplasms"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85017497069", "SubjectAreas": [["Pathology and Forensic Medicine", "MEDI", "2734"], ["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"57079790300": {"Name": "Apps J.R.", "AuthorID": "57079790300", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Developmental Biology and Cancer, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "6603565499": {"Name": "Martinez-Barbera J.P.", "AuthorID": "6603565499", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Developmental Biology and Cancer, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, University College London"}}}
