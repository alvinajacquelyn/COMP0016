The article suggests a conceptual model for recognising risk within professional learning opportunities and skills for facilitators. Data were generated from digital audio recordings of professional development sessions and semi-structured interviews. Data were analysed using a grounded theory approach. Data analysis revealed attributes for facilitators which enabled or determined their ability to manage risk. Extracts from transcripts illustrate the nature of risk and participant perception. Implications for facilitators of professional learning to support learners through their transformative learning journey are discussed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["cognitive dissonance", "facilitator", "risk", "teacher professional development", "transformative learning"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84963555122", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"]], "AuthorData": {"57188813461": {"Name": "Ince A.", "AuthorID": "57188813461", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "Learning and Leadership Department, UCL Institute of Education"}}}
