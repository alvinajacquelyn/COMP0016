In this study, cisplatin was successfully encapsulated with high efficiency (>. 70%) in poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) polymeric nanoparticles by using electrohydrodynamic atomization (EHDA) where applied voltage and solution flow rate as well as the concentration of cisplatin and polymer were varied to control the size of the particles. Thus, nanoparticles were produced with three different drug:polymer ratios (2.5, 5 and 10 wt% cisplatin). It was shown that smaller nanoparticles were produced with 10 wt% cisplatin. Furthermore, these demonstrated the best sustained release (smallest burst release). By fitting the experimental data with various kinetic models it was concluded that the release is dependent upon the particle morphology and the drug concentration. Thus, these particles have significant potential for cisplatin delivery with controlled dosage and release period that are crucial chemotherapy parameters.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cancer chemotherapy", "Cisplatin delivery", "Controlled release", "Electrohydrodynamic atomization", "Nanoparticle"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cancer Chemotherapy", "Cis-platin", "Controlled release", "Electrohydrodynamic atomization", "Particle morphologies", "Poly lactic-co-glycolic acid", "Polymeric nanoparticles", "Solution flow rate", "Antineoplastic Agents", "Cisplatin", "Drug Delivery Systems", "Glycols", "Humans", "Lactic Acid", "Nanoparticles", "Particle Size", "Polyglycolic Acid"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84973438894", "SubjectAreas": [["Bioengineering", "CENG", "1502"], ["Medicine (miscellaneous)", "MEDI", "2701"], ["Molecular Medicine", "BIOC", "1313"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Pharmaceutical Science", "PHAR", "3003"]], "AuthorData": {"55175510700": {"Name": "Parhizkar M.", "AuthorID": "55175510700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "7006247915": {"Name": "Edirisinghe M.", "AuthorID": "7006247915", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "55989472400": {"Name": "Reardon P.", "AuthorID": "55989472400", "AffiliationID": "60013985, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Biomaterials and Tissue Engineering, UCL Eastman Dental Institute, University College London"}, "26643634100": {"Name": "Knowles J.", "AuthorID": "26643634100", "AffiliationID": "60013985, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Biomaterials and Tissue Engineering, UCL Eastman Dental Institute, University College London"}, "42060918500": {"Name": "Browning R.", "AuthorID": "42060918500", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Biomedical Engineering, Department of Engineering Science, University of Oxford"}, "8782679600": {"Name": "Stride E.", "AuthorID": "8782679600", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Biomedical Engineering, Department of Engineering Science, University of Oxford"}, "57189626230": {"Name": "Barbara P.", "AuthorID": "57189626230", "AffiliationID": "60109234, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Cancer Institute, Department of Oncology, University College London"}, "7005517632": {"Name": "Harker A.", "AuthorID": "7005517632", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}}}
