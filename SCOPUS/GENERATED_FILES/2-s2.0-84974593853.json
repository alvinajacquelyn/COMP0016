This study quantifies the changes in the neuronal membrane elasticity induced by treatment with the two most common A\u03b2 isoforms found in AD brains: A\u03b240 and A\u03b242. Using quantitative atomic force microscopy (AFM), we measured for the first time the static elastic modulus of living primary hippocampal neurons treated with pre-aggregated A\u03b240 and A\u03b242 soluble species. Our AFM results demonstrate changes in the elasticity of young, mature and aged neurons treated for a short time with the two A\u03b2 species pre-aggregated for 2 hours. Neurons aging under stress conditions, showing aging hallmarks, are the most susceptible to amyloid binding and show the largest decrease in membrane stiffness upon A\u03b2 treatment. Membrane stiffness defines the way in which cells respond to mechanical forces in their environment and has been shown to be important for processes such as gene expression, ion-channel gating and neurotransmitter vesicle transport. Thus, one can expect that changes in neuronal membrane elasticity might directly induce functional changes related to neurodegeneration.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Amyloid beta-Peptides", "Animals", "Cell Membrane", "Cell Survival", "Cells, Cultured", "Cellular Senescence", "Elastic Modulus", "Hippocampus", "Humans", "Mice", "Microscopy, Atomic Force", "Neurons", "Peptide Fragments", "Protein Multimerization", "Rats"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84974593853", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"53165151500": {"Name": "Ungureanu A.A.", "AuthorID": "53165151500", "AffiliationID": "60070034", "AffiliationName": "Imec"}, "7005506089": {"Name": "Van Haesendonck C.", "AuthorID": "7005506089", "AffiliationID": "60025063", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, KU Leuven"}, "9639607600": {"Name": "Bartic C.", "AuthorID": "9639607600", "AffiliationID": "60070034", "AffiliationName": "Imec"}, "35885501300": {"Name": "Krylychkina O.", "AuthorID": "35885501300", "AffiliationID": "60070034", "AffiliationName": "Imec"}, "8504529000": {"Name": "Braeken D.", "AuthorID": "8504529000", "AffiliationID": "60070034", "AffiliationName": "Imec"}, "54910526200": {"Name": "Benilova I.", "AuthorID": "54910526200", "AffiliationID": "60019793, 60031069", "AffiliationName": "VIB Center for the Biology of Diseases, ON 4 Campus Gasthuisberg"}, "7006241978": {"Name": "De Strooper B.", "AuthorID": "7006241978", "AffiliationID": "60019793, 60031069", "AffiliationName": "VIB Center for the Biology of Diseases, ON 4 Campus Gasthuisberg"}, "57207498146": {"Name": "Dotti C.G.", "AuthorID": "57207498146", "AffiliationID": "60018505, 60006754", "AffiliationName": "CSIC, Centro de Biolog\u00eda Molecular Severo Ochoa, Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Madrid Campus Cantoblanco"}}}
