System managers deploy their resources with the aim of maintaining target levels of these attributes in the presence of reactive threats. Information stewardship is the challenge of maintaining the sustainability and resilience of the security attributes of (complex, interconnected, multi-agent) information ecosystems. In this paper, we present, in the tradition of public economics, a model of stewardship which addresses directly the question of resilience. We model attacker-target-steward behaviour in a fully endogenous Nash equilibrium setting. We analyse the occurrence of externalities across targets and assess the steward's ability to internalise these externalities under varying informational assumptions. We apply and simulate this model in the case of a critical national infrastructure example.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Information security", "Regulation", "Strategic behaviour", "System resilience"], "IndexKeywords": ["Information ecosystems", "Nash equilibria", "National infrastructure", "Public economics", "Regulation", "Security attributes", "Strategic behaviour", "System resiliences"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85057432537", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"], ["Modeling and Simulation", "MATH", "2611"], ["Management Science and Operations Research", "DECI", "1803"], ["Information Systems and Management", "DECI", "1802"]], "AuthorData": {"6603594047": {"Name": "Ioannidis C.", "AuthorID": "6603594047", "AffiliationID": "60116225", "AffiliationName": "Aston Business School, Aston University"}, "57207511534": {"Name": "Pym D.", "AuthorID": "57207511534", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Dept. of Computer Science"}, "56067715400": {"Name": "Williams J.", "AuthorID": "56067715400", "AffiliationID": "60112747", "AffiliationName": "Durham University Business School"}, "26666666400": {"Name": "Gheyas I.", "AuthorID": "26666666400", "AffiliationID": "60112747", "AffiliationName": "Durham University Business School"}}}
