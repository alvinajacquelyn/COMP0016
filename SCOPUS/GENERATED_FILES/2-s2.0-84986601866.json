Methods: Published screening marker parameters and Monte Carlo simulation were used to calculate detection rates (DR\u2019s) and risk cut-off levels for specified false-positive rates (FPR\u2019s), and DR\u2019s and FPR\u2019s for specified risk cut-offs. We compared this screening performance with that based on all women having Integrated tests. Results: Sequential Integrated DS screening detects 71% of DS pregnancies at the first trimester stage at a 0.5% FPR. For an overall 2% FPR, the DS DR is 92%, the same screening performance as the Integrated test performed on all women. Sequential Integrated T18 and T13 screening detects 70% of T18 and 53% of T13 pregnancies at the first trimester stage at a 0.05% FPR for each. The overall T18 and T13 DR\u2019s are 96% and 72% respectively at 0.2% FPR, the same screening performance as with Integrated tests performed on all women. Increasing the overall FPR\u2019s does not materially increase the DR\u2019s for any of the three disorders. Conclusion: The performance of sequential Integrated screening is similar to the performance if all women have an Integrated test, but has the advantage of identifying most DS, T18, and T13 pregnancies a few weeks earlier.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Down\u2019s syndrome", "Edwards\u2019 syndrome", "Integrated test", "Patau\u2019s syndrome", "Screening", "Sequential integrated screening", "Trisomy 13", "Trisomy 18", "Trisomy 21"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Biomarkers", "Down Syndrome", "Female", "Humans", "Monte Carlo Method", "Predictive Value of Tests", "Pregnancy", "Pregnancy Trimester, First", "Prenatal Diagnosis", "Trisomy 13 Syndrome", "Trisomy 18 Syndrome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84986601866", "SubjectAreas": [["Health Policy", "MEDI", "2719"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"14027999700": {"Name": "Bestwick J.P.", "AuthorID": "14027999700", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Wolfson Institute of Preventive Medicine, Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London"}, "57203046820": {"Name": "Wald N.J.", "AuthorID": "57203046820", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Wolfson Institute of Preventive Medicine, Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London"}}}
