Multiagent Router Throttling is a novel approach to defend against DDoS attacks where multiple reinforcement learning agents are installed on a set of routers and learn to rate-limit or throttle traffic towards a victim server. The focus of this paper is on online learning and scalability. We propose an approach that incorporates task decomposition, team rewards and a form of reward shaping called difference rewards. One of the novel characteristics of the proposed system is that it provides a decentralised coordinated response to the DDoS problem, thus being resilient to DDoS attacks themselves. The proposed system learns remarkably fast, thus being suitable for online learning. Furthermore, its scalability is successfully demonstrated in experiments involving 1000 learning agents. We compare our approach against a baseline and a popular state-of-the-art throttling technique from the network security literature and show that the proposed approach is more effective, adaptive to sophisticated attack rate dynamics and robust to agent failures.", "AuthorKeywords": ["DDoS attacks", "decentralised coordination", "distributed control", "network security"], "IndexKeywords": ["DDoS Attack", "Decentralised", "Distributed control", "Distributed denial of service attack", "Distributed reinforcement learning", "Reinforcement learning agent", "Router throttling", "Task decomposition"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84943198439", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Human-Computer Interaction", "COMP", "1709"], ["Artificial Intelligence", "COMP", "1702"]], "AuthorData": {"55670857800": {"Name": "Malialis K.", "AuthorID": "55670857800", "AffiliationID": "60016418", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University of York"}, "37107376400": {"Name": "Devlin S.", "AuthorID": "37107376400", "AffiliationID": "60016418", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University of York"}, "6603157921": {"Name": "Kudenko D.", "AuthorID": "6603157921", "AffiliationID": "60016418", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University of York"}}}
