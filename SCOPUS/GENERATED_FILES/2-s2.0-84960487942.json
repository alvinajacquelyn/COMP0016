The composite ceramic has good thermochemical stability up to 1500 \u00b0C. The thermal conductivity of composite ceramic is circa. 1.0 W/m\u00b7K at ambient temperature and the coefficients of thermal expansion are very stable and comparable to (Zr0.92Y0.08)O1.96 about 10.7 \u00d7 10-6 K-1 at 1223 K. The sintering resistance and mechanical properties become better after being dispersed. Therefore, the new ceramic composite synthesized by hybrid sol-gel method can be a promising candidate as a thermal barrier material on Ni-based superalloy.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Ceramics", "Composites", "Hybrid sol-gel", "Thermal barrier coatings", "Thermal conductivity"], "IndexKeywords": ["Ceramic composites", "Ceramics", "Coefficients of thermal expansions", "Hybrid sol-gel", "Ni-based superalloys", "Sintering resistance", "Thermal barrier materials", "Thermo-chemical stability"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84960487942", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Mechanics of Materials", "ENGI", "2211"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"], ["Metals and Alloys", "MATE", "2506"]], "AuthorData": {"57216282924": {"Name": "Zhang P.", "AuthorID": "57216282924", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute for Materials Discovery, University College London, Roberts Building"}, "57203183054": {"Name": "Choy K.L.", "AuthorID": "57203183054", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute for Materials Discovery, University College London, Roberts Building"}}}
