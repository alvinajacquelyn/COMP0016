The aims of this study were to evaluate the relation of PRC to (i) portal hypertension, (ii) degree of liver dysfunction, and (iii) survival. Methods: Plasma renin concentration (range 2.8\u201339.9 \u03bcU/mL) was measured after 30 min in supine position. Also, hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG), Child\u2013Pugh (CPS), model for end-stage liver disease scores and transient elastography values (TE, Fibroscan) were evaluated at this time. Mortality was recorded during follow-up. Results: One hundred fifty cirrhotic patients (age 55 \u00b1 11 years; 73% male; CPS A 41.3%/B 41.3%/C 17.3%) were included. Mean HVPG was 16.6 \u00b1 6.5 mmHg. Median PRC according to CPS was A 15.45 \u03bcU/mL (95%CI 1.56\u2013261.5), B 37.3 \u03bcU/mL (95%CI 4.29\u20131317.65), and C 175.3 \u03bcU/mL (95%CI 5.3\u20135684; P < 0.001). In patients with clinical significant portal hypertension (HVPG \u2265 10 mmHg, n = 123) median PRC was 31.2 \u03bcU/mL (95%CI 2.76\u20131345.4), in those without was 13.7 \u03bcU/mL (95%CI 2.7\u2013428.2; P = 0.009). Significantly higher TE values (33.2 [13\u201375] vs 59.65 kPa [14.5\u201375]; P = 0.014) were found in patients with elevated PRC. Median follow up was 711 days (95%CI 24\u20131152). Twenty-two (36.1%) of the 61 patients with elevated PRC and 11 of the 89 (12.4%) with normal PRC died (P = 0.001). Median PRC was significantly higher in patients that died (83.6 \u03bcU/mL [3.39\u20134451.9] vs 21.5 \u03bcU/mL [2.6\u20131197.9]; P = 0.001). Elevated PRC (P = 0.005; HR 3.36; 95%CI 1.46\u20137.85), hepatocellular carcinoma (P < 0.001; HR 10.68; 95%CI 3.64\u201331.3), CPS B (P = 0.013; HR 3.69; 95%CI 1.31\u201310.4) and CPS C (P = 0.008; HR 5.36; 95%CI 1.54\u201318.62) emerged as independent risk factors for mortality. Conclusions: In cirrhotic patients PRC correlates with the severity of portal hypertension and liver dysfunction. Moreover, elevated PRC represents an independent risk factor for mortality.", "AuthorKeywords": ["ascites", "cirrhosis", "CSPH", "mortality", "renin"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Biomarkers", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Humans", "Hypertension, Portal", "Liver", "Liver Cirrhosis", "Liver Function Tests", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Renin", "Risk Factors", "Severity of Illness Index"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85008457454", "SubjectAreas": [["Hepatology", "MEDI", "2721"], ["Gastroenterology", "MEDI", "2715"]], "AuthorData": {"56521656600": {"Name": "Paternostro R.", "AuthorID": "56521656600", "AffiliationID": "60011394", "AffiliationName": "Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Department of Internal Medicine III, Medical University of Vienna"}, "24315181000": {"Name": "Reiberger T.", "AuthorID": "24315181000", "AffiliationID": "60011394", "AffiliationName": "Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Department of Internal Medicine III, Medical University of Vienna"}, "55369068500": {"Name": "Mandorfer M.", "AuthorID": "55369068500", "AffiliationID": "60011394", "AffiliationName": "Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Department of Internal Medicine III, Medical University of Vienna"}, "55224913200": {"Name": "Schwarzer R.", "AuthorID": "55224913200", "AffiliationID": "60011394", "AffiliationName": "Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Department of Internal Medicine III, Medical University of Vienna"}, "35485391200": {"Name": "Schwabl P.", "AuthorID": "35485391200", "AffiliationID": "60011394", "AffiliationName": "Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Department of Internal Medicine III, Medical University of Vienna"}, "36344590600": {"Name": "Bota S.", "AuthorID": "36344590600", "AffiliationID": "60011394", "AffiliationName": "Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Department of Internal Medicine III, Medical University of Vienna"}, "7004157033": {"Name": "Peck-Radosavljevic M.", "AuthorID": "7004157033", "AffiliationID": "60011394", "AffiliationName": "Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Department of Internal Medicine III, Medical University of Vienna"}, "6603727095": {"Name": "Ferlitsch A.", "AuthorID": "6603727095", "AffiliationID": "60011394", "AffiliationName": "Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Department of Internal Medicine III, Medical University of Vienna"}, "51663568300": {"Name": "Ferlitsch M.", "AuthorID": "51663568300", "AffiliationID": "60011394", "AffiliationName": "Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Department of Internal Medicine III, Medical University of Vienna"}, "7006061605": {"Name": "Trauner M.", "AuthorID": "7006061605", "AffiliationID": "60011394", "AffiliationName": "Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Department of Internal Medicine III, Medical University of Vienna"}}}
