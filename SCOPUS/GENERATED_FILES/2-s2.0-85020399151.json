To our knowledge, this is the first such study of the brookite phase of TiO2 over timescales relevant to the kinetics of water splitting. We find that the behavior of brookite, both in the dynamics of relaxation of photo-generated charges and in energetic distribution, is similar to the anatase phase of TiO2. Moreover, links between the rate of recombination of charge carriers, their energetic distribution and the mode of transport are made in light of our findings and used to account for the differences in water splitting efficiency observed across the three polymorphs.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85020399151", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"57194496656": {"Name": "Moss B.", "AuthorID": "57194496656", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Imperial College London, Department of Chemistry, South Kensington Campus"}, "56565984100": {"Name": "Barnes P.", "AuthorID": "56565984100", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Imperial College London, Department of Chemistry, South Kensington Campus"}, "56401622800": {"Name": "Durrant J.", "AuthorID": "56401622800", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Imperial College London, Department of Chemistry, South Kensington Campus"}, "26039181400": {"Name": "Kafizas A.", "AuthorID": "26039181400", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Imperial College London, Department of Chemistry, South Kensington Campus"}, "57194511393": {"Name": "Lim K.", "AuthorID": "57194511393", "AffiliationID": "60105118", "AffiliationName": "Tunku Abdul Rahman University College, Department of Mathematics, Kampus Utama Jalan Genting Kelang"}, "56523311200": {"Name": "Beltram A.", "AuthorID": "56523311200", "AffiliationID": "60018363", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical and Pharmaceutical Sciences, ICCOM Trieste Research Unit, University of Trieste"}, "7003709305": {"Name": "Fornasiero P.", "AuthorID": "7003709305", "AffiliationID": "60018363", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical and Pharmaceutical Sciences, ICCOM Trieste Research Unit, University of Trieste"}, "35722558900": {"Name": "Moniz S.", "AuthorID": "35722558900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Department of Chemistry"}, "7404638641": {"Name": "Tang J.", "AuthorID": "7404638641", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Department of Chemistry"}}}
