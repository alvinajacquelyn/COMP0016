Methods: Fifteen endoluminal CTC examinations were recorded, each with one polyp, and two videos were generated, one with and one without a CAD mark. Forty-two readers (17 experienced, 25 inexperienced) interpreted the videos during infrared visual search recording. CAD markers and polyps were treated as regions of interest in data processing. This multi-reader, multi-case study was analysed using multilevel modelling. Results: CAD drew readers\u2019 attention to polyps faster, accelerating identification times: median \u2018time to first pursuit\u2019 was 0.48 s (IQR 0.27 to 0.87 s) with CAD, versus 0.58 s (IQR 0.35 to 1.06 s) without. For inexperienced readers, CAD also held visual attention for longer. All visual search metrics used to assess visual gaze behaviour demonstrated statistically significant differences when \u201cwith\u201d and \u201cwithout\u201d CAD were compared. A significant increase in the number of correct polyp identifications across all readers was seen with CAD (74 % without CAD, 87 % with CAD; p < 0.001). Conclusions: CAD significantly alters visual search and polyp identification in readers viewing three-dimensional endoluminal CTC. For polyp and CAD marker pursuit times, CAD generally exerted a larger effect on inexperienced readers. Key Points: \u2022 Visual gaze is attracted by computer-assisted detection (CAD) marks on polyps \u2022 Inexperienced readers\u2019 gaze is affected more by CAD than experienced readers. \u2022 CAD marks could mean that the unannotated endoluminal surface is relatively neglected. \u2022 Correct polyp identification is increased significantly by CAD.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Colonography, Computed tomographic", "Computer tomographic Colonography", "CT colonography", "Diagnosis, Computer-assisted", "Visual perception"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Biomarkers", "Clinical Competence", "Colonic Polyps", "Colonography, Computed Tomographic", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Observer Variation", "Radiographic Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted", "Reproducibility of Results"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84930008073", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"22134954900": {"Name": "Helbren E.", "AuthorID": "22134954900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Imaging, University College London"}, "57203543924": {"Name": "Taylor S.A.", "AuthorID": "57203543924", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Imaging, University College London"}, "55642708000": {"Name": "Halligan S.", "AuthorID": "55642708000", "AffiliationID": "60027403, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Gastrointestinal Radiology, University College London, Centre for Medical Imaging, Podium Level 2, University College Hospital"}, "8700137700": {"Name": "Fanshawe T.R.", "AuthorID": "8700137700", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Nuffield Department of Primary Care Health Sciences, University of Oxford"}, "57189234864": {"Name": "Mallett S.", "AuthorID": "57189234864", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Nuffield Department of Primary Care Health Sciences, University of Oxford"}, "57201566625": {"Name": "Phillips P.", "AuthorID": "57201566625", "AffiliationID": "60028813", "AffiliationName": "Health and Medical Sciences Group, University of Cumbria"}, "7103409605": {"Name": "Boone D.", "AuthorID": "7103409605", "AffiliationID": "60171758", "AffiliationName": "Colchester Hospital University NHS Foundation Trust and Anglia University"}, "7102193286": {"Name": "Gale A.", "AuthorID": "7102193286", "AffiliationID": "60000891", "AffiliationName": "Applied Vision Research Centre, Loughborough University"}, "7201380947": {"Name": "Altman D.G.", "AuthorID": "7201380947", "AffiliationID": "60002634", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Statistics in Medicine, University of Oxford"}, "7201460973": {"Name": "Manning D.", "AuthorID": "7201460973", "AffiliationID": "60023643", "AffiliationName": "Lancaster University"}}}
