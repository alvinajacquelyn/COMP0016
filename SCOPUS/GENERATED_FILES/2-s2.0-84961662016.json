Imaging of conductive objects is performed at room temperature, in an unshielded environment and without background subtraction. Conductivity maps of target objects exhibit not only excellent performance in terms of shape reconstruction but also demonstrate detection of sub-millimetric cracks and penetration of conductive barriers. The results presented here demonstrate the potential of a future generation of imaging instruments, which combine magnetic induction tomography and the unmatched performance of atomic magnetometers.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Atomic magnetometers", "Background subtraction", "Future generations", "Imaging instruments", "Magnetic induction tomography", "Optically pumped atomic magnetometers", "Shape reconstruction", "Unshielded environment"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84961662016", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (miscellaneous)", "PHYS", "3101"]], "AuthorData": {"57117691900": {"Name": "Deans C.", "AuthorID": "57117691900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "23477770400": {"Name": "Marmugi L.", "AuthorID": "23477770400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "57206413356": {"Name": "Hussain S.", "AuthorID": "57206413356", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "6603770390": {"Name": "Renzoni F.", "AuthorID": "6603770390", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}}}
