These activities are generated by groups of sympathoexcitatory and vagal preganglionic neurones residing in a close proximity to each other within well-defined structures of the brainstem. This short essay provides a general overview and an update on the latest developments in our understanding of the central nervous origins and functional significance of cardiac vagal tone. Significant experimental evidence suggests that distinct groups of cardiac vagal preganglionic neurones with different patterns of activity control nodal tissue (controlling the heart rate and atrioventricular conductance) and the ventricular myocardium (modulating its contractility and excitability).", "AuthorKeywords": ["Atrioventricular conductance", "Contractility", "Excitability", "Left ventricle", "Parasympathetic", "Vagal preganglionic neurones"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Autonomic Fibers, Preganglionic", "Heart", "Heart Rate", "Humans", "Medulla Oblongata", "Neurons", "Vagus Nerve"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84979658422", "SubjectAreas": [["Endocrine and Autonomic Systems", "NEUR", "2807"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"]], "AuthorData": {"57204343249": {"Name": "Gourine A.", "AuthorID": "57204343249", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cardiovascular and Metabolic Neuroscience Neuroscience Physiology and Pharmacology, University College London"}, "56168818300": {"Name": "Machhada A.", "AuthorID": "56168818300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cardiovascular and Metabolic Neuroscience Neuroscience Physiology and Pharmacology, University College London"}, "56441808800": {"Name": "Trapp S.", "AuthorID": "56441808800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cardiovascular and Metabolic Neuroscience Neuroscience Physiology and Pharmacology, University College London"}, "7006622082": {"Name": "Spyer K.", "AuthorID": "7006622082", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cardiovascular and Metabolic Neuroscience Neuroscience Physiology and Pharmacology, University College London"}}}
