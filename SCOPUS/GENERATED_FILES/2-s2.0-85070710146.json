Natural hydrophobicity of many nanomaterials must be overcome for their successful incorporation into any solution-based manufacturing process. To date, this has been typically achieved using polymers or surfactants, rather than chemical functionalization, to preserve the remarkable properties of the nanomaterials. Quantifying surfactant or dispersion technique efficacy has been challenging. Here we introduce a new methodology to quantify dispersions applicable to high-weight fraction suspensions of most nanomaterials. It is based on centrifuging and weighing residue of undispersed material. This enables the determination of the efficacy of surfactants to disperse nanomaterials (e.g., ultrasonication power and duration) and leads to increased nanomaterial solution loading. To demonstrate this technique, we assessed carbon nanotube dispersions using popular surfactants: Benzalkonium chloride (ADBAC), Brij52, Brij58, PluronicF127, sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate (SDBS), Triton X-100, TritonX-405, and Tween80, evaluating the dispersion outcome when varying sonicator power and horn depth as well as imaging sono-intensity within the solution with luminol. The methodology is shown to be applicable for high-weight fraction nanomaterial suspensions, enabling greater deployment.", "AuthorKeywords": ["carbon black", "carbon nanotubes", "micro-centrifugal technique", "nanomaterial dispersions", "nanopowders", "surfactants", "titanium oxide"], "IndexKeywords": ["Benzalkonium chloride", "Chemical functionalization", "Manufacturing process", "micro-centrifugal technique", "Nano powders", "Nanotube dispersions", "Natural hydrophobicity", "Sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85070710146", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"]], "AuthorData": {"56502874700": {"Name": "King S.G.", "AuthorID": "56502874700", "AffiliationID": "60021097", "AffiliationName": "Advanced Technology Institute, University of Surrey"}, "57214210426": {"Name": "McCaffterty L.", "AuthorID": "57214210426", "AffiliationID": "60021097", "AffiliationName": "Advanced Technology Institute, University of Surrey"}, "7203043276": {"Name": "Silva S.R.P.", "AuthorID": "7203043276", "AffiliationID": "60021097", "AffiliationName": "Advanced Technology Institute, University of Surrey"}, "6602589117": {"Name": "Stolojan V.", "AuthorID": "6602589117", "AffiliationID": "60021097", "AffiliationName": "Advanced Technology Institute, University of Surrey"}, "37103460100": {"Name": "Castaldelli E.", "AuthorID": "37103460100", "AffiliationID": "60008088", "AffiliationName": "Departamento de Qu\u00edmica, FFCLRP, Universidade de S\u00e3o Paulo"}}}
