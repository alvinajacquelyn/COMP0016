It is associated with a 25-50% prevalence of epilepsy, but detailed electroclinical descriptions are rare. The occurrence of early-onset photosensitivity has recently been reported in single patients. Materials/patients: We collected electroclinical data on 8 infants (age range from 2. months to 3. years and 9. months, median: 17. months) with Patau syndrome referred for an EEG in our Clinical Neurophysiology Department between 1991 and 2011. Methods: All EEGs, case-notes, cytogenetic diagnosis and neuroimaging when available were reviewed; data on the occurrence of seizures, epileptiform discharges, photoparoxysmal response and their characteristics in terms of positive frequencies, latencies, grade and duration were noted and analysed. Results: Two patients had been previously diagnosed with epilepsy (one with tonic spasms and one with multiple seizure types). We found 3 patients with photosensitive myoclonic epilepsy (37.5%), and one with non-photosensitive myoclonic epilepsy. We also recorded non-epileptic myoclonic jerks in one patient known to suffer from epileptic spasms. Among photosensitive patients we found self-limited, Waltz's grade 2-4, spike-wave/polyspike-wave discharges in low, medium and high frequency ranges in two patients and in the high frequency range in the third patient, with latencies and duration from less than 1. s to a maximum of 9. s. Conclusions: In our cohort of Patau syndrome patients, we found a high prevalence of spasms and photic-induced myoclonic jerks. Photosensitivity shows an unusual early age of onset.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Chromosomal abnormalities", "Infantile-onset", "Myoclonic epilepsy", "Patau syndrome", "Photoparoxysmal response", "Photosensitive epilepsy", "Trisomy 13"], "IndexKeywords": ["Age of Onset", "Brain", "Child, Preschool", "Chromosome Disorders", "Chromosomes, Human, Pair 13", "Electroencephalography", "Epilepsy", "Epilepsy, Reflex", "Female", "Humans", "Infant", "Male", "Photic Stimulation", "Prevalence", "Seizures", "Spasms, Infantile", "Trisomy"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84931571325", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Developmental Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2806"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"54879767000": {"Name": "Spagnoli C.", "AuthorID": "54879767000", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Neurophysiology Department, Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "7201529100": {"Name": "Boyd S.G.", "AuthorID": "7201529100", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Neurophysiology Department, Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "56403392900": {"Name": "Kugathasan U.", "AuthorID": "56403392900", "AffiliationID": "60020736", "AffiliationName": "Neurophysiology Department, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "57203494273": {"Name": "Brittain H.", "AuthorID": "57203494273", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Genetics Department, Great Ormond Street Hospital"}}}
