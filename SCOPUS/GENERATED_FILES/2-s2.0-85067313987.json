Attention has also been called to the social challenges these systems bring, particularly in how they might fail or even actively disadvantage marginalised social groups, or how their opacity might make them difficult to oversee and challenge. In the context of these and other challenges, the roles of humans working in tandem with these systems will be important, yet the HCI community has been only a quiet voice in these debates to date. This workshop aims to catalyse and crystallise an agenda around HCI's engagement with AI systems. Topics of interest include explainable and explorable AI; documentation and review; integrating artificial and human intelligence; collaborative decision making; AI/ML in HCI Design; diverse human roles and relationships in AI systems; and critical views of AI.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Artificial intelligence", "Human computer interaction"], "IndexKeywords": ["AI systems", "Application area", "Catalyse", "Collaborative decision making", "HCI design", "Human intelligence", "Social challenges", "Social groups"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85067313987", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Human-Computer Interaction", "COMP", "1709"], ["Computer Graphics and Computer-Aided Design", "COMP", "1704"]], "AuthorData": {"6603519698": {"Name": "Inkpen K.", "AuthorID": "6603519698", "AffiliationID": "60021726", "AffiliationName": "Microsoft Research"}, "57073209400": {"Name": "Veale M.", "AuthorID": "57073209400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "57024019200": {"Name": "Chancellor S.", "AuthorID": "57024019200", "AffiliationID": "60019647", "AffiliationName": "Georgia Tech"}, "18433530100": {"Name": "De Choudhury M.", "AuthorID": "18433530100", "AffiliationID": "60019647", "AffiliationName": "Georgia Tech"}, "57192812542": {"Name": "Baumer E.", "AuthorID": "57192812542", "AffiliationID": "60000060", "AffiliationName": "Lehigh University"}}}
