The molybdenum oxide (MoO3-x) nanostructures have shown promising applications especially when used as photothermal treatment agents due to their relatively low cost, facile synthesis and low toxicity. However, the design and synthesis of efficient MoO3-x nanomaterials with tunable phases and morphologies for theragnosis of tumors remains a challenge. In this work, hydrophilic MoO3-x with controlled structures and phases was synthesized by a simple one-step hydrothermal process. The as-obtained MoO2 nanoclusters showed a desirable size of \u223c40 nm in diameter exhibiting unique properties as a theragnosis nanoplatform: (1) strong near-infrared absorption, which is due to oxygen vacancies of the nanoclusters, as proved by photoluminescence spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy; (2) excellent photothermal performance with a photothermal conversion efficiency of up to 62.1%; and (3) the image response of X-ray computed tomography (CT) and infrared thermal imaging for simultaneous diagnosis of tumors. This study provided the facile synthetic strategy for controllable metal oxide semiconductors and promoted the development of metal oxides for theragnosis therapy of cancers.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Controlled structures", "Energy storage and conversions", "Infrared thermal imaging", "Metal oxide semiconductor", "Morphological control", "Near-infrared absorption", "Photothermal conversion efficiencies", "X-ray computed tomography", "Animals", "Cell Line, Tumor", "Humans", "Hydrophobic and Hydrophilic Interactions", "Mice", "Molybdenum", "Nanostructures", "Neoplasms", "Oxides", "Oxygen", "Phototherapy", "Theranostic Nanomedicine"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85027401718", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"]], "AuthorData": {"57089312600": {"Name": "Li B.", "AuthorID": "57089312600", "AffiliationID": "60082819, 60073647", "AffiliationName": "Department of Vascular Surgery, Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital, Shanghai JiaoTong University School of Medicine"}, "57192721409": {"Name": "Wang X.", "AuthorID": "57192721409", "AffiliationID": "60082819, 60073647", "AffiliationName": "Department of Vascular Surgery, Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital, Shanghai JiaoTong University School of Medicine"}, "57195355065": {"Name": "Wu X.", "AuthorID": "57195355065", "AffiliationID": "60082819, 60073647", "AffiliationName": "Department of Vascular Surgery, Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital, Shanghai JiaoTong University School of Medicine"}, "8839201800": {"Name": "Lu X.", "AuthorID": "8839201800", "AffiliationID": "60082819, 60073647", "AffiliationName": "Department of Vascular Surgery, Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital, Shanghai JiaoTong University School of Medicine"}, "55626024600": {"Name": "He G.", "AuthorID": "55626024600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Christopher Ingold Laboratory, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "57213083930": {"Name": "Parkin I.", "AuthorID": "57213083930", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Christopher Ingold Laboratory, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "57191248248": {"Name": "Xu R.", "AuthorID": "57191248248", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "57194321667": {"Name": "Wang F.", "AuthorID": "57194321667", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}}}
