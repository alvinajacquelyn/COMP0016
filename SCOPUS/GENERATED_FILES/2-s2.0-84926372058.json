Video-Supported Simulation for Interactions in the Operating Theatre draws on original video-based research on teamwork in the operating theatres in the United Kingdom. The objective of this model was to improve verbal and nonverbal interactions between nurses and surgeons that often fall outside explicit training. These involve visual monitoring of colleagues, verbal responsiveness, speaking up about distractions, and seeking prompt clarification when needed. The model includes two scenarios and video-supported debriefing, which uses authentic research footage from the operating theatres. In the article, the strategies are briefly communicated and implications for training are discussed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Communication", "Operating theatre", "Simulation", "Social interaction", "Video"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84926372058", "SubjectAreas": [["Modeling and Simulation", "MATH", "2611"], ["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["Nursing (miscellaneous)", "NURS", "2901"]], "AuthorData": {"55631959200": {"Name": "Korkiakangas T.", "AuthorID": "55631959200", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London"}, "16506294300": {"Name": "Bezemer J.", "AuthorID": "16506294300", "AffiliationID": "60117699, 60006242", "AffiliationName": "London Knowledge Lab, UCL Institute of Education"}, "55931805100": {"Name": "Weldon S.", "AuthorID": "55931805100", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London"}, "7004625073": {"Name": "Kneebone R.", "AuthorID": "7004625073", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London"}}}
