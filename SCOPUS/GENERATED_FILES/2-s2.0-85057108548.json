We examined the association of PAS with motivation to stop in a population sample and assessed its association with past and future quit attempts and future quit success. Method: 12,700 smokers in England were surveyed between September 2009\u2013March 2012 as part of the Smoking Toolkit Study. 2796 smokers were followed up after 6 months. PAS was assessed at baseline by a single self-report item. The outcome variables were ratings of motivation to stop and reports of past-year quit attempts at baseline, and quit attempts in the past 6 months and smoking status at follow-up. Baseline covariates were sex, age, social grade and daily cigarette consumption. Results: In adjusted analyses, PAS was positively associated with at least some degree of motivation to stop versus no motivation (ORs = 1.97\u20132.96, all p's < 0.001). PAS was also positively associated with past-year quit attempts (OR = 1.43, 95% CI = 1.32\u20131.55, p < 0.001), but not with future quit attempts (OR = 1.17, 95% CI = 0.99\u20131.39, p = 0.064) or quit success (OR = 1.04, 95% CI = 0.73\u20131.47, p = 0.83). Conclusion: In smokers in England, perceived addiction to smoking is positively associated with motivation to stop and having recently made a quit attempt but is not clearly associated with future quit attempts or success. These findings provide no grounds for believing that increasing smokers\u2019 perceived addiction through promotion of stop-smoking support has undermined motivation to stop.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Disease model of addiction", "Motivation to stop", "Perceived addiction", "Quit attempts", "Smoking", "Tobacco"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Attitude to Health", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "England", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Motivation", "Prospective Studies", "Smokers", "Smoking Cessation", "Tobacco Smoking", "Treatment Outcome", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85057108548", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (miscellaneous)", "MEDI", "2701"], ["Clinical Psychology", "PSYC", "3203"], ["Toxicology", "PHAR", "3005"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"57195261126": {"Name": "Perski O.", "AuthorID": "57195261126", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London"}, "57188833302": {"Name": "Herd N.", "AuthorID": "57188833302", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London"}, "55547124591": {"Name": "Brown J.", "AuthorID": "55547124591", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Behavioural Science and Health, University College London"}, "7402396010": {"Name": "West R.", "AuthorID": "7402396010", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Behavioural Science and Health, University College London"}}}
