All rights reserved.Objective The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between adherence to a Mediterranean-type diet and metabolic syndrome (MetS) in the Polish arm of the Health, Alcohol and Psychosocial factors In Eastern Europe (HAPIEE) cohort study. Materials/methods A cross-sectional survey including 8821 adults was conducted in Krakow, Poland. Food intake was evaluated through a validated food frequency questionnaire and adherence to the dietary pattern was assessed using a score specifically developed for non-Mediterranean countries (MedTypeDiet score). Linear and logistic regression models were performed to estimate beta and odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), respectively. Results Significant associations between the MedTypeDiet score and waist circumference (\u03b2 = - 0.307 \u00b1 0.239 cm), systolic blood pressure (\u03b2 = - 0.440 \u00b1 0.428 mmHg), and triglycerides (\u03b2 = - 0.021 \u00b1 0.016 mmol/L) were observed. After multivariable adjustment, individuals in the highest quartile of the score were less likely to have MetS, central obesity, high triglycerides, and hypertension. Increase of one standard deviation of the score was associated with 7% less odds of having MetS (OR 0.93, 95% CI: 0.88, 0.97). When analyzing the relation of single components of the MedTypeDiet score, wine, dairy products, and the total unsaturated:saturated fatty acids ratio were associated with MetS. Conclusions Adherence to a Mediterranean-like diet may decrease the risk of MetS also among non-Mediterranean populations.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Diabetes", "Hypertension", "Mediterranean diet", "Metabolic syndrome", "Obesity"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Blood Pressure", "Cohort Studies", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Diet Surveys", "Diet, Mediterranean", "Eating", "European Continental Ancestry Group", "Female", "Health Surveys", "Humans", "Life Style", "Male", "Metabolic Syndrome X", "Middle Aged", "Obesity", "Poland", "Prospective Studies", "Socioeconomic Factors", "Triglycerides", "Waist Circumference"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85047698880", "SubjectAreas": [["Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism", "MEDI", "2712"], ["Endocrinology", "BIOC", "1310"]], "AuthorData": {"35299157700": {"Name": "Grosso G.", "AuthorID": "35299157700", "AffiliationID": "60021323", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Population Studies, Jagiellonian University Medical College"}, "25629876800": {"Name": "Stepaniak U.", "AuthorID": "25629876800", "AffiliationID": "60021323", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Population Studies, Jagiellonian University Medical College"}, "36242169600": {"Name": "Micek A.", "AuthorID": "36242169600", "AffiliationID": "60021323", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Population Studies, Jagiellonian University Medical College"}, "57211182892": {"Name": "Topor-M\u0105dry R.", "AuthorID": "57211182892", "AffiliationID": "60021323", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Population Studies, Jagiellonian University Medical College"}, "57210300468": {"Name": "Szafraniec K.", "AuthorID": "57210300468", "AffiliationID": "60021323", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Population Studies, Jagiellonian University Medical College"}, "7004784461": {"Name": "Paj\u0105k A.", "AuthorID": "7004784461", "AffiliationID": "60021323", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Population Studies, Jagiellonian University Medical College"}, "20434382400": {"Name": "Stefler D.", "AuthorID": "20434382400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College of London"}, "7005266289": {"Name": "Bobak M.", "AuthorID": "7005266289", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College of London"}}}
