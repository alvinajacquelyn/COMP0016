Surrogates who must make life-and-death medical decisions on behalf of incapacitated patients may experience additional distress. EMPOWER (Enhancing & Mobilizing the POtential for Wellness & Emotional Resilience) is a novel cognitive-behavioral, acceptance-based intervention delivered in the intensive care unit (ICU) setting to surrogate decision-makers designed to improve both patients' quality of life and death and dying as well as surrogates' mental health. Methods: Clinician stakeholder and surrogate participant feedback (n = 15), as well as results from an open trial (n = 10), will be used to refine the intervention, which will then be evaluated through a multisite randomized controlled trial (RCT) (n = 60) to examine clinical superiority to usual care. Feasibility, tolerability, and acceptability of the intervention will be evaluated through self-report assessments. Hierarchical linear modeling will be used to adjust for clustering within interventionists to determine the effect of EMPOWER on surrogate differences in the primary outcome, peritraumatic stress. Secondary outcomes will include symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, prolonged grief disorder, and experiential avoidance. Exploratory outcomes will include symptoms of anxiety, depression, and decision regret, all measured at 1 and 3 months from post-intervention assessment. Linear regression models will examine the effects of assignment to EMPOWER versus the enhanced usual care group on patient quality of life or quality of death and intensity of care the patient received during the indexed ICU stay assessed at the time of the post-intervention assessment. Participant exit interviews will be conducted at the 3-month assessment time point and will be analyzed using qualitative thematic data analysis methods. Discussion: The EMPOWER study is unique in its application of evidence-based psychotherapy targeting peritraumatic stress to improve patient and caregiver outcomes in the setting of critical illness. The experimental intervention will be strengthened through the input of a variety of ICU stakeholders, including behavioral health clinicians, physicians, bereaved informal caregivers, and open trial participants. Results of the RCT will be submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal and serve as preliminary data for a larger, multisite RCT grant application.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Caregivers", "Communication", "Critical illness", "Medical decision-making", "Peritraumatic distress", "Psychological distress", "Surrogate decision-makers"], "IndexKeywords": ["Caregivers", "Choice Behavior", "Cognitive Behavioral Therapy", "Critical Care", "Emotions", "Equivalence Trials as Topic", "Humans", "Intensive Care Units", "Mental Health", "Multicenter Studies as Topic", "New York City", "Proxy", "Quality of Life", "Resilience, Psychological", "Stress, Psychological", "Third-Party Consent", "Time Factors", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85069200654", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (miscellaneous)", "MEDI", "2701"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"7007048974": {"Name": "Prigerson H.G.", "AuthorID": "7007048974", "AffiliationID": "60007997", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine"}, "57209408720": {"Name": "Viola M.", "AuthorID": "57209408720", "AffiliationID": "60007997", "AffiliationName": "Center for Research on End-of-Life Care, Weill Cornell Medicine"}, "57201194991": {"Name": "Ouyang D.", "AuthorID": "57201194991", "AffiliationID": "60007997", "AffiliationName": "Center for Research on End-of-Life Care, Weill Cornell Medicine"}, "57209413882": {"Name": "Rogers M.", "AuthorID": "57209413882", "AffiliationID": "60007997", "AffiliationName": "Center for Research on End-of-Life Care, Weill Cornell Medicine"}, "57192672547": {"Name": "Rabin S.", "AuthorID": "57192672547", "AffiliationID": "60007997", "AffiliationName": "Center for Research on End-of-Life Care, Weill Cornell Medicine"}, "57209970501": {"Name": "Xu J.", "AuthorID": "57209970501", "AffiliationID": "60007997", "AffiliationName": "Center for Research on End-of-Life Care, Weill Cornell Medicine"}, "57213019555": {"Name": "Berlin D.", "AuthorID": "57213019555", "AffiliationID": "60007997", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine"}, "56410798400": {"Name": "Lief L.", "AuthorID": "56410798400", "AffiliationID": "60007997", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine"}, "7006656085": {"Name": "Brewin C.R.", "AuthorID": "7006656085", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London"}, "35395853000": {"Name": "Cox C.", "AuthorID": "35395853000", "AffiliationID": "60008724", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Duke University"}, "7403224535": {"Name": "Pan C.X.", "AuthorID": "7403224535", "AffiliationID": "121368442", "AffiliationName": "NewYork-Presbyterian Queens"}, "7005383057": {"Name": "Vaughan S.", "AuthorID": "7005383057", "AffiliationID": "60011605", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia College of Phys. and Surg."}, "56486151200": {"Name": "Gordon-Elliot J.S.", "AuthorID": "56486151200", "AffiliationID": "60007997", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, Weill Cornell Medicine"}, "23028300300": {"Name": "Lichtenthal W.G.", "AuthorID": "23028300300", "AffiliationID": "60009343", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"}}}
