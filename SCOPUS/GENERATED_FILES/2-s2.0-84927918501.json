Outcome measures included intraoperative and postoperative complication rates, and preoperative and postoperative visual acuities.ResultsMedian age at first eye surgery was 77.1 years, 36.9% cases had ocular co-pathology and 41.0% patients underwent cataract surgery on both eyes. Preoperative visual acuity was 0.30 logMAR or better in 32.0% first eyes and 47.7% second eyes. Postoperative best-measured visual acuity was 0.00 and 0.30 logMAR or better in 50.8 and 94.6% eyes without ocular co-pathology, and 32.5 and 79.9% in eyes with co-pathology. For eyes without co-pathology, postoperative uncorrected distance visual acuity was 0.00 and 0.30 logMAR or better in 27.3 and 80.9% eyes. Posterior capsule rupture or vitreous loss or both occurred in 1.95% cases, and was associated with a 42 times higher risk of retinal detachment surgery within 3 months and an eight times higher risk of endophthalmitis.ConclusionThese results provide updated data for the benchmarking of cataract surgery. Visual outcomes, and the rate of posterior capsule rupture or vitreous loss or both appear stable over the past decade.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Cataract Extraction", "Databases, Factual", "Female", "Humans", "Intraoperative Complications", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Outcome Assessment (Health Care)", "Posterior Capsular Rupture, Ocular", "Postoperative Complications", "Prospective Studies", "United Kingdom", "Visual Acuity", "Vitreous Detachment"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84927918501", "SubjectAreas": [["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"], ["Sensory Systems", "NEUR", "2809"]], "AuthorData": {"36028093000": {"Name": "Day A.C.", "AuthorID": "36028093000", "AffiliationID": "60016691, 60022148, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre at Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS, Foundation Trust and UCL, Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "35169087700": {"Name": "Donachie P.H.J.", "AuthorID": "35169087700", "AffiliationID": "60019573", "AffiliationName": "Gloucestershire Hospitals, NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7103024973": {"Name": "Sparrow J.M.", "AuthorID": "7103024973", "AffiliationID": "60016719", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, Bristol Eye Hospital"}, "7403678474": {"Name": "Johnston R.L.", "AuthorID": "7403678474", "AffiliationID": "60019573", "AffiliationName": "Gloucestershire Hospitals, NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
