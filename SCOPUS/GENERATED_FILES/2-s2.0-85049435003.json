Disrupting the status quo has therefore become an obligation and a necessity. Initiated by the Fragility Fracture Network (FFN) at a \u201cPresidents\u2019 Roundtable\u201d during the 5 th FFN Global Congress in 2016 several leading organisations agreed that a global multidisciplinary and multiprofessional collaboration, resulting in a Global Call to Action (CtA), would be the right step forward to improve the care of people presenting with fragility fractures. So far global and regional organisations in geriatrics/internal medicine, orthopaedics, osteoporosis/metabolic bone disease, rehabilitation and rheumatology were contacted as well as national organisations in five highly populated countries (Brazil, China, India, Japan and the United States), resulting in 81societies endorsing the CtA. We call for implementation of a systematic approach to fragility fracture care with the goal of restoring function and preventing subsequent fractures without further delay. There is an urgent need to improve: \u2022 Acute multidisciplinary care for the person who suffers a hip, clinical vertebral and other major fragility fractures\u2022 Rapid secondary prevention after first occurrence of all fragility fractures, including those in younger people as well as those in older persons, to prevent future fractures\u2022 Ongoing post-acute care of people whose ability to function is impaired by hip and major fragility fracturesTo address this fragility fracture crisis, the undersigned organisations pledge to intensify their efforts to improve the current management of all fragility fractures, prevent subsequent fractures, and strive to restore functional abilities and quality of life.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Fracture liaison service", "Fragility fracture", "Multidisciplinary", "Orthogeriatric", "Rehabilitation", "Systematic approach"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Brazil", "China", "Continuity of Patient Care", "Delivery of Health Care", "Female", "Geriatrics", "Health Services for the Aged", "Health Services Research", "Humans", "India", "Japan", "Male", "Osteoporosis", "Osteoporotic Fractures", "Quality Improvement", "Quality of Health Care", "Quality of Life", "Secondary Prevention", "Time Factors", "United States"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85049435003", "SubjectAreas": [["Emergency Medicine", "MEDI", "2711"], ["Orthopedics and Sports Medicine", "MEDI", "2732"]], "AuthorData": {"6603552016": {"Name": "Dreinh\u00f6fer K.E.", "AuthorID": "6603552016", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "FFN"}, "13102957600": {"Name": "Mitchell P.J.", "AuthorID": "13102957600", "AffiliationID": "60031487", "AffiliationName": "School of Medicine, Sydney Campus, The University of Notre Dame Australia"}, "24372401900": {"Name": "Costa M.L.", "AuthorID": "24372401900", "AffiliationID": "60006343", "AffiliationName": "University Hospitals Coventry and Warwickshire NHS Trust"}, "7004593018": {"Name": "Falaschi P.", "AuthorID": "7004593018", "AffiliationID": "60032350", "AffiliationName": "Sapienza University of Rome"}, "7402332452": {"Name": "Marsh D.", "AuthorID": "7402332452", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "16432574700": {"Name": "Palm H.", "AuthorID": "16432574700", "AffiliationID": "60025840", "AffiliationName": "Department of Orthopedics, Copenhagen University Hospital Bispebjerg"}, "6503877762": {"Name": "Speerin R.", "AuthorID": "6503877762", "AffiliationID": "112974428", "AffiliationName": "Musculoskeletal Network, NSW Agency for Clinical Innovation"}, "7006026522": {"Name": "Magaziner J.", "AuthorID": "7006026522", "AffiliationID": "60012957", "AffiliationName": "University of Maryland School of Medicine"}, "6701677694": {"Name": "B\u00e9gu\u00e9 T.", "AuthorID": "6701677694", "AffiliationID": "114362949", "AffiliationName": "European Federation of National Associations of Orthopaedics and Traumatology (EFORT), Chair Science Committee, EFORT"}, "36041345700": {"Name": "Cooper C.", "AuthorID": "36041345700", "AffiliationID": "120940982", "AffiliationName": "IOF"}, "55348727500": {"Name": "Hertz K.", "AuthorID": "55348727500", "AffiliationID": "120941330", "AffiliationName": "International Collaboration of Orthopaedic Nursing (ICON) Chair"}, "57203083453": {"Name": "Maggi S.", "AuthorID": "57203083453", "AffiliationID": "120941247", "AffiliationName": null}, "7004920807": {"Name": "Nana A.", "AuthorID": "7004920807", "AffiliationID": "120941181", "AffiliationName": "IGFS"}, "null": {"Name": null, "AuthorID": null, "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
