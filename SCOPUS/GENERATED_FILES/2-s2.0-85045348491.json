However, because of their broad coverage, UAV communications are prone to passive eavesdropping attacks. This paper analyzes the secrecy performance of UAVs networks at the millimeter wave band and takes into account unique features of air-to-ground channels and practical constraints of UAV deployment. To be specific, it explores the 3-D antenna gain in the air-to-ground links and uses the Mat\u00e9rn hardcore point process to guarantee the safety distance between the randomly deployed UAV base stations. In addition, we propose the transmit jamming strategy to improve the secrecy performance in which part of UAVs send jamming signals to confound the eavesdroppers. Simulation results verify our analysis and demonstrate the impact of different system parameters on the achievable secrecy rate. It is also revealed that optimizing the density of jamming UAVs will significantly improve security of UAV-enabled networks.", "AuthorKeywords": ["3D antenna pattern", "Mat\u00e9rn hardcore process", "millimeter wave (mm-wave)", "physical layer security", "Unmanned aerial vehicles"], "IndexKeywords": ["3D antenna pattern", "Hardcore", "Millimeter-wave (mm-wave)", "Physical layer security", "Rayleigh channel", "Security"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85045348491", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"56021641700": {"Name": "Zhu Y.", "AuthorID": "56021641700", "AffiliationID": "60000891", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Manufacturing Engineering, Loughborough University"}, "16176882900": {"Name": "Zheng G.", "AuthorID": "16176882900", "AffiliationID": "60000891", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Manufacturing Engineering, Loughborough University"}, "7102390740": {"Name": "Fitch M.", "AuthorID": "7102390740", "AffiliationID": "60014174", "AffiliationName": "BT Research and Innovation, BT Adastral Park"}}}
