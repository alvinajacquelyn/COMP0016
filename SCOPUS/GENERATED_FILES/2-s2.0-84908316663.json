A total of 263 adolescents between 13 and 17. years and their parents participated in the study, completing two forms of the Trait Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire (TEIQue-AF and TEIQue-360\u00b0) and the Child Behavior CheckList (CBCL-YSR and CBCL-parents' report). Results revealed a strong correspondence between father and mother ratings, especially for externalizing problems. A doubly MANOVA, with gender as the between-subjects variable, rating source (father, mother, and adolescent) as the within-subjects variable, and the four trait EI factors as dependent variables revealed a significant effect of ratings. Both fathers and mothers attributed higher Well-being and Self-control to their children than the children attributed to themselves. The findings showed that while multisource ratings of trait EI generally converge, they are differentially predictive of external criteria.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Adolescents", "Behavioral problems", "Self and other-ratings", "Trait EI"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84908316663", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychology (all)", "PSYC", "3200"]], "AuthorData": {"55344738600": {"Name": "Gugliandolo M.", "AuthorID": "55344738600", "AffiliationID": "60011576", "AffiliationName": "Section of Psychology, Department of Human and Social Sciences, University of Messina"}, "55985037000": {"Name": "Costa S.", "AuthorID": "55985037000", "AffiliationID": "60011576", "AffiliationName": "Section of Psychology, Department of Human and Social Sciences, University of Messina"}, "55010497100": {"Name": "Cuzzocrea F.", "AuthorID": "55010497100", "AffiliationID": "60011576", "AffiliationName": "Section of Psychology, Department of Human and Social Sciences, University of Messina"}, "6508384880": {"Name": "Larcan R.", "AuthorID": "6508384880", "AffiliationID": "60011576", "AffiliationName": "Section of Psychology, Department of Human and Social Sciences, University of Messina"}, "6603597461": {"Name": "Petrides K.", "AuthorID": "6603597461", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "London Psychometric Laboratory, University College London"}}}
