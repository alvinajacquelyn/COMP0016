We formulate the optimal control problems aiming to minimise the travel delay on motorways based upon a macroscopic cell transmission model of traffic. The optimal ramp metering optimisation is formulated as a linear programming (LP) while the variable speed control problem is formulated as a mixed integer LP. The optimisation models are applied to a real scenario over a section of M25 motorway in the UK. This paper also includes various analyses on the sensitivity of the optimal control solutions with respect to different network configurations and model assumptions.", "AuthorKeywords": ["cell transmission model", "mixed integer linear programming", "ramp metering", "variable speed limits"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cell transmission model", "Mixed integer linear programming", "Modelling and optimisation", "Optimal control problem", "Optimal control solution", "Ramp metering", "Variable speed control", "Variable speed limits"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84926217168", "SubjectAreas": [["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"], ["Transportation", "SOCI", "3313"]], "AuthorData": {"56092100700": {"Name": "Li Y.", "AuthorID": "56092100700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Transport Studies, University College London"}, "36146863600": {"Name": "Chow A.", "AuthorID": "36146863600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Transport Studies, University College London"}}}
