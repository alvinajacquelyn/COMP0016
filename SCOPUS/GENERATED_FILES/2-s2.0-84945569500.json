MI-BCIs are very promising for a wide range of applications as they offer a new and non-time locked modality of control. However, most MI-BCIs involve visual feedback to inform the user about the system\u2019s decisions, which makes them difficult to use when integrated with visual interactive tasks. This paper presents our design and evaluation of a tactile feedback glove for MI-BCIs, which provides a continuously updated tactile feedback. We first determined the best parameters for this tactile feedback and then tested it in a multitasking environment: at the same time users were performing the MI tasks, they were asked to count distracters. Our results suggest that, as compared to an equivalent visual feedback, the use of tactile feedback leads to a higher recognition accuracy of the MI-BCI tasks and fewer errors in counting distracters.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Brain-Computer interaction", "Multitasking", "Tactile feedback"], "IndexKeywords": ["Brain computer interactions", "Design and evaluations", "Limb movements", "Motor imagery", "Multitasking environments", "Recognition accuracy", "Tactile feedback", "Visual feedback"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84945569500", "SubjectAreas": [["Theoretical Computer Science", "MATH", "2614"], ["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"]], "AuthorData": {"56297867300": {"Name": "Jeunet C.", "AuthorID": "56297867300", "AffiliationID": "60013373, 60106845", "AffiliationName": "Project-Team Potioc, Inria Bordeaux Sud-Ouest/LaBRI/CNRS"}, "56928339600": {"Name": "N\u2019Kaoua B.", "AuthorID": "56928339600", "AffiliationID": "60106822, 60102125", "AffiliationName": "Laboratoire Handicap and Syst\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdme Nerveux, University of Bordeaux"}, "12801085400": {"Name": "Lotte F.", "AuthorID": "12801085400", "AffiliationID": "60013373, 60106845", "AffiliationName": "Project-Team Potioc, Inria Bordeaux Sud-Ouest/LaBRI/CNRS"}, "55247108300": {"Name": "Vi C.", "AuthorID": "55247108300", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "Bristol Interaction and Graphics (BIG) Group, University of Bristol"}, "25723936700": {"Name": "Spelmezan D.", "AuthorID": "25723936700", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "Bristol Interaction and Graphics (BIG) Group, University of Bristol"}, "35389893300": {"Name": "Subramanian S.", "AuthorID": "35389893300", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "Bristol Interaction and Graphics (BIG) Group, University of Bristol"}}}
