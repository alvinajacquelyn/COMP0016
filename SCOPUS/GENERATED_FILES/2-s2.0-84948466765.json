The presence of Gd3+ diethylenetriaminepentaacetate and Gd3+ diethylenetriaminepenta(methylenephosphonate) complexes in the HDS lattice after intercalation was confirmed by microwave plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy. The structural aspects of the HDS-Gd composites were studied by X-ray diffraction, with the intercalates having an interlayer spacing of 14.5-18.6 \u00c5. Infrared spectroscopy confirmed the presence of characteristic vibration peaks associated with the Gd3+ complexes in the intercalation compounds. The proton relaxivities of the Gd3+ complex-loaded composites were 2 to 5-fold higher in longitudinal relaxivity, and up to 10-fold higher in transverse relaxivity, compared to solutions of the pure complexes. These data demonstrate that the new composites reported here are potentially potent MRI contrast agents.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Hydroxy double salts", "Interlayer spacings", "Magnetic resonance imaging contrast agents", "Microwave plasma", "MRI contrast agents", "Relaxivity", "Structural aspects", "Vibration peak", "Contrast Media", "Coordination Complexes", "Gadolinium", "Gadolinium DTPA", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Organophosphorus Compounds", "Salts"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84948466765", "SubjectAreas": [["Inorganic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1604"]], "AuthorData": {"55832656100": {"Name": "Jin M.", "AuthorID": "55832656100", "AffiliationID": "60016379, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "7406083266": {"Name": "Williams G.", "AuthorID": "7406083266", "AffiliationID": "60016379, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "6601962010": {"Name": "Spillane D.", "AuthorID": "6601962010", "AffiliationID": "60002826", "AffiliationName": "School of Human Sciences, London Metropolitan University"}, "35477589200": {"Name": "Geraldes C.", "AuthorID": "35477589200", "AffiliationID": "60106462, 60020985", "AffiliationName": "Department of Life Sciences, Coimbra Chemistry Centre, Faculty of Science and Technology, University of Coimbra"}, "6602001632": {"Name": "Bligh S.", "AuthorID": "6602001632", "AffiliationID": "60000508", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Science and Technology, University of Westminster"}}}
