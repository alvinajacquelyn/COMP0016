The specific field enhancement in a wide spectral range (from UV to near-infrared) originates from the abundance of localized surface-plasmonic (LSP) modes in the microscopically random distributed silver nanoplates and propagating Bloch-plasmonic (PBP) modes from the macroscopically periodic pattern. The characterization of polarization dependent spectral absorption, surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS), as well as theoretical simulation was conducted to comprehensively understand the features of the broadband spectrum and highly concentrated near-field. The reported macro-periodic and micro-random structure may offer a new route for the design of plasmonic systems for photonic and optoelectronic applications.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Broad-band spectrum", "Near-field enhancement", "Optoelectronic applications", "Silver nanoplates", "Spectral absorptions", "Surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy", "Theoretical simulation", "Wide spectral range"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84944104454", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"]], "AuthorData": {"55693815200": {"Name": "Lu H.", "AuthorID": "55693815200", "AffiliationID": "60006541", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Hong Kong"}, "56412328200": {"Name": "Ren X.", "AuthorID": "56412328200", "AffiliationID": "60006541", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Hong Kong"}, "56419475000": {"Name": "Sha W.", "AuthorID": "56419475000", "AffiliationID": "60006541", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Hong Kong"}, "7006202371": {"Name": "Choy W.", "AuthorID": "7006202371", "AffiliationID": "60006541", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Hong Kong"}, "35175860200": {"Name": "Ho H.", "AuthorID": "35175860200", "AffiliationID": "60002798", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong"}}}
