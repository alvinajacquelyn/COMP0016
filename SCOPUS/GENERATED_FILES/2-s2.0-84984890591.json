We aimed to explore patterns of alcohol consumption and motivation to reduce alcohol use in England throughout the year. Methods: Data from 38,372 participants who answered questions about alcohol consumption (March 2014 to January 2016) were analysed using weighted regression using the R survey package. Questions assessed alcohol consumption (AUDIT-C) and attempts to reduce consumption. Results: Sixty-seven percent of participants reported using alcohol, with a small negative trend of about 2 % reduction over 12 months in the studied period (P < 0.01). These include ~25 % higher risk drinkers and ~10 % regular binge drinkers. About 20 % of higher risk drinkers indicated they were attempting to reduce their alcohol consumption. Attempts were lowest in December (-20 %; 95 % CI 0-35 %), but increases significantly in January (+41 %; 95 % CI 16-73 %) compared with other months (P < 0.001), indicating a small net gain; at least in attempts to reduce. However, there was no evidence that the increased motivation in January was accompanied by a reported decrease in consumption or binge drinking events. This could be an artefact of the use of AUDIT questions, but could also reflect a disconnect between attempting to reduce alcohol consumption and subsequent change; maybe as a result of lack of continuing support. Conclusions: January is associated with moderate increased attempts to reduce alcohol consumption. However, we find little evidence of a change in alcohol consumption. In part, this may be due to temporal insensitivity of the AUDIT questions.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Alcohol Drinking", "Alcoholic Intoxication", "England", "Female", "Health Surveys", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Regression Analysis", "Socioeconomic Factors", "Time Factors", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84984890591", "SubjectAreas": [["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"6508311548": {"Name": "De Vocht F.", "AuthorID": "6508311548", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "School of Social and Community Medicine, University of Bristol, Canynge Hall"}, "55547124591": {"Name": "Brown J.", "AuthorID": "55547124591", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Educational and Health Psychology, University College London"}, "35224537600": {"Name": "Beard E.", "AuthorID": "35224537600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Educational and Health Psychology, University College London"}, "55601225500": {"Name": "Angus C.", "AuthorID": "55601225500", "AffiliationID": "60176589, 60001881", "AffiliationName": "ScHARR, School of Health and Related Research, University of Sheffield"}, "55585019700": {"Name": "Brennan A.", "AuthorID": "55585019700", "AffiliationID": "60176589, 60001881", "AffiliationName": "ScHARR, School of Health and Related Research, University of Sheffield"}, "7004779970": {"Name": "Michie S.", "AuthorID": "7004779970", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Educational and Health Psychology, University College London"}, "55819464700": {"Name": "Campbell R.", "AuthorID": "55819464700", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "School of Social and Community Medicine, University of Bristol, Canynge Hall"}, "7101974395": {"Name": "Hickman M.", "AuthorID": "7101974395", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "School of Social and Community Medicine, University of Bristol, Canynge Hall"}}}
