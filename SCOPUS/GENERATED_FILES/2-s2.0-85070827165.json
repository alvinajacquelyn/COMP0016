Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.Introduction: Oromucosal films, comprising mucoadhesive buccal films (MBFs) and orodispersible films (ODFs), are considered patient-centric dosage forms. Target groups are patients with special needs. Various active pharmaceutical ingredients have been shown to be suitable for oromucosal film production. A shift is seen in the production techniques, from conventional solvent casting to printing techniques. Areas covered: In this review, the patient acceptability of oromucosal films is discussed. An overview is given of the small molecule drugs, biopharmaceuticals and herbal extracts that have been incorporated so far. Finally, the current state of 2D and 3D printing techniques for production purposes is discussed. Expert opinion: The patient-centric features are important for the further development and acceptance of this oral solid dosage form. Oromucosal films perfectly fit in the current attention for personalized medicine. Both MBFs and ODFs are intended for either a local or a systemic effect. For buccal absorption, sufficient mucoadhesion is one of the most important criteria an oromucosal film must comply with. For the preparation, the solvent casting technique is still predominately used. Some limitations of this production method can be tackled by printing techniques. However, these novel techniques introduce new requirements, yet to be set, for oromucosal film preparation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Local drug delivery", "mucoadhesive buccal films", "orodispersible films", "oromucosal films", "patient centricity", "printing techniques", "systemic drug delivery"], "IndexKeywords": ["Administration, Buccal", "Animals", "Drug Delivery Systems", "Humans", "Mouth Mucosa", "Oral Mucosal Absorption", "Patient Preference", "Printing, Three-Dimensional"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85070827165", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmaceutical Science", "PHAR", "3003"]], "AuthorData": {"57195511967": {"Name": "Tian Y.", "AuthorID": "57195511967", "AffiliationID": "60010023", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmaceutical Technology and Biopharmacy, University of Groningen"}, "7005090451": {"Name": "Woerdenbag H.J.", "AuthorID": "7005090451", "AffiliationID": "60010023", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmaceutical Technology and Biopharmacy, University of Groningen"}, "35310366500": {"Name": "Hinrichs W.L.J.", "AuthorID": "35310366500", "AffiliationID": "60010023", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmaceutical Technology and Biopharmacy, University of Groningen"}, "7004545002": {"Name": "Frijlink H.W.", "AuthorID": "7004545002", "AffiliationID": "60010023", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmaceutical Technology and Biopharmacy, University of Groningen"}, "7202086523": {"Name": "Visser J.C.", "AuthorID": "7202086523", "AffiliationID": "60010023", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmaceutical Technology and Biopharmacy, University of Groningen"}, "57193742036": {"Name": "Orlu M.", "AuthorID": "57193742036", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "57193746651": {"Name": "Scarpa M.", "AuthorID": "57193746651", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "57210473009": {"Name": "Kiefer O.", "AuthorID": "57210473009", "AffiliationID": "60025310", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Pharmaceutics and Biopharmaceutics, Heinrich-Heine-University D\u00fcsseldorf"}, "57210474817": {"Name": "Kottke D.", "AuthorID": "57210474817", "AffiliationID": "60025310", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Pharmaceutics and Biopharmaceutics, Heinrich-Heine-University D\u00fcsseldorf"}, "6602181997": {"Name": "Breitkreutz J.", "AuthorID": "6602181997", "AffiliationID": "60025310", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Pharmaceutics and Biopharmaceutics, Heinrich-Heine-University D\u00fcsseldorf"}, "57196741631": {"Name": "Sj\u00f6holm E.", "AuthorID": "57196741631", "AffiliationID": "60015375", "AffiliationName": "Pharmaceutical Sciences Laboratory, Faculty of Science and Engineering, \u00c5bo Akademi University"}, "57192941627": {"Name": "\u00d6blom H.", "AuthorID": "57192941627", "AffiliationID": "60015375", "AffiliationName": "Pharmaceutical Sciences Laboratory, Faculty of Science and Engineering, \u00c5bo Akademi University"}, "56250091000": {"Name": "Sandler N.", "AuthorID": "56250091000", "AffiliationID": "60015375", "AffiliationName": "Pharmaceutical Sciences Laboratory, Faculty of Science and Engineering, \u00c5bo Akademi University"}}}
