The target compound was prepared via copper-catalysed diastereoselective nucleophilic borylation of a sulfinimine. After deprotection to give the amine as the hydrochloride salt, four boronocysteine amide derivatives were prepared through reaction with a variety of different active acylating agents.", "AuthorKeywords": ["amino acids", "boron", "copper", "imines", "peptides"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85031936195", "SubjectAreas": [["Organic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1605"]], "AuthorData": {"56763438800": {"Name": "Gibson S.", "AuthorID": "56763438800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "15127363300": {"Name": "Macmillan D.", "AuthorID": "15127363300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "7006813758": {"Name": "Sheppard T.", "AuthorID": "7006813758", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}}}
