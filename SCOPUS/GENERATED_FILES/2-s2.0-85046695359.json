We develop this for the SIR and SEIR models, and we show how it can be used to perform quick maximum likelihood inference for the underlying parameters given population estimates of the number of infecteds or cases at given time points. We also show how the unobserved processes can be inferred at the same time as the underlying parameters.", "AuthorKeywords": ["MLE", "SEIR", "SIR", "Stochastic Taylor expansion"], "IndexKeywords": ["Fast inference", "Flexible framework", "Gaussian Processes", "Individual based model", "Infectious disease", "Population estimate", "SEIR", "Taylor expansions", "Caliciviridae Infections", "Communicable Diseases", "Computer Simulation", "Epidemics", "Humans", "Incidence", "Likelihood Functions", "Linear Models", "Markov Chains", "Mathematical Concepts", "Models, Biological", "Multivariate Analysis", "Nonlinear Dynamics", "Normal Distribution", "Stochastic Processes"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85046695359", "SubjectAreas": [["Statistics and Probability", "MATH", "2613"], ["Modeling and Simulation", "MATH", "2611"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Immunology and Microbiology (all)", "IMMU", "2400"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"57193240753": {"Name": "Buckingham-Jeffery E.", "AuthorID": "57193240753", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "School of Mathematics, University of Manchester"}, "6701600227": {"Name": "Isham V.", "AuthorID": "6701600227", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Statistical Science, University College London"}, "6701370105": {"Name": "House T.", "AuthorID": "6701370105", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "School of Mathematics, University of Manchester"}}}
