While feedback is recognised as a key pedagogical dimension of these games, particularly in early learning, there has been no research on how commercial games available to schools and parents reify learning theory into feedback. Using a systematic content analysis, we examine how evidence-based feedback principles manifest in five widely-used learning games designed to foster young children's reading skills. Our findings highlight strengths in how games deliver feedback when players succeed. Many of the games, however, were inconsistent and not proactive when providing error feedback, often promoting trial and error strategies. Furthermore, there was a lack of support for learning the game mechanics and a preference for taskoriented rewards less deeply embedded in the gameplay. Our research provides a design and research agenda for the inclusion of feedback in early learning games.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Children", "Feedback", "Learning games", "Reading"], "IndexKeywords": ["Children", "Content analysis", "Feedback principle", "Informal learning", "Learning game", "Learning Theory", "Reading", "Research agenda"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85046978551", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Human-Computer Interaction", "COMP", "1709"], ["Computer Graphics and Computer-Aided Design", "COMP", "1704"]], "AuthorData": {"39060961100": {"Name": "Benton L.", "AuthorID": "39060961100", "AffiliationID": "60117699, 60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Knowledge Lab, UCL Institute of Education, University College London"}, "8950143700": {"Name": "Vasalou A.", "AuthorID": "8950143700", "AffiliationID": "60117699, 60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Knowledge Lab, UCL Institute of Education, University College London"}, "25651815200": {"Name": "Mavrikis M.", "AuthorID": "25651815200", "AffiliationID": "60117699, 60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Knowledge Lab, UCL Institute of Education, University College London"}, "23392113900": {"Name": "Berkling K.", "AuthorID": "23392113900", "AffiliationID": "60134849", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, Cooperative State University, Baden W\u00fcrttemberg"}, "14029729600": {"Name": "Barendregt W.", "AuthorID": "14029729600", "AffiliationID": "60016437", "AffiliationName": "Department of Applied Information Technology, University of Gothenburg"}}}
