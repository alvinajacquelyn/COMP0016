A laser technique introduced surface perforations. Micro computed tomography generated porosity data. Scaffolds were seeded with cells, investigated histologically and proliferation studied. Incubation and time effects were assessed.Results Laser cutting perforated the polymer, connecting the substructure with the ex-scaffold environment and increasing porosity (porous, non-perforated = 87.9 per cent; porous, laser-perforated at intensities 3 = 96.4 per cent and 6 = 89.5 per cent). Cellular studies confirmed improved cell viability. Histology showed cells adherent to the scaffold surface and cells within perforations, and indicated that cells migrated into the scaffolds. After 15 days of incubation, scanning electron microscopy revealed an 11 per cent reduction in pore diameter, correlating with a decrease in Young's modulus.Conclusion Introducing surface perforations presents a viable method of improving polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane poly(carbonate-urea) urethane as a tissue-engineered scaffold.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cell Proliferation", "Key wordsTissue Engineering", "Laryngeal Neoplasms", "Nanocomposites", "Porosity", "Tissue Scaffolds"], "IndexKeywords": ["Biocompatible Materials", "Cell Proliferation", "Cell Survival", "Humans", "Materials Testing", "Microscopy, Electron, Scanning", "Polyurethanes", "Porosity", "Tissue Engineering", "Tissue Scaffolds", "X-Ray Microtomography"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85063266367", "SubjectAreas": [["Otorhinolaryngology", "MEDI", "2733"]], "AuthorData": {"57207941333": {"Name": "Wismayer K.", "AuthorID": "57207941333", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60011326, 60012558", "AffiliationName": "Division of Surgery, Ear Institute Charing Cross Hospital, University College London"}, "36677771600": {"Name": "Mehrban N.", "AuthorID": "36677771600", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60011326, 60012558", "AffiliationName": "Division of Surgery, Ear Institute Charing Cross Hospital, University College London"}, "55574192663": {"Name": "Bowen J.", "AuthorID": "55574192663", "AffiliationID": "60011326, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Ear Institute, University College London"}, "7004957785": {"Name": "Birchall M.", "AuthorID": "7004957785", "AffiliationID": "60012113", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering and Innovation, Open University"}}}
