Considerable developments in the instrumentation and data analysis associated with the major spectroscopic methods have taken place in recent years. A range of spectroscopic techniques have been used to interrogate and understand the skin barrier. This chapter discusses the various spectroscopic methods which have been investigated over the years. These include the electronic spectroscopic methods (UV spectroscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance), vibrational spectroscopic methods and other miscellaneous methods, including opto-thermal transient emission radiometry, electron spin resonance, impedance spectroscopy, laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy, and mass spectrometry imaging.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Electron spin resonance", "Electronic spectroscopic methods", "Impedance spectroscopy", "Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy", "Nuclear magnetic resonance", "Opto-thermal transient emission radiometry", "Skin permeation", "Uv radiation", "Vibrational spectroscopic methods"], "IndexKeywords": ["Impedance spectroscopy", "Opto-thermal transient emission radiometries", "Skin permeation", "Spectroscopic method", "Vibrational spectroscopic methods"], "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84960298594", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"]], "AuthorData": {"57213994372": {"Name": "Hadgraft J.", "AuthorID": "57213994372", "AffiliationID": "60016379", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmaceutics, UCL School of Pharmacy"}, "56535097600": {"Name": "Mateus R.", "AuthorID": "56535097600", "AffiliationID": "60016379", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmaceutics, UCL School of Pharmacy"}, "56393831400": {"Name": "Lane M.E.", "AuthorID": "56393831400", "AffiliationID": "60016379", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmaceutics, UCL School of Pharmacy"}}}
