Materials and methods We analysed Nepal Demographic and Health Survey 2016 data from 6,069 women aged 15\u201349 years. WHO cut-offs for Body Mass Index categorised as: underweight (<18.5 kg/ m2), normal weight (18.5kg/m2 to 24.9kg/m2) and overweight/ obesity (> = 25.0 kg/m2) were used. We used multinomial logistic regression to explore associations of factors with Body Mass Index and concentration indices to estimate socio-economic inequalities. Results Higher risk of underweight was found in age group 15\u201319 (RRR 3.08, 95% CI: 2.29\u20134.15), 20\u201329 (RRR 1.64, 95% CI: 1.29\u20132.08) and in lowest (RRR 1.60, 95% CI: 1.03\u20132.47) and second wealth quintiles (RRR 1.77 (95% CI: 1.18\u20132.64). Education, occupation, urban/rural residence and food security were not associated with underweight (p>0.05). Lower risk of overweight/obesity was found in age group 15\u201319 (RRR 0.07, 95% CI: 0.05\u20130.10), 20\u201329 (RRR 0.40, 95% CI: 0.32\u20130.51), in manual occupation (RRR 0.58, 95% CI: 0.46\u20130.74) and in lower quintiles. Women with primary (RRR 1.91, 95% CI: 1.36\u20132.67), secondary education (RRR 1.42, 95% CI 1.00, 2.01) were at increased risk of overweight/obesity. Household food security and urban/rural residence were not associated with overweight/obesity (p>0.05). Socioeconomic inequalities were detected, with overweight/obesity strongly concentrated (concentration index: 0.380) amongst the higher quintiles and underweight concentrated (concentration index: -0.052) amongst the poorest. Conclusion Nutrition programmes should target younger and poor women to address undernutrition and higher wealth group women to address overnutrition. Equity based nutrition interventions improving socio-economic status of poor households may benefit undernourished women. Interventions to encourage physical activity as women age and among wealthier women as well as healthy eating for prevention of under- and over-nutrition are needed.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Female", "Health Surveys", "Healthcare Disparities", "Humans", "Middle Aged", "Nepal", "Obesity", "Overweight", "Reproduction", "Thinness", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85065774882", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"57191628321": {"Name": "Rai A.", "AuthorID": "57191628321", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "56567863000": {"Name": "Gurung S.", "AuthorID": "56567863000", "AffiliationID": "60177701", "AffiliationName": "Camris International"}, "55252344300": {"Name": "Thapa S.", "AuthorID": "55252344300", "AffiliationID": "60013183", "AffiliationName": "Prince Naif Bin Abdulaziz Health Research Centre, King Saud University"}, "23486721300": {"Name": "Saville N.M.", "AuthorID": "23486721300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Global Health, University College London"}}}
