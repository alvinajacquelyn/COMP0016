We achieve this by introducing a positive linear slope in the imaginary component of the input impedance seen by the Josephson oscillator using a \u03bb / 2 transformer. Our theoretical model predicts an extremely flat gain profile with a bandwidth enhancement proportional to the square root of amplitude gain. We experimentally demonstrate a nearly flat 20 dB gain over a 640 MHz band, along with a mean 1-dB compression point of -110 dBm and near quantum-limited noise. The results are in a good agreement with our theoretical model.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["1dB compression point", "Bandwidth enhancement", "Gain-bandwidth products", "Input impedance", "Josephson oscillators", "Parametric amplification", "Quantum limited", "Theoretical modeling"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84954044840", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (miscellaneous)", "PHYS", "3101"]], "AuthorData": {"57014407900": {"Name": "Roy T.", "AuthorID": "57014407900", "AffiliationID": "60031855", "AffiliationName": "Department of Condensed Matter Physics and Materials Science, Tata Institute of Fundamental Research"}, "57014253400": {"Name": "Kundu S.", "AuthorID": "57014253400", "AffiliationID": "60031855", "AffiliationName": "Department of Condensed Matter Physics and Materials Science, Tata Institute of Fundamental Research"}, "24342874400": {"Name": "Chand M.", "AuthorID": "24342874400", "AffiliationID": "60031855", "AffiliationName": "Department of Condensed Matter Physics and Materials Science, Tata Institute of Fundamental Research"}, "57015130400": {"Name": "Vadiraj A.", "AuthorID": "57015130400", "AffiliationID": "60014171", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Quantum Computing and Electrical, Computer Engineering Department, University of Waterloo"}, "57015187400": {"Name": "Ranadive A.", "AuthorID": "57015187400", "AffiliationID": "60031855", "AffiliationName": "Department of Condensed Matter Physics and Materials Science, Tata Institute of Fundamental Research"}, "57078832300": {"Name": "Nehra N.", "AuthorID": "57078832300", "AffiliationID": "60031855", "AffiliationName": "Department of Condensed Matter Physics and Materials Science, Tata Institute of Fundamental Research"}, "7003640546": {"Name": "Patankar M.", "AuthorID": "7003640546", "AffiliationID": "60031855", "AffiliationName": "Department of Condensed Matter Physics and Materials Science, Tata Institute of Fundamental Research"}, "8337484000": {"Name": "Vijay R.", "AuthorID": "8337484000", "AffiliationID": "60031855", "AffiliationName": "Department of Condensed Matter Physics and Materials Science, Tata Institute of Fundamental Research"}, "6602430743": {"Name": "Aumentado J.", "AuthorID": "6602430743", "AffiliationID": "60023053", "AffiliationName": "National Institute of Standards and Technology"}, "7005574956": {"Name": "Clerk A.", "AuthorID": "7005574956", "AffiliationID": "60002494", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, McGill University"}}}
