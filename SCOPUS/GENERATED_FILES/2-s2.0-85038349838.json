Little is known regarding the cognitive mechanisms that drive these behaviours across a compulsivity spectrum. Here, we used a sequential information gathering task to study indecisiveness in subjects with high and low obsessive-compulsive scores. These subjects were selected from a large population-representative database, and matched for intellectual and psychiatric factors. We show that high compulsive subjects sampled more information and performed better when sampling was cost-free. When sampling was costly, both groups adapted flexibly to reduce their information gathering. Computational modelling revealed that increased information gathering behaviour could be explained by higher decision thresholds that, in turn, were driven by a delayed emergence of impatience or urgency. Our findings show that indecisiveness generalises to a compulsivity spectrum beyond frank clinical disorder, and this behaviour can be explained within a decision-theoretic framework as arising from an augmented decision threshold associated with an attenuated urgency signal.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Compulsive Behavior", "Decision Making", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Models, Psychological", "Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85038349838", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"], ["Biological Psychiatry", "NEUR", "2803"]], "AuthorData": {"55240236800": {"Name": "Hauser T.U.", "AuthorID": "55240236800", "AffiliationID": "60122566", "AffiliationName": "Max Planck UCL Centre for Computational Psychiatry and Ageing Research"}, "6603657495": {"Name": "Moutoussis M.", "AuthorID": "6603657495", "AffiliationID": "60122566", "AffiliationName": "Max Planck UCL Centre for Computational Psychiatry and Ageing Research"}, "55027467100": {"Name": "Dolan R.J.", "AuthorID": "55027467100", "AffiliationID": "60122566", "AffiliationName": "Max Planck UCL Centre for Computational Psychiatry and Ageing Research"}, "7006914663": {"Name": "Dayan P.", "AuthorID": "7006914663", "AffiliationID": "60084280, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit, University College London"}, "null": {"Name": null, "AuthorID": null, "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
