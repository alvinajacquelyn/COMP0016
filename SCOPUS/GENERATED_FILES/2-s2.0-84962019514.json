Brain inflammation is increasingly recognized as a critical factor for seizure precipitation, but the molecular mediators of such proconvulsant effects are only partly understood. The chemokine CCL2 is one of the most elevated inflammatory mediators in patients with pharmacoresistent epilepsy, but its contribution to seizure generation remains unexplored. Here, we show, for the first time, a crucial role for CCL2 and its receptor CCR2 in seizure control. Weimposed a systemic inflammatory challenge via lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration in mice with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. We found that LPS dramatically increased seizure frequency and upregulated the expression of many inflammatory proteins, including CCL2. To test the proconvulsant role of CCL2, we administered systemically either a CCL2 transcription inhibitor (bindarit) or a selective antagonist of the CCR2 receptor (RS102895). We found that interference with CCL2 signaling potently suppressed LPS-induced seizures. Intracerebral administration of anti-CCL2 antibodies also abrogated LPS-mediated seizure enhancement in chronically epileptic animals. Our results reveal that CCL2 is a key mediator in the molecular pathways that link peripheral inflammation with neuronal hyperexcitability.", "AuthorKeywords": ["CCL2", "EEG", "Seizures", "Systemic inflammation", "Temporal lobe epilepsy"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Antibodies", "Benzoxazines", "Chemokine CCL2", "Disease Models, Animal", "Electroencephalography", "Epilepsy, Temporal Lobe", "Excitatory Amino Acid Agonists", "Hippocampus", "Indazoles", "Inflammation", "Kainic Acid", "Lipopolysaccharides", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Piperidines", "Propionates", "Receptors, CCR2", "RNA, Messenger", "Signal Transduction", "Up-Regulation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84962019514", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"]], "AuthorData": {"57195284720": {"Name": "Cerri C.", "AuthorID": "57195284720", "AffiliationID": "60102150", "AffiliationName": "Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei"}, "54985377400": {"Name": "Allegra M.", "AuthorID": "54985377400", "AffiliationID": "60102150", "AffiliationName": "Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei"}, "26421368800": {"Name": "Pistillo F.", "AuthorID": "26421368800", "AffiliationID": "60021199", "AffiliationName": "Neuroscience Institute, National Research Council"}, "6603341607": {"Name": "Bozzi Y.", "AuthorID": "6603341607", "AffiliationID": "60015986", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Molecular Neuropathology, Centre for Integrative Biology, University of Trento"}, "6603589444": {"Name": "Caleo M.", "AuthorID": "6603589444", "AffiliationID": "60021199", "AffiliationName": "Neuroscience Institute, National Research Council"}, "6701813835": {"Name": "Genovesi S.", "AuthorID": "6701813835", "AffiliationID": "60015986", "AffiliationName": "Armenise/Harvard Laboratory of Cancer Biology and Genetics, Centre for Integrative Biology, University of Trento"}, "13008271900": {"Name": "P\u00fcntener U.", "AuthorID": "13008271900", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Biological Sciences, University of Southampton"}, "7101787946": {"Name": "Hugh Perry V.", "AuthorID": "7101787946", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Biological Sciences, University of Southampton"}, "6603759818": {"Name": "Guglielmotti A.", "AuthorID": "6603759818", "AffiliationID": "60118415", "AffiliationName": "Angelini SpA"}}}
