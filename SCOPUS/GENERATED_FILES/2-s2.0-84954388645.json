However, the potentially broad therapeutic implications are largely unexplored. Here, to investigate the therapeutic potential of CRISPR/Cas9 in a diverse set of genetic disorders, we establish a pipeline that uses readily obtainable cells from affected individuals. We show that an adapted version of CRISPR/Cas9 increases the amount of utrophin, a known disease modifier in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Furthermore, we demonstrate preferential elimination of the dominant-negative FGFR3 c.1138G>A allele in fibroblasts of an individual affected by achondroplasia. Using a previously undescribed approach involving single guide RNA, we successfully removed large genome rearrangement in primary cells of an individual with an X chromosome duplication including MECP2. Moreover, removal of a duplication of DMD exons 18-30 in myotubes of an individual affected by DMD produced full-length dystrophin. Our findings establish the far-reaching therapeutic utility of CRISPR/Cas9, which can be tailored to target numerous inherited disorders.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Alleles", "Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats", "Gene Expression", "Genetic Diseases, Inborn", "Humans", "Muscular Dystrophy, Duchenne"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84954388645", "SubjectAreas": [["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Genetics (clinical)", "MEDI", "2716"]], "AuthorData": {"55846087400": {"Name": "Wojtal D.", "AuthorID": "55846087400", "AffiliationID": "60016849", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Genetics, University of Toronto"}, "36608265000": {"Name": "Kemaladewi D.U.", "AuthorID": "36608265000", "AffiliationID": "60030319", "AffiliationName": "Program in Genetics and Genome Biology, Research Institute, Hospital for Sick Children"}, "16230562000": {"Name": "Malam Z.", "AuthorID": "16230562000", "AffiliationID": "60030319", "AffiliationName": "Program in Genetics and Genome Biology, Research Institute, Hospital for Sick Children"}, "57220736641": {"Name": "Abdullah S.", "AuthorID": "57220736641", "AffiliationID": "60030319", "AffiliationName": "Program in Genetics and Genome Biology, Research Institute, Hospital for Sick Children"}, "56999645500": {"Name": "Wong T.W.Y.", "AuthorID": "56999645500", "AffiliationID": "60030319", "AffiliationName": "Program in Genetics and Genome Biology, Research Institute, Hospital for Sick Children"}, "56694295600": {"Name": "Hyatt E.", "AuthorID": "56694295600", "AffiliationID": "60030319", "AffiliationName": "Program in Genetics and Genome Biology, Research Institute, Hospital for Sick Children"}, "42861083600": {"Name": "Baghestani Z.", "AuthorID": "42861083600", "AffiliationID": "60030319", "AffiliationName": "Program in Genetics and Genome Biology, Research Institute, Hospital for Sick Children"}, "7202024620": {"Name": "Pereira S.", "AuthorID": "7202024620", "AffiliationID": "60082763, 60030319", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Applied Genomics, Hospital for Sick Children"}, "36704559400": {"Name": "Gonorazky H.D.", "AuthorID": "36704559400", "AffiliationID": "60016849", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatrics, University of Toronto"}, "36149882300": {"Name": "Dowling J.J.", "AuthorID": "36149882300", "AffiliationID": "60030319", "AffiliationName": "Division of Clinical and Metabolic Genetics, Hospital for Sick Children"}, "56091673300": {"Name": "Wilson M.D.", "AuthorID": "56091673300", "AffiliationID": "60016849", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Genetics, University of Toronto"}, "7801398898": {"Name": "Ivakine E.A.", "AuthorID": "7801398898", "AffiliationID": "60030319", "AffiliationName": "Program in Genetics and Genome Biology, Research Institute, Hospital for Sick Children"}, "7102697029": {"Name": "Cohn R.D.", "AuthorID": "7102697029", "AffiliationID": "60030319", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Genetic Medicine, Hospital for Sick Children"}, "37162261600": {"Name": "Stavropoulos J.", "AuthorID": "37162261600", "AffiliationID": "60016849", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatrics, University of Toronto"}, "6506126587": {"Name": "Mendoza-Londono R.", "AuthorID": "6506126587", "AffiliationID": "60030319", "AffiliationName": "Division of Clinical and Metabolic Genetics, Hospital for Sick Children"}, "7004550582": {"Name": "Mouly V.", "AuthorID": "7004550582", "AffiliationID": "60000905, 60008134, 60157980, 60001422", "AffiliationName": "INSERM UMRS974, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique FRE3617, Center for Research in Myology, Universit\u00e9 Pierre et Marie Curie (Paris 6), Sorbonne Universit\u00e9s"}, "6507658532": {"Name": "Mamchaoui K.", "AuthorID": "6507658532", "AffiliationID": "60000905, 60008134, 60157980, 60001422", "AffiliationName": "INSERM UMRS974, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique FRE3617, Center for Research in Myology, Universit\u00e9 Pierre et Marie Curie (Paris 6), Sorbonne Universit\u00e9s"}, "7102038246": {"Name": "Muntoni F.", "AuthorID": "7102038246", "AffiliationID": "60018207, 60012662", "AffiliationName": "Dubowitz Neuromuscular Centre, Institute of Child Health, Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "55669992000": {"Name": "Voit T.", "AuthorID": "55669992000", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, Institute of Child Health, University College London"}}}
