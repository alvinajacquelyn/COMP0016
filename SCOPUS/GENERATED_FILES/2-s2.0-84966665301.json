Most recent works about unsupervised learning have focused on clustering, showing the potential of ACO-based techniques. However, there are still clustering areas that are almost unexplored using these techniques, such as medoid-based clustering. Medoid-based clustering methods are helpful\u2014compared to classical centroid-based techniques\u2014when centroids cannot be easily defined. This paper proposes two medoid-based ACO clustering algorithms, where the only information needed is the distance between data: one algorithm that uses an ACO procedure to determine an optimal medoid set (METACOC algorithm) and another algorithm that uses an automatic selection of the number of clusters (METACOC-K algorithm). The proposed algorithms are compared against classical clustering approaches using synthetic and real-world datasets.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Adaptive", "Ant colony optimization", "Clustering", "Data mining", "Machine learning", "Medoid"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aco-based algorithms", "Adaptive", "Automatic selection", "Bio-inspired approach", "Clustering", "Medoid", "Real-world datasets", "Supervised and unsupervised learning"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84966665301", "SubjectAreas": [["Artificial Intelligence", "COMP", "1702"]], "AuthorData": {"42661760100": {"Name": "Men\u00e9ndez H.", "AuthorID": "42661760100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "22734530000": {"Name": "Otero F.", "AuthorID": "22734530000", "AffiliationID": "60010818", "AffiliationName": "School of Computing, University of Kent"}, "7003774102": {"Name": "Camacho D.", "AuthorID": "7003774102", "AffiliationID": "60026796", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Madrid"}}}
