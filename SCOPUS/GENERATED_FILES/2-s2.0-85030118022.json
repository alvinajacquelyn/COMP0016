Experiments were conducted in a two stage fixed bed reactor, where plastics were pyrolysed in the first stage followed by reaction of the evolved volatiles over the catalyst in the second stage. Different catalyst temperatures (700, 800, 900 \u00b0C) and steam to plastic ratios (0, 0.3, 1, 2.6) were explored to optimize the product hydrogen and the yield of carbon nanotubes deposited on the catalyst. The results showed that the growth of carbon nanotubes and hydrogen were highly dependent on the catalyst type and the operational parameters. Fe/\u03b3-Al2O3 produced the highest hydrogen yield (22.9 mmol H2/gplastic) and carbon nanotubes yield (195 mg g\u22121plastic) among the monometallic catalysts, followed by Fe/\u03b1-Al2O3, Ni/\u03b3-Al2O3 and Ni/\u03b1-Al2O3. The bimetallic Ni-Fe catalyst showed higher catalytic activity in relation to H2 yield than the monometallic Ni or Fe catalysts because of the optimum interaction between metal and support. Further investigation of the influence of steam input and catalyst temperature on product yields found that the optimum simultaneous production of CNTs (287 mg g\u22121plastic) and hydrogen production (31.8 mmol H2/gplastic) were obtained at 800 \u00b0C in the absence of steam and in the presence of the bimetallic Ni-Fe/\u03b3-Al2O3 catalyst.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Carbon nanotubes", "Hydrogen", "Ni-Fe catalyst", "Plastics", "Waste"], "IndexKeywords": ["Catalyst composition", "Catalyst temperature", "Catalytic pyrolysis", "Fe catalyst", "Fixed bed reactor", "Monometallic catalysts", "Operational parameters", "Support materials"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85030118022", "SubjectAreas": [["Catalysis", "CENG", "1503"], ["Environmental Science (all)", "ENVI", "2300"], ["Process Chemistry and Technology", "CENG", "1508"]], "AuthorData": {"55881284400": {"Name": "Yao D.", "AuthorID": "55881284400", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemical and Process Engineering, University of Leeds"}, "34868886500": {"Name": "Yang H.", "AuthorID": "34868886500", "AffiliationID": "60025761", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Coal Combustion, School of Energy and Power Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"}, "8581957400": {"Name": "Chen H.", "AuthorID": "8581957400", "AffiliationID": "60025761", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Coal Combustion, School of Energy and Power Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"}, "56662820300": {"Name": "Zhang Y.", "AuthorID": "56662820300", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemical and Process Engineering, University of Leeds"}, "7404956386": {"Name": "Williams P.", "AuthorID": "7404956386", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemical and Process Engineering, University of Leeds"}}}
