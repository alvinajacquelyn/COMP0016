Published with license by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.Sexual difficulties are common and can negatively impact health and well-being. A wide range of support is available, but there are multiple barriers to accessing help. Interactive digital interventions (IDIs) for sexual difficulties have the potential to provide a convenient, wide-reaching, and cost-effective source of support, but little is known about who might use them. We explored the potential reach of IDIs by assessing the prevalence of help-seeking among people with distressing sexual difficulties, including who seeks which sources of help. Data came from sexually active men and women, ages 16 to 74, participating in Britain\u2019s third National Survey of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles (Natsal-3) (N = 11,637). Help/advice was sought by less than half of those with distressing sexual difficulties, and help-seeking was associated with younger age in women but not men. The most popular sources of support were family doctor (47.5% to 54.8%), Internet (22.0% to 25.6%), and family/friend (20.7% to 41.8%), with older participants (\u2265 35), particularly men, preferring to seek help from a family doctor, and younger participants (<35) preferring to seek help from the Internet or family/friend. Despite a paucity of good digital support sites for sexual function, the Internet is a common source of help. As Internet access continues to increase, so too does the potential for well-designed IDIs to support those with sexual difficulties.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Female", "Help-Seeking Behavior", "Humans", "Information Seeking Behavior", "Internet-Based Intervention", "Life Style", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Patient Acceptance of Health Care", "Sex Factors", "Sexual Behavior", "Sexual Dysfunctions, Psychological", "United Kingdom", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85063378428", "SubjectAreas": [["Gender Studies", "SOCI", "3318"], ["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"], ["Psychology (all)", "PSYC", "3200"], ["History and Philosophy of Science", "ARTS", "1207"]], "AuthorData": {"37112124300": {"Name": "Hobbs L.J.", "AuthorID": "37112124300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "eHealth Unit, Research Department of Primary Care and Population Health, University College London"}, "7404350273": {"Name": "Bailey J.", "AuthorID": "7404350273", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "eHealth Unit, Research Department of Primary Care and Population Health, University College London"}, "7202670002": {"Name": "Murray E.", "AuthorID": "7202670002", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "eHealth Unit, Research Department of Primary Care and Population Health, University College London"}, "7202163725": {"Name": "Mitchell K.R.", "AuthorID": "7202163725", "AffiliationID": "60001490", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Health and Wellbeing, University of Glasgow"}, "7401504983": {"Name": "Graham C.A.", "AuthorID": "7401504983", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, University of Southampton"}, "57202906059": {"Name": "Trifonova V.", "AuthorID": "57202906059", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Global Health, University College London"}, "47661542700": {"Name": "Prah P.", "AuthorID": "47661542700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Global Health, University College London"}, "7103014246": {"Name": "Mercer C.H.", "AuthorID": "7103014246", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Global Health, University College London"}}}
