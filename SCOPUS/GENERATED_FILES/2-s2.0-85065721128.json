The Fourier transform infrared spectrophotometry, ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometry, and X-ray diffraction analysis displayed characteristic features of PEDOT and TiO2. The morphology of the nano-hybrid structure was additionally investigated by scanning electron microscopy analysis. Pore size and surface area analysis of particles were characterized by the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller method. The electrochemical analysis showed that the specific capacitance (Csp) for PEDOT-TiO2-15-rGO was 18.9 F g\u22121 at 0.1 mA cm\u22122 current density.
