All rights reserved.This chapter focuses on online grooming and solicitation and internet child pornography. These are the two aspects of online abuse that seem to have attracted the most public concern, law enforcement attention and research interest. The chapter proposes a typology within which to organise prevention strategies for online sexual abuse. The typology is based on a fusion of the preventative health care model and the routine activities approach. A comprehensive approach to prevention should include a mix of primary, secondary and tertiary prevention activities targeting offenders, victims and settings. Sexual abuse, including online abuse, relies to a significant extent on children's vulnerabilities associated with their sexual deference to adults. Police are assisted in the task of removing internet child pornography material by various groups such as the Internet Watch Foundation (IWF) and CyberTipline. It is not yet clear whether vulnerabilities associated with online abuse are the same as those associated with contact sexual abuse.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Children's vulnerabilities", "Contact sexual abuse", "Internet child pornography", "Online grooming", "Online safety", "Online sexual abuse", "Online solicitation", "Prevention strategies"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85049819195", "SubjectAreas": [["Social Sciences (all)", "SOCI", "3300"], ["Psychology (all)", "PSYC", "3200"]], "AuthorData": {"6603037767": {"Name": "Smallbone S.", "AuthorID": "6603037767", "AffiliationID": "106900513", "AffiliationName": "Australian Research Council"}, "6603079491": {"Name": "Wortley R.", "AuthorID": "6603079491", "AffiliationID": "120963417", "AffiliationName": "Australian Psychological Society's College of Forensic Psychologists"}}}
