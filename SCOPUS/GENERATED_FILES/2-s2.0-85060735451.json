All rights reserved.According to the argument from inductive risk, scientists have responsibilities to consider the consequences of error when they set evidential standards for making decisions such as accepting or rejecting hypotheses. This argument has received a great deal of scholarly attention in recent years. Exploring Inductive Risk brings together a set of concrete case studies with the goals of illustrating the pervasiveness of inductive risk, assisting scientists and policymakers in responding to it, and moving theoretical discussions of this phenomenon forward. The book contains eleven case studies ranging over a wide range of scientific contexts and fields: the drug approval process, high energy particle physics, dual-use research, climate science, research on gender disparities, clinical trials, and toxicology. The chapters are divided into four parts: (1) weighing inductive risk; (2) evading inductive risk; (3) the breadth of inductive risk; and (4) exploring the limits of inductive risk. It includes an introduction that provides a historical overview of the argument from inductive risk and a conclusion that highlights three major topic areas that merit future research. These include the nature of inductive risk and the argument from inductive risk (AIR), the extent to which the AIR can be evaded by defenders of the value-free ideal, and the strategies that the scientific community can employ to handle inductive risk in a responsible fashion.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Argument from inductive risk", "Climate science", "Clinical trials", "Drug approval", "Dual-use research", "Gender disparities", "High energy physics", "Inductive risk", "Toxicology"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85060735451", "SubjectAreas": [["Arts and Humanities (all)", "ARTS", "1200"]], "AuthorData": {"15131376500": {"Name": "Elliott K.", "AuthorID": "15131376500", "AffiliationID": "60031707", "AffiliationName": "Department of Fisheries and Wildlife, Department of Philosophy, Michigan State University"}, "57205600729": {"Name": "Richards T.", "AuthorID": "57205600729", "AffiliationID": "60014171", "AffiliationName": "University of Waterloo"}}}
