Recent studies suggest two specific principles. First, mood depends on how recent reward outcomes differ from expectations. Second, mood biases the way we perceive outcomes (e.g., rewards), and this bias affects learning about those outcomes. We propose that this two-way interaction serves to mitigate inefficiencies in the application of reinforcement learning to real-world problems. Specifically, we propose that mood represents the overall momentum of recent outcomes, and its biasing influence on the perception of outcomes 'corrects' learning to account for environmental dependencies. We describe potential dysfunctions of this adaptive mechanism that might contribute to the symptoms of mood disorders.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Decision making", "Mood", "Reinforcement learning"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adaptive mechanism", "Mood", "Mood disorders", "Real-world problem", "Two-way interaction", "Affect", "Humans", "Learning", "Reinforcement (Psychology)", "Reward"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84951774934", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuropsychology and Physiological Psychology", "PSYC", "3206"], ["Experimental and Cognitive Psychology", "PSYC", "3205"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"]], "AuthorData": {"23004344800": {"Name": "Eldar E.", "AuthorID": "23004344800", "AffiliationID": "60122566", "AffiliationName": "Max Planck University College London Centre for Computational Psychiatry and Ageing Research"}, "7101911123": {"Name": "Rutledge R.", "AuthorID": "7101911123", "AffiliationID": "60122566", "AffiliationName": "Max Planck University College London Centre for Computational Psychiatry and Ageing Research"}, "55027467100": {"Name": "Dolan R.", "AuthorID": "55027467100", "AffiliationID": "60122566", "AffiliationName": "Max Planck University College London Centre for Computational Psychiatry and Ageing Research"}, "22958379700": {"Name": "Niv Y.", "AuthorID": "22958379700", "AffiliationID": "60003269", "AffiliationName": "Princeton Neuroscience Institute and Psychology Department, Princeton University"}}}
