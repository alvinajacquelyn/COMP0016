This strategy is based on a two-step sequence developed in one-pot at 30 \u00b0C and atmospheric pressure. First, the formation of a reactive peracid intermediate occurs by means of a lipase-catalysed perhydrolysis reaction, and then this peracid acts as a chemical oxidising agent of the amines. A total of nine ketoximes were isolated in high purity after a simple extraction protocol (90-98% isolated yield), while for the eleven synthesised aldoximes a further column chromatography purification was required (71-82% isolated yield). In all cases excellent selectivities were attained, offering a practical method for amine oxidation in short reaction times (1 hour). The environmental impact of the process was analysed and compared with a recently published alternative chemical synthesis, finding for this metric a good E-factor value.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Amine oxidation", "Benzylamines", "Chromatography purifications", "Extraction protocols", "Isolated yield", "Practical method", "Short reaction time", "Step sequences"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85017509773", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"], ["Organic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1605"]], "AuthorData": {"55987305300": {"Name": "M\u00e9ndez-S\u00e1nchez D.", "AuthorID": "55987305300", "AffiliationID": "60006793", "AffiliationName": "Departamento de Qu\u00edmica Org\u00e1nica e Inorg\u00e1nica, Instituto Universitario de Biotecnolog\u00eda de Asturias, Universidad de Oviedo"}, "6505871917": {"Name": "Lavandera I.", "AuthorID": "6505871917", "AffiliationID": "60006793", "AffiliationName": "Departamento de Qu\u00edmica Org\u00e1nica e Inorg\u00e1nica, Instituto Universitario de Biotecnolog\u00eda de Asturias, Universidad de Oviedo"}, "7005873573": {"Name": "Gotor V.", "AuthorID": "7005873573", "AffiliationID": "60006793", "AffiliationName": "Departamento de Qu\u00edmica Org\u00e1nica e Inorg\u00e1nica, Instituto Universitario de Biotecnolog\u00eda de Asturias, Universidad de Oviedo"}, "6506762366": {"Name": "Gotor-Fern\u00e1ndez V.", "AuthorID": "6506762366", "AffiliationID": "60006793", "AffiliationName": "Departamento de Qu\u00edmica Org\u00e1nica e Inorg\u00e1nica, Instituto Universitario de Biotecnolog\u00eda de Asturias, Universidad de Oviedo"}}}
