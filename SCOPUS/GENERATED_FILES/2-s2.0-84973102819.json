This observation has, however, remained to a large extent anecdotal due to the lack of experimental work supporting it, especially for certain timber architectural forms, including traditional timber frame \u201ch\u0131m\u0131\u015f\u201d structures. To fill this gap, the authors carried out an extensive full-scale testing scheme using frames of various geometrical configurations, tested under reverse-cyclic lateral loading with/without infill (brick and adobe) or cladding (ba\u011fdadi and \u015famdolma) (Aktas et al. in Earthq Spectra 30(4):1711\u20131732, 2014a, b). The tests concluded that h\u0131m\u0131\u015f frames had high energy dissipation capabilities due mostly to nailed connections. Infill/cladding significantly helped improve stiffness and lateral load strength of the frames, and timber type did not seem to make a remarkable impact on the overall behaviour. The current paper, on the other hand, uses test data to calculate capacity/demand ratios based on capacity spectrum method and Eurocode 8 to elaborate more on the performance of \u201ch\u0131m\u0131\u015f\u201d structures under seismic loading. The obtained results are discussed to draw important conclusions with regards to how frame geometry and infill/cladding techniques affect the overall performance.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Capacity spectrum method", "h\u0131m\u0131\u015f", "Timber frame"], "IndexKeywords": ["Capacity spectrum method", "Cyclic lateral loading", "Energy dissipation capability", "Geometrical configurations", "Post disaster reconnaissance", "Seismic performance evaluation", "Timber construction", "Timber frames"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84973102819", "SubjectAreas": [["Civil and Structural Engineering", "ENGI", "2205"], ["Building and Construction", "ENGI", "2215"], ["Geotechnical Engineering and Engineering Geology", "EART", "1909"], ["Geophysics", "EART", "1908"]], "AuthorData": {"56254804900": {"Name": "Akta\u015f Y.", "AuthorID": "56254804900", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60012808", "AffiliationName": "Epicentre Research Group, Civil, Environmental and Geomatic Engineering, University College London (UCL)"}, "6602844436": {"Name": "T\u00fcrer A.", "AuthorID": "6602844436", "AffiliationID": "60004305", "AffiliationName": "Civil Engineering Department, Middle East Technical University (METU)"}}}
