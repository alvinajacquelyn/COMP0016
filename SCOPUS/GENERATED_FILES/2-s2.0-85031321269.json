Journal of Clinical Nursing Published by John Wiley & Sons LtdAims and objectives: To determine potential facilitators and barriers and tailor interventions to optimise future implementation of a patient-assessment framework into emergency nursing practice. Background: An evidence-informed patient-assessment framework HIRAID (History, Identify Red flags, Assessment, Interventions, Diagnostics, communication and reassessment) improves the quality of patient assessments performed by emergency nurses. Facilitators and barriers must be understood and tailored interventions selected to optimise implementation. Design: A mixed-method convergent study design was used. Methods: Thirty eight early career emergency nurses from five Australian hospitals participated in an education workshop on the HIRAID assessment framework. Simulated clinical scenarios enabled participants to experience conducting a patient assessment with and without using the framework. All participants completed surveys, interviews and focus groups to identify potential facilitators and barriers. Twenty three participants completed follow-up telephone surveys 4\u20136 months later. Quantitative and qualitative data were analysed separately using descriptive statistics and inductive content analysis, prior to integration. Implementation interventions were selected using the Behaviour Change Wheel. Results: Nine facilitators and nine barriers were identified to potentially effect implementation of the HIRAID assessment framework. Twelve of the 23 participants (52.2%) who completed follow-up surveys reported using the framework in the clinical setting. To optimise future implementation, the education workshop needs refinement, and environmental restructuring, modelling and social support are required. Conclusion: A multimodal strategy is needed to promote future successful implementation of the HIRAID assessment framework into emergency nursing practice. Relevance for clinical practice: The successful implementation of the HIRAID assessment framework has the potential to improve nursing assessments of patients in emergency and other acute care settings. This study demonstrates how to systematically identify facilitators and barriers to behaviour change and select interventions to optimise implementation of evidence-informed nursing practices.", "AuthorKeywords": ["behaviour change theory", "emergency department", "evidence-base practice", "implementation science", "nursing", "nursing assessment", "patient assessment"], "IndexKeywords": ["Emergency Nursing", "Evidence-Based Nursing", "Focus Groups", "Humans", "Nursing Assessment", "Nursing Staff, Hospital", "Qualitative Research", "Surveys and Questionnaires"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85031321269", "SubjectAreas": [["Nursing (all)", "NURS", "2900"]], "AuthorData": {"7801350338": {"Name": "Munroe B.", "AuthorID": "7801350338", "AffiliationID": "119559681", "AffiliationName": "Emergency Services, Illawarra Shoalhaven Local Health District"}, "7102811087": {"Name": "Curtis K.", "AuthorID": "7102811087", "AffiliationID": "119559681", "AffiliationName": "Emergency Services, Illawarra Shoalhaven Local Health District"}, "7101745351": {"Name": "Buckley T.", "AuthorID": "7101745351", "AffiliationID": "60025709", "AffiliationName": "Sydney Nursing School, University of Sydney"}, "35173048700": {"Name": "Lewis M.", "AuthorID": "35173048700", "AffiliationID": "60025709", "AffiliationName": "Educational Innovation, University of Sydney"}, "7005842007": {"Name": "Atkins L.", "AuthorID": "7005842007", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Behaviour Change, University College London"}}}
