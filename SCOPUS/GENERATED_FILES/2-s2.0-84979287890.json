The synthesis machine incorporates the use of amine-redox chemistry through diazotization and a metal-free Vitamin C mediated reduction. The machine can be used for the synthesis of an array of analogues or the scale up of an individual target.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84979287890", "SubjectAreas": [["Catalysis", "CENG", "1503"], ["Chemistry (miscellaneous)", "CHEM", "1601"], ["Chemical Engineering (miscellaneous)", "CENG", "1501"], ["Process Chemistry and Technology", "CENG", "1508"], ["Fluid Flow and Transfer Processes", "CENG", "1507"]], "AuthorData": {"56664364200": {"Name": "Poh J.", "AuthorID": "56664364200", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge"}, "23018311500": {"Name": "Browne D.", "AuthorID": "23018311500", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, Cardiff University Main Building"}, "55540158700": {"Name": "Ley S.", "AuthorID": "55540158700", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge"}}}
