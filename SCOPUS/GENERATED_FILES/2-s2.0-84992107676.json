The minimally invasive surgery (MIS) techniques have recently gained increasing attention. However, their use is still limited to lumbar burst fractures mainly due to their difficulties in burst fracture reduction and decompression. Here we present a novel bio-inspired MIS device which can be used with an endoscope to reset the bone fragments retropulsed into the spinal canal within the wounded vertebral body. Its head jaw mimics the biomechanical characteristics of a crocodile rostrum to improve the performance in gripping and moving bone pieces in the confined space of a vertebral body. This study may be capable of converting the posterior open surgeries to the MIS procedures, and expands the use of the MIS techniques in the treatment of lumbar burst fractures.", "AuthorKeywords": ["biomimetics", "lumbar burst fracture", "MIS device", "reduction"], "IndexKeywords": ["Biomechanical characteristics", "Bone fragments", "Burst fracture", "Confined space", "Fracture reduction", "Minimally invasive surgeries (MIS)", "Neurological deficit", "Treatment methods", "Alligators and Crocodiles", "Animals", "Biomechanical Phenomena", "Biomimetic Materials", "Decompression, Surgical", "Equipment Design", "Fracture Fixation", "Fractures, Comminuted", "Humans", "Jaw", "Lumbar Vertebrae", "Skull", "Spinal Fractures"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84992107676", "SubjectAreas": [["Biotechnology", "BIOC", "1305"], ["Biophysics", "BIOC", "1304"], ["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Molecular Medicine", "BIOC", "1313"], ["Engineering (miscellaneous)", "ENGI", "2201"]], "AuthorData": {"23995730400": {"Name": "Li J.", "AuthorID": "23995730400", "AffiliationID": "60004538", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory for Micro/Nano Technology and System of Liaoning Province, Dalian University of Technology"}, "57191625693": {"Name": "Guo L.", "AuthorID": "57191625693", "AffiliationID": "60004538", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory for Micro/Nano Technology and System of Liaoning Province, Dalian University of Technology"}, "57191612670": {"Name": "Shi W.", "AuthorID": "57191612670", "AffiliationID": "60004538", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory for Micro/Nano Technology and System of Liaoning Province, Dalian University of Technology"}, "57206666665": {"Name": "Li T.", "AuthorID": "57206666665", "AffiliationID": "60004538", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory for Micro/Nano Technology and System of Liaoning Province, Dalian University of Technology"}, "55680743700": {"Name": "Liu C.", "AuthorID": "55680743700", "AffiliationID": "60004538, 60001604", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory for Precision and Non-traditional Machining Technology, Ministry of Education, Dalian University of Technology"}, "55491229500": {"Name": "Li Y.", "AuthorID": "55491229500", "AffiliationID": "60005229", "AffiliationName": "Department of Orthopedics, First Affiliated Hospital, Dalian Medical University"}, "7202931672": {"Name": "Lei Z.", "AuthorID": "7202931672", "AffiliationID": "60004538, 60126534", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Structural Analysis for Industrial Equipment, Dalian University of Technology"}, "57216171730": {"Name": "Li W.", "AuthorID": "57216171730", "AffiliationID": "60004538, 60126534", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Structural Analysis for Industrial Equipment, Dalian University of Technology"}, "56515441900": {"Name": "Liu Y.", "AuthorID": "56515441900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}}}
