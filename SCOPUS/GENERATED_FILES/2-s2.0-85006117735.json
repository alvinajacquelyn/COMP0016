We show here a straightforward coupling mechanism that promises 100% efficiency. We exploit the THz pulse generation process from photoexcited charge density gradients to create a radially-polarized THz pulse with the profile matching the fundamental mode profile of the coaxial waveguide. Single mode propagation is demonstrated at the output of the coaxial waveguide.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Coaxial waveguides", "Coupling efficiency", "Coupling mechanism", "Fundamental mode profiles", "Linearly polarized", "Radially polarized", "Single mode propagation", "Thz pulse generations"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85006117735", "SubjectAreas": [["Energy Engineering and Power Technology", "ENER", "2102"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"22980776600": {"Name": "Navarro-Cia M.", "AuthorID": "22980776600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "10141185300": {"Name": "Wu J.", "AuthorID": "10141185300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "15765485000": {"Name": "Liu H.", "AuthorID": "15765485000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "7003451569": {"Name": "Mitrofanov O.", "AuthorID": "7003451569", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}}}
