HORNET is designed as a low-latency onion routing system that operates at the network layer thus enabling a wide range of applications. Our system uses only symmetric cryptography for data forwarding yet requires no per-flow state on intermediate routers. This design enables HORNET routers implemented on off-the-shelf hardware to process anonymous traffic at over 93 Gb/s. HORNET is also highly scalable, adding minimal processing overhead per additional anonymous channel.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Anonymity", "Network layer", "Onion routing"], "IndexKeywords": ["Anonymity", "Data-forwarding", "Intermediate routers", "Minimal processing", "Off-the-shelf hardwares", "Onion routing", "Per-flow state", "Symmetric cryptography"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84954119511", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"]], "AuthorData": {"57051864600": {"Name": "Chen C.", "AuthorID": "57051864600", "AffiliationID": "60025858", "AffiliationName": "ETH Z\u00fcrich"}, "57053394100": {"Name": "Asoni D.E.", "AuthorID": "57053394100", "AffiliationID": "60025858", "AffiliationName": "ETH Z\u00fcrich"}, "56889298800": {"Name": "Barrera D.", "AuthorID": "56889298800", "AffiliationID": "60025858", "AffiliationName": "ETH Z\u00fcrich"}, "6603929649": {"Name": "Perrig A.", "AuthorID": "6603929649", "AffiliationID": "60025858", "AffiliationName": "ETH Z\u00fcrich"}, "57200734488": {"Name": "Danezis G.", "AuthorID": "57200734488", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
