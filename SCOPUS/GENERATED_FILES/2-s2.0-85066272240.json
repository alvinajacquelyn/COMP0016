Successive national and international policy documents emphasise the need to improve preconception health, but resources and action have not followed through with these goals. We argue for a dual intervention strategy at both the public health level (eg, by improving the food environment) and at the individual level (eg, by better identification of those planning a pregnancy who would benefit from support to optimise health before conception) in order to raise awareness of preconception health and to normalise the notion of planning and preparing for pregnancy. Existing strategies that target common risks factors, such as obesity and smoking, should recognise the preconception period as one that offers special opportunity for intervention, based on evidence from life-course epidemiology, developmental (embryo) programming around the time of conception, and maternal motivation. To describe and monitor preconception health in England, we propose an annual report card using metrics from multiple routine data sources. Such a report card should serve to hold governments and other relevant agencies to account for delivering interventions to improve preconception health.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["England", "Female", "Health Policy", "Humans", "Preconception Care", "Pregnancy", "Pregnancy Complications", "Pregnancy Outcome", "Program Development", "Quality Indicators, Health Care"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85066272240", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"7401715373": {"Name": "Stephenson J.", "AuthorID": "7401715373", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Elizabeth Garrett Anderson Institute for Women's Health, University College London"}, "57217396240": {"Name": "Hall J.", "AuthorID": "57217396240", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Elizabeth Garrett Anderson Institute for Women's Health, University College London"}, "7102177355": {"Name": "Barrett G.", "AuthorID": "7102177355", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Elizabeth Garrett Anderson Institute for Women's Health, University College London"}, "8655661200": {"Name": "Conti G.", "AuthorID": "8655661200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Economics and Department of Social Science, University College London"}, "37066519500": {"Name": "Shannon G.", "AuthorID": "37066519500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Global Health Epidemiology and Evaluation, UCL Institute for Global Health, University College London"}, "16021435300": {"Name": "Colbourn T.", "AuthorID": "16021435300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Global Health Epidemiology and Evaluation, UCL Institute for Global Health, University College London"}, "56909528600": {"Name": "Vogel C.", "AuthorID": "56909528600", "AffiliationID": "60025225, 60023615", "AffiliationName": "MRC Lifecourse Epidemiology Unit, University of Southampton"}, "7202354001": {"Name": "Barker M.", "AuthorID": "7202354001", "AffiliationID": "60025225, 60023615", "AffiliationName": "MRC Lifecourse Epidemiology Unit, University of Southampton"}, "57202558797": {"Name": "Hanson M.", "AuthorID": "57202558797", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Developmental Sciences, University of Southampton"}, "37661453100": {"Name": "Hutchinson J.", "AuthorID": "37661453100", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "Nutritional Epidemiology Group, School of Food Science and Nutrition, University of Leeds"}, "7005622445": {"Name": "Cade J.", "AuthorID": "7005622445", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "Nutritional Epidemiology Group, School of Food Science and Nutrition, University of Leeds"}, "36911193000": {"Name": "Mann S.", "AuthorID": "36911193000", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "Public Health England"}, "57209010793": {"Name": "Duncan H.", "AuthorID": "57209010793", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "Public Health England"}, "55388651700": {"Name": "Woods-Townsend K.", "AuthorID": "55388651700", "AffiliationID": "60176936, 60175924, 60025225, 60000703", "AffiliationName": "Southampton Education School, University of Southampton and NIHR Southampton Biomedical Research Centre, University Hospital Southampton"}, "7003334937": {"Name": "de Lusignan S.", "AuthorID": "7003334937", "AffiliationID": "60113753", "AffiliationName": "Royal College of General Practitioners"}, "55791911200": {"Name": "Poston L.", "AuthorID": "55791911200", "AffiliationID": "60004111, 60177635", "AffiliationName": "School of Life Course Sciences, Faculty of Life Sciences and Medicine, King's College London, St Thomas Hospital"}, "26643416200": {"Name": "Godfrey K.", "AuthorID": "26643416200", "AffiliationID": "60023615, 60175924, 60025225, 60000703", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Southampton Biomedical Research Centre, MRC Lifecourse Epidemiology Unit (University of Southampton), University Hospital Southampton"}, "null": {"Name": null, "AuthorID": null, "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
