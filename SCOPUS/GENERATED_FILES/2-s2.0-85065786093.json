The developmental brain changes accounting for this emergent psychiatric symptomatology remain obscure. Capitalizing on a unique longitudinal dataset that includes in vivo myelin-sensitive magnetization transfer (MT) MRI scans, we show that this developmental period is characterized by brain-wide growth in MT trajectories within both gray matter and adjacent juxtacortical white matter. In this healthy population, the expression of common developmental traits, namely compulsivity and impulsivity, is tied to a reduced growth of these MT trajectories in frontostriatal regions. This reduction is most marked in dorsomedial and dorsolateral prefrontal regions for compulsivity and in lateral and medial prefrontal regions for impulsivity. These findings highlight that psychiatric traits of compulsivity and impulsivity are linked to regionally specific reductions in myelin-related growth in late adolescent brain development.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Compulsive Behavior", "Female", "Humans", "Impulsive Behavior", "Male", "Prefrontal Cortex", "White Matter", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85065786093", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"]], "AuthorData": {"35254725100": {"Name": "Ziegler G.", "AuthorID": "35254725100", "AffiliationID": "60103674", "AffiliationName": "German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE)"}, "55240236800": {"Name": "Hauser T.U.", "AuthorID": "55240236800", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60084279", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging, University College London"}, "6603657495": {"Name": "Moutoussis M.", "AuthorID": "6603657495", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60084279", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging, University College London"}, "7003644686": {"Name": "Lindenberger U.", "AuthorID": "7003644686", "AffiliationID": "60026562", "AffiliationName": "Center for Lifespan Psychology, Max Planck Institute for Human Development"}, "57210439880": {"Name": "Dolan R.J.", "AuthorID": "57210439880", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60084279", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging, University College London"}, "35405771500": {"Name": "Bullmore E.T.", "AuthorID": "35405771500", "AffiliationID": "60020649", "AffiliationName": "ImmunoPsychiatry, GlaxoSmithKline Research and Development"}, "7005728308": {"Name": "Goodyer I.M.", "AuthorID": "7005728308", "AffiliationID": "60005210", "AffiliationName": "Cambridgeshire and Peterborough National Health Service Foundation Trust"}, "26021246400": {"Name": "Jones P.B.", "AuthorID": "26021246400", "AffiliationID": "60005210", "AffiliationName": "Cambridgeshire and Peterborough National Health Service Foundation Trust"}, "7004981532": {"Name": "Fonagy P.", "AuthorID": "7004981532", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London"}, "null": {"Name": null, "AuthorID": null, "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
