Rietveld refinement of high-resolution time-of-flight neutron powder diffraction measurements indicate that this compound crystallizes in the hexagonal system with space group P63/m, Z = 1 and unit cell parameters a = 9.88903(6) \u00c5, c = 7.25602(5) \u00c5, V = 614.521(7) \u00c53 at room temperature. The 4f sites are statistically occupied by La, Nd and Na, while 6h sites are occupied by La and Nd. Luminescence in the near- and middle-IR range caused by the transitions in neodymium and holmium ions is excited under 808 nm laser diode radiation. The highest emission intensity in NaLa9-x-yNdxHoy(GeO4)6O2 is attained at trace amounts of holmium, and it decreases sharply when y increases to 0.01. The IR phosphors have a good thermal stability and exhibit a very weak upconversion emission in the red spectral range upon 808 nm excitation. A scheme of excitation and emission pathways involving ground/excited state absorption, energy transfer, cross-relaxation, nonradiative multiphonon relaxation processes in Nd3+ and Ho3+ ions has been proposed. The data analysis indicates that Nd3+ ions serve as sensitizers for Ho3+ ions in these compounds, stimulating intense 2.1 \u03bcm and 2.7 \u03bcm emissions. These apatite-related germanate phosphors are promising materials for near- and middle-infrared solid-state lighting applications.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85054771395", "SubjectAreas": [["Inorganic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1604"]], "AuthorData": {"36570014400": {"Name": "Baklanova Y.V.", "AuthorID": "36570014400", "AffiliationID": "60107421, 60021331", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Solid State Chemistry, UB RAS"}, "57191800089": {"Name": "Lipina O.A.", "AuthorID": "57191800089", "AffiliationID": "60107421, 60021331", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Solid State Chemistry, UB RAS"}, "35618885800": {"Name": "Enyashin A.N.", "AuthorID": "35618885800", "AffiliationID": "60107421, 60021331", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Solid State Chemistry, UB RAS"}, "6701320467": {"Name": "Surat L.L.", "AuthorID": "6701320467", "AffiliationID": "60107421, 60021331", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Solid State Chemistry, UB RAS"}, "7003349662": {"Name": "Tyutyunnik A.P.", "AuthorID": "7003349662", "AffiliationID": "60107421, 60021331", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Solid State Chemistry, UB RAS"}, "54787426500": {"Name": "Chufarov A.Y.", "AuthorID": "54787426500", "AffiliationID": "60107421, 60021331", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Solid State Chemistry, UB RAS"}, "57200293461": {"Name": "Gorbatov E.V.", "AuthorID": "57200293461", "AffiliationID": "60107421, 60021331", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Solid State Chemistry, UB RAS"}, "7103014714": {"Name": "Zubkov V.G.", "AuthorID": "7103014714", "AffiliationID": "60107421, 60021331", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Solid State Chemistry, UB RAS"}, "57195241264": {"Name": "Tarakina N.V.", "AuthorID": "57195241264", "AffiliationID": "60022109", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering and Materials Science, Queen Mary University of London"}, "7004475745": {"Name": "Fortes A.D.", "AuthorID": "7004475745", "AffiliationID": "60001724, 60023254", "AffiliationName": "ISIS Facility, Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, Harwell Science and Innovation Campus"}}}
