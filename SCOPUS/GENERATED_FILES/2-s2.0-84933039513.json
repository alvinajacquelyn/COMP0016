Service providers face high implementation and management costs. Users must absorb the increased effort, as choice comes at a cost. A 2013 behavioral lab experiment on Web search privacy found that three times as many users were willing to pay extra to enhance the quality of their search results than to enhance their queries' privacy. Service providers can offer incentives such as discounts or work with smart defaults to guide their customers. In return, users navigate effortlessly through a series of simple choices, often either providing or withholding information at will or deciding on permissible uses for a data item. Companies that offer privacy negotiations benefit from higher data quality, as their customers no longer need to resort to providing fake details when coping with mandatory form fields.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Data items", "Data quality", "Internet users", "Management costs", "Service provider", "Web searches"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84933039513", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"], ["Law", "SOCI", "3308"]], "AuthorData": {"55549394300": {"Name": "Krol K.", "AuthorID": "55549394300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "22954415000": {"Name": "Preibusch S.", "AuthorID": "22954415000", "AffiliationID": "60006191", "AffiliationName": "Google"}}}
