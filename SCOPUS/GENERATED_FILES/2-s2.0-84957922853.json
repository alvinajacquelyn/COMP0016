Drug development for TB, stymied for decades, has enjoyed a renaissance over the past several years. However, the development of new TB regimens is hindered by the limitations in our understanding and use of preclinical models; the paucity of accurate, early surrogate markers of cure, and challenges in untangling the individual contributions of drugs to multidrug regimens in a complex, multi-compartment disease. Lack of profit motive, advocacy, and imagination has contributed mightily to the dearth of drugs we have on the shelf to treat this ancient disease. Areas that will speed the development of new regimens for TB include novel murine and in vitro pharmacodynamics models, clinical endpoints that are not culture-based, innovative clinical trial designs, and an infusion of much-needed funding.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Hollow fiber model", "Mouse model", "Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic", "Translational science", "Trial design", "Tuberculosis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Hollow fiber", "Mouse models", "Translational science", "Trial designs", "Tuberculosis", "Animals", "Antitubercular Agents", "Drug Discovery", "Drug Evaluation", "Drug Evaluation, Preclinical", "Humans", "Mice", "Mycobacterium tuberculosis", "Tuberculosis", "Tuberculosis, Multidrug-Resistant"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84957922853", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmaceutical Science", "PHAR", "3003"]], "AuthorData": {"35616578800": {"Name": "Dooley K.", "AuthorID": "35616578800", "AffiliationID": "60001117", "AffiliationName": "Divisions of Clinical Pharmacology and Infectious Diseases, Center for Tuberculosis Research, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine"}, "18234077800": {"Name": "Phillips P.", "AuthorID": "18234077800", "AffiliationID": "60003108, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "MRC Clinical Trials Unit at UCL"}, "6507099787": {"Name": "Nahid P.", "AuthorID": "6507099787", "AffiliationID": "60023691, 60003214", "AffiliationName": "Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, at San Francisco General Hospital"}, "57203032681": {"Name": "Hoelscher M.", "AuthorID": "57203032681", "AffiliationID": "116341933", "AffiliationName": "German Centre for Infection Research"}}}
