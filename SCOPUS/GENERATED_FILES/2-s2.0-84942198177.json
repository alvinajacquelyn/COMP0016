This article explores the potential risks associated with repackaging medications into MCAs for pharmacists who supply and patients who use them. Key findings There is a paucity of information currently available to pharmacists concerning the stability of medications repackaged into MCAs as it is not routinely provided by pharmaceutical manufacturers. However, some studies have identified the potential for adverse effects on safety, bioavailability and stability that may have a clinical impact. There are also professional and legal implications of removing medications from their original packaging for storage in MCAs. Conclusion There is a growing need for further information concerning the stability of medications repackaged into MCAs to guide pharmacists who are supplying these compliance aids to primary and secondary care. Pharmaceutical manufacturers and researchers should be advised to conduct stability testing in MCAs for orally administered medications. This information should be readily available, and pharmacists should be made aware of it via their pharmaceutical bodies. As a result, decisions regarding MCA preparation can be more informed, and pharmacist and patient risks associated with repackaging potentially unstable medications can be minimised.", "AuthorKeywords": ["community pharmacy", "compliance AIDS", "dispensing", "product handling"], "IndexKeywords": ["Drug Packaging", "Drug Stability", "Humans", "Medication Adherence", "Pharmacists"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84942198177", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmacy", "HEAL", "3611"], ["Pharmaceutical Science", "PHAR", "3003"], ["Health Policy", "MEDI", "2719"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"55621888000": {"Name": "Gilmartin J.F.M.", "AuthorID": "55621888000", "AffiliationID": "60019578", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medicine Use and Safety, Faculty of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Monash University"}, "6603352762": {"Name": "Jani Y.", "AuthorID": "6603352762", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Pharmacy Department, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7402856186": {"Name": "Smith F.", "AuthorID": "7402856186", "AffiliationID": "60016379", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Practice and Policy, University College London School of Pharmacy"}, "55948967400": {"Name": "Raimi-Abraham B.T.", "AuthorID": "55948967400", "AffiliationID": "60016379", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Pharmaceutics, University College London School of Pharmacy"}, "55761363900": {"Name": "Orlu-Gul M.", "AuthorID": "55761363900", "AffiliationID": "60016379", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Pharmaceutics, University College London School of Pharmacy"}}}
