The aim was to describe the issues young people experienced and identify interventions to support AYA at the end of treatment. Methods: We conducted a rapid review of published primary research to identify what is currently known about AYA experiences of the end of treatment, the issues which arise and existing interventions to support AYA at this time. Results: Searches identified 540 papers of which 16 met the inclusion criteria. Five main themes were identified: physical/medical issues; psychological, social and emotional issues; information and support needs; sources of information and support; and difficulties accessing information and support. Within these broader themes, several subthemes were identified and explored further. Conclusion: Adolescents and young adults are under prepared for the unpredictable and ongoing nature of the physical, psychological and social issues they face at the end of cancer treatment. Enabling young people's inclusion within their relevant social and educational peer networks should be a priority. Timely, structured and equitable information/support is needed to prepare AYA for treatment ending and subsequent reintegration to \u201ceveryday\u201d life.", "AuthorKeywords": ["early consequences", "early survivorship", "end of treatment", "teenagers", "transition", "young people"], "IndexKeywords": ["Access to Information", "Adolescent", "Adult", "Cancer Survivors", "Emotions", "Health Services Needs and Demand", "Humans", "Neoplasms", "Patient Transfer", "Social Support", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85057503043", "SubjectAreas": [["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"]], "AuthorData": {"56669433600": {"Name": "Lea S.", "AuthorID": "56669433600", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57054859300": {"Name": "Martins A.", "AuthorID": "57054859300", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "23979721800": {"Name": "Fern L.A.", "AuthorID": "23979721800", "AffiliationID": "120822119", "AffiliationName": "National Cancer Research Institute"}, "6506899099": {"Name": "Soanes L.", "AuthorID": "6506899099", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57202910374": {"Name": "Taylor R.M.", "AuthorID": "57202910374", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57204842867": {"Name": "Bassett M.", "AuthorID": "57204842867", "AffiliationID": "60112922", "AffiliationName": "Teenage Cancer Trust"}, "57204839738": {"Name": "Doig G.", "AuthorID": "57204839738", "AffiliationID": "60112922", "AffiliationName": "Teenage Cancer Trust"}, "56455759500": {"Name": "Smith S.", "AuthorID": "56455759500", "AffiliationID": "60112922", "AffiliationName": "Teenage Cancer Trust"}, "28267554900": {"Name": "Cable M.", "AuthorID": "28267554900", "AffiliationID": "60017326", "AffiliationName": "Coventry University"}, "57204848223": {"Name": "Whelan M.", "AuthorID": "57204848223", "AffiliationID": "60017326", "AffiliationName": "Coventry University"}, "55836086800": {"Name": "Morgan S.", "AuthorID": "55836086800", "AffiliationID": "60012508", "AffiliationName": "Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust"}}}
