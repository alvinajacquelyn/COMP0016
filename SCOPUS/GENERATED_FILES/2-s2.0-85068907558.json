It addresses contemporary concern that formative assessment, of which feedback is a part, is under theorised. The arguments presented link to existing theoretical and research evidence. The paper also challenges the dominant policy discourse in high stakes assessment contexts in which feedback is typically seen in technised ways to serve the need to raise measured pupil outcomes. Vygotsky\u2019s notion of the zone of proximal development is explored as a relational space in which both teachers and learners understand differences between learning \u2018now\u2019 and learning \u2018next\u2019. Extending Vygotsky\u2019s perspective, a socio-cultural perspective is offered, by considering the role of \u2018others\u2019, \u2018language\u2019, \u2018activity\u2019 and \u2018identity\u2019, as part of the process of sharing and understanding feedback in classrooms. The work of Holland et al. (1998), Bakhtin (1986) are central to the developing argument. The paper reveals feedback as a complex situated process, requiring mediated dynamic interaction, where feedback is appropriated as a cultural artefact by its participants. The implications of such an articulation demands a greater sense of understanding pupils\u2019 roles in feedback and the importance of teachers enabling pupils to see themselves in new ways as future learners.", "AuthorKeywords": ["agency", "Assessment", "classroom assessment", "dialogical", "feedback", "figured world", "formative assessment", "identity"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85068907558", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"]], "AuthorData": {"55096462700": {"Name": "Dann R.", "AuthorID": "55096462700", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Education, Curriculum, Pedagogy and Assessment, University College London"}}}
