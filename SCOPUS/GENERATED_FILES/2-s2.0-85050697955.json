This paper presents an integrated model to support the scale-up of the AACVD process, which is comprised of three modules: aerosol generation, transport and delivery. Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) method is used to generate input data for the sensitivity and uncertainty analysis. Based on industrial ranges of process parameters, the incorporation of AACVD into current TCO industrial plants, without replacing their existing facilities, was found to be mainly impacted by the flow rates, the length of the transport system and the temperature of the chemical deposition site.", "AuthorKeywords": ["AACVD", "aerosol", "LHS", "machine learning", "process scale-up"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85050697955", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"]], "AuthorData": {"57200504716": {"Name": "Filho P.", "AuthorID": "57200504716", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Process Systems Engineering, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "7004488806": {"Name": "Angeli P.", "AuthorID": "7004488806", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Process Systems Engineering, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "7006429775": {"Name": "Fraga E.", "AuthorID": "7006429775", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Process Systems Engineering, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}}}
