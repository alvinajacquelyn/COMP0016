Performing comparison studies between breast imaging systems poses a number of practical challenges within a clinical environment. We therefore adopted a simulation approach which included synthetic breast blocks, a validated lesion simulation model and a set of validated image modelling tools as a viable alternative to clinical trials. A series of 4-alternative forced choice (4AFC) human observer experiments has been conducted for signal detection tasks using masses and spheres as targets. Five physicists participated in the study viewing images with a 5mm target at a range of contrast levels and 60 trials per experimental condition. The results showed that tomosynthesis has a lower threshold contrast than 2D-mammography for masses and spheres, and that detection studies using spheres may produce overly-optimistic threshold contrast values.", "AuthorKeywords": ["2D-mammography", "4AFC study", "DBT", "Modelling tools", "Tomosynthesis", "Virtual trials"], "IndexKeywords": ["4AFC study", "DBT", "Modelling tools", "Tomosynthesis", "Virtual trials"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84943339607", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"], ["Biomaterials", "MATE", "2502"], ["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"19640003600": {"Name": "Elangovan P.", "AuthorID": "19640003600", "AffiliationID": "60021097", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Vision, Speech and Signal Processing, University of Surrey"}, "55201317000": {"Name": "Rashidnasab A.", "AuthorID": "55201317000", "AffiliationID": "60028760", "AffiliationName": "NCCPM, Royal Surrey County Hospital"}, "55937364900": {"Name": "Wells K.", "AuthorID": "55937364900", "AffiliationID": "60021097", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Vision, Speech and Signal Processing, University of Surrey"}, "18037479800": {"Name": "Mackenzie A.", "AuthorID": "18037479800", "AffiliationID": "60021097", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of Surrey"}, "7006548404": {"Name": "Dance D.", "AuthorID": "7006548404", "AffiliationID": "60021097", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of Surrey"}, "7402601205": {"Name": "Young K.", "AuthorID": "7402601205", "AffiliationID": "60021097", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of Surrey"}, "7005849463": {"Name": "Bosmans H.", "AuthorID": "7005849463", "AffiliationID": "60031069", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, University Hospitals Leuven"}, "35211893200": {"Name": "Segars W.", "AuthorID": "35211893200", "AffiliationID": "60008724", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Duke University"}}}
