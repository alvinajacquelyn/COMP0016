This may cause insufficiency in the aortic valve under long-term CF-LVAD support. The aim of this study is to assess the aortic valve function under varying speed CF-LVAD support. A Medtronic freestyle valve and a Micromed DeBakey CF-LVAD were tested in a mock circulatory system. First, the CF-LVAD was operated at constant speeds between 7500 and 11,500 rpm with 1000 rpm intervals. The mean pump outputs obtained from these tests were applied in varying speed CF-LVAD support mode using a reference model for the pump flow. The peak of the instantaneous pump flow was applied at peak systole and mid-diastole, respectively. Ejection durations and in the aortic valve were the longest when the peak pump flow was applied at mid-diastole among the CF-LVAD operating modes. Furthermore, mean aortic valve area over a cardiac cycle was highest when the peak pump flow was applied at mid-diastole. The results show that changing phase of the reference flow rate signal may reduce the effects of the CF-LVADs on altered aortic valve closing behavior, without compromising the overall pump support level.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Aortic valve", "Aortic valve area", "Aortic valve insufficiency", "CF-LVAD", "Varying speed CF-LVAD support"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aortic valves", "Cardiac cycles", "Constant speed", "Continuous flows", "Left ventricular", "Mock circulatory systems", "Operating modes", "Reference modeling", "Animals", "Aortic Valve", "Heart-Assist Devices", "Hemodynamics", "Humans", "Models, Cardiovascular"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84937922193", "SubjectAreas": [["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"]], "AuthorData": {"35100053600": {"Name": "Bozkurt S.", "AuthorID": "35100053600", "AffiliationID": "60032882", "AffiliationName": "Eindhoven University of Technology"}, "7004415668": {"Name": "van de Vosse F.", "AuthorID": "7004415668", "AffiliationID": "60032882", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Eindhoven University of Technology"}, "7006945383": {"Name": "Rutten M.", "AuthorID": "7006945383", "AffiliationID": "60032882", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Eindhoven University of Technology"}}}
