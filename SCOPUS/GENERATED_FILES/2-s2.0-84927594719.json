The aim of this study was to describe the epidemiology and clinical characteristics of UTIs/bacteriuria due to ESBL-GNB in Australia. Methods: At a single-site tertiary referral hospital, 100 cases with UTIs/bacteriuria due to ESBL-GNB were matched to 100 cases where UTIs/bacteriuria were caused by organisms matching the ESBL bacterial species that had routine susceptibility to antibiotics. Potential risk factors for ESBL-GNB UTI/bacteriuria and differences in clinical outcomes were identified. Results: Length of admission prior to positive sample (odds ratio (OR) 1.3, p= 0.03, per week), exposure to antibiotics (OR 5.7, p<. 0.001), return from overseas travel (OR 6.5, p= 0.002), and nursing home residency (OR 4.2, p= 0.03) were identified as risk factors associated with ESBL-GNB UTI/bacteriuria in the multivariate analysis. In addition, ESBL-GNB-infected cases subsequently had a longer inpatient stay (median 6 vs. 2 days, p= 0.002) and were admitted to the intensive care unit more frequently (28/100 vs. 8/100, p<. 0.001). Conclusions: Our results emphasize the need for culture of a mid-stream urine specimen prior to commencing antibacterials, especially in patients with the risk factors identified herein associated with ESBL-GNB UTI/bacteriuria.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Antibiotic resistance", "ESBL", "Gram-negative bacteria", "Urinary tract infection"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Anti-Bacterial Agents", "Australia", "beta-Lactamases", "Community-Acquired Infections", "Female", "Gram-Negative Bacteria", "Humans", "Intensive Care Units", "Length of Stay", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Prognosis", "Risk Factors", "Tertiary Care Centers", "Urinary Tract Infections"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84927594719", "SubjectAreas": [["Microbiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2726"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"35077959700": {"Name": "Osthoff M.", "AuthorID": "35077959700", "AffiliationID": "60028287", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infectious Diseases and Hospital Epidemiology, University Hospital Basel"}, "57189971913": {"Name": "McGuinness S.", "AuthorID": "57189971913", "AffiliationID": "60005245, 60117340, 60003433", "AffiliationName": "Victorian Infectious Diseases Service at the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunology, Royal Melbourne Hospital"}, "56593055200": {"Name": "Wagen A.", "AuthorID": "56593055200", "AffiliationID": "60005245, 60117340, 60003433", "AffiliationName": "Victorian Infectious Diseases Service at the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunology, Royal Melbourne Hospital"}, "7004451420": {"Name": "Eisen D.", "AuthorID": "7004451420", "AffiliationID": "60026553, 60005245", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Royal Melbourne Hospital, University of Melbourne"}}}
