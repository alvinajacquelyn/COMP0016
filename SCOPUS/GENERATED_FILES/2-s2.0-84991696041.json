We investigate effects of altering VIF CA bolus arrival delays on liver DCE MRI perfusion parameters, propose an alternative approach to estimating delays and evaluate reproducibility. Thirteen healthy volunteers (28.7 \u00b1 1.9 years, seven males) underwent liver DCE MRI using dual-input single compartment modelling, with reproducibility (n = 9) measured at 7 days. Effects of VIF CA bolus arrival delays were assessed for arterial and portal venous input functions. Delays were pre-estimated using linear regression, with restricted free modelling around the pre-estimated delay. Perfusion parameters and 7 days reproducibility were compared using this method, freely modelled delays and no delays using one-way ANOVA. Reproducibility was assessed using Bland-Altman analysis of agreement. Maximum percent change relative to parameters obtained using zero delays, were -31% for portal venous (PV) perfusion, +43% for total liver blood flow (TLBF), +3247% for hepatic arterial (HA) fraction, +150% for mean transit time and -10% for distribution volume. Differences were demonstrated between the 3 methods for PV perfusion (p = 0.0085) and HA fraction (p < 0.0001), but not other parameters. Improved mean differences and Bland-Altman 95% Limits-of-Agreement for reproducibility of PV perfusion (9.3 ml/min/100 g, \u00b1506.1 ml/min/100 g) and TLBF (43.8 ml/min/100 g, \u00b1586.7 ml/min/100 g) were demonstrated using pre-estimated delays with constrained free modelling. CA bolus arrival delays cause profound differences in liver DCE MRI quantification. Pre-estimation of delays with constrained free modelling improved 7 days reproducibility of perfusion parameters in volunteers.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Liver DCE MRI", "liver perfusion", "pharmacokinetic modelling"], "IndexKeywords": ["DCE-MRI", "Distribution volume", "Dynamic contrast enhanced mris (DCE)", "Healthy volunteers", "Investigate effects", "Liver perfusion", "Mean transit time", "Reproducibilities", "Adult", "Algorithms", "Contrast Media", "Female", "Healthy Volunteers", "Humans", "Liver", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Perfusion", "Reproducibility of Results", "Tissue Distribution"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84991696041", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiological and Ultrasound Technology", "HEAL", "3614"], ["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"12794809100": {"Name": "Chouhan M.D.", "AuthorID": "12794809100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London (UCL) Centre for Medical Imaging, Division of Medicine, UCL"}, "7202372276": {"Name": "Atkinson D.", "AuthorID": "7202372276", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London (UCL) Centre for Medical Imaging, Division of Medicine, UCL"}, "17036141700": {"Name": "Punwani S.", "AuthorID": "17036141700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London (UCL) Centre for Medical Imaging, Division of Medicine, UCL"}, "57203543924": {"Name": "Taylor S.A.", "AuthorID": "57203543924", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London (UCL) Centre for Medical Imaging, Division of Medicine, UCL"}, "8576309800": {"Name": "Bainbridge A.", "AuthorID": "8576309800", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics, University College London Hospitals NHS Trust"}, "6603672216": {"Name": "Mookerjee R.P.", "AuthorID": "6603672216", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London (UCL), Institute for Liver and Digestive Health, Division of Medicine, UCL"}, "7004107686": {"Name": "Lythgoe M.F.", "AuthorID": "7004107686", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London (UCL), Centre for Advanced Biomedical Imaging, Division of Medicine, UCL"}}}
