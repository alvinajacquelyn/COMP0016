Methods: Cross-sectional analyses of data from the French Three City Study, a large multicenter cohort of elderly community-dwellers. Participants: 6,354 participants (56.4% women, median age 73; range: 65-97 years). Measurements: Frequency of insomnia complaints (difficulty in initiating sleep, difficulty in maintaining sleep [DMS], and early morning awakening) and excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) were self-reported. MetS was assessed using National Cholesterol Education program Adult Treatment Panel III criteria. Results: A total of 977 participants had MetS. After adjustment for a large range of potential confounders, we report an association between the number of insomnia complaints and MetS. Among insomnia complaints only DMS was consistently associated with MetS (OR: 1.23, 95% CI: 1.06 to 1.43). Our results showed that EDS independently increased the risk of MetS (OR: 1.46, 95% CI: 1.18 to 1.81 for \"frequently\"; OR: 1.99, 95% CI: 1.49 to 1.67 for \"often\"). The EDS-MetS association was independent of pasthistory of cardiovascular disease, insomnia complaints, and obesity and loud snoring. Conclusion: We report significant independent associations between frequent sleep complaints (EDS and to a lesser extent DMS) and MetS in the elderly with potential implications in terms of management and cardiovascular prevention in general geriatric practice. Prospective studies are required to clarify the direction of the association between sleep complaints and MetS.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Elderly", "Metabolic syndrome", "Observational study", "Sleep complaints"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Cohort Studies", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Female", "France", "Humans", "Logistic Models", "Male", "Metabolic Syndrome X", "Self Report", "Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84942786190", "SubjectAreas": [["Geriatrics and Gerontology", "MEDI", "2717"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"15070433300": {"Name": "Akbaraly T.", "AuthorID": "15070433300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "6603426927": {"Name": "Jaussent I.", "AuthorID": "6603426927", "AffiliationID": "60108525, 60000905, 60031919", "AffiliationName": "INSERM U1061, Universit\u00e9 Montpellier, H\u00f4pital la Colombi\u00e8re"}, "7005735614": {"Name": "Besset A.", "AuthorID": "7005735614", "AffiliationID": "60108525, 60000905, 60031919", "AffiliationName": "INSERM U1061, Universit\u00e9 Montpellier, H\u00f4pital la Colombi\u00e8re"}, "7006483248": {"Name": "Ritchie K.", "AuthorID": "7006483248", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College"}, "7003647751": {"Name": "Dauvilliers Y.", "AuthorID": "7003647751", "AffiliationID": "60033500, 60031773", "AffiliationName": "CHU Montpellier, Service de Neurologie, Unit\u00e9 des Troubles du Sommeil, H\u00f4pital Gui-de-Chauliac"}, "7006725989": {"Name": "Barberger-Gateau P.", "AuthorID": "7006725989", "AffiliationID": "60102125, 60000905", "AffiliationName": "Universit\u00e9 Bordeaux, ISPED, Centre INSERM U897-Epidemiologie-Biostatistique"}, "55045633300": {"Name": "Ferrie J.", "AuthorID": "55045633300", "AffiliationID": "60108514, 60000905", "AffiliationName": "INSERM U1198"}, "7004391239": {"Name": "Kivimaki M.", "AuthorID": "7004391239", "AffiliationID": "60108514, 60000905", "AffiliationName": "INSERM U1198"}, "7202308658": {"Name": "Bertrand M.", "AuthorID": "7202308658", "AffiliationID": "60000905, 60102125", "AffiliationName": "INSERM U708-Neuroepidemiology, Universit\u00e9 Bordeaux-Segalen"}}}
