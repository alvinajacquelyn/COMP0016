Both scientists and coaches routinely monitor training loads using multidisciplinary approaches, and the pursuit of the best methodologies to capture and interpret data has produced an exponential increase in empirical and applied research. Indeed, the field has developed with such speed in recent years that it has given rise to industries aimed at developing new and novel paradigms to allow us to precisely quantify the internal and external loads placed on athletes and to help protect them from injury and ill health. In February 2016, a conference on \"Monitoring Athlete Training Loads-The Hows and the Whys\" was convened in Doha, Qatar, which brought together experts from around the world to share their applied research and contemporary practices in this rapidly growing field and also to investigate where it may branch to in the future. This consensus statement brings together the key findings and recommendations from this conference in a shared conceptual framework for use by coaches, sport-science and-medicine staff, and other related professionals who have an interest in monitoring athlete training loads and serves to provide an outline on what athlete-load monitoring is and how it is being applied in research and practice, why load monitoring is important and what the underlying rationale and prospective goals of monitoring are, and where athlete-load monitoring is heading in the future.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Injury prevention", "Prescribing performance", "Wearable technologies", "Workload"], "IndexKeywords": ["Athletes", "Athletic Injuries", "Athletic Performance", "Congresses as Topic", "Consensus", "Decision Making", "Humans", "Monitoring, Physiologic", "Physical Conditioning, Human", "Psychometrics", "Sports Medicine"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85019241404", "SubjectAreas": [["Orthopedics and Sports Medicine", "MEDI", "2732"], ["Physical Therapy, Sports Therapy and Rehabilitation", "HEAL", "3612"]], "AuthorData": {"7005784280": {"Name": "Bourdon P.C.", "AuthorID": "7005784280", "AffiliationID": "60031846", "AffiliationName": "Bourdon and Burgess, School of Health Sciences, University of South Australia"}, "7003493917": {"Name": "Cardinale M.", "AuthorID": "7003493917", "AffiliationID": "60108464", "AffiliationName": "University of St Mark and St John"}, "56797352300": {"Name": "Murray A.", "AuthorID": "56797352300", "AffiliationID": "60012317", "AffiliationName": "Athletics Dept, University of Oregon"}, "35224580900": {"Name": "Cable N.T.", "AuthorID": "35224580900", "AffiliationID": "60028355", "AffiliationName": "Research Inst for Sport and Exercise Sciences, Liverpool Johns Moore University"}, "7003487645": {"Name": "Gastin P.", "AuthorID": "7003487645", "AffiliationID": "60018805", "AffiliationName": "School of Exercise and Nutrition Sciences, Deakin University"}, "6602248863": {"Name": "Kellmann M.", "AuthorID": "6602248863", "AffiliationID": "60031004", "AffiliationName": "School of Human Movement and Nutrition Sciences, University of Queensland"}, "6603756203": {"Name": "Gabbett T.J.", "AuthorID": "6603756203", "AffiliationID": "60109080", "AffiliationName": "Gabbett Performance Solutions"}, "7005163036": {"Name": "Coutts A.J.", "AuthorID": "7005163036", "AffiliationID": "60023932", "AffiliationName": "Sport and Exercise Discipline Group, University of Technology Sydney"}, "35236191000": {"Name": "Burgess D.J.", "AuthorID": "35236191000", "AffiliationID": "60031846", "AffiliationName": "Bourdon and Burgess, School of Health Sciences, University of South Australia"}, "55108570100": {"Name": "Varley M.C.", "AuthorID": "55108570100", "AffiliationID": "60006234", "AffiliationName": "Inst of Sport, Exercise and Active Living, Victoria University"}, "8515051400": {"Name": "Gregson W.", "AuthorID": "8515051400", "AffiliationID": "60028355", "AffiliationName": "Research Inst for Sport and Exercise Sciences, Liverpool Johns Moore University"}}}
