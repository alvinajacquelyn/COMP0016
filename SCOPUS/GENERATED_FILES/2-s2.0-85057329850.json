This does not hold for nonlinear systems, which can thus exhibit sub-Fourier-behavior. The present Letter identifies a mechanism for sub-Fourier-sensitivity in driven quantum systems, which relies on avoided crossing between Floquet states. Features up to three orders of magnitude finer than the Fourier limit are presented.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Avoided crossings", "External perturbations", "Floquet state", "Fourier limit", "Interaction time", "Quantum system", "System bandwidth", "Three orders of magnitude"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85057329850", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"6603493388": {"Name": "Cubero D.", "AuthorID": "6603493388", "AffiliationID": "60033284", "AffiliationName": "Departamento de F\u00edsica Aplicada i, EUP, Universidad de Sevilla"}, "7006914537": {"Name": "Robb G.", "AuthorID": "7006914537", "AffiliationID": "60024724", "AffiliationName": "SUPA, Department of Physics, University of Strathclyde, John Anderson Building"}, "6603770390": {"Name": "Renzoni F.", "AuthorID": "6603770390", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}}}
