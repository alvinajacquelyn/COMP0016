Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Immunotoxins are being investigated as anti-cancer therapies and consist of a cytotoxic enzyme fused to a cancer targeting antibody. All currently used toxins function via the inhibition of protein synthesis, making them highly potent in both healthy and transformed cells. This non-specific cell killing mechanism causes dose-limiting side effects that can severely limit the potential of immunotoxin therapy. In this study, the recently characterised bacterial toxin Burkholderia lethal factor 1 (BLF1) is investigated as a possible alternative payload for targeted toxin therapy in the treatment of neuroblastoma. BLF1 inhibits translation initiation by inactivation of eukaryotic initiation translation factor 4A (eIF4A), a putative anti-cancer target that has been shown to regulate a number of oncogenic proteins at the translational level. We show that cellular delivery of BLF1 selectively induces apoptosis in neuroblastoma cells that display MYCN amplification but has little effect on non-transformed cells. Future immunotoxins based on this enzyme may therefore have higher specificity towards MYCN-amplified cancer cells than more conventional ribosome-inactivating proteins, leading to an increased therapeutic window and decreased side effects.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Apoptosis", "BLF1", "Cancer", "EIF4A", "MYCN", "Neuroblastoma", "Ribosome-inactivating protein"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Antineoplastic Agents", "Bacterial Toxins", "Burkholderia", "Cell Line, Tumor", "Cell Survival", "Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-4F", "Fibroblasts", "Humans", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "N-Myc Proto-Oncogene Protein", "Neuroblastoma"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85049525169", "SubjectAreas": [["Toxicology", "PHAR", "3005"], ["Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis", "ENVI", "2307"]], "AuthorData": {"53881870500": {"Name": "Rust A.", "AuthorID": "53881870500", "AffiliationID": "60001881", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomedical Science, University of Sheffield"}, "57202831325": {"Name": "Shah S.", "AuthorID": "57202831325", "AffiliationID": "60008750, 60001881", "AffiliationName": "Sheffield Institute for Translational Neuroscience, Department of Neuroscience, University of Sheffield"}, "57207607716": {"Name": "Davletov B.", "AuthorID": "57207607716", "AffiliationID": "60001881", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomedical Science, University of Sheffield"}, "6506028137": {"Name": "Hautbergue G.M.", "AuthorID": "6506028137", "AffiliationID": "60008750, 60001881", "AffiliationName": "Sheffield Institute for Translational Neuroscience, Department of Neuroscience, University of Sheffield"}}}
