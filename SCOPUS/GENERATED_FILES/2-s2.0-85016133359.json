These diagnoses may include a wide range of neurologic and neuropsychiatric disorders; in this chapter we will focus on other causes of memory symptoms which may be labeled psychologic or functional, or be more obviously part of an established psychiatric disorder. We describe the differential categorization recently posited by Stone et al. (2015), and consider important aspects of assessment and management in these cases.", "AuthorKeywords": ["assessment", "functional symptoms", "management", "memory", "memory clinics", "neurologic causes", "neuropsychiatric", "nonneurologic causes", "psychogenic", "psychologic or psychiatric memory problems"], "IndexKeywords": ["Humans", "Memory Disorders", "Mental Disorders"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85016133359", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"57193207737": {"Name": "Griem J.", "AuthorID": "57193207737", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London"}, "7006593707": {"Name": "Kopelman M.D.", "AuthorID": "7006593707", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London"}, "7403061220": {"Name": "Stone J.", "AuthorID": "7403061220", "AffiliationID": "60110825, 60027272", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Neurosciences, Centre for Clinical Brain Sciences, University of Edinburgh"}, "7004283317": {"Name": "Carson A.", "AuthorID": "7004283317", "AffiliationID": "60110825, 60004120, 60027272", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Clinical Neurosciences and of Rehabilitation Medicine, NHS Lothian and Centre for Clinical Brain Sciences, University of Edinburgh"}}}
