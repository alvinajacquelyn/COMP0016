Polyvinyl alcohol (PVOH) of varying molecular weights were prepared and grafted-to single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs), to improve the interfacial interaction with a homopolymer PVOH matrix. Nanocomposite fibers were coagulation spun across a broad range of loading fractions, controlled by the spinning dope composition. An intermediate grafted-PVOH molecular weight (10 kDa) maximized grafting ratio, and the final composite mechanical performance; the positive effects were attributed to the increased degree of dispersion of the SWCNTs in the dope, as well as the favorable interface. The PVOH grafting increased the stability of the SWCNT loading fractions (up to 45 wt.%), offering increased strength (up to 1100 MPa) and stiffness (up to 38.5 GPa); at the same time, strain-to-failures remained high (up to 23.3%), resulting in high toughness (up to 125 J g \u22121 ).", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Composite fibers", "Degree of dispersion", "Interfacial interaction", "Mechanical performance", "Nanocomposite fibers", "Polyvinyl alcohol (PVOH)", "Single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNTs)", "Spinning dopes"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85061610275", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"]], "AuthorData": {"57198500108": {"Name": "Lee W.J.", "AuthorID": "57198500108", "AffiliationID": "60002877", "AffiliationName": "Department of Fiber System Engineering, Dankook University"}, "56330351900": {"Name": "Clancy A.J.", "AuthorID": "56330351900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "56379720700": {"Name": "Anthony D.B.", "AuthorID": "56379720700", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Imperial College London"}, "56625502800": {"Name": "White E.R.", "AuthorID": "56625502800", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Imperial College London"}, "37115855200": {"Name": "Leese H.S.", "AuthorID": "37115855200", "AffiliationID": "60030480", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University of Bath"}, "7103369266": {"Name": "Shaffer M.S.P.", "AuthorID": "7103369266", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials, Imperial College London"}, "57190854550": {"Name": "Fern\u00e1ndez-Toribio J.C.", "AuthorID": "57190854550", "AffiliationID": "60113856", "AffiliationName": "IMDEA Materials Institute"}, "23101342100": {"Name": "Vilatela J.J.", "AuthorID": "23101342100", "AffiliationID": "60113856", "AffiliationName": "IMDEA Materials Institute"}, "55263679100": {"Name": "Solano E.", "AuthorID": "55263679100", "AffiliationID": "60086946", "AffiliationName": "NCD-SWEET beamline, ALBA synchrotron light source"}}}
