These cells reside within exclusive locations in tissues, termed niches, which protect adult stem cell fidelity and regulate their many functions through biophysical-, biochemical- and cellular-mediated mechanisms. There is a growing understanding of how these mechanisms and their components contribute towards maintaining stem cell quiescence, self-renewal, expansion and differentiation patterns. In vitro expansion of adult stem cells is a powerful tool for understanding stem cell biology, and for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine applications. However, it is technically challenging, since adult stem cell removal from their native microenvironment has negative repercussions on their sustainability. In this review, we overview specific elements of the biomimetic niche and how recreating such elements can help in vitro propagation of adult stem cells.", "AuthorKeywords": ["adult stem cells", "Biomimicry", "microenvironment"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85056811977", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (miscellaneous)", "MEDI", "2701"], ["Biomaterials", "MATE", "2502"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"]], "AuthorData": {"57206313007": {"Name": "Redondo P.", "AuthorID": "57206313007", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Surgery and Interventional Science, University College London"}, "57204294898": {"Name": "Loizidou M.", "AuthorID": "57204294898", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Surgery and Interventional Science, University College London"}, "57205589826": {"Name": "Pavlou M.", "AuthorID": "57205589826", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Orthopaedics & Musculoskeletal Science, University College London"}, "9238779300": {"Name": "Cheema U.", "AuthorID": "9238779300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Orthopaedics & Musculoskeletal Science, University College London"}}}
