This merits critical and historical investigation because its usage marks a highpoint in Arnold's engagement with two competing kinds of erudition throughout the 1860s, echoing Swift's own commitments at the turn of the eighteenth century. In his discussion of Liberal politics, Francis Newman and Homeric poetry, and the parochialism of the English middle class, Arnold restaged the battle between urbanity and philology which Swift and the Tory wits fought in response to Richard Bentley. This article juxtaposes and interweaves these debates to show that articulacy twice attempted to lay total claim to knowledge; on each occasion, the effort to protect literature and ambiguity spurred Swift and Arnold to discrete imaginative acts engendered by the same anxiety over minute scholarship. It is suggested this disquiet was especially acute because the techniques of satire and artistry made those forms appear less disinterested and more pedantic than they professed to be, whilst Bentley's philological work was truly exemplary of the vital creativity Swift and Arnold espoused. At work was a double irony: Swift and Arnold encouraged a ranging and cursory approach whilst in fact employing the subtlest stylistic manoeuvres to attenuate the rise of a discipline which was in reality concerned with the aesthetic as well as the historical.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85018189143", "SubjectAreas": [["Language and Linguistics", "ARTS", "1203"], ["Linguistics and Language", "SOCI", "3310"], ["Literature and Literary Theory", "ARTS", "1208"]], "AuthorData": {"37061717600": {"Name": "Owens T.", "AuthorID": "37061717600", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "University of Cambridge"}}}
