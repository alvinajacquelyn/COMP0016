Following focal-onset status epilepticus (SE) in preconditioned (tolerance) and sham-preconditioned (injury) mice, we screened for protein changes using a proteomic approach and identified several putative candidates of epileptic tolerance. Among SE-induced changes to both proteomic screens, proteins clustered in key regulatory pathways, including protein trafficking and cytoskeletal regulation. Downregulation of one such protein, ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase isozyme L1 (UCHL1), was unique to injury and not evident in tolerance. UCHL1 inhibition decreased hippocampal ubiquitin, disrupted UPS function, interfered with seizure termination and exacerbated seizure-induced cell death. Though UCHL1 transcription was maintained after SE, we observed downregulation of the pro-translational antisense Uchl1 (AsUchl1) and confirmed that both AsUchl1 and rapamycin can increase UCHL1 expression in vivo. These data indicate that the post-transcriptional loss of UCHL1 following SE is deleterious to neuronal survival and may contribute to hyperexcitability, and are suggestive of a novel modality of rapamycin therapy.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Long non-coding RNA", "Proteomics", "Temporal lobe epilepsy", "Ubiquitin proteasome system", "UCHL1"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Cell Survival", "Hippocampus", "Indoles", "Injections, Intraventricular", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Neurons", "Oximes", "Proteomics", "Random Allocation", "Status Epilepticus", "Ubiquitin Thiolesterase"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85017224054", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"]], "AuthorData": {"56915216400": {"Name": "Reynolds J.P.", "AuthorID": "56915216400", "AffiliationID": "60000050", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physiology and Medical Physics, Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland"}, "36955280200": {"Name": "Jimenez-Mateos E.M.", "AuthorID": "36955280200", "AffiliationID": "60000050", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physiology and Medical Physics, Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland"}, "56964716000": {"Name": "Alves M.", "AuthorID": "56964716000", "AffiliationID": "60000050", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physiology and Medical Physics, Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland"}, "36895142700": {"Name": "Miller-Delaney S.F.", "AuthorID": "36895142700", "AffiliationID": "60000050", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physiology and Medical Physics, Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland"}, "7004070560": {"Name": "Henshall D.C.", "AuthorID": "7004070560", "AffiliationID": "60000050", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physiology and Medical Physics, Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland"}, "56643634500": {"Name": "Cao L.", "AuthorID": "56643634500", "AffiliationID": "60024321", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurobiology, Morehouse School of Medicine"}, "36817819700": {"Name": "Bian F.", "AuthorID": "36817819700", "AffiliationID": "60024321", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurobiology, Morehouse School of Medicine"}, "8247979600": {"Name": "Zhou A.", "AuthorID": "8247979600", "AffiliationID": "60024321", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurobiology, Morehouse School of Medicine"}}}
