Although it claims to prove antidepressant effectiveness beyond dispute, the main outcome is response rates, which are derived from continuous data in a process that can inflate differences between groups. The standardised mean difference of 0.3 is in line with other meta-Analyses that show small differences between antidepressants and placebo that are unlikely to be clinically significant. Other factors likely to exaggerate the effects are discussed, and evidence on associations between antidepressant effects and severity and outcomes of long-Term treatment is considered. Clinicians need to have open discussions with patients about the limitations of antidepressant research, the lack of evidence that antidepressants correct a chemical imbalance or other brain abnormality, and the range of adverse effects and mental and physical alterations they can produce.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Antidepressant efficacy", "Antidepressants", "Meta-Analysis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Antidepressive Agents", "Depression", "Depressive Disorder, Major", "Humans", "Meta-Analysis as Topic"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85047452826", "SubjectAreas": [["Epidemiology", "MEDI", "2713"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"57207838002": {"Name": "Moncrieff J.", "AuthorID": "57207838002", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, University College London"}}}
