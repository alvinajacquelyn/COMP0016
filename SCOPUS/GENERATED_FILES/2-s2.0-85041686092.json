Evidence for the event comes from three independent datasets: calcareous nannofossils, ammonites, and the bulk sediment carbon and oxygen stable isotope record, which collectively indicate a brief period (\u00e2 1/4 500\u00e2 \u20ackyr) of significant surface water warming (in excess of 6\u00e2 \u20ac\u00b0C) at around 107.5\u00e2 \u20acMa (the base of the <i>Dipoloceras cristatum</i> Ammonite Zone). A surface water productivity increase based on high percentages of the eutrophic nannofossil <i>Zeugrhabdotus noeliae</i> is found to be concomitant with this warming event, suggesting that surface waters were nutrient-rich and the warming was associated with increased precipitation and run-off, delivering more nutrients into the basin.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85041686092", "SubjectAreas": [["Paleontology", "EART", "1911"]], "AuthorData": {"7004829943": {"Name": "Kanungo S.", "AuthorID": "7004829943", "AffiliationID": "60025488", "AffiliationName": "University of Utah, Energy and Geoscience Institute (EGI)"}, "6701346236": {"Name": "Bown P.", "AuthorID": "6701346236", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dept. of Earth Sciences, University College London"}, "7408525261": {"Name": "Young J.", "AuthorID": "7408525261", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dept. of Earth Sciences, University College London"}, "7102194068": {"Name": "Gale A.", "AuthorID": "7102194068", "AffiliationID": "60025475", "AffiliationName": "School of Earth and Environmental Sciences, University of Portsmouth"}}}
