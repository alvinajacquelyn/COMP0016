Increasing evidence suggests that autistic people can copy the goal of an observed action but show differences in their mimicry. We investigated mimicry in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) within a two-dimensional virtual reality environment. Participants played an imitation game with a socially engaged avatar and socially disengaged avatar. Despite being told only to copy the goal of the observed action, autistic participants and matched neurotypical participants mimicked the kinematics of the avatars\u2019 movements. However, autistic participants mimicked less. Social engagement did not modulate mimicry in either group. The results demonstrate the feasibility of using virtual reality to induce mimicry and suggest mimicry differences in ASD may also occur when interacting with avatars.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Imitation", "Kinematics", "Mimicry", "Social cognition", "Virtual reality"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Autism Spectrum Disorder", "Biomechanical Phenomena", "Case-Control Studies", "Computer Simulation", "Female", "Humans", "Imitative Behavior", "Male", "Movement", "Social Behavior", "User-Computer Interface", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84989160088", "SubjectAreas": [["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"]], "AuthorData": {"57164501700": {"Name": "Forbes P.A.G.", "AuthorID": "57164501700", "AffiliationID": "60109771, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, University College London"}, "57190578013": {"Name": "Antonia A.F.", "AuthorID": "57190578013", "AffiliationID": "60109771, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, University College London"}, "23390192600": {"Name": "Pan X.", "AuthorID": "23390192600", "AffiliationID": "60010964", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computing, Goldsmiths, University of London"}}}
