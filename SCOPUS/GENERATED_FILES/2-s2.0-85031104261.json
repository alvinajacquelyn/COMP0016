The system and the embodied techniques have utility in security screening, medical diagnostics, non-destructive testing (NDT) and quality assurance (QA). This paper outlines the design of the system including discussion on the choice of components and presents some data from relevant samples which are compared to other energy dispersive and angular dispersive XRD techniques.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Detection of contraband and drugs", "Detection of explosives", "X-ray diffraction detectors", "X-ray radiography and digital radiography (DR)"], "IndexKeywords": ["Detection of explosives", "Digital radiography", "Energy dispersive", "Medical diagnostics", "Non destructive testing", "Sample analysis", "Security screening", "Transmission x-rays"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85031104261", "SubjectAreas": [["Mathematical Physics", "MATH", "2610"], ["Instrumentation", "PHYS", "3105"]], "AuthorData": {"14036021200": {"Name": "Moss R.", "AuthorID": "14036021200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "56943124300": {"Name": "Crews C.", "AuthorID": "56943124300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "57205908360": {"Name": "Speller R.", "AuthorID": "57205908360", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "8660368400": {"Name": "Wilson M.", "AuthorID": "8660368400", "AffiliationID": "60023254", "AffiliationName": "Detector Development Group, Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, STFC Harwell Campus"}}}
