The mean charge per oxidative transient is measured from nanoimpacts; XPS shows the formation of PtO and PtO2 in relative amounts defined by the electrode potential and an average oxidation state is deduced as a function of potential. The number of platinum atoms oxidised per PtNP is calculated and compared with two models: solid and porous spheres, within which there are two cases: full and surface oxidation. This allows insight into extent to which the internal surface of the aggregate is 'seen' by the solution and is electrochemically active.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85024394001", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"]], "AuthorData": {"56622219300": {"Name": "Jiao X.", "AuthorID": "56622219300", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry Laboratory, University of Oxford"}, "55836420700": {"Name": "Tanner E.", "AuthorID": "55836420700", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry Laboratory, University of Oxford"}, "56609802800": {"Name": "Sokolov S.", "AuthorID": "56609802800", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry Laboratory, University of Oxford"}, "55950127500": {"Name": "Compton R.", "AuthorID": "55950127500", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry Laboratory, University of Oxford"}, "8227436900": {"Name": "Palgrave R.", "AuthorID": "8227436900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "12238972200": {"Name": "Young N.", "AuthorID": "12238972200", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials, University of Oxford"}}}
