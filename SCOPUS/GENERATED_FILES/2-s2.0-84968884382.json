British HIV Association guidelines suggest tropism testing may remain valid for only 90 days in antiretroviral-na\u00efve patients. We aimed to determine the accuracy of this figure. Tropism was assessed in 26 antiretroviral-na\u00efve patients with ongoing viral replication, sampled yearly from first clinic visit. The V3 region of HIV-1 was sequenced in triplicate, then tropism predicted using the Geno2Pheno system. Baseline tropism prediction remained valid for a median of 52 months (range 7\u201381). For 19/26 individuals baseline tropism remained unchanged throughout a median of 54 months follow-up; 18 R5 tropic and 1 X4 tropic. In seven patients (27%) baseline tropism switched at least once (range 1\u20134 switches) during follow-up; however, their baseline tropism prediction remained valid for a median of 45 months. Co-receptor tropism in treatment-na\u00efve patients with ongoing viral replication appears highly stable over time, suggesting that baseline genotypic tropism prediction may be valid for a longer duration in patients delaying ART initiation. In this study, baseline tropism prediction remained valid for a median of 52 months, suggesting current guidelines recommending repeat testing after 90 days may be excessively conservative in their assessment of tropism stability.", "AuthorKeywords": ["AIDS", "antiretroviral therapy", "CCR5", "co-receptor stability", "HIV", "maraviroc", "tropism"], "IndexKeywords": ["Clinical Laboratory Techniques", "Female", "Genotype", "HIV Infections", "HIV-1", "Humans", "Male", "RNA, Viral", "Sequence Analysis, DNA", "Viral Tropism", "Virology"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84968884382", "SubjectAreas": [["Dermatology", "MEDI", "2708"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"57217400612": {"Name": "Philip K.E.J.", "AuthorID": "57217400612", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Department of Virology, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "9037576800": {"Name": "Macartney M.J.", "AuthorID": "9037576800", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Department of Virology, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "56600502900": {"Name": "Conibear T.C.R.", "AuthorID": "56600502900", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Department of Virology, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "55816915600": {"Name": "Haque T.", "AuthorID": "55816915600", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Department of Virology, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7201998521": {"Name": "Webster D.P.", "AuthorID": "7201998521", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Department of Virology, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7501658889": {"Name": "Smith C.J.", "AuthorID": "7501658889", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Infection and Population Health, University College London"}, "45061232900": {"Name": "Marshall N.", "AuthorID": "45061232900", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Department of HIV Medicine, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "55574223038": {"Name": "Johnson M.A.", "AuthorID": "55574223038", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Department of HIV Medicine, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
