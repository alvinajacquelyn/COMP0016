For high-throughput applications such as epigenome-wide association studies, the Infinium HumanMethylation450 (450K) BeadChip is currently the platform of choice. However, BeadChip processing relies on traditional bisulfite (BS) based protocols which cannot discriminate between 5-methylcytosine (5mC) and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC). Here, we report the adaptation of the recently developed oxidative bisulfite (oxBS) chemistry to specifically detect both 5mC and 5hmC in a single workflow using 450K BeadChips, termed oxBS-450K. Supported by validation using mass spectrometry and pyrosequencing, we demonstrate reproducible (R2>0.99) detection of 5hmC in human brain tissue using the optimised oxBS-450K protocol described here.", "AuthorKeywords": ["450K BeadChip", "Bisulfite conversion", "DNA methylation", "Epigenetics", "Hydroxymethylation", "Oxidation"], "IndexKeywords": ["DNA Methylation", "Epigenomics", "Humans", "Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis", "Reproducibility of Results", "Sequence Analysis, DNA"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84927714053", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"56524888300": {"Name": "Stewart S.", "AuthorID": "56524888300", "AffiliationID": "60109234, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cancer Biology, UCL Cancer Institute, University College London"}, "7201714683": {"Name": "Morris T.", "AuthorID": "7201714683", "AffiliationID": "60109234, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cancer Biology, UCL Cancer Institute, University College London"}, "56018559100": {"Name": "Guilhamon P.", "AuthorID": "56018559100", "AffiliationID": "60109234, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cancer Biology, UCL Cancer Institute, University College London"}, "57193033325": {"Name": "Beck S.", "AuthorID": "57193033325", "AffiliationID": "60109234, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cancer Biology, UCL Cancer Institute, University College London"}, "48861007100": {"Name": "Bulstrode H.", "AuthorID": "48861007100", "AffiliationID": "60014873", "AffiliationName": "Scottish Centre for Regenerative Medicine"}, "55892708100": {"Name": "Bachman M.", "AuthorID": "55892708100", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge"}, "7201550638": {"Name": "Balasubramanian S.", "AuthorID": "7201550638", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge"}}}
