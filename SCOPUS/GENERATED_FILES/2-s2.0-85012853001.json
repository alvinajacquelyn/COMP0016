The aim of this study was to investigate the role of selective laser sintered (SLS) porous collars in augmenting the osseointegration of these prostheses. Materials and Methods The two novel designs of porous SLS collars, one with small pores (O700 \u03bcm, SP) and one with large pores (O1500 \u03bcm, LP), were compared in an ovine tibial diaphyseal model. Osseointegration of these collars was compared with that of a clinically used solid, grooved design (G). At six months post-operatively, the ovine tibias were retrieved and underwent radiological and histological analysis. Results Porous collars provided a significantly greater surface (p < 0.001) for the ingrowth of bone than the standard grooved design. Significantly greater extracortical pedicle formation was seen radiologically around the grooved design (length p = 0.002, thickness p < 0.001, surface area p = 0.002) than around the porous collars. However, the ingrowth of bone occurred from the transection site into the porous structure of both types of collar. A fivefold increase in integration was seen with the SP and a threefold increase in the LP design when compared with G (p < 0.001). Conclusion SLS porous collars allow the direct ingrowth of more bone and are better than current designs which rely on surface ongrowth and ECBB.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Coated Materials, Biocompatible", "Durapatite", "Female", "Lasers", "Osseointegration", "Porosity", "Prostheses and Implants", "Prosthesis Design", "Prosthesis Failure", "Sheep", "Tibia", "Titanium"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85012853001", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Orthopedics and Sports Medicine", "MEDI", "2732"]], "AuthorData": {"55382707700": {"Name": "Mumith A.", "AuthorID": "55382707700", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60024067", "AffiliationName": "Bone Tumour Unit, University College London, Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital"}, "6603029220": {"Name": "Coathup M.", "AuthorID": "6603029220", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60024067", "AffiliationName": "Bone Tumour Unit, University College London, Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital"}, "36550164000": {"Name": "Chimutengwende Gordon M.", "AuthorID": "36550164000", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60024067", "AffiliationName": "Bone Tumour Unit, University College London, Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital"}, "36763143500": {"Name": "Aston W.", "AuthorID": "36763143500", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60024067", "AffiliationName": "Bone Tumour Unit, University College London, Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital"}, "7004395420": {"Name": "Briggs T.", "AuthorID": "7004395420", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60024067", "AffiliationName": "Bone Tumour Unit, University College London, Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital"}, "7004735871": {"Name": "Blunn G.", "AuthorID": "7004735871", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60024067", "AffiliationName": "Bone Tumour Unit, University College London, Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital"}}}
