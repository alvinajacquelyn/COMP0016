In particular, we derive sufficient and (occasionally) necessary conditions on the number of linear measurements for the signal reconstruction minimum mean squared error (MMSE) to approach zero in the low-noise regime; moreover, we also derive closed-form linear side information measurement designs for the reconstruction MMSE to approach zero in the low-noise regime. Our designs suggest that a linear projection kernel that optimally captures side information is such that it measures the attributes of side information that are maximally correlated with the signal of interest. A number of experiments both with synthetic and real data confirm that our theoretical results are well aligned with numerical ones. Finally, we offer a case study associated with a panchromatic sharpening (pan sharpening) application in the presence of compressive hyperspectral data that demonstrates that our proposed linear side information measurement designs can lead to reconstruction peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) gains in excess of 2 dB over other approaches in this practical application.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Compressive sensing", "compressive sensing with side information", "Gaussian mixture models (GMM)", "linear projection kernel design", "pan-sharpening", "random projection kernels"], "IndexKeywords": ["Atmospheric measurement", "Compressive sensing", "Covariance matrices", "Gaussian Mixture Model", "Kernel", "Kernel design", "Noise measurements", "Pan-sharpening", "Particle measurement", "Random projections", "Side information"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85042724617", "SubjectAreas": [["Signal Processing", "COMP", "1711"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"57189603032": {"Name": "Chen M.Y.", "AuthorID": "57189603032", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "57210526627": {"Name": "Rodrigues M.R.D.", "AuthorID": "57210526627", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "24802572900": {"Name": "Renna F.", "AuthorID": "24802572900", "AffiliationID": "60119937, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics, University of Cambridge, Cambridge"}}}
