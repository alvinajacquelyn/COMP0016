In this paper, we focus on the ways in which power is at work to pre-emptively exclude certain ideas and descriptions of relevant phenomena before questions about what should be done about that phenomena can even be asked. We describe this as the power of occlusion. Beginning with Gilbert Ryle\u2019s notion of the category mistake, we go on to consider the various ways that have been employed to understand the market, focusing primarily on the (mutually exclusive) descriptions employed by Friedrich Hayek and Karl Polanyi. The essay ends with a survey of the ways in which unconditional basic income has been occluded from debates surrounding welfare reform, arguing that in order to confront the power of occlusion it is necessary to challenge many of our assumptions surrounding work and reciprocity.", "AuthorKeywords": ["basic income", "category mistakes", "controversy", "credibility", "Occlusion"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85012877531", "SubjectAreas": [["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"]], "AuthorData": {"57022954700": {"Name": "Jenkins D.", "AuthorID": "57022954700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Political Science, University College London"}, "10044436700": {"Name": "Lukes S.", "AuthorID": "10044436700", "AffiliationID": "60021784", "AffiliationName": "Department of Sociology, New York University"}}}
