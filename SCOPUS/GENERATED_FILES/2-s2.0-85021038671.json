All rights reserved.Anthropologists have long looked to the Pacific Islands as model systems for the interaction between people and their environments. With a settlement history less than a thousand years, the Hawaiian Islands in particular offer an unprecedented opportunity to examine how cultural elaboration and increasing social complexity are influenced by environmental conditions. Emphasizing soil geochemical analyses from transects across the district of Kaupo in arid, southeastern Maui, this chapter demonstrates how this region features a uniquely nutrient-rich mosaic of soils. Merging these data with GIS modeling, field survey, and excavation reveals how early Hawaiian farmers recognized that despite its limited rainfall, Kaupo was ideally suited to growing dryland crops such as sweet potato and taro. With an increasingly centralized political system, Maui elites moved to control the region, rapidly surrounding it within a network of major temples and intensifying the fertile interior with a broad zone of agricultural walls and embankments. By employing the soil geochemical analyses described here, we are afforded insights into why Kaupo, in a seemingly undesirable location, became home to the only dryland field system on the island, and why the district was ultimately made the royal seat of the entire Maui polity.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85021038671", "SubjectAreas": [["Social Sciences (all)", "SOCI", "3300"], ["Arts and Humanities (all)", "ARTS", "1200"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Environmental Science (all)", "ENVI", "2300"]], "AuthorData": {"36664294500": {"Name": "Baer A.", "AuthorID": "36664294500", "AffiliationID": "100780766", "AffiliationName": "Pacific Legacy, Inc"}}}
