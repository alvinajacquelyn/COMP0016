Recent findings indicate that meal timing is crucial, with both intermittent fasting and adjusted diurnal rhythm of feeding improving health and function, in the absence of changes in overall intake. Lowered intake of particular nutrients rather than of overall calories is also key, with protein and specific amino acids playing prominent roles. Nutritional modulation of the microbiome can also be important, and there are long-term, including inter-generational, effects of diet. The metabolic, molecular, and cellular mechanisms that mediate both improvement in health during aging to diet and genetic variation in the response to diet are being identified. These new findings are opening the way to specific dietary and pharmacological interventions to recapture the full potential benefits of dietary restriction, which humans can find difficult to maintain voluntarily.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Aging", "Animals", "Caloric Restriction", "Diet", "Health Promotion", "Humans", "Longevity", "Models, Animal"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84925852614", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"57200759067": {"Name": "Fontana L.", "AuthorID": "57200759067", "AffiliationID": "60159407", "AffiliationName": "CEINGE Biotecnologie Avanzate"}, "57202667589": {"Name": "Partridge L.", "AuthorID": "57202667589", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Healthy Ageing, Department of Genetics, Environment and Evolution, University College London"}}}
