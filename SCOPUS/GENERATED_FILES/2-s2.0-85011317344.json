Post-acquisition techniques have been proposed to increase spatial resolution a posteriori by combining acquired orthogonal stacks into a single, high-resolution (HR) volume. Current super-resolution techniques classically rely on a two-step procedure. The volumetric reconstruction step leverages a physical slice acquisition model. However, the motion correction step typically neglects the point spread function (PSF) information. In this paper, we propose a PSF-aware slice-to-volume registration approach and, for the first time, demonstrate the potential benefit of Super-Resolution for upper abdominal imaging. Our novel reconstruction pipeline takes advantage of different MR acquisitions clinically used in routine MR cholangio-pancreatography studies to guide the registration. On evaluation of clinically relevant image information, our approach outperforms state-of-the-art reconstruction toolkits in terms of visual clarity and preservation of raw data information. Overall, we achieve promising results towards replacing currently required CT scans.", "AuthorKeywords": ["MRCP study", "Point spread function", "Registration", "Scattered data approximation", "Super-resolution reconstruction"], "IndexKeywords": ["MRCP study", "Reconstruction toolkits", "Registration", "Scattered data approximation", "Spatial resolution", "Super resolution reconstruction", "Volume registration", "Volumetric reconstruction"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85011317344", "SubjectAreas": [["Theoretical Computer Science", "MATH", "2614"], ["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"]], "AuthorData": {"57193152354": {"Name": "Ebner M.", "AuthorID": "57193152354", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Translational Imaging Group, CMIC, University College London"}, "56957582400": {"Name": "Patel P.A.", "AuthorID": "56957582400", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Radiology Department, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}, "23010613000": {"Name": "Vercauteren T.", "AuthorID": "23010613000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Translational Imaging Group, CMIC, University College London"}, "6602233595": {"Name": "Ourselin S.", "AuthorID": "6602233595", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Translational Imaging Group, CMIC, University College London"}, "12794809100": {"Name": "Chouhan M.", "AuthorID": "12794809100", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Radiology Department, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7202372276": {"Name": "Atkinson D.", "AuthorID": "7202372276", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Imaging, University College London"}, "17036141700": {"Name": "Punwani S.", "AuthorID": "17036141700", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Radiology Department, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57203543924": {"Name": "Taylor S.", "AuthorID": "57203543924", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Radiology Department, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "22937229800": {"Name": "Amin Z.", "AuthorID": "22937229800", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Radiology Department, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7101662225": {"Name": "Read S.", "AuthorID": "7101662225", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Radiology Department, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
