Several design criteria are considered for minimizing the downlink multiuser interference. First, we consider both omnidirectional and directional beampattern design problems, where the closed-form globally optimal solutions are obtained. Based on the derived waveforms, we further consider weighted optimizations targeting a flexible tradeoff between radar and communications performance and introduce low-complexity algorithms. Moreover, to address the more practical constant modulus waveform design problem, we propose a branch-and-bound algorithm that obtains a globally optimal solution, and derive its worst-case complexity as function of the maximum iteration number. Finally, we assess the effectiveness of the proposed waveform design approaches via numerical results.", "AuthorKeywords": ["global minimizer", "multi-user interference", "non-convex optimization", "radar-communication", "Spectrum sharing"], "IndexKeywords": ["Downlink", "Global minimizers", "Multi-user interference", "Nonconvex optimization", "Radar communication", "Signal processing algorithms", "Spectrum sharing"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85048598293", "SubjectAreas": [["Signal Processing", "COMP", "1711"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"57211818673": {"Name": "Liu F.", "AuthorID": "57211818673", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "23009493900": {"Name": "Masouros C.", "AuthorID": "23009493900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "36882561300": {"Name": "Luo W.", "AuthorID": "36882561300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "57192574299": {"Name": "Zhou L.", "AuthorID": "57192574299", "AffiliationID": "60014966, 60124585", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Advanced Optical Communication Systems and Networks, Peking University"}, "56453725100": {"Name": "Li A.", "AuthorID": "56453725100", "AffiliationID": "60014966, 60124585", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Advanced Optical Communication Systems and Networks, Peking University"}, "35569377300": {"Name": "Petropulu A.", "AuthorID": "35569377300", "AffiliationID": "60120688, 60119141", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering Rutgers, State University of New Jersey"}}}
