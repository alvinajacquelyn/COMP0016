Interventions are more likely to be effective if they are theory- and evidence-based. The Behaviour Change Wheel (BCW) provides a framework for intervention development. To provide an example of how the BCW was used to develop an intervention to increase condom use in heterosexual men (the MenSS website), the steps of the BCW intervention development process were followed, incorporating evidence from the research literature and views of experts and the target population. Capability (e.g. knowledge) and motivation (e.g. beliefs about pleasure) were identified as important targets of the intervention. We devised ways to address each intervention target, including selecting interactive features and behaviour change techniques. The BCW provides a useful framework for integrating sources of evidence to inform intervention content and deciding which influences on behaviour to target.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Behaviour change", "Internet", "Intervention development", "Sexual health", "Theory"], "IndexKeywords": ["Behavior Therapy", "Condoms", "Health Behavior", "Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice", "Heterosexuality", "Humans", "Internet", "Male", "Motivation", "Safe Sex", "Sexual Behavior", "Sexually Transmitted Diseases"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84983249368", "SubjectAreas": [["Applied Psychology", "PSYC", "3202"], ["Behavioral Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2802"]], "AuthorData": {"56530107500": {"Name": "Webster R.", "AuthorID": "56530107500", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60032819", "AffiliationName": "eHealth Unit, Research Department of Primary Care and Population Health, University College London, Royal Free Hospital"}, "7404350273": {"Name": "Bailey J.V.", "AuthorID": "7404350273", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60032819", "AffiliationName": "eHealth Unit, Research Department of Primary Care and Population Health, University College London, Royal Free Hospital"}, "7004779970": {"Name": "Michie S.", "AuthorID": "7004779970", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Clinical, Educational, and Health Psychology, University College London"}, "57205874518": {"Name": "Estcourt C.", "AuthorID": "57205874518", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109, 60004093", "AffiliationName": "BICMS, Barts and The London School of Medicine & Dentistry, Barts Sexual Health Centre, Queen Mary University of London, St Bartholomew\u2019s Hospital"}, "12769254200": {"Name": "Gerressu M.", "AuthorID": "12769254200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infection and Population Health, University College London"}, "57190807163": {"Name": "on behalf of the MenSS Trial Group", "AuthorID": "57190807163", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
