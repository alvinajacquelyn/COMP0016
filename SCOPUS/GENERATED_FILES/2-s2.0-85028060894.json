Specifically, the research focusses upon the way in which the school has engaged with the neoliberal policy context in which increased autonomy and diversification of provision is promoted in England as a driver of standards. Using Bourdieu's conceptualisation of symbolic capital, the findings suggest that within this autonomous system, \u2018innovative\u2019 localised policy-making can arguably misrecognise the role such \u2018innovation\u2019 plays in helping to maintain structures, which may contribute to ensuring the field, and its competitive nature, is protected rather than challenged.", "AuthorKeywords": ["autonomy", "England", "innovation", "misrecognition", "symbolic capital"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85028060894", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"]], "AuthorData": {"55489465100": {"Name": "McGinity R.", "AuthorID": "55489465100", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "Manchester Institute of Education, University of Manchester"}}}
