A high-content siRNA screen identified the endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT)-associated protein ALIX as a regulator of both EGFR activity and PD-L1 surface presentation in basal-like breast cancer (BLBC) cells. ALIX depletion results in prolonged and enhanced stimulation-induced EGFR activity as well as defective PD-L1 trafficking through the MVB, reduced exosomal secretion, and its redistribution to the cell surface. Increased surface PD-L1 expression confers an EGFR-dependent immunosuppressive phenotype on ALIX-depleted cells. An inverse association between ALIX and PD-L1 expression was observed in human breast cancer tissues, while an immunocompetent mouse model of breast cancer revealed that ALIX-deficient tumors are larger and show an increased immunosuppressive environment. Our data suggest that ALIX modulates immunosuppression through regulation of PD-L1 and EGFR and may, therefore, present a diagnostic and therapeutic target for BLBC. Monypenny et al. show that the ESCRT-related protein ALIX regulates two clinically important proteins in breast cancer; namely, EGFR, a receptor linked to cell survival, and PD-L1, an immune checkpoint protein. ALIX is, therefore, associated with pathways that drive both cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous mechanisms of tumor survival.", "AuthorKeywords": ["ALIX", "breast", "EGFR", "exosome", "ILV",
