The book focuses on the issue of scarcity: less of a problem for the supply of resources in general, but relevant in the dimension of global demand forecasting when relative shortages match with regional constraints and environmental consequences. It highlights the regional patterns of growth and trade in relation to natural resources. The book presents a theoretical basis for some of the empirical literature, with a focus on the links between stock market pricing and innovation dynamics. It demonstrates that technological catch-up across countries can be attributed to large natural resource rent fluctuations during the 1970-1990 period while the absence of natural resource rents in the last part of that period explains the decline of productivity improvements. The book highlights two country studies, on Finland and Greece.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85076070215", "SubjectAreas": [["Economics, Econometrics and Finance (all)", "ECON", "2000"], ["Business, Management and Accounting (all)", "BUSI", "1400"]], "AuthorData": {"6603227818": {"Name": "Bleischwitz R.", "AuthorID": "6603227818", "AffiliationID": "112731437", "AffiliationName": "The Research Group on Material Flows and Resource Management, The Wuppertal Institute"}, "6505958352": {"Name": "Welfens P.J.J.", "AuthorID": "6505958352", "AffiliationID": "123947808", "AffiliationName": "The European Institute for international Economic Relations (EIIW)"}, "57212164266": {"Name": "Zhang Z.X.", "AuthorID": "57212164266", "AffiliationID": "60014966, 60102421, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "The Chinese Academy of Sciences, The Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, Peking University"}}}
