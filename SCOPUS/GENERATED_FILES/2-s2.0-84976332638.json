Ophthalmol.", "Volume": "254", "Issue": 12, "Art.No": null, "PageStart": 2333, "PageEnd": 2338, "CitedBy": 4, "DOI": "10.1007/s00417-016-3398-7", "Link": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84976332638&origin=inward", "Abstract": "\u00a9 2016, The Author(s).Purpose: To describe the characteristics and outcomes of patients presenting with rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) after ocriplasmin (OCP) injection. Methods: Retrospective, multi-centre, observational case series with case note review. Results: Eight patients with symptomatic vitreomacular traction (six with concomitant macular hole) were diagnosed with RRD after a median of 16 days (range 3\u2013131 days) post-OCP injection. Presentation was within 3 weeks of the OCP injection in six of the cases. Five patients presented with symptoms post-OCP, and three were diagnosed asymptomatically on planned visits. Seven cases were phakic, one had high myopia (>8 dioptres), and two cases had lattice degeneration. Following RRD surgery, hole closure was achieved in 5/6 MH cases. The final median BCVA at 7 months was 20/80 (range 20/40\u201320/1200) similar to the baseline BCVA 20/80, with four patients gaining \u22651 line of vision compared to baseline but three losing \u22653 lines. Conclusions: RRD is a non-negligible risk associated with intravitreal OCP, and it should be used with caution in eyes with high myopia and peripheral retinal pathology predisposing to RRD. Detailed peripheral retinal examination is recommended pre- and postoperatively at all visits. Patients should be advised to seek attention if symptoms recur after initial presentation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Macular hole", "Ocriplasmin", "Pharmacological vitreolysis", "Retinal detachment", "Retinal tears", "Vitreomacular traction"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Female", "Fibrinolysin", "Follow-Up Studies", "Humans", "Intravitreal Injections", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Peptide Fragments", "Prognosis", "Retina", "Retinal Detachment", "Retinal Perforations", "Retrospective Studies", "Tomography, Optical Coherence", "Visual Acuity", "Vitreous Detachment"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84976332638", "SubjectAreas": [["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"], ["Sensory Systems", "NEUR", "2809"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"]], "AuthorData": {"56146118200": {"Name": "Madi H.A.", "AuthorID": "56146118200", "AffiliationID": "60017085", "AffiliationName": "Sunderland Eye Infirmary"}, "56221341600": {"Name": "Steel D.H.W.", "AuthorID": "56221341600", "AffiliationID": "60026712, 60006222", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Genetic Medicine, Newcastle University"}, "7202566558": {"Name": "Haynes R.J.", "AuthorID": "7202566558", "AffiliationID": "60016719", "AffiliationName": "Bristol Eye Hospital"}, "6603678414": {"Name": "Depla D.", "AuthorID": "6603678414", "AffiliationID": "60006438", "AffiliationName": "Ophthalmology Department, Cumberland Infirmary"}, "6603248673": {"Name": "de la Cour M.D.", "AuthorID": "6603248673", "AffiliationID": "60006564", "AffiliationName": "Eye Department, Rigshospitalet"}, "16686989600": {"Name": "Lesnik-Oberstein S.", "AuthorID": "16686989600", "AffiliationID": "60001157", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, Academic Medical Centre"}, "57203157173": {"Name": "Muqit M.M.K.", "AuthorID": "57203157173", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Vitreoretinal Service, Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "7004826638": {"Name": "Patton N.", "AuthorID": "7004826638", "AffiliationID": "60023665", "AffiliationName": "Manchester Royal Eye Hospital"}, "57197693504": {"Name": "Price N.", "AuthorID": "57197693504", "AffiliationID": "60006255", "AffiliationName": "Royal Wolverhampton NHS Trust, Wolverhampton & Midland Counties Eye Infirmary"}}}
