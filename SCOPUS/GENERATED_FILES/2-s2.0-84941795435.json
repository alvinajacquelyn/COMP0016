This has fueled an increase in candidate compounds designed to modulate these pathways and to alter the processes underlying neuronal death in this disorder. Using mitochondrial quality control and the macroautophagy/lysosomal pathways as examples, we discuss the pipeline from a comprehensive genetic architecture for PD through to clinical trials for drugs targeting pathways linked to neurodegeneration in PD. We also identify opportunities and pitfalls on the road to a clinically effective disease-modifying treatment for this disease.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Biomarkers", "Clinical Trials as Topic", "Dopamine", "Dopaminergic Neurons", "Drug Design", "Gene Expression Regulation", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Humans", "Lysosomes", "Mitochondria", "Neurodegenerative Diseases", "Parkinson Disease", "Substantia Nigra"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84941795435", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"6507453938": {"Name": "Van Der Brug M.", "AuthorID": "6507453938", "AffiliationID": "60026209", "AffiliationName": "Department of Diagnostics Discovery, Genentech"}, "7006092717": {"Name": "Singleton A.", "AuthorID": "7006092717", "AffiliationID": "60017252, 60006577", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Neurogenetics, National Institute on Aging, National Institutes of Health"}, "35519668300": {"Name": "Gasser T.", "AuthorID": "35519668300", "AffiliationID": "60084331, 60017246, 60103674", "AffiliationName": "Department for Neurodegenerative Diseases, Hertie Institute for Clinical Brain Research, University of T\u00fcbingen, German Centre for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE)"}, "14045338700": {"Name": "Lewis P.", "AuthorID": "14045338700", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology"}}}
