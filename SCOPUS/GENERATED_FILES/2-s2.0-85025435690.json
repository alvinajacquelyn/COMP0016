We integrate the additional knowledge of the similar signal into CS via \u21131-\u21131 and \u21131-\u21132 minimization. We then establish bounds on the number of measurements required by these problems to successfully reconstruct the original signal. Our bounds and geometrical interpretations reveal that if the prior information has good enough quality, \u21131-\u21131 minimization improves the performance of CS dramatically. In contrast, \u21131-\u21132 minimization has a performance very similar to classical CS, and brings no significant benefits. In addition, we use the insight provided by our bounds to design practical schemes to improve prior information. All our findings are illustrated with experimental results.", "AuthorKeywords": ["basis pursuit", "Compressed sensing", "Gaussian width.", "prior information", "\u21131-\u21131 and \u21131-\u21132 minimization"], "IndexKeywords": ["Additional knowledge", "basis pursuit", "Compressive sensing", "Gaussian width", "Geometrical interpretation", "Original signal", "Practical schemes", "Prior information"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85025435690", "SubjectAreas": [["Information Systems", "COMP", "1710"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Library and Information Sciences", "SOCI", "3309"]], "AuthorData": {"49061361500": {"Name": "Mota J.", "AuthorID": "49061361500", "AffiliationID": "60019656", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Sensors, Signals, and Systems, Heriot-Watt University"}, "14026659500": {"Name": "Deligiannis N.", "AuthorID": "14026659500", "AffiliationID": "60070034", "AffiliationName": "Imec"}, "57210526627": {"Name": "Rodrigues M.", "AuthorID": "57210526627", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electronic and Electrical Engineering Department, University College London"}}}
