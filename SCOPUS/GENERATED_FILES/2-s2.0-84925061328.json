Mechanical deformation of metamaterial arrays is driven by both resistive heating of bimorph nanostructures and the Lorentz force that acts on charges moving in a magnetic field. With electrically controlled transmission changes of up to 50% at sub-mW power levels, our approaches offer high contrast solutions for dynamic control of metamaterial functionalities in optoelectronic devices.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Dynamic controls", "High contrast", "Mechanical deformation", "Photonic metamaterials", "Power levels", "Resistive heating", "Spatial arrangements"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84925061328", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (miscellaneous)", "PHYS", "3101"]], "AuthorData": {"56117856900": {"Name": "Valente J.", "AuthorID": "56117856900", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "Optoelectronics Research Centre, Centre for Photonic Metamaterials, University of Southampton"}, "57201604213": {"Name": "Ou J.", "AuthorID": "57201604213", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "Optoelectronics Research Centre, Centre for Photonic Metamaterials, University of Southampton"}, "16426451100": {"Name": "Plum E.", "AuthorID": "16426451100", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "Optoelectronics Research Centre, Centre for Photonic Metamaterials, University of Southampton"}, "7004908928": {"Name": "Zheludev N.", "AuthorID": "7004908928", "AffiliationID": "60118967, 60005510", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Disruptive Photonic Technologies, Nanyang Technological University"}, "6603558777": {"Name": "Youngs I.", "AuthorID": "6603558777", "AffiliationID": "60026242", "AffiliationName": "Physical Sciences Department, DSTL"}}}
