Adopting a deconstructive framework, it purposefully centralizes what has previously been assigned a peripheral position throughout the ever-expanding \ufffdarchive of knowledge\ufffd (following Foucault) vis-\ufffd-vis particular refugee situations and critically interrogates how, why, and with what effect only certain bodies, identity markers, and models of humanitarian response become hypervisible in the European public sphere. The article starts by tracing the roles of visibility and invisibility in constituting the \ufffdideal refugee\ufffd (and the concomitant figure of the \ufffda-refugee\ufffd), before turning to refugee-refugee humanitarianism as an invisible form of Southern-led (rather than Northern-led or Northern-dominated) responses to displacement from Syria.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84991098055", "SubjectAreas": [["Social Psychology", "PSYC", "3207"], ["Communication", "SOCI", "3315"], ["Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)", "ARTS", "1201"]], "AuthorData": {"34979810900": {"Name": "Fiddian-Qasmiyeh E.", "AuthorID": "34979810900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
