While it is known that rhythmic sensory events can entrain brain oscillations at different frequencies, how learning and prior experience with sequencing relationships affect neocortical oscillations and neuronal responses is poorly understood. We used an implicit sequence learning paradigm (an \u201cartificial grammar\u201d) in which humans and monkeys were exposed to sequences of nonsense words with regularities in the ordering relationships between the words. We then recorded neural responses directly from the auditory cortex in both species in response to novel legal sequences or ones violating specific ordering relationships. Neural oscillations in both monkeys and humans in response to the nonsense word sequences show strikingly similar hierarchically nested low-frequency phase and high-gamma amplitude coupling, establishing this form of oscillatory coupling\u2014previously associated with speech processing in the human auditory cortex\u2014as an evolutionarily conserved biological process. Moreover, learned ordering relationships modulate the observed form of neural oscillatory coupling in both species, with temporally distinct neural oscillatory effects that appear to coordinate neuronal responses in the monkeys. This study identifies the conserved auditory cortical neural signatures involved in monitoring learned sequencing operations, evident as modulations of transient coupling and neuronal responses to temporally structured sensory input.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Animals", "Audiometry, Evoked Response", "Auditory Cortex", "Auditory Pathways", "Biological Evolution", "Brain Mapping", "Female", "Functional Neuroimaging", "Humans", "Macaca mulatta", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Models, Neurological", "Neural Conduction", "Neurons", "Neurovascular Coupling", "Reaction Time", "Species Specificity", "Speech Perception", "Task Performance and Analysis", "Verbal Learning"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85019022643", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Immunology and Microbiology (all)", "IMMU", "2400"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"]], "AuthorData": {"36523143800": {"Name": "Kikuchi Y.", "AuthorID": "36523143800", "AffiliationID": "60006222", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Behaviour and Evolution, Newcastle University"}, "56454382600": {"Name": "Attaheri A.", "AuthorID": "56454382600", "AffiliationID": "60006222", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Behaviour and Evolution, Newcastle University"}, "22735520500": {"Name": "Wilson B.", "AuthorID": "22735520500", "AffiliationID": "60006222", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Behaviour and Evolution, Newcastle University"}, "7102183421": {"Name": "Griffiths T.", "AuthorID": "7102183421", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60084279", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, University College London"}, "9043257600": {"Name": "Petkov C.", "AuthorID": "9043257600", "AffiliationID": "60006222", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Behaviour and Evolution, Newcastle University"}, "37000351300": {"Name": "Rhone A.", "AuthorID": "37000351300", "AffiliationID": "60024324", "AffiliationName": "Human Brain Research Laboratory, Department of Neurosurgery, The University of Iowa"}, "6507894702": {"Name": "Nourski K.", "AuthorID": "6507894702", "AffiliationID": "60024324", "AffiliationName": "Human Brain Research Laboratory, Department of Neurosurgery, The University of Iowa"}, "41561207500": {"Name": "Gander P.", "AuthorID": "41561207500", "AffiliationID": "60024324", "AffiliationName": "Human Brain Research Laboratory, Department of Neurosurgery, The University of Iowa"}, "13409468800": {"Name": "Kovach C.", "AuthorID": "13409468800", "AffiliationID": "60024324", "AffiliationName": "Human Brain Research Laboratory, Department of Neurosurgery, The University of Iowa"}, "8942321500": {"Name": "Kawasaki H.", "AuthorID": "8942321500", "AffiliationID": "60024324", "AffiliationName": "Human Brain Research Laboratory, Department of Neurosurgery, The University of Iowa"}, "7402455098": {"Name": "Howard M.", "AuthorID": "7402455098", "AffiliationID": "60024324", "AffiliationName": "Human Brain Research Laboratory, Department of Neurosurgery, The University of Iowa"}}}
