Inc.To determine whether coating polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) discs with Parylene-C would reduce Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans biofilm formation. Materials and Methods: MRSA and Candida albicans single and dual biofilms were grown for 48 hours in artificial saliva on parylene-C-coated or uncoated PMMA, and the viable biofilm colony-forming units were counted. Results: There was no significant difference in the count of viable methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus or Candida albicans recovered from single- or dual-species biofilms between coated and uncoated PMMA discs. Conclusion: Parylene-C does not prevent biofilm formation on PMMA.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Bacterial Adhesion", "Bacterial Load", "Biofilms", "Candida albicans", "Coated Materials, Biocompatible", "Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus", "Polymers", "Polymethyl Methacrylate", "Surface Properties", "Xylenes"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85062854962", "SubjectAreas": [["Oral Surgery", "DENT", "3504"]], "AuthorData": {"56624045900": {"Name": "Green I.M.", "AuthorID": "56624045900", "AffiliationID": "60013985", "AffiliationName": "Department of Microbial Diseases, UCL Eastman Dental Institute"}, "6602244656": {"Name": "Petridis H.", "AuthorID": "6602244656", "AffiliationID": "60013985", "AffiliationName": "Department of Microbial Diseases, UCL Eastman Dental Institute"}, "57207769389": {"Name": "Margoni I.", "AuthorID": "57207769389", "AffiliationID": "60013985", "AffiliationName": "Department of Restorative Dentistry, Unit of Prosthodontics, UCL Eastman Dental Institute"}, "7402726222": {"Name": "Nair S.P.", "AuthorID": "7402726222", "AffiliationID": "60013985", "AffiliationName": "Department of Restorative Dentistry, Unit of Prosthodontics, UCL Eastman Dental Institute"}}}
