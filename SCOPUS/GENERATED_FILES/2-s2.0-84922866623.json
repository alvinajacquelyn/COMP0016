Here we use archaeological data for this purpose, which brings in a temporal as well as spatial dimension. We analyse two distinct material cultures (pottery and personal ornaments) from Neolithic Europe, in order to: a) determine whether archaeologically defined \"cultures\" exhibit marked discontinuities in space and time, supporting the existence of a population structure, or merely isolation-by-distance; and b) investigate the extent to which cultures can be conceived as structuring \"cores\" or as multiple and historically independent \"packages\". Our results support the existence of a robust population structure comparable to previous studies on human culture, and show how the two material cultures exhibit profound differences in their spatial and temporal structuring, signalling different evolutionary trajectories.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Archaeology", "Cultural evolution", "Homophily", "Isolation-by-distance", "Material culture", "Neolithic Europe", "Population structure"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84922866623", "SubjectAreas": [["Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics", "AGRI", "1105"], ["Experimental and Cognitive Psychology", "PSYC", "3205"], ["Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)", "ARTS", "1201"]], "AuthorData": {"6602927062": {"Name": "Shennan S.", "AuthorID": "6602927062", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Archaeology"}, "35361380600": {"Name": "Crema E.", "AuthorID": "35361380600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Archaeology"}, "15028667700": {"Name": "Kerig T.", "AuthorID": "15028667700", "AffiliationID": "60024025", "AffiliationName": "Archaeology of Pre-Modern Economies (DFG Research Training Group 1878), Universities of Cologne and Bonn, Albertus-Magnus-Platz"}}}
