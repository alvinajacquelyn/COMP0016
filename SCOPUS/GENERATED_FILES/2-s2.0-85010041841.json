All rights reserved.Objectives: The high mortality among HIV/tuberculosis (TB) coinfected patients in Eastern Europe is partly explained by the high prevalence of drug-resistant TB. It remains unclear whether outcomes of HIV/TB patients with rifampicin/isoniazid-susceptible TB in Eastern Europe differ from those in Western Europe or Latin America. Methods: One-year mortality of HIV-positive patients with rifampicin/isoniazidsusceptible TB in Eastern Europe, Western Europe, and Latin America was analysed and compared in a prospective observational cohort study. Factors associated with death were analysed using Cox regression models Results: Three hundred and forty-one patients were included (Eastern Europe 127, Western Europe 165, Latin America 49). Proportions of patients with disseminated TB (50, 58, 59%) and initiating rifampicin+isoniazid+pyrazinamide-based treatment (93, 94, 94%) were similar in Eastern Europe, Western Europe, and Latin America respectively, whereas receipt of antiretroviral therapy at baseline and after 12 months was lower in Eastern Europe (17, 39, 39%, and 69, 94, 89%). The 1-year probability of death was 16% (95% confidence interval 11-24%) in Eastern Europe, vs. 4% (2-9%) in Western Europe and 9% (3-21%) in Latin America; P<0.0001. After adjustment for IDU, CD4+ cell count and receipt of antiretroviral therapy, those residing in Eastern Europe were at nearly 3-fold increased risk of death compared with those in Western Europe/Latin America (aHR 2.79 (1.15-6.76); P=0.023). Conclusions: Despite comparable use of recommended anti-TB treatment, mortality of patients with rifampicin/isoniazid-susceptible TB remained higher in Eastern Europe when compared with Western Europe/Latin America. The high mortality in Eastern Europe was only partially explained by IDU, use of ART and CD4+ cell count. These results call for improvement of care for TB/HIV patients in Eastern Europe.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Death", "Drug susceptibility testing", "Eastern Europe", "HIV", "Latin America", "TB:HIV study", "Treatment", "Tuberculosis", "Western Europe"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Antitubercular Agents", "Europe", "Europe, Eastern", "Female", "HIV Infections", "Humans", "Isoniazid", "Latin America", "Male", "Prospective Studies", "Rifampin", "Survival Analysis", "Tuberculosis"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85010041841", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"14322170800": {"Name": "Podlekareva D.N.", "AuthorID": "14322170800", "AffiliationID": "60022645", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pulmonary and Infectious Diseases, Nordsjaelland Hospital"}, "56083273900": {"Name": "Efsen A.M.W.", "AuthorID": "56083273900", "AffiliationID": "60030840, 60006564", "AffiliationName": "CHIP, Department of Infectious Diseases, Rigshospitalet, University of Copenhagen"}, "35307337700": {"Name": "Lundgren J.D.", "AuthorID": "35307337700", "AffiliationID": "60030840, 60006564", "AffiliationName": "CHIP, Department of Infectious Diseases, Rigshospitalet, University of Copenhagen"}, "7005723136": {"Name": "Kirk O.", "AuthorID": "7005723136", "AffiliationID": "60030840, 60006564", "AffiliationName": "CHIP, Department of Infectious Diseases, Rigshospitalet, University of Copenhagen"}, "56601225300": {"Name": "Schultze A.", "AuthorID": "56601225300", "AffiliationID": "60029950", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infection and Population Health, University College London Medical School"}, "7006513758": {"Name": "Mocroft A.", "AuthorID": "7006513758", "AffiliationID": "60029950", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infection and Population Health, University College London Medical School"}, "7004024274": {"Name": "Panteleev A.", "AuthorID": "7004024274", "AffiliationID": "113335763", "AffiliationName": "Department of HIV/TB, TB Hospital 2"}, "57209061309": {"Name": "Skrahina A.M.", "AuthorID": "57209061309", "AffiliationID": "112863185", "AffiliationName": "Republican Research and Practical Centre for Pulmonology and TB"}, "7102494372": {"Name": "Miro J.M.", "AuthorID": "7102494372", "AffiliationID": "60001576, 60030315, 60010814", "AffiliationName": "Infectious Diseases Service, Hospital Clinic - IDIBAPS, University of Barcelona"}, "34571970700": {"Name": "Rakhmanova A.", "AuthorID": "34571970700", "AffiliationID": "101889135", "AffiliationName": "Botkin Infectious Disease Hospital"}, "35225781600": {"Name": "Furrer H.", "AuthorID": "35225781600", "AffiliationID": "60010987, 60020486", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infectious Diseases, Bern University Hospital, University of Bern"}, "55547118657": {"Name": "Miller R.F.", "AuthorID": "55547118657", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Sexual Health and HIV Research, Mortimer Market Centre, University College London"}, "56785746500": {"Name": "Losso M.H.", "AuthorID": "56785746500", "AffiliationID": "60001846", "AffiliationName": "Department of Immunocompromised, Hospital J.M.
