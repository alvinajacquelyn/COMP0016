Rather, the practice of boycotting often requires further moral justification. We argue that this justification should not rely solely on the consequences of boycotting, nor should it rely solely on the complicity of the consumer. We suggest that both justifications are subject to pressing objections. In light of these objections, we outline an alternative non-consequentialist justification of commercial boycotting that is grounded in the moral values of conscience and personal integrity. We then explore the scope of this justification in the legal realm. We focus on cases where consumers lack freedom of exchange due to their contractual obligations and conclude by defending a qualified legal right to breach contracts on conscientious grounds.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85047623074", "SubjectAreas": [["Philosophy", "ARTS", "1211"]], "AuthorData": {"55553607400": {"Name": "Mills C.", "AuthorID": "55553607400", "AffiliationID": "60022020", "AffiliationName": "School of Law, University of Warwick"}, "56491554100": {"Name": "Saprai P.", "AuthorID": "56491554100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Laws, University College London"}}}
