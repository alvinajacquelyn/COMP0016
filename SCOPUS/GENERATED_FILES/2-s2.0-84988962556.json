Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc., on behalf of the American Psychological AssociationThere has been an increasing interest in patient-centered assessment of psychological treatments. This article reviews the existing patient-generated measures (PGMs) that have been used by clinicians and psychotherapy researchers to collect evaluation data from the patient perspective. A systematic review of literature was performed to identify PGMs in empirical studies between 1990 and 2014. Twenty tools were identified, of which three were designed to assess the outcome and 17 to assess the process of therapy. The characteristics of each are described and discussed, including psychometric data and evidence of clinical utility. This review helps professionals and researchers to implement the recommendation of health policies that advocate the importance of patient-centered care.", "AuthorKeywords": ["idiographic", "individualized PROMs", "outcome and process assessment", "patient experiences", "patient-centered assessment", "patient-generated measures", "patient-reported measures", "personalized assessment"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84988962556", "SubjectAreas": [["Clinical Psychology", "PSYC", "3203"]], "AuthorData": {"35339793400": {"Name": "Sales C.M.D.", "AuthorID": "35339793400", "AffiliationID": "60007249", "AffiliationName": "Faculdade de Psicologia e de Ci\u00eancias da Educa\u00e7\u00e3o, Centro de Psicologia da Universidade do Porto"}, "55226085300": {"Name": "Alves P.C.G.", "AuthorID": "55226085300", "AffiliationID": "60177635", "AffiliationName": "Instituto Universit\u00e1rio de Lisboa (ISCTE-IUL), Division of Health and Social Care Research, School of Medicine, King's College London"}}}
