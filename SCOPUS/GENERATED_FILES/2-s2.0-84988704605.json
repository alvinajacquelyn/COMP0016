All rights reserved.Objectives: To describe the spectrum of renal tubular disease (RTD) in HIV-positive patients and its association with exposure to antiretroviral therapy (ART). Design: Review of 265 consecutive renal biopsies from HIV-positive patients attending eight clinics in the United Kingdom between 2000 and 2012. Methods: We described the clinical characteristics of patients with RTD and compared current/recent exposure (at the time of, or up to 3 months prior to the date of biopsy) to potentially nephrotoxic ART [tenofovir (TDF), atazanavir (ATV), indinavir (IDV) and lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r)]. We also analysed the incidence of RTD in the UK CHIC cohort. Kruskall-Wallis, analysis of variance and Fisher's exact tests were used to evaluate between-group differences. Results: Of the 60 RTD cases, 54 (90%) were included in the analyses. RTD comprised of three distinct patterns: Acute tubular injury (ATI, n=22), tubulo-interstitial nephritis (TIN, n=20) and interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy (IFTA, n=12). Compared with TIN and IFTA, ATI cases were less likely to be of black ethnicity (10 vs. 42-55%; P=0.006), more likely to be on ART (100 vs. 55-68%; P=0.001), with HIV-RNA below 200 copies/ml (100 vs. 54-58%; P<0.001), and more likely to have current/ recent exposure to TDF (P<0.001). We did not find evidence for an association between exposure to TDF, ATV/r or LPV/r and either TIN or IFTA. Conclusion: RTD was present in approximately 20% of renal biopsies and comprised three distinct injury patterns with considerable clinical overlap. ATI was associated with TDF exposure, although the overall incidence of biopsy-defined ATI was low.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Atazanavir", "Drug-induced kidney injury", "HIV", "Interstitial", "Renal tubular disease", "Tenofovir"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "AIDS-Associated Nephropathy", "Anti-Retroviral Agents", "Antiretroviral Therapy, Highly Active", "Biopsy", "Female", "Histocytochemistry", "HIV Infections", "Humans", "Incidence", "Kidney", "Male", "Middle Aged", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84988704605", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"24080447200": {"Name": "Hamzah L.", "AuthorID": "24080447200", "AffiliationID": "60029685, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust and King's College London"}, "14025002900": {"Name": "Williams D.I.", "AuthorID": "14025002900", "AffiliationID": "60029685, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust and King's College London"}, "7005967261": {"Name": "Post F.A.", "AuthorID": "7005967261", "AffiliationID": "60029685, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust and King's College London"}, "36150412800": {"Name": "Booth J.W.", "AuthorID": "36150412800", "AffiliationID": "60032819, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Royal Free Hospital NHS Foundation Trust and University College London"}, "55872182100": {"Name": "Jose S.", "AuthorID": "55872182100", "AffiliationID": "60032819, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Royal Free Hospital NHS Foundation Trust and University College London"}, "56466212800": {"Name": "Sabin C.", "AuthorID": "56466212800", "AffiliationID": "60032819, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Royal Free Hospital NHS Foundation Trust and University College London"}, "57191288800": {"Name": "Mcadooc S.P.", "AuthorID": "57191288800", "AffiliationID": "60111785, 60032993, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "Chelsea and Westminster NHS Foundation Trust, Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust and Imperial College London"}, "57191289495": {"Name": "Kumar E.A.", "AuthorID": "57191289495", "AffiliationID": "60111785, 60032993, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "Chelsea and Westminster NHS Foundation Trust, Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust and Imperial College London"}, "55722574900": {"Name": "Jones R.", "AuthorID": "55722574900", "AffiliationID": "60111785, 60032993, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "Chelsea and Westminster NHS Foundation Trust, Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust and Imperial College London"}, "57191293366": {"Name": "O'donnelld P.", "AuthorID": "57191293366", "AffiliationID": "60005518, 60003456", "AffiliationName": "Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust, EBrighton and Sussex University Hospitals London"}, "7006452715": {"Name": "Hilton R.", "AuthorID": "7006452715", "AffiliationID": "60005518, 60003456", "AffiliationName": "Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust, EBrighton and Sussex University Hospitals London"}}}
