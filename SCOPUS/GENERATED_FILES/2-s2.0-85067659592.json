The film thickness and total twist angle of the chiral molecular structure were simultaneously measured using multiple-beam optical interference. As the film thickness was increased and the chiral structure deformed, the twist angle remained almost unchanged until discontinuous changes occurred at critical distances that were equally spaced by one cholesteric half-pitch length. Structural deformations generated oscillatory elastic forces with periodically spaced maxima corresponding to twist transitions. These findings were reproduced using an equilibrium model of cholesteric confinement and force generation. The analysis indicates that the strength of the azimuthal surface anchoring on mica is high, exceeding 0.2 mJ m-2.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Cholesteric liquid crystal films", "Cylindrical surface", "Direct measurement", "Equilibrium modeling", "Structural deformation", "Structural forces", "Surface force apparatus", "Surface-anchoring", "Equipment Design", "Liquid Crystals", "Mechanical Phenomena"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85067659592", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"]], "AuthorData": {"57197807676": {"Name": "Zheng W.", "AuthorID": "57197807676", "AffiliationID": "60020261", "AffiliationName": "Universit\u00e0 della Calabria, Dipartimento di Fisica"}, "36091943300": {"Name": "Perez-Martinez C.S.", "AuthorID": "36091943300", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry Laboratory, University of Oxford"}, "6507218261": {"Name": "Perkin S.", "AuthorID": "6507218261", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry Laboratory, University of Oxford"}, "6701775690": {"Name": "Petriashvili G.", "AuthorID": "6701775690", "AffiliationID": "60071901, 60071903", "AffiliationName": "Georgian Technical University, Institute of Cybernetics"}, "23972021900": {"Name": "Zappone B.", "AuthorID": "23972021900", "AffiliationID": "60020261, 60109553, 60021199", "AffiliationName": "Consiglio Nazionale Delle Ricerche, Istituto di Nanotecnologia (CNR-Nanotec), Rende (CS), C/o Dipartimento di Fisica, Universit\u00e0 della Calabria"}}}
