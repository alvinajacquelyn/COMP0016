This study provides an interdisciplinary study to investigate the key contributors driving air pollution emissions changes in China from 1997 to 2012, by applying the Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index method. The decomposition results are presented in both multiplicative and additive approaches to show the relative and absolute contribution of each factor in affecting emission changes. Changes in total particulate matter emissions are attributed to variations in primary particle, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides emissions. It is manifested that the economic growth effect and energy intensity effect have always been the two key drivers in affecting the changes in air pollutant emissions over the period. The effects of emission efficiency, production structure and population growth contribute less significantly to overall emission changes, and the impacts of different factors vary among different pollutants. Since current strategies and policies in combatting particulate matter emissions are inefficient, this paper provides a guideline for the Chinese Government to deal with the air pollution problem for sustainable development in China.", "AuthorKeywords": ["China", "Divisia index", "Emission drivers", "Index decomposition analysis", "PM2.5"], "IndexKeywords": ["China", "Divisia index", "Fine particulate matter", "Index decomposition analysis", "Inter-disciplinary studies", "Nitrogen oxides emission", "Particulate matter emissions", "Total particulate matter"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84988851478", "SubjectAreas": [["Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment", "ENER", "2105"], ["Environmental Science (all)", "ENVI", "2300"], ["Strategy and Management", "BUSI", "1408"], ["Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering", "ENGI", "2209"]], "AuthorData": {"57191339304": {"Name": "Lyu W.", "AuthorID": "57191339304", "AffiliationID": "60008928", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University"}, "56798676000": {"Name": "Li Y.", "AuthorID": "56798676000", "AffiliationID": "60025278", "AffiliationName": "School of Environment, Tsinghua University"}, "15839411900": {"Name": "Guan D.", "AuthorID": "15839411900", "AffiliationID": "60025278, 60001604", "AffiliationName": "Ministry of Education Key Laboratory for Earth System Modeling, Center for Earth System Science, Tsinghua University"}, "56447312900": {"Name": "Zhao H.", "AuthorID": "56447312900", "AffiliationID": "60025278, 60001604", "AffiliationName": "Ministry of Education Key Laboratory for Earth System Modeling, Center for Earth System Science, Tsinghua University"}, "55624488227": {"Name": "Zhang Q.", "AuthorID": "55624488227", "AffiliationID": "60025278, 60001604", "AffiliationName": "Ministry of Education Key Laboratory for Earth System Modeling, Center for Earth System Science, Tsinghua University"}, "57196426525": {"Name": "Liu Z.", "AuthorID": "57196426525", "AffiliationID": "60006332, 60009982", "AffiliationName": "John F.
