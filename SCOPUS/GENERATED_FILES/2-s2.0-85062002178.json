The purpose of our preliminary study was to assess if magnetic resonance texture analysis can differentiate parenchymal mass-like neurosarcoidosis granulomas from primary central nervous system lymphomas. Methods: A total of nine patients was evaluated, four with parenchymal neurosarcoidosis granulomas and five with primary central nervous system lymphomas. Magnetic resonance texture analysis was performed with commercial software using a filtration histogram technique. Texture features of different sizes and variations in signal intensity were extracted at six different spatial scale filters, followed by feature quantification using statistical and histogram parameters and 36 features were analysed for each sequence (T1-weighted, T2-weighted, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery, diffusion-weighted, apparent diffusion coefficient, T1-post contrast). The non-parametric Mann\u2013Whitney test was used to evaluate the differences between different texture parameters. Results: The differences in distribution of entropy on T2-weighted imaging, apparent diffusion coefficient and T1-weighted post-contrast images were statistically significant on all spatial scale filters. Magnetic resonance texture analysis using medium and coarse spatial scale filters was especially useful in discriminating neurosarcoidosis from primary central nervous system lymphomas for mean, mean positive pixels, kurtosis, and skewness on diffusion-weighted imaging (P < 0.004\u20130.030). At spatial scale filter 5, entropy on T2-weighted imaging (P = 0.001) was the most useful discriminator with a cut-off value of 6.12 (P = 0.001, area under the curve (AUC)-1, sensitivity (Sn)-100%, specificity (Sp)-100%), followed by kurtosis and skewness on diffusion-weighted imaging with a cut-off value of \u22120.565 (P = 0.011, AUC-0.97, Sn-100%, Sp-83%) and\u20130.365 (P = 0.008, AUC-0.98, Sn-100%, Sp-100%) respectively. Conclusion: Filtration histogram-based magnetic resonance texture analysis appears to be a promising modality to distinguish parenchymal neurosarcoidosis granulomas from primary central nervous system lymphomas.", "AuthorKeywords": ["histogram", "MRI", "neurosarcoidosis", "primary central nervous system lymphoma", "Texture analysis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Central Nervous System Diseases", "Central Nervous System Neoplasms", "Contrast Media", "Diagnosis, Differential", "Female", "Humans", "Lymphoma", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Sarcoidosis"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85062002178", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"25929795700": {"Name": "Bathla G.", "AuthorID": "25929795700", "AffiliationID": "60006455", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics"}, "54994909800": {"Name": "Soni N.", "AuthorID": "54994909800", "AffiliationID": "60006455", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics"}, "23027243700": {"Name": "Endozo R.", "AuthorID": "23027243700", "AffiliationID": "60090043, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Nuclear Medicine, University College London, Institute of Nuclear Medicine"}, "8556612100": {"Name": "Ganeshan B.", "AuthorID": "8556612100", "AffiliationID": "60090043, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Nuclear Medicine, University College London, Institute of Nuclear Medicine"}}}
