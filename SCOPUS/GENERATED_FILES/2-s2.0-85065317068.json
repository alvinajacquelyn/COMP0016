To contextualise these figures it is necessary to consider rates of improvement for those in the general population. This study examined rates of reliable improvement/deterioration for children in a school sample over time. N = 9074 children (mean age 12; 52% female; 79% white) from 118 secondary schools across England provided self-report mental health (SDQ), quality of life and demographic data (age, ethnicity and free school meals (FSM) at baseline and 1 year and self-report data on access to mental health support at 1 year). Multinomial logistic regressions and classification trees were used to analyse the data. Of 2270 (25%) scoring above threshold for mental health problems at outset, 27% reliably improved and 9% reliably deteriorated at 1-year follow up. Of 6804 (75%) scoring below threshold, 4% reliably improved and 12% reliably deteriorated. Greater emotional difficulties at outset were associated with greater rates of reliable improvement for both groups (above threshold group: OR = 1.89, p < 0.001, 95% CI [1.64, 2.17], below threshold group: OR = 2.23, p < 0.001, 95% CI [1.93, 2.57]). For those above threshold, higher baseline quality of life was associated with greater likelihood of reliable improvement (OR = 1.28, p < 0.001, 95% CI [1.13, 1.46]), whilst being in receipt of FSM was associated with reduced likelihood of reliable improvement (OR = 0.68, p < 0.01, 95% CI [0.53, 0.88]). For the group below threshold, being female was associated with increased likelihood of reliable deterioration (OR = 1.20, p < 0.025, 95% CI [1.00, 1.42]), whereas being from a non-white ethnic background was associated with decreased likelihood of reliable deterioration (OR = 0.66, p < 0.001, 95% CI [0.54, 0.80]). For those above threshold, almost one in three children showed reliable improvement at 1 year. The extent of emotional difficulties at outset showed the highest associations with rates of reliable improvement.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Child mental health", "Deterioration", "Improvement", "Outcomes"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Child", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Mental Health", "Public Health", "Quality of Life"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85065317068", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"6701596440": {"Name": "Wolpert M.", "AuthorID": "6701596440", "AffiliationID": "60170329", "AffiliationName": "Child Outcomes Research Consortium (CORC), Anna Freud National Centre for Children and Families"}, "57204026367": {"Name": "Zamperoni V.", "AuthorID": "57204026367", "AffiliationID": "60170329", "AffiliationName": "Child Outcomes Research Consortium (CORC), Anna Freud National Centre for Children and Families"}, "57208224227": {"Name": "Napoleone E.", "AuthorID": "57208224227", "AffiliationID": "60170329", "AffiliationName": "Child Outcomes Research Consortium (CORC), Anna Freud National Centre for Children and Families"}, "56612861900": {"Name": "Jacob J.", "AuthorID": "56612861900", "AffiliationID": "60170329", "AffiliationName": "Child Outcomes Research Consortium (CORC), Anna Freud National Centre for Children and Families"}, "15726142200": {"Name": "Promberger M.", "AuthorID": "15726142200", "AffiliationID": "60170329", "AffiliationName": "Child Outcomes Research Consortium (CORC), Anna Freud National Centre for Children and Families"}, "57208627406": {"Name": "Costa da Silva L.", "AuthorID": "57208627406", "AffiliationID": "60170329", "AffiliationName": "Child Outcomes Research Consortium (CORC), Anna Freud National Centre for Children and Families"}, "57205392769": {"Name": "Patel M.", "AuthorID": "57205392769", "AffiliationID": "60170329", "AffiliationName": "Child Outcomes Research Consortium (CORC), Anna Freud National Centre for Children and Families"}, "56339951200": {"Name": "Edbrooke-Childs J.", "AuthorID": "56339951200", "AffiliationID": "60170329", "AffiliationName": "Child Outcomes Research Consortium (CORC), Anna Freud National Centre for Children and Families"}, "55746318400": {"Name": "Patalay P.", "AuthorID": "55746318400", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "University of Liverpool"}, "56469192900": {"Name": "Fokkema M.", "AuthorID": "56469192900", "AffiliationID": "60019816", "AffiliationName": "University of Leiden"}}}
