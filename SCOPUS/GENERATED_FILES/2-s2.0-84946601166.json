Governments and industry in advanced economies welcome this trend, since it complements the \u2018knowledge economy\u2019 vision that has come to dominate higher education globally. Knowledge economy stakeholders consider doctoral scientists to constitute particularly high-value human capital; primed to contribute to economic growth via the creation and application of scientific knowledge. Little is known, however, about doctoral scientists\u2019 awareness of, and attitudes towards, the knowledge economy. This paper reports a study of UK doctoral scientists, which reveals that they are aware of, but ideologically divided towards, the knowledge economy. The knowledge economy relates to their scientific motivations, values and aspirations in complex ways. Four moral positions emerge, ranging from \u2018anti\u2019 to \u2018pro\u2019 knowledge economy. We discuss the characteristics of each moral position, concluding with the need for doctoral scientists to adopt better informed and more flexible professional outlooks.", "AuthorKeywords": ["academic identity", "doctorate", "knowledge economy", "postgraduates", "science careers"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84946601166", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"]], "AuthorData": {"55948114900": {"Name": "Hancock S.", "AuthorID": "55948114900", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Graduate School, Imperial College London"}, "35812554400": {"Name": "Walsh E.", "AuthorID": "35812554400", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Graduate School, Imperial College London"}, "57202372791": {"Name": "Hughes G.", "AuthorID": "57202372791", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Education"}}}
