All rights reserved.In humans, the endometrium, the uterine mucosal lining, undergoes dynamic changes throughout the menstrual cycle and pregnancy. Despite the importance of the endometrium as the site of implantation and nutritional support for the conceptus, there are no long-term culture systems that recapitulate endometrial function in vitro. We adapted conditions used to establish human adult stem-cell-derived organoid cultures to generate three-dimensional cultures of normal and decidualized human endometrium. These organoids expand long-term, are genetically stable and differentiate following treatment with reproductive hormones. Single cells from both endometrium and decidua can generate a fully functional organoid. Transcript analysis confirmed great similarity between organoids and the primary tissue of origin. On exposure to pregnancy signals, endometrial organoids develop characteristics of early pregnancy. We also derived organoids from malignant endometrium, and so provide a foundation to study common diseases, such as endometriosis and endometrial cancer, as well as the physiology of early gestation.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult Stem Cells", "Cell Culture Techniques", "Cell Differentiation", "Cell Lineage", "Cell Proliferation", "Cells, Cultured", "Culture Media", "Decidua", "Endometrial Neoplasms", "Endometrium", "Estrogens", "Female", "Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental", "Genotype", "Humans", "Organoids", "Phenotype", "Pregnancy", "Progesterone", "Time Factors", "Tissue Engineering", "Tumor Cells, Cultured"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85017216625", "SubjectAreas": [["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"57220437353": {"Name": "Turco M.Y.", "AuthorID": "57220437353", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Trophoblast Research, University of Cambridge"}, "7201375692": {"Name": "Gardner L.", "AuthorID": "7201375692", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Trophoblast Research, University of Cambridge"}, "57193869504": {"Name": "Gomez M.J.", "AuthorID": "57193869504", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, University of Cambridge"}, "24477380600": {"Name": "Farrell L.", "AuthorID": "24477380600", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Trophoblast Research, University of Cambridge"}, "7004602469": {"Name": "Hollinshead M.", "AuthorID": "7004602469", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, University of Cambridge"}, "7003894941": {"Name": "Moffett A.", "AuthorID": "7003894941", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Trophoblast Research, University of Cambridge"}, "6505931329": {"Name": "Cindrova-Davies T.", "AuthorID": "6505931329", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physiology, Development and Neuroscience, University of Cambridge"}, "7004249606": {"Name": "Hemberger M.", "AuthorID": "7004249606", "AffiliationID": "60000661", "AffiliationName": "Epigenetics Programme, Babraham Institute, Babraham Research Campus"}, "7201844309": {"Name": "Burton G.J.", "AuthorID": "7201844309", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physiology, Development and Neuroscience, University of Cambridge"}, "57193871455": {"Name": "Hughes J.", "AuthorID": "57193871455", "AffiliationID": "60025649, 60017488, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Medicine, Addenbrooke's Hospital, University of Cambridge"}, "55942654100": {"Name": "Marsh S.G.E.", "AuthorID": "55942654100", "AffiliationID": "60032819, 60020641", "AffiliationName": "Anthony Nolan Research Institute, Royal Free Hospital"}, "7004138643": {"Name": "Brosens J.J.", "AuthorID": "7004138643", "AffiliationID": "60000064, 60022020", "AffiliationName": "Division of Reproductive Health, Clinical Science Research Laboratories, Warwick Medical School, University of Warwick"}, "7006731536": {"Name": "Critchley H.O.", "AuthorID": "7006731536", "AffiliationID": "60028299, 60027272", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Reproductive Health, University of Edinburgh"}, "7006039575": {"Name": "Simons B.D.", "AuthorID": "7006039575", "AffiliationID": "60031101, 60105833", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Trust - Medical Research Council Stem Cell Institute, University of Cambridge"}, "8607696800": {"Name": "Koo B.K.", "AuthorID": "8607696800", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genetics, University of Cambridge"}}}
