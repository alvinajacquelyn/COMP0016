The reaction results in the formation of a new carbon-magnesium bond and a new fluorine-magnesium bond and is analogous to Grignard formation in homogeneous solution.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Coordination complex", "Grignard", "Homogeneous solutions"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84990836956", "SubjectAreas": [["Catalysis", "CENG", "1503"], ["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Colloid and Surface Chemistry", "CENG", "1505"]], "AuthorData": {"55274309300": {"Name": "Bakewell C.", "AuthorID": "55274309300", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Imperial College London"}, "35431952500": {"Name": "White A.", "AuthorID": "35431952500", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Imperial College London"}, "6603102853": {"Name": "Crimmin M.", "AuthorID": "6603102853", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Imperial College London"}}}
