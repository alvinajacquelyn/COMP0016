Finite calibration precision or an active manipulation by an attacker may cause the actual emitted photon number to deviate from the known value. We model effects of this deviation on the security of three quantum communication protocols: the Bennett-Brassard 1984 (BB84) quantum key distribution (QKD) protocol without decoy states, Scarani-Ac\u00edn-Ribordy-Gisin 2004 (SARG04) QKD protocol, and a coin-tossing protocol. For QKD we model both a strong attack using technology possible in principle and a realistic attack bounded by today's technology. To maintain the mean photon number in two-way systems, such as plug-and-play and relativistic quantum cryptography schemes, bright pulse energy incoming from the communication channel must be monitored. Implementation of a monitoring detector has largely been ignored so far, except for ID Quantique's commercial QKD system Clavis2. We scrutinize this implementation for security problems and show that designing a hack-proof pulse-energy-measuring detector is far from trivial. Indeed, the first implementation has three serious flaws confirmed experimentally, each of which may be exploited in a cleverly constructed Trojan-horse attack. We discuss requirements for a loophole-free implementation of the monitoring detector.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Calibration precision", "Coherent sources", "Coin-tossing protocol", "Emitted photons", "Modeling effects", "Quantum key distribution protocols", "Security problems", "Trojan Horse attacks"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84927534385", "SubjectAreas": [["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"]], "AuthorData": {"36134821500": {"Name": "Sajeed S.", "AuthorID": "36134821500", "AffiliationID": "60014171", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Waterloo"}, "56589517200": {"Name": "Kaiser S.", "AuthorID": "56589517200", "AffiliationID": "60014171", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Waterloo"}, "35777466000": {"Name": "Bourgoin J.", "AuthorID": "35777466000", "AffiliationID": "60014171", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Waterloo"}, "7401690380": {"Name": "Makarov V.", "AuthorID": "7401690380", "AffiliationID": "60014171", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Waterloo"}, "55480308300": {"Name": "Radchenko I.", "AuthorID": "55480308300", "AffiliationID": "60068680, 60021331", "AffiliationName": "General Physics Institute, Russian Academy of Sciences"}, "54387248300": {"Name": "Pappa A.", "AuthorID": "54387248300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "22981118700": {"Name": "Monat L.", "AuthorID": "22981118700", "AffiliationID": "60074547", "AffiliationName": "ID Quantique SA"}, "7003833104": {"Name": "Legr\u00e9 M.", "AuthorID": "7003833104", "AffiliationID": "60074547", "AffiliationName": "ID Quantique SA"}}}
