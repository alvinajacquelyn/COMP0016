Several studies suggest that the reinstatement of neural encoding patterns is beneficial for memory retrieval (Manning et al., 2011; Staresina et al., 2012; Jafarpour et al., 2014). However, reinstatement of the original encoding context is not always helpful, for instance, when retrieving a memory in a different contextual situation(Smith and Vela, 2001). It is an open question whether such context-dependent memory effects can be captured by the reinstatement of neural patterns. We investigated this question by applying temporal and spatial pattern similarity analysis in MEG and intracranial EEG in a context-match paradigm. Items (words) were tagged by individual dynamic context stimuli (movies). The results show that beta oscillatory phase in visual regions and the parahippocampal cortex tracks the incidental reinstatement of individual context trajectories on a single-trial level. Crucially, memory benefitted from reinstatement when the encoding and retrieval contexts matched but suffered from reinstatement when the contexts did not match.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Episodic memory", "Intracranial EEG", "MEG", "Oscillations"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Brain Waves", "Electroencephalography", "Female", "Humans", "Magnetoencephalography", "Male", "Memory, Episodic", "Mental Recall", "Models, Neurological", "Motion Pictures as Topic", "Parahippocampal Gyrus", "Photic Stimulation", "Visual Cortex", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84929353029", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"]], "AuthorData": {"21733748400": {"Name": "Staudigl T.", "AuthorID": "21733748400", "AffiliationID": "60025525", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, University of Konstanz"}, "6506938544": {"Name": "Hanslmayr S.", "AuthorID": "6506938544", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, University of Birmingham"}, "6507426960": {"Name": "Vollmar C.", "AuthorID": "6507426960", "AffiliationID": "60028717", "AffiliationName": "Epilepsy Center, Department of Neurology, University of Munich"}, "56207842400": {"Name": "Noachtar S.", "AuthorID": "56207842400", "AffiliationID": "60028717", "AffiliationName": "Epilepsy Center, Department of Neurology, University of Munich"}}}
