However, lesions larger than this require a tracheal replacement, of which there are currently few options available. The recent advancement of tissue-engineering principles in tracheal research is quickly opening up new vistas for airway reconstruction and creating a very promising future for medical science. This review discusses the main criteria required for the development of a tissue-engineered tracheal replacement. The criteria include: (a) appropriate cell types and sources; (b) biomolecules to direct the differentiation of the cells to the desired lineage (c) a suitable scaffold for a cellular matrix; and (d) a bioreactor to facilitate cell attachment and proliferation and construct transport to theatre. Our group has designed and developed the world's first synthetic tracheal replacement, using a novel nanocomposite material, also developed in our laboratory. It was implanted clinically in June 2011 with a successful outcome. The application of tissue-engineering approaches to tracheal replacement development is the first step towards the much-anticipated 'off-the-shelf' tissue-engineered technology, contributing extensively to the advancement in treatment and rehabilitation of patients afflicted with tracheal pathology.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Biomaterials", "Cartilage", "Clinical study", "Nanocomposite", "Nanotechnology", "POSS-PCU", "Regenerative medicine", "Stem cells", "Tissue engineering", "Trachea", "Transplantation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Animals", "Bioprosthesis", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Humans", "Nanocomposites", "Tissue Engineering", "Tissue Scaffolds", "Trachea", "Tracheal Diseases"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84927690739", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (miscellaneous)", "MEDI", "2701"], ["Biomaterials", "MATE", "2502"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"]], "AuthorData": {"54392763900": {"Name": "Crowley C.", "AuthorID": "54392763900", "AffiliationID": "60011326", "AffiliationName": "Royal National Throat, Nose and Ear Hospital and UCL Ear Institute"}, "7004957785": {"Name": "Birchall M.", "AuthorID": "7004957785", "AffiliationID": "60011326", "AffiliationName": "Royal National Throat, Nose and Ear Hospital and UCL Ear Institute"}, "7005344804": {"Name": "Seifalian A.M.", "AuthorID": "7005344804", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust Hospital"}}}
