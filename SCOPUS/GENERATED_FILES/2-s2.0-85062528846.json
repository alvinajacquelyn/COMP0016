Focusing on Jamaica between 1770 and 1805, which passed legislation for the 'policing' - in the broader Scottish sense - of its towns, demonstrates that itwas a global phenomenon common to thewhole BritishAtlantic. However, the solutions it produced were also specific to local circumstances. Jamaican elites feared invasion, revolt and the dissolution of the slave society. Their police acts reflected these concerns, and demonstrate the alternative pathway that urban modernity took in this part of the British Atlantic.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85062528846", "SubjectAreas": [["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"], ["History", "ARTS", "1202"], ["Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)", "ARTS", "1201"], ["Urban Studies", "SOCI", "3322"]], "AuthorData": {"56216305000": {"Name": "Graham A.", "AuthorID": "56216305000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of History, University College London"}}}
