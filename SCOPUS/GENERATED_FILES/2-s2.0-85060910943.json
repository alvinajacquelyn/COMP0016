A key role of the headteacher as policy narrator is to tell/sell a story about their school to themselves, their staff and the outside world of parents, inspectors and other stakeholders. The accounts they construct will depend to some extent on their perspectives, commitments and personal-professional identities as well as an interplay between national priorities and situated contexts. They will also depend on who they are speaking to and what they take to be a \u2018professional\u2019 response in relation to their policy work in school. Drawing on in-depth interviews with two experienced English primary school headteachers, Hazel and George, and Lakoff and Johnson\u2019s claim [1980. Metaphors We Live By. Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press] that metaphors are not just linguistic devices, but technologies of reasoning and understanding, this paper explores the ways in which headteachers deploy different tropes to explain what it is that they do. Metaphors of leadership explored include headship as branding, persuasion and not dropping the ball as well as fighting and parenting although there is an absence of any direct political critique in these two accounts.", "AuthorKeywords": ["metaphors of leadership", "Policy narration", "primary headship"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85060910943", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"]], "AuthorData": {"7201807975": {"Name": "Maguire M.", "AuthorID": "7201807975", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Public Policy Research, School of Education, Communication and Society, King\u2019s College London"}, "23134795600": {"Name": "Braun A.", "AuthorID": "23134795600", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Education, University College London"}}}
