Materials and methods: Forty-five patients (36 males and 9 females) referred for dental extraction underwent treatment and provided blood samples before, immediately after, and 24 h after the procedure. A broad array of biomarkers was employed to assess myocardial injury (highly sensitive troponin T, hs-TnT), bacterial burden (LPS endotoxin activity), and systemic inflammation (CRP, fibrinogen, IFN-\u03b3, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, and TNF-\u03b1). Results: Dental extraction in patients with and without CAD was associated with rises in hs-TnT (p = 0.013), hs-CRP (p < 0.001), fibrinogen (p = 0.005), endotoxin activity (p < 0.001), IFN-\u03b3 (p < 0.001), IL-6 (p < 0.001), IL-8 (p = 0.011), and IL-12 (p < 0.001) at 24 h compared with immediately post procedure. Changes in systemic inflammation and endotoxin activity were more evident in those with hs-TnT rise. Conclusions: Simple dental extractions may cause mild increase in hs-TnT, indicating minor myocardial injury in both patients with and without CAD. Acute systemic inflammation and endotoxemia could represent a possible link between invasive dental treatment and increased risk of acute cardiovascular events. These findings indicate that invasive dental treatment (as simple as a single dental extraction) may impact negatively on clinical outcomes in dental patients, especially those with CAD.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85071912499", "SubjectAreas": [["Dentistry (all)", "DENT", "3500"]], "AuthorData": {"36169871100": {"Name": "Habbab K.", "AuthorID": "36169871100", "AffiliationID": "60028907", "AffiliationName": "Prince Sultan Cardiac Center"}, "57198744550": {"Name": "D\u2019Aiuto F.", "AuthorID": "57198744550", "AffiliationID": "60013985", "AffiliationName": "UCL Eastman Dental Institute"}, "57213899881": {"Name": "Porter S.", "AuthorID": "57213899881", "AffiliationID": "60013985", "AffiliationName": "UCL Eastman Dental Institute"}, "35564916700": {"Name": "Habbab M.", "AuthorID": "35564916700", "AffiliationID": "60028907", "AffiliationName": "Prince Sultan Cardiac Center"}}}
