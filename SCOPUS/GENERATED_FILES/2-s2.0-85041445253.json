The shape of the final deposit depends on the flows within the droplet during evaporation. These flows are typically determined at the onset of the process by the intrinsic physical, chemical, and geometrical properties of the droplet and its environment. Here, we demonstrate deterministic emergence and real-Time control of Marangoni flows within the evaporating droplet by an external point source of vapor. By varying the source location, we can modulate these flows in space and time to pattern colloids on surfaces in a controllable manner.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Dynamic controls", "Geometrical property", "Marangoni flows", "Particle depositions", "Sessile droplet", "Source location", "Space and time", "Thin-film depositions"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85041445253", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"]], "AuthorData": {"57212796027": {"Name": "Malinowski R.", "AuthorID": "57212796027", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "56217400400": {"Name": "Parkin I.P.", "AuthorID": "56217400400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "55391086000": {"Name": "Volpe G.", "AuthorID": "55391086000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "8374046000": {"Name": "Volpe G.", "AuthorID": "8374046000", "AffiliationID": "60016437", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of Gothenburg"}}}
