The exact solution in a simple two-layered medium requires solving a degree-4 polynomial according to Snell's law, meaning a time-demanding solution. For narrow-beam sources a small-angle approximation is commonly used. In this new technique, we transformed the governing equations until the system can be solved by intersection of two curves. As these are monotonic with opposite slope, the crossing point can be estimated by iteration, with a minimum search algorithm. This method has been applied to focus synthetic aperture radar images of the Antarctic bedrock, improving the detected response in the wide-beam case, and reducing time regarding to compute the polynomial solution.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Back-projection", "Radar", "Refraction", "SAR", "Snell's law"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85063155039", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Earth and Planetary Sciences (all)", "EART", "1900"]], "AuthorData": {"24069933100": {"Name": "Arenas-Pingarron A.", "AuthorID": "24069933100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "35087329300": {"Name": "Brennan P.", "AuthorID": "35087329300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "6602216254": {"Name": "Corr H.", "AuthorID": "6602216254", "AffiliationID": "60025990", "AffiliationName": "British Antarctic Survey, High Cross"}}}
