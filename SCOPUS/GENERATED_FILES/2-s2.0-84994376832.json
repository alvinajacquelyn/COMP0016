There are relatively specific effects of X-linked genes on social cognition, language, emotional regulation, visuospatial, and numerical skills. Many human X-linked genes outside the X\u2013Y pairing pseudoautosomal regions escape X-inactivation. Dosage differences in the expression of such genes (which constitute at least 15% of the total) are likely to play an important role in male\u2013female neural differentiation, and in cognitive deficits and behavioral characteristics, particularly in the realm of social communication, that are associated with sex chromosome aneuploidies. \u00a9 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.", "AuthorKeywords": ["ADHD", "autism", "language", "X chromosome", "Y chromosome"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aneuploidy", "Animals", "Brain", "Cognition", "Humans", "Mental Disorders", "Sex Characteristics", "Sex Chromosomes", "Sex Differentiation", "Social Behavior"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84994376832", "SubjectAreas": [["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"]], "AuthorData": {"57131060700": {"Name": "Printzlau F.", "AuthorID": "57131060700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "57191861000": {"Name": "Wolstencroft J.", "AuthorID": "57191861000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "7004857206": {"Name": "Skuse D.", "AuthorID": "7004857206", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital Institute of Child Health, University College London"}}}
