Global warming initiated a cascade of palaeoenvironmental perturbations starting with increased continental weathering and an accelerated hydrological cycle that delivered higher loads of nutrients to coastal areas, stimulating biological productivity. The end-result was widespread anoxia and deposition of black shales: the hallmarks of OAEs. In order to assess the role of weathering as both an OAE initiator and terminator (via CO2 sequestration) during the Early Aptian OAE 1a (Selli Event, ~120 Ma) the isotopic ratio of lithium isotopes was analysed in three sections of shallow-marine carbonates from the Pacific and Tethyan realms and one basinal pelagic section from the Tethyan domain. Because the isotopic composition of lithium in seawater is largely controlled by continental silicate weathering and high- and low-temperature alteration of basaltic material, a shift to lighter \u03b47Li values is expected to characterize OAEs. The studied sections illustrate this phenomenon: \u03b47Li values decrease to a minimum coincident with the negative carbon-isotope excursion that effectively records the onset of OAE 1a. A second negative \u03b47Li excursion occurs coeval with the minimum in strontium isotopes after the event. The striking similarity to the strontium-isotope record argues for a common driver. The formation and destruction (weathering) of an oceanic LIP could account for the parallel trend in both isotope systems. The double-spike in lithium isotopes is probably related to a change in weathering congruencies. Such a chemostratigraphy is consistent with the hypothesis that an increase in silicate weathering, in conjunction with organic-carbon burial, led to drawdown of atmospheric CO2 during the early Aptian OAE 1a.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Li isotopes", "OAE 1a", "Selli event", "Silicate weathering"], "IndexKeywords": ["Biological productivity", "Isotopic composition", "Li isotopes", "Low temperature alteration", "Negative carbon isotope excursions", "Organic carbon burial", "Selli event", "Silicate weathering"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84944876552", "SubjectAreas": [["Geophysics", "EART", "1908"], ["Geochemistry and Petrology", "EART", "1906"], ["Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)", "EART", "1901"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"55555883700": {"Name": "Lechler M.", "AuthorID": "55555883700", "AffiliationID": "60020919", "AffiliationName": "Dipartimento di Scienze, Universit\u00e0 degli Studi della Basilicata"}, "6701340199": {"Name": "Prosser G.", "AuthorID": "6701340199", "AffiliationID": "60020919", "AffiliationName": "Dipartimento di Scienze, Universit\u00e0 degli Studi della Basilicata"}, "57204707349": {"Name": "Pogge von Strandmann P.A.E.", "AuthorID": "57204707349", "AffiliationID": "60009016, 60162128, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Earth and Planetary Sciences, University College London and Birkbeck, University of London"}, "6701532726": {"Name": "Jenkyns H.C.", "AuthorID": "6701532726", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, University of Oxford"}, "7003880309": {"Name": "Parente M.", "AuthorID": "7003880309", "AffiliationID": "60017293", "AffiliationName": "Dipartimento di Scienze della Terra, Dell'Ambiente e delle Risorse (DiSTAR), Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Napoli Federico II"}}}
