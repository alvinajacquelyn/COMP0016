FTIR results showed that during the modification, the formation of the silane coating occurs due to the appearance of the magnetite\u2013O\u2013Si\u2013R bond. According to TGA results, the mass loss in the range of temperatures 410\u2013650 \u00b0C is due to the destruction of covalent bonds Fe\u2013O\u2013Si. The Si\u2013O\u2013R coating leads to the decrease in the absolute value of the effective saturation magnetization due to the presence of a non-magnetic phase (coating) in the sample, but the coercivity increases with the coating thickness due to higher effective values of the magnetic anisotropy of the magnetostrictive nature. The thermal response of NP-based dispersions in silicone and oleic acid was shown that SLP value is higher for magnetic material dispersions in Lipiodol and oleic acid compared to silicone-based dispersions. This can be explained by the contribution of both Neel and Brownian relaxation processes. However, in the case of silicone-based dispersion, Brownian relaxation is negligible because of NP immobilization in viscous silicone matrix. As it is to the effect of coating on SLP, this is clearly evident in the case of silicone dispersions. The study of the heating ability of dispersions based on HDTMS-modified Fe3O4 NPs showed that the coating does not significantly decrease the SLP values.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Low-power alternating magnetic field", "Magnetite", "Nanocomposite", "Silane", "Specific loss power", "Surface modification"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85069717521", "SubjectAreas": [["Biotechnology", "BIOC", "1305"], ["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"], ["Materials Science (miscellaneous)", "MATE", "2501"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"25655548900": {"Name": "Storozhuk L.", "AuthorID": "25655548900", "AffiliationID": "60068511, 60011313", "AffiliationName": "Chuiko Institute of Surface Chemistry, National Academy of Science of Ukraine"}, "24474890100": {"Name": "Iukhymenko N.", "AuthorID": "24474890100", "AffiliationID": "60023137", "AffiliationName": "Chemical Faculty of Kyiv National Taras Shevchenko University"}}}
