The potential for reproduction declines and ceases as the ovaries become depleted of follicles. A transition period in mid-life, for 2 to 10 years, when menstruation is less regular is called the perimenopause. The menopause is associated with a significant decline in plasma concentrations of sex hormones, an increase in the concentrations of the gonadotrophins and changes in other hormones such as the inhibins. These changes are superimposed with effects of aging, social and metabolic factors, daily activity and well-being. Although the menopause is entirely natural, in some cases ovarian failure can occur earlier than usual; this is pathological and warrants careful biochemical investigations to distinguish it from conditions causing infertility. Elderly females are affected by a range of clinical disorders including endocrine, cardiovascular, skeletal, urogenital tract and immunological systems, body mass, vasomotor tone, mood and sleep pattern. Reference intervals for many diagnostic biochemical tests for the menopause need to be used when interpreting results in clinical investigations for patient management. The standardization and harmonization of assays are being addressed. Many women now choose to develop their career before bearing children, and the health service has had to change services around this. This review does not cover screening for and tests during pregnancy. The review is timely since the population is aging and there will be more demand on healthcare services.", "AuthorKeywords": ["endocrinology", "mass spectrometry", "Steroid hormones"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Female", "Gonadal Steroid Hormones", "Gonadotropins", "Humans", "Inhibins", "Menopause", "Middle Aged", "Reference Values"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85042909784", "SubjectAreas": [["Clinical Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1308"]], "AuthorData": {"7006775964": {"Name": "Honour J.", "AuthorID": "7006775964", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Women's Health, University College London"}}}
