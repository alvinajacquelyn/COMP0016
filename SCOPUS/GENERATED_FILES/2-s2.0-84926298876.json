What can result is a crystal-induced arthropathy often referred to as pseudogout, which is variable in both presentation and severity. A particularly destructive and deforming arthritis is an uncommon but well-recognized subtype of this disease. Radiologically resembling the neuroarthropathy described by Charcot, a pattern of joint fragmentation and structural collapse occurs in the absence of peripheral neuropathy. This pseudo-neuroarthropathy is rarely reported in the foot and ankle. Methods: A total of 15 cases of pseudo-neuroarthropathy involving some previously unreported joints within the foot and ankle are described in this case series of 9 patients. Results: All patients presented with disease involving multiple joints. Clinical deformity was apparent in each case, and extensive joint destruction was seen on plain radiographs. In 6 patients, histopathological CPPD diseas was confirmed on tissue biopsy of the affected joints. In the remaining 3 patients a clinical diagnosis was made on the basis of the classic appearance of pseudo-neuroarthropathy in the foot, with additional recognized features of CPPD. Operative management with deformity correction using joint arthrodesis produced satisfactory clinical and radiological results. Conclusions: In the absence of peripheral neuropathy and systemic disease, the pseudo-neuroarthropathy of CPPD should be considered when a progressively deforming and destructive arthritis is seen in the foot and ankle. Level of Evidence: Level IV, case series.Wrba\u0161k.", "AuthorKeywords": ["calcium pyrophosphate", "chondrocalcinosis", "pseudo-neuroarthropathy", "pseudogout", "pyrophosphate arthropathy"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Ankle Joint", "Arthropathy, Neurogenic", "Calcium Pyrophosphate", "Chondrocalcinosis", "Cohort Studies", "Combined Modality Therapy", "Disease Progression", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Humans", "Male", "Metatarsophalangeal Joint", "Middle Aged", "Retrospective Studies", "Risk Assessment", "Severity of Illness Index", "Tarsal Joints", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84926298876", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Orthopedics and Sports Medicine", "MEDI", "2732"]], "AuthorData": {"55861211400": {"Name": "Lomax A.", "AuthorID": "55861211400", "AffiliationID": "60024067", "AffiliationName": "Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital"}, "56581352800": {"Name": "Ferrero A.", "AuthorID": "56581352800", "AffiliationID": "60024067", "AffiliationName": "Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital"}, "9275785400": {"Name": "Cullen N.", "AuthorID": "9275785400", "AffiliationID": "60024067", "AffiliationName": "Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital"}, "33067771800": {"Name": "Goldberg A.", "AuthorID": "33067771800", "AffiliationID": "60024067", "AffiliationName": "Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital"}, "9043195500": {"Name": "Singh D.", "AuthorID": "9043195500", "AffiliationID": "60024067", "AffiliationName": "Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital"}}}
