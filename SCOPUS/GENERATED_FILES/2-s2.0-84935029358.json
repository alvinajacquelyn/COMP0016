All rights reserved.Respiratory depression remains an important clinical problem that limits the use of opiate analgesia. Activation of AMPA glutamate receptors has been shown to reverse fentanyl-induced respiratory changes. Here, we explored whether tianeptine, a drug known for its ability to phosphorylate AMPA receptors, can be used to prevent opiate-induced respiratory depression. A model of respiratory depression in conscious rats was produced by administration of morphine (10 mg/kg, i.p.). Rats were pre-treated with test compounds or control solutions 5 min prior to administration of morphine. Respiratory activity was measured using whole-body plethysmography. In conscious animals, tianeptine (2 and 10 mg/kg, ip) and DP-201 (2-(4-((3-chloro-6-methyl-5,5-dioxido-6,11-dihydrodibenzo[c,f][1,2] thiazepin-11-yl)amino)butoxy)acetic acid; tianeptine analogue; 2 mg/kg, ip) triggered significant (~30%) increases in baseline respiratory activity and prevented morphine-induced respiratory depression. These effects were similar to those produced by an ampakine CX-546 (15 mg/kg, ip). The antinociceptive effect of morphine (hot plate test) was unaffected by tianeptine pre-treatment. In conclusion, the results of the experiments conducted in conscious rats demonstrate that systemic administration of tianeptine increases respiratory output and prevents morphine-induced respiratory depression without interfering with the antinociceptive effect of opiates.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Ampakines", "Analgesia", "Morphine", "Nociception", "Opiates", "Respiratory depression", "Tianeptine"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Dioxanes", "Disease Models, Animal", "Excitatory Amino Acid Agonists", "Lung", "Male", "Morphine", "Pain Threshold", "Phosphorylation", "Piperidines", "Plethysmography, Whole Body", "Rats, Sprague-Dawley", "Receptors, AMPA", "Respiration", "Respiratory Insufficiency", "Thiazepines", "Time Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84935029358", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"]], "AuthorData": {"7003526303": {"Name": "Cavalla D.", "AuthorID": "7003526303", "AffiliationID": "115403461", "AffiliationName": "Revive Therapeutics Ltd."}, "56708721300": {"Name": "Chianelli F.", "AuthorID": "56708721300", "AffiliationID": "115403461", "AffiliationName": "Revive Therapeutics Ltd."}, "7004432175": {"Name": "Korsak A.", "AuthorID": "7004432175", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology, University College London"}, "56118823200": {"Name": "Hosford P.", "AuthorID": "56118823200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology, University College London"}, "57204343249": {"Name": "Gourine A.", "AuthorID": "57204343249", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology, University College London"}, "13004689900": {"Name": "Marina N.", "AuthorID": "13004689900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Department of Clinical Pharmacology, University College London"}}}
