Due to the rapid and continuous evolution of medical sciences, development of unbiased tools for monitoring the evolution of medical disciplines is required. Methodology/Principal Findings Network analysis was used to explore how the medical sciences have evolved between 1980 and 2015 based on the shared words contained in more than 9 million PubMed abstracts. The k-clique percolation method was used to extract local research communities within the network. Analysis of the shared vocabulary in research papers reflects the trends of collaboration and splintering among different disciplines in medicine. Our model identifies distinct communities within each discipline that preferentially collaborate with other communities within other domains of specialty, and overturns some common perceptions. Conclusions/Significance Our analysis provides a tool to assess growth, merging, splitting and contraction of research communities and can thereby serve as a guide to inform policymakers about funding and training in healthcare.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Biomedical Research", "Humans", "Vocabulary, Controlled"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85001944018", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"35957391900": {"Name": "Shirazi A.H.", "AuthorID": "35957391900", "AffiliationID": "60032873", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Shahid Beheshti University - G.C"}, "57192236341": {"Name": "Modiri A.B.", "AuthorID": "57192236341", "AffiliationID": "60032873", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Shahid Beheshti University - G.C"}, "57215416754": {"Name": "Heydari S.", "AuthorID": "57215416754", "AffiliationID": "60032873", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Shahid Beheshti University - G.C"}, "8558289900": {"Name": "Jafari G.R.", "AuthorID": "8558289900", "AffiliationID": "60032873", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Shahid Beheshti University - G.C"}, "7003803831": {"Name": "Rohn J.L.", "AuthorID": "7003803831", "AffiliationID": "60182839, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Nephrology, UCL Division of Medicine, Royal Free Campus, University College London"}, "7101619634": {"Name": "Mani A.R.", "AuthorID": "7101619634", "AffiliationID": "60182839, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Liver and Digestive Health, UCL Division of Medicine, Royal Free Campus, University College London"}}}
