The approach was developed by utilizing the commercially available numerical computational package, Computer Simulation Technology, to assess the electromagnetic environment of a Royal Navy Type 22 Batch II Frigate. A number of the results of such an assessment were validated using measurements on a 1:50 scale copper model of the Type 22 Batch II Frigate. The approach was then applied to a new concept phase design study for a Future Patrol Ship, produced by UK Ministry of Defence's Naval Design Partnership. This work is expected to be useful in assessing the severity of topside EMI, using numerical modeling and simulations, in Concept-Phase Ship Design.", "AuthorKeywords": ["concept-phase ship design", "electromagnetic compatibility (EMC)", "Electromagnetic interference (EMI)", "modeling and simulation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Computational package", "Computer simulation technology", "Copper model", "Electromagnetic environments", "Model and simulation", "Naval ship designs", "Ship designs", "UK Ministry of Defence"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84994008571", "SubjectAreas": [["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"57191831676": {"Name": "Gharib A.", "AuthorID": "57191831676", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "7202821654": {"Name": "Griffiths H.D.", "AuthorID": "7202821654", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "7202676419": {"Name": "Andrews D.J.", "AuthorID": "7202676419", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}}}
