This observation may suggest an analysis in terms of X-bar-style \u2018\u2018structural layering.\u2019\u2019 However, such an account faces several problems: (a) in languages with PP-AP-N order, scrambling of the AP is permitted; (b) in languages with AP-N-PP or PP-N-AP order, there is evidence that the AP can c-command the PP, as well as the other way around; and (c) in languages with N-AP-PP order, the AP can take scope over the PP, as well as the other way around, arguably as a consequence of a structural ambiguity. We therefore develop an alternative analysis based on a striking parallel between the syntax of attributive APs and that of objects: while OV languages systematically allow adverbs to intervene between object and verb, VO languages tend to require verbobject-adverb order. This aspect of verbal syntax is familiar and can be captured in terms of a well-known linear constraint: Case Adjacency (Stowell 1981, Janke and Neeleman 2012). We propose that this constraint has a nominal counterpart that ensures N-AP adjacency in nouninitial structures. Thus, this instance of NP/VP parallelism has its source in parallel constraints, rather than parallel structural layers.", "AuthorKeywords": ["AP adjacency", "Attribution", "Case adjacency", "PP peripherality"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85011961556", "SubjectAreas": [["Language and Linguistics", "ARTS", "1203"], ["Linguistics and Language", "SOCI", "3310"]], "AuthorData": {"57193242267": {"Name": "Belk Z.", "AuthorID": "57193242267", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Linguistics"}, "6603228228": {"Name": "Neeleman A.", "AuthorID": "6603228228", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Linguistics"}}}
