An optimum gross efficiency of (1.36 \u00b1 0.02)% was achieved, amounting to an increase of (290 \u00b1 20)% relative to the performance of an equivalent single-stage accelerator. The performance increase due to pulse-shaping for a two-stage setup was found to surpass that achieved for this single-stage setup in terms of both efficiency and velocity. This investigation highlights the potential of pulse-shaping methods to increase the feasibility and flexibility of electrical acceleration for a variety of practical applications. The intention of this paper was to exhibit the potential of reluctance acceleration technology in multi-stage, initially by using a two-stage system. Possible avenues for further investigation are proposed, to build upon the results of this study.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Accelerator magnets", "Energy efficiency", "Linear accelerators", "Magnetic circuits", "Magnetic devices"], "IndexKeywords": ["Efficiency gain", "Electrical pulse", "Multi stage", "Pulse shaping method", "Reluctance accelerators", "Single stage", "Two stage system"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85015024963", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Engineering (all)", "ENGI", "2200"]], "AuthorData": {"57193577406": {"Name": "Harris M.", "AuthorID": "57193577406", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "57193571114": {"Name": "Shaikh M.", "AuthorID": "57193571114", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "56525450300": {"Name": "Bristoll B.", "AuthorID": "56525450300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "57193579919": {"Name": "Vine K.", "AuthorID": "57193579919", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "56415822800": {"Name": "Bartlett P.", "AuthorID": "56415822800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}}}
