The assessment of land use impacts in decision-support tools such as life cycle assessment (LCA) requires spatially explicit models, but existing approaches are either not spatially differentiated or modeled at very coarse scales (e.g., biomes or ecoregions). In this paper, we develop a high-resolution (900 m) assessment method for land use impacts on biodiversity based on habitat suitability models (HSM) of mammal species. This method considers potential land use effects on individual species, and impacts are weighted by the species' conservation status and global rarity. We illustrate the method using a case study of crop production in East Africa, but the underlying HSMs developed by the Global Mammals Assessment are available globally. We calculate impacts of three major export crops and compare the results to two previously developed methods (focusing on local and regional impacts, respectively) to assess the relevance of the methodological innovations proposed in this paper. The results highlight hotspots of product-related biodiversity impacts that help characterize the links among agricultural production, consumption, and biodiversity loss.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Agricultural land use", "Agricultural productions", "Conservation status", "Decision support tools", "Habitat suitability model", "Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)", "Methodological innovations", "Spatially explicit models", "Africa, Eastern", "Agriculture", "Animals", "Biodiversity", "Camellia sinensis", "Coffea", "Crops, Agricultural", "Ecosystem", "Models, Theoretical", "Tobacco"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84923112398", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Environmental Chemistry", "ENVI", "2304"]], "AuthorData": {"36704496800": {"Name": "De Baan L.", "AuthorID": "36704496800", "AffiliationID": "60025858", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Environmental Engineering, ETH Zurich"}, "56908457300": {"Name": "Curran M.", "AuthorID": "56908457300", "AffiliationID": "60025858", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Environmental Engineering, ETH Zurich"}, "6603550824": {"Name": "Hellweg S.", "AuthorID": "6603550824", "AffiliationID": "60025858", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Environmental Engineering, ETH Zurich"}, "6506118014": {"Name": "Rondinini C.", "AuthorID": "6506118014", "AffiliationID": "60032350", "AffiliationName": "Global Mammal Assessment Program, Department of Biology and Biotechnologies, Sapienza University of Rome"}, "26647965400": {"Name": "Visconti P.", "AuthorID": "26647965400", "AffiliationID": "60098463", "AffiliationName": "Computational Ecology, Microsoft Research"}, "6507337126": {"Name": "Koellner T.", "AuthorID": "6507337126", "AffiliationID": "60023208", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ecological Services, Faculty of Biology, Chemistry and Earth Sciences, University of Bayreuth"}}}
