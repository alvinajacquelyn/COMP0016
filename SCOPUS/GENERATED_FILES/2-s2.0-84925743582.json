Results: Ultracentrifugation and x-ray/neutron scattering, together with atomistic modeling, revealed asymmetric concentration-independent IgG1 solution structures. Conclusion: The complement and receptor Fc binding sites are not hindered by the Fab regions, explaining its full activity. Significance: These solution structures clarify IgG1 activity and its therapeutic applications.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Asymmetric concentration", "Atomistic modeling", "Conformational stabilities", "Solution structures", "Therapeutic Application", "Ultracentrifugation", "Complement C1q", "Humans", "Immunoglobulin G", "Ligands", "Models, Molecular", "Neutron Diffraction", "Protein Binding", "Protein Stability", "Receptors, IgG", "Solutions", "X-Ray Diffraction"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84925743582", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"55523165000": {"Name": "Rayner L.E.", "AuthorID": "55523165000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Structural and Molecular Biology, Division of Biosciences, Darwin Building, University College London"}, "56308009800": {"Name": "Hui G.K.", "AuthorID": "56308009800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Structural and Molecular Biology, Division of Biosciences, Darwin Building, University College London"}, "6603153709": {"Name": "Gor J.", "AuthorID": "6603153709", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Structural and Molecular Biology, Division of Biosciences, Darwin Building, University College London"}, "7201961714": {"Name": "Perkins S.J.", "AuthorID": "7201961714", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Structural and Molecular Biology, Division of Biosciences, Darwin Building, University College London"}, "7005527546": {"Name": "Heenan R.K.", "AuthorID": "7005527546", "AffiliationID": "60001724, 60009523, 60023254", "AffiliationName": "ISIS Facility, Science and Technology Facilities Council, Rutherford Appleton Laboratory"}, "6701589883": {"Name": "Dalby P.A.", "AuthorID": "6701589883", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemical Engineering, Division of Engineering, Roberts Building, University College London"}}}
