Coherent monostatic and bistatic data was collected with the University College London (UCL) NetRAD 2.4 GHz radar, and the Cranfield University CW radar operating at X-band. Initial analysis shows the bistatic Doppler signature of wind turbines and informs on the key differences seen at modest bistatic angles. Polarimetric variations are also analysed via data gathered from using co-polarised VV and HH and cross-polarised VH components.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Bistatic angle", "Cranfield University", "Doppler signatures", "Measurement and analysis", "Monostatic", "Monostatic radar", "Multiband", "University College London"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84936888419", "SubjectAreas": [["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"36186273500": {"Name": "Ritchie M.", "AuthorID": "36186273500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electronic and Electrical Engineering, UCL"}, "55574564400": {"Name": "Fioranelli F.", "AuthorID": "55574564400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electronic and Electrical Engineering, UCL"}, "7202821654": {"Name": "Griffiths H.", "AuthorID": "7202821654", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electronic and Electrical Engineering, UCL"}, "26435138500": {"Name": "Balleri A.", "AuthorID": "26435138500", "AffiliationID": "60004407", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Electronic Warfare, Defence Academy of United Kingdom, Cranfield University"}}}
