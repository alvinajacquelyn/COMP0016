Method Happy and sad emotion expressions were presented to DPRD and non-referred control (NC) subjects in an implicit event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) design, and correlated with self report scales reflecting typical co-morbidities of DPRD: depression, dissociation, anxiety, somatization. Results Significant differences between the slopes of the two groups were observed for somatization in the right temporal operculum (happy) and ventral striatum, bilaterally (sad). Discriminative regions for symptoms of depression were the right pulvinar (happy) and left amygdala (sad). For dissociation, discriminative regions were the left mesial inferior temporal gyrus (happy) and left supramarginal gyrus (sad). For state anxiety, discriminative regions were the left inferior frontal gyrus (happy) and parahippocampal gyrus (sad). For trait anxiety, discriminative regions were the right caudate head (happy) and left superior temporal gyrus (sad). Discussion The ascertained brain regions are in line with previous findings for the respective traits. The findings suggest separate brain systems for each trait. Conclusion Our results do not justify any bias for a certain nosological category in DPRD.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Depersonalization-derealization disorder", "depression", "differential regression analysis", "dissociation", "facial expression processing", "functional magnetic resonance imaging", "somatization severity", "state anxiety", "trait anxiety"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Anxiety", "Brain", "Brain Mapping", "Case-Control Studies", "Depersonalization", "Depression", "Dissociative Disorders", "Female", "Functional Neuroimaging", "Happiness", "Humans", "Male", "Somatoform Disorders"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84959357703", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"6603307512": {"Name": "Lemche E.", "AuthorID": "6603307512", "AffiliationID": "60177635, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "Section of Cognitive Neuropsychiatry, Institute of Psychiatry, King's College School of Medicine"}, "6603167558": {"Name": "Surguladze S.A.", "AuthorID": "6603167558", "AffiliationID": "60177635, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "Section of Cognitive Neuropsychiatry, Institute of Psychiatry, King's College School of Medicine"}, "56243459400": {"Name": "Sierra M.", "AuthorID": "56243459400", "AffiliationID": "60177635, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "Section of Cognitive Neuropsychiatry, Institute of Psychiatry, King's College School of Medicine"}, "7402606754": {"Name": "David A.S.", "AuthorID": "7402606754", "AffiliationID": "60177635, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "Section of Cognitive Neuropsychiatry, Institute of Psychiatry, King's College School of Medicine"}, "7006746119": {"Name": "Brammer M.J.", "AuthorID": "7006746119", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Neuroimaging Sciences, Institute of Psychiatry"}, "35419560700": {"Name": "Williams S.C.R.", "AuthorID": "35419560700", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Neuroimaging Sciences, Institute of Psychiatry"}, "6602160284": {"Name": "Giampietro V.P.", "AuthorID": "6602160284", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Neuroimaging Sciences, Institute of Psychiatry"}, "57203365458": {"Name": "Phillips M.L.", "AuthorID": "57203365458", "AffiliationID": "60028131, 60015543", "AffiliationName": "Western Psychiatric Institute and Clinic, University of Pittsburgh, School of Medicine"}}}
