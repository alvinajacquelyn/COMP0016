This paper presents the findings of a systematic literature review of treatment outcomes with ERT in adult female patients. Methods: A comprehensive systematic literature review was conducted through January 2017 to retrieve published papers with original data on ERT in the treatment of Fabry disease. The review included all original articles that presented ERT outcomes data on patients with Fabry disease, irrespective of the study type. Results: Clinical evidence for the efficacy of ERT in female patients was available from 67 publications including six clinical trial publications, and indicates significant reductions in plasma and urine globotriaosylceramide (GL-3) accumulation (in female patients with elevated pre-treatment levels) and improvements in cardiac parameters and quality of life (QoL). To date, data are insufficient to conclude on the effects of ERT on the nervous system, gastrointestinal manifestations, and pain in female patients with Fabry disease. Conclusions: This review of available literature data demonstrates that ERT in adult female patients with Fabry disease has a beneficial effect on GL-3 levels and cardiac outcomes. The current evidence also suggests that ERT may improve QoL in this patient population, though further studies are needed to examine these results.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Adult female patients", "Agalsidase alfa", "Agalsidase beta", "Enzyme replacement therapy", "Fabry disease", "Systematic literature review"], "IndexKeywords": ["alpha-Galactosidase", "Clinical Trials as Topic", "Enzyme Replacement Therapy", "Fabry Disease", "Female", "Gastrointestinal Tract", "Humans", "Isoenzymes", "Nervous System", "Observational Studies as Topic", "Pain", "Quality of Life", "Recombinant Proteins", "Treatment Outcome", "Trihexosylceramides"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85050122338", "SubjectAreas": [["Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism", "MEDI", "2712"], ["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Endocrinology", "BIOC", "1310"]], "AuthorData": {"7006706457": {"Name": "Germain D.P.", "AuthorID": "7006706457", "AffiliationID": "60029937, 60106116, 60106017", "AffiliationName": "French Referral Center for Fabry disease, Division of Medical Genetics and INSERM U1179, University of Versailles, Paris-Saclay University"}, "7004305446": {"Name": "Arad M.", "AuthorID": "7004305446", "AffiliationID": "60005681, 60011766", "AffiliationName": "Leviev Heart Center, Sheba Medical Center, Tel Hashomer, and Tel Aviv University"}, "16427566800": {"Name": "Burlina A.", "AuthorID": "16427566800", "AffiliationID": "120109633", "AffiliationName": "Neurological Unit, St Bassiano Hospital"}, "57202356433": {"Name": "Elliott P.M.", "AuthorID": "57202356433", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60004093", "AffiliationName": "University College London and Barts Heart Centre"}, "7003400734": {"Name": "Falissard B.", "AuthorID": "7003400734", "AffiliationID": "60106085, 60123796, 60106017", "AffiliationName": "INSERM U1018, University of Paris-Sud, University of Paris-Descartes"}, "7005437081": {"Name": "Feldt-Rasmussen U.", "AuthorID": "7005437081", "AffiliationID": "60006564, 60015199", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Endocrinology, Section 2132, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen University Hospital"}, "7005993594": {"Name": "Hilz M.J.", "AuthorID": "7005993594", "AffiliationID": "60000765", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, University of Erlangen-Nuremberg"}, "55186237200": {"Name": "Hughes D.A.", "AuthorID": "55186237200", "AffiliationID": "60170516, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Lysosomal Storage Disorders Unit, Department of Haematology, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust and University College London"}, "57202476826": {"Name": "Ortiz A.", "AuthorID": "57202476826", "AffiliationID": "60019290, 60026796", "AffiliationName": "Unidad de Di\u00e1lisis, IIS-Fundaci\u00f3n Jim\u00e9nez D\u00edaz/UAM, IRSIN and REDINREN"}, "57212349814": {"Name": "Wanner C.", "AuthorID": "57212349814", "AffiliationID": "60032515, 60012689", "AffiliationName": "Division of Nephrology, University Clinic, University of W\u00fcrzburg"}, "6603774095": {"Name": "Weidemann F.", "AuthorID": "6603774095", "AffiliationID": "60033050", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Innere Klinik II, Katharinen-Hospital"}, "57202378580": {"Name": "Spada M.", "AuthorID": "57202378580", "AffiliationID": "60012259", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatrics, University of Torino"}}}
