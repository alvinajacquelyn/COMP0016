This paper is derived from an exploration of Qatari encounters with globalizing discourses of genetics, particularly as they relate to notions of risk. It explores Qataris negotiations of global interactions and influences, including the discourses around genetic risk and cousin marriage. It suggests that family marriage can be seen as one of the main platforms of resistance and a means for modern, cosmopolitan and tradition to be negotiated.", "AuthorKeywords": ["genetics", "globalisation", "medical anthropology", "Middle East", "Qatar", "risk"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Anthropology, Medical", "Child", "Consanguinity", "Family", "Female", "Genetic Research", "Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice", "Humans", "Internationality", "Male", "Qatar"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85025439785", "SubjectAreas": [["Anthropology", "SOCI", "3314"], ["Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)", "ARTS", "1201"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"23028373000": {"Name": "Kilshaw S.", "AuthorID": "23028373000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anthropology, University College London"}}}
