Liver biopsy, although an invasive method, is the recommended 'reference standard' for diagnosis and staging of hepatic fibrosis in people with liver diseases. Transient elastography is a non-invasive method for assessing and staging hepatic fibrosis. Objectives To determine the diagnostic accuracy of transient elastography for diagnosis and staging hepatic fibrosis in people with alcoholic liver disease when compared with liver biopsy. To identify the optimal cut-off values for differentiating the five stages of hepatic fibrosis. Search methods The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled and Diagnostic Test Accuracy Studies Registers, The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (OvidSP), EMBASE (OvidSP), and the Science Citation Index Expanded (last search August 2014). Selection criteria Diagnostic cohort and diagnostic case-control study designs that assessed hepatic fibrosis in participants with alcoholic liver disease with transient elastography and liver biopsy, irrespective of language or publication status. The study participants could be of any sex and ethnic origin, above 16 years old, hospitalised or managed as outpatients. We excluded participants with viral hepatitis, autoimmunity, metabolic diseases, and toxins.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Disease Progression", "Elasticity Imaging Techniques", "Humans", "Liver Cirrhosis", "Liver Diseases, Alcoholic", "Prospective Studies", "Retrospective Studies", "Sensitivity and Specificity"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84962196322", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"57196355076": {"Name": "Pavlov C.S.", "AuthorID": "57196355076", "AffiliationID": "60010188", "AffiliationName": "Clinic of Internal Diseases Propedeutics, I.M.
