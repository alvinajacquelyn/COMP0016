Methods: Qualitative, semistructured interviews with a purposive sample of people with direct experience of commissioning, providing, and regulating health care provision in care homes and care home residents. Data from interviews were augmented by a secondary analysis of previous interviews with care home residents on their personal experience of and priorities for access to health care. Analysis was framed by the assumptions of realist evaluation and drew on the constant comparative method to identify key themes about what is required to achieve quality health care provision to care homes and resident health. Results: Participants identified 3 overlapping approaches to the provision of NHS that they believed supported access to health care for older people in care homes: (1) Investment in relational working that fostered continuity and shared learning between visiting NHS staff and care home staff, (2) the provision of age-appropriate clinical services, and (3) governance arrangements that used contractual and financial incentives to specify a minimum service that care homes should receive. Conclusion: The 3 approaches, and how they were typified as working, provide a rich picture of the stakeholder perspectives and the underlying assumptions about how service delivery models should work with care homes. The findings inform how evidence on effective working in care homes will be interrogated to identify how different approaches, or specifically key elements of those approaches, achieve different health-related outcomes in different situations for residents and associated health and social care organizations.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Care homes", "Frailty", "Health care", "Health services", "Older people", "Realist review"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Delivery of Health Care, Integrated", "England", "Female", "Health Services Accessibility", "Health Services for the Aged", "Health Services Needs and Demand", "Health Services Research", "Homes for the Aged", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Nursing Homes", "Patient Care Team", "State Medicine"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84928702702", "SubjectAreas": [["Nursing (all)", "NURS", "2900"], ["Health Policy", "MEDI", "2719"], ["Geriatrics and Gerontology", "MEDI", "2717"]], "AuthorData": {"7202267987": {"Name": "Goodman C.", "AuthorID": "7202267987", "AffiliationID": "60032760", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Research in Primary and Community Care, University of Hertfordshire"}, "57198502507": {"Name": "Davies S.L.", "AuthorID": "57198502507", "AffiliationID": "60032760", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Research in Primary and Community Care, University of Hertfordshire"}, "23088143100": {"Name": "Gordon A.L.", "AuthorID": "23088143100", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "Division of Rehabilitation and Ageing, University of Nottingham"}, "35447547200": {"Name": "Gladman J.R.F.", "AuthorID": "35447547200", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "Division of Rehabilitation and Ageing, University of Nottingham"}, "10039531600": {"Name": "Meyer J.", "AuthorID": "10039531600", "AffiliationID": "60025704", "AffiliationName": "School of Health Sciences, City University"}, "7202682987": {"Name": "Bowman C.", "AuthorID": "7202682987", "AffiliationID": "60025704", "AffiliationName": "School of Health Sciences, City University"}, "7004547326": {"Name": "Dening T.", "AuthorID": "7004547326", "AffiliationID": "60015138, 60172395", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Dementia, Institute of Mental Health, University of Nottingham"}, "55178181800": {"Name": "Zubair M.", "AuthorID": "55178181800", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "School of Sociology and Social Policy, University of Nottingham"}, "23050302300": {"Name": "Iliffe S.", "AuthorID": "23050302300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Primary Care and Population Health, University College London"}, "21647459300": {"Name": "Victor C.", "AuthorID": "21647459300", "AffiliationID": "60020623", "AffiliationName": "Department of Community Health Nursing and Health Studies, Brunel University"}, "7403519729": {"Name": "Martin F.C.", "AuthorID": "7403519729", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Division of Health and Social Care Research, Kings College London"}}}
