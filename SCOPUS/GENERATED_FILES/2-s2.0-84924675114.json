However, the role of adipocytes in linking energy metabolic disorders with insulin regulation is unknown in humans. Human adipocytes constitutively synthesize and secrete insulin, which is biologically functional. Insulin concentrations and release are fat mass-and LDs-dependent respectively. Fat reduction mediated by bariatric surgery repairs obesity-associated T2D the expression of genes, like PCSK1 (proinsulin conversion enzyme), GCG (Glucagon), GPLD1, CD38 and NNAT, involved in insulin regulation/release were differentially expressed in pancreas and adipose tissue (AT). INS (insulin) and GCG expression reduced in human AT-T2D as compared to AT-control, but remained unchanged in pancreas in either state. Insulin levels (mRNA/protein) were higher in AT derived from prediabetes BB rats with destructed pancreatic 2-cells and controls than pancreas derived from the same rats respectively. Insulin expression in 10 human primary cell types including adipocytes and macrophages is an evidence for extrapancreatic insulin-producing cells the data suggest a crosstalk between AT and pancreas to fine-tune energy metabolic system or may minimize the metabolic damage during diabetes. This study opens new avenues towards T2D therapy with a great impact on public health.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adipocytes", "Animals", "Biomarkers", "Cell Differentiation", "Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2", "Gene Expression Profiling", "Humans", "Insulin", "Lipid Droplets", "Protein Transport", "Rats", "RNA, Messenger"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84924675114", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"6504036038": {"Name": "Sanjabi B.", "AuthorID": "6504036038", "AffiliationID": "60006027", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genetics, University Medical Center Groningen"}, "55486037300": {"Name": "Dashty M.", "AuthorID": "55486037300", "AffiliationID": "60032114, 60022265", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Erasmus Medical Center, University of Rotterdam"}, "14069150600": {"Name": "Rezaee F.", "AuthorID": "14069150600", "AffiliationID": "60006027, 60010023", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell Biology, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen"}, "55445202100": {"Name": "\u00d6zcan B.", "AuthorID": "55445202100", "AffiliationID": "60006027, 60010023", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell Biology, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen"}, "55486371400": {"Name": "Akbarkhanzadeh V.", "AuthorID": "55486371400", "AffiliationID": "60032114", "AffiliationName": "Department of Endocrinology, Erasmus Medical Center"}, "56481196900": {"Name": "Rahimi M.", "AuthorID": "56481196900", "AffiliationID": "60002483", "AffiliationName": "Institute Center-45, Medical University of Amsterdam, University of Amsterdam"}, "6603555514": {"Name": "Vinciguerra M.", "AuthorID": "6603555514", "AffiliationID": "60006027, 60010023", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Medical Science, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen"}, "57200926185": {"Name": "Van Rooij F.", "AuthorID": "57200926185", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Liver and Digestive Health, Division of Medicine, University College London (UCL)"}, "35848125100": {"Name": "Al-Lahham S.", "AuthorID": "35848125100", "AffiliationID": "60070410", "AffiliationName": "Gastroenterology Unit, IRCCS Casa Sollievo della Sofferenza"}, "55807731900": {"Name": "Sheedfar F.", "AuthorID": "55807731900", "AffiliationID": "60032114", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiovascular Genetics, Metabolism Erasmus Medical Center"}, "6701683724": {"Name": "Van Kooten T.G.", "AuthorID": "6701683724", "AffiliationID": "60006027, 60010023", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Biology, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen"}, "9333880600": {"Name": "Spek C.A.", "AuthorID": "9333880600", "AffiliationID": "60002573", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physiology, Radboud University Medical Center"}, "6602387008": {"Name": "Rowshani A.T.", "AuthorID": "6602387008", "AffiliationID": "60006027, 60010023", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen"}, "7004598338": {"Name": "Van Der Want J.", "AuthorID": "7004598338", "AffiliationID": "60002483, 60001157", "AffiliationName": "Department for Experimental and Molecular Medicine, AcademicMedical Center, University of Amsterdam"}, "57212785352": {"Name": "Klaassen R.", "AuthorID": "57212785352", "AffiliationID": "60032114", "AffiliationName": "Department of Internal Medicine, Sectionnephrology and Transplantation, Erasmus Medical Center"}, "57202447715": {"Name": "Sijbrands E.", "AuthorID": "57202447715", "AffiliationID": "60013141", "AffiliationName": "Department of Laboratory Medicine, Children's and Women's Health, Norwegian University of Science and Technology"}, "7005062812": {"Name": "Peppelenbosch M.P.", "AuthorID": "7005062812", "AffiliationID": "60032114", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery, Bariatric Surgery, Maas City Hospital"}}}
