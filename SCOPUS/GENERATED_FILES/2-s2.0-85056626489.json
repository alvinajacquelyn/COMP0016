In tumour necrosis factor (TNF) signalling, linear (also known as M1) ubiquitin enables full gene activation and prevents cell death. However, the mechanisms underlying cell death prevention remain ill-defined. Here, we show that LUBAC activity enables TBK1 and IKK\u03b5 recruitment to and activation at the TNF receptor 1 signalling complex (TNFR1-SC). While exerting only limited effects on TNF-induced gene activation, TBK1 and IKK\u03b5 are essential to prevent TNF-induced cell death. Mechanistically, TBK1 and IKK\u03b5 phosphorylate the kinase RIPK1 in the TNFR1-SC, thereby preventing RIPK1-dependent cell death. This activity is essential in vivo, as it prevents TNF-induced lethal shock. Strikingly, NEMO (also known as IKK\u03b3), which mostly, but not exclusively, binds the TNFR1-SC via M1 ubiquitin, mediates the recruitment of the adaptors TANK and NAP1 (also known as AZI2). TANK is constitutively associated with both TBK1 and IKK\u03b5, while NAP1 is associated with TBK1. We discovered a previously unrecognized cell death checkpoint that is mediated by TBK1 and IKK\u03b5, and uncovered an essential survival function for NEMO, whereby it enables the recruitment and activation of these non-canonical IKKs to prevent TNF-induced cell death.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["A549 Cells", "Animals", "Cell Death", "Cells, Cultured", "HeLa Cells", "Humans", "I-kappa B Kinase", "Mice, Knockout", "Phosphorylation", "Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases", "Receptor-Interacting Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases", "Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Type I", "Signal Transduction", "Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha", "Ubiquitination"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85056626489", "SubjectAreas": [["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"26635426100": {"Name": "Lafont E.", "AuthorID": "26635426100", "AffiliationID": "60109234, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cell Death, Cancer and Inflammation (CCCI), UCL Cancer Institute, University College London"}, "57219004837": {"Name": "Draber P.", "AuthorID": "57219004837", "AffiliationID": "60010612", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Adaptive Immunity, Institute of Molecular Genetics of the Czech Academy of Sciences"}, "6603206215": {"Name": "Rieser E.", "AuthorID": "6603206215", "AffiliationID": "60109234, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cell Death, Cancer and Inflammation (CCCI), UCL Cancer Institute, University College London"}, "57189469930": {"Name": "Reichert M.", "AuthorID": "57189469930", "AffiliationID": "60109234, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cell Death, Cancer and Inflammation (CCCI), UCL Cancer Institute, University College London"}, "57189463511": {"Name": "Kupka S.", "AuthorID": "57189463511", "AffiliationID": "60109234, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cell Death, Cancer and Inflammation (CCCI), UCL Cancer Institute, University College London"}, "55613621200": {"Name": "de Miguel D.", "AuthorID": "55613621200", "AffiliationID": "60109234, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cell Death, Cancer and Inflammation (CCCI), UCL Cancer Institute, University College London"}, "56386128400": {"Name": "Draberova H.", "AuthorID": "56386128400", "AffiliationID": "60010612", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Adaptive Immunity, Institute of Molecular Genetics of the Czech Academy of Sciences"}, "7003995251": {"Name": "Walczak H.", "AuthorID": "7003995251", "AffiliationID": "60109234, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cell Death, Cancer and Inflammation (CCCI), UCL Cancer Institute, University College London"}, "57204663408": {"Name": "Chalk A.", "AuthorID": "57204663408", "AffiliationID": "60010612", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Adaptive Immunity, Institute of Molecular Genetics of the Czech Academy of Sciences"}, "24339487500": {"Name": "Surinova S.", "AuthorID": "24339487500", "AffiliationID": "60109234, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Proteomics Research Core Facility, UCL Cancer Institute, University College London"}, "57202761763": {"Name": "von M\u00e4ssenhausen A.", "AuthorID": "57202761763", "AffiliationID": "60025676, 60018353", "AffiliationName": "Division of Nephrology, Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital Carl Gustav Carus at the Technical University Dresden"}, "8785209000": {"Name": "Linkermann A.", "AuthorID": "8785209000", "AffiliationID": "60025676, 60018353", "AffiliationName": "Division of Nephrology, Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital Carl Gustav Carus at the Technical University Dresden"}, "57189508819": {"Name": "Bhamra A.", "AuthorID": "57189508819", "AffiliationID": "60109234, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Proteomics Research Core Facility, UCL Cancer Institute, University College London"}, "42263246800": {"Name": "Wojdyla K.", "AuthorID": "42263246800", "AffiliationID": "60109234, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Proteomics Research Core Facility, UCL Cancer Institute, University College London"}, "35548946900": {"Name": "Henderson S.", "AuthorID": "35548946900", "AffiliationID": "60109234, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Bill Lyons Informatics Centre (BLIC), UCL Cancer Institute, University College London"}}}
