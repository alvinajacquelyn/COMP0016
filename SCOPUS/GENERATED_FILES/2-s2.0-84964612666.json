Drawing on discursive data collected in the framework of a research project investigating the international promotion of Switzerland, I particularly focus on how multilingualism and cultural diversity are constructed by the Swiss government as a capital belonging to Switzerland and its history and on how and why this imagined historical capital is reframed in promotional terms. In doing so, I question the function of the historicity of Swiss multilingualism and cultural diversity in nation branding practices and analyze the logics causing specific tokens of multilingualism and cultural diversity to emerge as desirable promotional features. Finally, I research how the promotional investment in country's multilingualism and cultural diversity affects the status and value of its historical capital and how this has consequences for what can be said (or not) about Switzerland and its history.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Commodification", "Historical capital", "Ideology", "Late capitalism", "Multilingualism", "Nation branding", "Nation-state", "Switzerland"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84964612666", "SubjectAreas": [["Language and Linguistics", "ARTS", "1203"], ["Linguistics and Language", "SOCI", "3310"]], "AuthorData": {"56445500200": {"Name": "Del Percio A.", "AuthorID": "56445500200", "AffiliationID": "60010348", "AffiliationName": "University of Oslo, Center for Multilingualism in Society Across the Lifespan - MultiLing (CoE), Department of Linguistics and Scandinavian Studies"}}}
