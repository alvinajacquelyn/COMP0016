Such approaches suffer from inherent discretization errors, as well as high computational complexity as the dictionary size grows. To alleviate these issues, we propose a HYbrid Deep magnetic ResonAnce fingerprinting (HYDRA) approach, referred to as HYDRA. Methods: HYDRA involves two stages: a model-based signature restoration phase and a learning-based parameter restoration phase. Signal restoration is implemented using low-rank based de-aliasing techniques while parameter restoration is performed using a deep nonlocal residual convolutional neural network. The designed network is trained on synthesized MRF data simulated with the Bloch equations and fast imaging with steady-state precession (FISP) sequences. In test mode, it takes a temporal MRF signal as input and produces the corresponding tissue parameters. Results: We validated our approach on both synthetic data and anatomical data generated from a healthy subject. The results demonstrate that, in contrast to conventional dictionary matching-based MRF techniques, our approach significantly improves inference speed by eliminating the time-consuming dictionary matching operation, and alleviates discretization errors by outputting continuous-valued parameters. We further avoid the need to store a large dictionary, thus reducing memory requirements. Conclusions: Our approach demonstrates advantages in terms of inference speed, accuracy, and storage requirements over competing MRF methods.", "AuthorKeywords": ["deep learning", "magnetic resonance fingerprinting", "nonlocal residual convolutional neural network", "quantitative magnetic resonance imaging", "self-attention"], "IndexKeywords": ["Dictionary matching", "Discretization errors", "Memory requirements", "Non-local residuals", "Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging", "self-attention", "Signal restoration", "Storage requirements", "Deep Learning", "Image Processing, Computer-Assisted", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85070862212", "SubjectAreas": [["Biophysics", "BIOC", "1304"], ["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"57191198668": {"Name": "Song P.", "AuthorID": "57191198668", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, Imperial College"}, "35562426100": {"Name": "Eldar Y.C.", "AuthorID": "35562426100", "AffiliationID": "60017563", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, Weizmann Institute of Science"}, "57192917192": {"Name": "Mazor G.", "AuthorID": "57192917192", "AffiliationID": "60022403", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical Engineering, Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology"}, "57210526627": {"Name": "Rodrigues M.R.D.", "AuthorID": "57210526627", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}}}
