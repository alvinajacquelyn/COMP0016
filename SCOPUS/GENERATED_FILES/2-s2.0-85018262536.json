We examined associations between positive and negative support from the nominated close person across 15 years of follow-up with sleep quality in older age. Methods MRC National Survey of Health and Development study members reported sleep quality at age 68 (n = 2446). Cumulative exposure to and changes in positive and negative support were derived from data at age 53, 60\u201364 and 68 years. Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index scores were regressed on social support measures adjusted for i) gender only then additionally ii) education, marital status, number in household, limiting illness, body mass index, caregiving, iii) and affective symptoms. Results Greater exposure to positive support and lower exposure to negative support over 15 years were independently associated with better sleep quality at age 68. Sleep quality was poorer for those who experienced declining positive support or increasing negative support. Those who nominated their spouse/partner as their closest person at age 53 but not at age 68 had poorer sleep quality than those who nominated their spouse on both occasions. These associations were not explained by the covariates, including affective symptoms. Conclusions Based on repeat data on support from the closest person, this study finds a link between declining social relationship quality and poor sleep quality. Whilst acknowledging that the association may be bi-directional, the study suggests that interventions to improve older people's social relationships may have benefits for sleep.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Ageing", "Longitudinal", "Marital status", "Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index", "Social support"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Cohort Studies", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Parturition", "Quality of Life", "Sleep", "Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders", "Sleep Wake Disorders", "Social Support", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85018262536", "SubjectAreas": [["Clinical Psychology", "PSYC", "3203"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"7005374676": {"Name": "Stafford M.", "AuthorID": "7005374676", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Unit for Lifelong Health and Ageing at UCL"}, "55074751900": {"Name": "Bendayan R.", "AuthorID": "55074751900", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Unit for Lifelong Health and Ageing at UCL"}, "8329745200": {"Name": "Kuh D.", "AuthorID": "8329745200", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Unit for Lifelong Health and Ageing at UCL"}, "57190403499": {"Name": "Tymoszuk U.", "AuthorID": "57190403499", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, UCL"}}}
