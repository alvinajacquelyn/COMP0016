Histopathological examination identified marked hepatitis and coelomitis associated with pigmented fungal hyphae, which are results consistent with a diagnosis of phaeohyphomycosis. Sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer region and the D1-D2 region of the large subunit of the ribosomal RNA gene from affected liver tissue identified the presence of Exophiala (Chaetothyriales) sp., a black yeast previously identified as a cause of amphibian phaeohyphomycosis. To our knowledge, this is the first published report of Exophiala sp. in a wild or captive amphibian in Europe and the first description of phaeohyphomycosis affecting a free-living amphibian in Great Britain. Exophiala spp. are saprobes and opportunistic pathogens. It has been postulated that phaeohyphomycosis is a disease of immunocompromised amphibians; however, we found no evidence of significant concurrent infection or generalised debility in this common toad. Phaeohyphomycosis appears to be a sporadic cause of mortality in amphibians, and this report adds to the growing list of pathogens known to affect wild amphibians in Europe.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Amphibian population declines", "Black yeast", "Mycosis", "Wildlife disease surveillance"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Bufo bufo", "Europe", "Exophiala", "Female", "Phaeohyphomycosis", "Scotland", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85064709124", "SubjectAreas": [["Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics", "AGRI", "1105"], ["Aquatic Science", "AGRI", "1104"]], "AuthorData": {"55341849700": {"Name": "Seilern-Moy K.", "AuthorID": "55341849700", "AffiliationID": "60005453, 60009498", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Zoology, Zoological Society of London"}, "7103228035": {"Name": "Macgregor S.K.", "AuthorID": "7103228035", "AffiliationID": "60005453, 60009498", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Zoology, Zoological Society of London"}, "57213854763": {"Name": "John S.K.", "AuthorID": "57213854763", "AffiliationID": "60005453, 60009498", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Zoology, Zoological Society of London"}, "57203051586": {"Name": "Cunningham A.A.", "AuthorID": "57203051586", "AffiliationID": "60005453, 60009498", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Zoology, Zoological Society of London"}, "8944571900": {"Name": "Lawson B.", "AuthorID": "8944571900", "AffiliationID": "60005453, 60009498", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Zoology, Zoological Society of London"}, "57194213054": {"Name": "Fernandez J.R.R.", "AuthorID": "57194213054", "AffiliationID": "60103100", "AffiliationName": "IDEXX Laboratories Limited"}, "7006302432": {"Name": "Linton C.", "AuthorID": "7006302432", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "Public Health England"}}}
