Design: A focus group was established by parents of hearing-impaired children. A facilitator explored how audiology tests influenced their understanding and management of hearing loss in their child and their acceptance of hearing aids or cochlear implant referral. The views were transcribed and thematic analysis was used to understand key topics. Study samples: Eight sets of parents participated. Their children had been enrolled in an audiology pathway that included CAEP testing. The sample included six children who were aided, one child who was going through the implant assessment and one child who was implanted. Results: Parents reported that it was important for them to understand the test results because this influenced acceptance of hearing aids and cochlear implant assessments. Seven sets of parents had not understood ABR results, while six reported that CAEPs had helped them to understand their child\u2019s hearing and need for intervention. Conclusion: Compliance with early hearing aid use and referral for cochlear implant depends upon parents\u2019 understanding of their infant\u2019s hearing loss by including CAEPs in the audiology pathway.", "AuthorKeywords": ["amplification", "Cortical auditory-evoked potential (CAEP)", "hearing aids", "infants", "parent support worker"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Child", "Evoked Potentials, Auditory", "Female", "Focus Groups", "Hearing Aids", "Hearing Loss", "Hearing Tests", "Humans", "Male", "Parents", "Patient Acceptance of Health Care", "Phonetics", "Qualitative Research", "Speech Perception"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85064525981", "SubjectAreas": [["Language and Linguistics", "ARTS", "1203"], ["Linguistics and Language", "SOCI", "3310"], ["Speech and Hearing", "HEAL", "3616"]], "AuthorData": {"57212694408": {"Name": "Mehta K.", "AuthorID": "57212694408", "AffiliationID": "60020849", "AffiliationName": "Department of Audiology, Whipps Cross University Hospital"}, "6701673135": {"Name": "Watkin P.", "AuthorID": "6701673135", "AffiliationID": "60020849", "AffiliationName": "Department of Audiology, Whipps Cross University Hospital"}, "8726278400": {"Name": "Mahon M.", "AuthorID": "8726278400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Psychology and Language Sciences, University College London"}, "7006164240": {"Name": "Vickers D.", "AuthorID": "7006164240", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "University of Cambridge, Clinical Neurosciences, Robinson Way"}, "6603562749": {"Name": "Marriage J.", "AuthorID": "6603562749", "AffiliationID": "101851384", "AffiliationName": "Chears Ltd."}}}
