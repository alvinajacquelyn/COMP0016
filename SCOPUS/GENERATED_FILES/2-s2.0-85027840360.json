The systems have been modelled using molecular dynamics simulation which allows for the flexibility of, and movement of charge within, the molecular anions. The model reproduces the experimentally-determined scattering functions in both the low- and high-Q regimes reflecting the inter- and intra-molecular length-scales. For ammonium nitrate the best fit to the diffraction data is obtained by assuming the NH4+ cation to have a radius closer to that for Cs+ rather than a smaller cation such as Rb+ as often previously assumed. The alkali nitrites show an emergent length scale, attributed to the nitrogen-nitrogen spatial correlations, that depends on both temperature and the identity of the alkali cation. The corresponding nitrates show a more subtle effect in the nitrogen-nitrogen correlations. As a result, the nature of this N-N length-scale appears different for the respective nitrites and nitrates.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85027840360", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"]], "AuthorData": {"57205868517": {"Name": "Wilding M.C.", "AuthorID": "57205868517", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "35556605200": {"Name": "Wilson M.", "AuthorID": "35556605200", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry Laboratory, University of Oxford"}, "35561173900": {"Name": "Ribeiro M.C.C.", "AuthorID": "35561173900", "AffiliationID": "60008088", "AffiliationName": "Laborat\u00f3rio de Espectroscopia Molecular, Instituto de Qu\u00edmica, Universidade de S\u00e4o Paulo"}, "7003748350": {"Name": "Benmore C.J.", "AuthorID": "7003748350", "AffiliationID": "60028609", "AffiliationName": "X-ray Science Division, Argonne National Laboratory"}, "35579941200": {"Name": "Weber J.K.R.", "AuthorID": "35579941200", "AffiliationID": "60115290", "AffiliationName": "Materials Development Inc"}, "55340796000": {"Name": "Alderman O.L.G.", "AuthorID": "55340796000", "AffiliationID": "60115290", "AffiliationName": "Materials Development Inc"}, "55960880400": {"Name": "Tamalonis A.", "AuthorID": "55960880400", "AffiliationID": "60115290", "AffiliationName": "Materials Development Inc"}, "7103376969": {"Name": "Parise J.B.", "AuthorID": "7103376969", "AffiliationID": "60026415", "AffiliationName": "SUNY"}}}
