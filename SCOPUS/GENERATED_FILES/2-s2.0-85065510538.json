All rights reserved.Purpose of reviewThere is a clear unmet need for either the development of new drugs for the treatment of painful pathologies or the better use of the existing agents denoted by the lack of efficacy of many existing drugs in a number of patients, limitations of their use due to severity of side effects, and by the high number of drugs that fail to reach clinical efficacy from preclinical development. This account considers the efforts being made to better validate new analgesic components and to improve translational efficacy of existing drugs.Recent findingsA better use of the available models and tools can improve the predictive validity of new analgesic drugs, as well as using intermediate steps when translating drugs to clinical context such as characterizing drugs using stem cell-sensory derived neurones. Profiling patient sensory phenotypes can decrease the number of failed clinical trials and improve patient outcome.SummaryAn integrative approach, comprising the use of complementary techniques to fully characterize drug profiles, is necessary to improve translational success of new analgesics.", "AuthorKeywords": ["clinical trials", "drug development", "preclinical studies"], "IndexKeywords": ["Analgesics", "Animals", "Clinical Trials as Topic", "Disease Models, Animal", "Drug Development", "Drug Evaluation, Preclinical", "Humans", "Pain", "Perceptual Disorders"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85065510538", "SubjectAreas": [["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Oncology (nursing)", "NURS", "2917"], ["Critical Care and Intensive Care Medicine", "MEDI", "2706"]], "AuthorData": {"55865963800": {"Name": "David-Pereira A.", "AuthorID": "55865963800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Biosciences Division, Department of Neuroscience, Pharmacology and Physiology, University College London"}, "7101706308": {"Name": "Dickenson A.H.", "AuthorID": "7101706308", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Biosciences Division, Department of Neuroscience, Pharmacology and Physiology, University College London"}}}
