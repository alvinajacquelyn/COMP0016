Objective: This study assessed the feasibility and safety of performing image-guided internal drainage of pancreatic pseudocysts with a flanged self-expanding covered nitinol pancreatic pseudocyst drainage stent. Materials and methods: We conducted a retrospective case note review of children undergoing image-guided cystogastrostomy at two paediatric hospitals. Percutaneous access to the stomach was achieved via an existing gastrostomy tract or image-guided formation of a new tract. Under combined ultrasound, fluoroscopic or cone-beam CT guidance the pancreatic pseudocysts were punctured through the posterior wall of the stomach. A self-expanding covered nitinol stent was deployed to create a cystogastrostomy opening. Results: Image-guided cystogastrostomy was performed in 6 children (4 male; median age 6 years, range 46 months to 15 years; median weight 18 kg, range 13.8\u201347 kg). Two children had prior failed attempts at surgical or endoscopic drainage. Median maximum cyst diameter was 11.5 cm (range 4.7\u201315.5 cm) pre-procedure. Technical success was 100%. There were no complications. There was complete pseudocyst resolution in five children and a small (2.1-cm) residual pseudocyst in one. Pseudocyst-related symptoms resolved in all children. Conclusion: Pancreatic pseudocyst drainage can be successfully performed in children by image-guided placement of a cystogastrostomy stent. In this cohort of six children there were no complications.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Adolescents", "Children", "Cystogastric stent", "Interventional radiology", "Pancreas", "Pseudocyst"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Alloys", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Cohort Studies", "Contrast Media", "Drainage", "Endosonography", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Gastrostomy", "Hospitals, Pediatric", "Humans", "Male", "Minimally Invasive Surgical Procedures", "Pancreas", "Pancreatic Pseudocyst", "Retrospective Studies", "Risk Assessment", "Self Expandable Metallic Stents", "Surgery, Computer-Assisted", "Tomography, X-Ray Computed", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85069646162", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"56957582400": {"Name": "Patel P.A.", "AuthorID": "56957582400", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60020649", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome/EPSRC Centre for Interventional & Surgical Sciences, University College London"}, "57188959013": {"Name": "Minhas K.S.", "AuthorID": "57188959013", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Interventional Radiology, Radiology Department, Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "26635884100": {"Name": "Stuart S.", "AuthorID": "26635884100", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Interventional Radiology, Radiology Department, Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "7006174234": {"Name": "Roebuck D.J.", "AuthorID": "7006174234", "AffiliationID": "60031806, 60189720", "AffiliationName": "Discipline of Paediatrics, Medical School, University of Western Australia"}, "57203257829": {"Name": "De Coppi P.", "AuthorID": "57203257829", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148, 60018207", "AffiliationName": "Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine Section, UCL Institute of Child Health and Great Ormond Street Hospital, University College London"}, "34167780400": {"Name": "Gibson C.", "AuthorID": "34167780400", "AffiliationID": "60136288", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Imaging, Perth Children\u2019s Hospital"}}}
