Machine-to-machine and human-to-machine interactions progressively delineate the space for innovation: who is involved, how they interact with each other, how the interactions are structured and what behaviours or actions emerge. The article asks: under which conditions does technology enhance or hinder collaboration? Through two exploratory case studies of transversal coordination and collaboration, this study shows that digital technology is not neutral, but it may act as a syntax of how public services evolve over time.", "AuthorKeywords": ["collaborative innovation", "Digital government", "Estonia", "human-machine interaction", "network governance"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85070805106", "SubjectAreas": [["Management Information Systems", "BUSI", "1404"], ["Management of Technology and Innovation", "BUSI", "1405"]], "AuthorData": {"24166963100": {"Name": "Kattel R.", "AuthorID": "24166963100", "AffiliationID": "60068861", "AffiliationName": "Ragnar Nurkse Department of Innovation and Governance, Tallinn University of Technology"}, "6507246912": {"Name": "Lember V.", "AuthorID": "6507246912", "AffiliationID": "60025063", "AffiliationName": "Public Governance Institute, KU Leuven"}, "55359607700": {"Name": "T\u00f5nurist P.", "AuthorID": "55359607700", "AffiliationID": "60009357", "AffiliationName": "OECD"}}}
