The authors assessed the knowledge and perceptions of HIV-infected patients in an ARV education program in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. Of 185 patients, 64 (35%) receiving ARV medications, nearly 80% correctly answered questions regarding HIV. Correct responses were associated with higher education (P <.05) and longer duration of HIV diagnosis (P <.05). A lack of knowledge was observed in 40% of respondents who believed HIV and AIDS were the same and 70% of respondents who believed ARV medications cured HIV. Greater embarrassment of living with HIV was associated with female gender (P <.05) and lower education (P <.05). Patients were concerned over ARV medication use (27%) and its side effects (38%). The study population's knowledge of HIV/AIDS and ARV medications, perceived stigmatization, and areas of knowledge deficits underscore the need for effective patient education programs addressing poorly understood issues around HIV/AIDS.", "AuthorKeywords": ["antiretroviral medication", "HIV/AIDS", "patient education", "prevention", "transmission", "Vietnam"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Female", "Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice", "HIV Infections", "Humans", "Knowledge", "Male", "Stereotyping", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "Vietnam", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84926332150", "SubjectAreas": [["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"37035799900": {"Name": "Hoang D.", "AuthorID": "37035799900", "AffiliationID": "60017994", "AffiliationName": "Yale University School of Medicine"}, "54949854600": {"Name": "Dinh A.", "AuthorID": "54949854600", "AffiliationID": "60017994", "AffiliationName": "Yale University School of Medicine"}, "55315359400": {"Name": "Sullivan L.", "AuthorID": "55315359400", "AffiliationID": "60017994", "AffiliationName": "Yale University School of Medicine"}, "57204340273": {"Name": "Groce N.", "AuthorID": "57204340273", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
