All Rights Reserved.Arsenate respiration by bacteria was discovered over two decades ago and is catalyzed by diverse organisms using the well-conserved Arr enzyme complex. Until now, the mechanisms underpinning this metabolism have been relatively opaque. Here, we report the structure of an Arr complex (solved by X-ray crystallography to 1.6-\u00c5 resolution), which was enabled by an improved Arr expression method in the genetically tractable arsenate respirer Shewanella sp. ANA-3. We also obtained structures bound with the substrate arsenate (1.8 \u00c5), the product arsenite (1.8 \u00c5), and the natural inhibitor phosphate (1.7 \u00c5). The structures reveal a conserved active-site motif that distinguishes Arr [(R/K)GRY] from the closely related arsenite respiratory oxidase (Arx) complex (XGRGWG). Arr activity assays using methyl viologen as the electron donor and arsenate as the electron acceptor display two-site ping-pong kinetics. A Mo(V) species was detected with EPR spectroscopy, which is typical for proteins with a pyranopterin guanine dinucleotide cofactor. Arr is an extraordinarily fast enzyme that approaches the diffusion limit (Km = 44.6 \u00b1 1.6 \u03bcM, kcat = 9,810 \u00b1 220 seconds\u22121), and phosphate is a competitive inhibitor of arsenate reduction (Ki = 325 \u00b1 12 \u03bcM). These observations, combined with knowledge of typical sedimentary arsenate and phosphate concentrations and known rates of arsenate desorption from minerals in the presence of phosphate, suggest that (i) arsenate desorption limits microbiologically induced arsenate reductive mobilization and (ii) phosphate enhances arsenic mobility by stimulating arsenate desorption rather than by inhibiting it at the enzymatic level.", "AuthorKeywords": ["ArrAB", "Bacterial arsenate respiration", "Biogeochemistry", "Enzymology", "Structure"], "IndexKeywords": ["Amino Acid Sequence", "Arsenate Reductases", "Arsenates", "Arsenic", "Arsenites", "Bacterial Proteins", "Crystallography, X-Ray", "Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial", "Kinetics", "Models, Molecular", "Oxidoreductases", "Protein Binding", "Protein Domains", "Sequence Homology, Amino Acid", "Shewanella"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85052984565", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"56343972900": {"Name": "Glasser N.R.", "AuthorID": "56343972900", "AffiliationID": "60031581", "AffiliationName": "Division of Biology and Biological Engineering, California Institute of Technology"}, "7402964625": {"Name": "Newman D.K.", "AuthorID": "7402964625", "AffiliationID": "60086312, 60031581", "AffiliationName": "Division of Geological and Planetary Sciences, California Institute of Technology"}, "55272218400": {"Name": "Oyala P.H.", "AuthorID": "55272218400", "AffiliationID": "60031581", "AffiliationName": "Division of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, California Institute of Technology"}, "36348658000": {"Name": "Osborne T.H.", "AuthorID": "36348658000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, Division of Biosciences, University College London"}, "57218181351": {"Name": "Santini J.M.", "AuthorID": "57218181351", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, Division of Biosciences, University College London"}}}
