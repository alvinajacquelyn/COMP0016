In this paper we present an analysis of the mandibular fossil record from four important Pleistocene European sites, Gran Dolina-TD6-2 (Sierra de Atapuerca), Mauer, Arago, and Atapuerca-Sima de los Huesos. We focus this study in the recognition of key derived mandibular features that may be useful to assess the relationship among the populations represented at these sites. In order to make an approach to the ecological scenario, we also present a short review and discussion of the archaeological and paleoenvironmental evidences at that time. Our results suggest that probably there was a demographic discontinuity between the late Early Pleistocene populations (MIS 21-MIS 19), and those dated to the MIS 15. Hybridization between residents and new settlers cannot be discarded. However, some features of the Gran Dolina-TD6 hominins point to some relationship between the population represented in this site (probably dated to the MIS 21) and the European Middle Pleistocene and early Late Pleistocene populations. A hypothetical scenario is presented in order to understand this apparent contradiction with the model of discontinuity.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Arago", "Atapuerca", "Continuity", "Discontinuity", "Europe", "Evolutionary scenario", "Human evolution", "Mandibles", "Mauer"], "IndexKeywords": ["Arago", "Atapuerca", "Continuity", "Discontinuity", "Europe", "Evolutionary scenario", "Human evolution", "Mandibles", "Mauer"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84994059901", "SubjectAreas": [["Global and Planetary Change", "ENVI", "2306"], ["Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics", "AGRI", "1105"], ["Archeology (arts and humanities)", "ARTS", "1204"], ["Archeology", "SOCI", "3302"], ["Geology", "EART", "1907"]], "AuthorData": {"7003670066": {"Name": "Berm\u00fadez de Castro J.M.", "AuthorID": "7003670066", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anthropology, University College London"}, "23099008800": {"Name": "Blasco R.", "AuthorID": "23099008800", "AffiliationID": "60113906", "AffiliationName": "Centro Nacional de Investigaci\u00f3n sobre la Evoluci\u00f3n Humana"}, "6505967345": {"Name": "Martin\u00f3n TorresMartin\u00f3n-Torres M.", "AuthorID": "6505967345", "AffiliationID": "60022866", "AffiliationName": "Departamento de la Ciencias Hist\u00f3ricas y Geograf\u00eda, Universidad de Burgos"}, "35747067100": {"Name": "Rosell J.", "AuthorID": "35747067100", "AffiliationID": "60105014", "AffiliationName": "Institut Catal\u00e0 de Paleoecologia Humana i Evoluci\u00f3 Social (IPHES)"}, "7004942023": {"Name": "Carbonell E.", "AuthorID": "7004942023", "AffiliationID": "60016358, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Human Evolution, Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology (IVPP), Chines Academy of Sciences"}, "6506247114": {"Name": "Arsuaga J.L.", "AuthorID": "6506247114", "AffiliationID": "60027282, 60001602", "AffiliationName": "Centro Mixto UCM-ISCIII de Evoluci\u00f3n y Comportamiento Humanos"}}}
