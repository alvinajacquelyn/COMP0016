{"Title": "Loss of Function of the Nuclear Receptor NR2F2, Encoding COUP-TF2, Causes Testis Development and Cardiac Defects in 46,XX Children", "Year": 2018, "Source": "Am. J. Hum.

However, in contrast to testis formation, the gene regulatory pathways governing mammalian ovary development have remained elusive. We performed exome or Sanger sequencing on 79 46,XX SRY-negative individuals with either unexplained virilization or with testicular/ovotesticular disorders/differences of sex development (TDSD/OTDSD). We identified heterozygous frameshift mutations in NR2F2, encoding COUP-TF2, in three children. One carried a c.103_109delGGCGCCC (p.Gly35Argfs\u221775) mutation, while two others carried a c.97_103delCCGCCCG (p.Pro33Alafs\u221777) mutation. In two of three children the mutation was de novo. All three children presented with congenital heart disease (CHD), one child with congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH), and two children with blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES). The three children had androgen production, virilization of external genitalia, and biochemical or histological evidence of testicular tissue. We demonstrate a highly significant association between the NR2F2 loss-of-function mutations and this syndromic form of DSD (p = 2.44 \u00d7 10\u22128). We show that COUP-TF2 is highly abundant in a FOXL2-negative stromal cell population of the fetal human ovary. In contrast to the mouse, these data establish COUP-TF2 as a human \u201cpro-ovary\u201d and \u201canti-testis\u201d sex-determining factor in female gonads. Furthermore, the data presented here provide additional evidence of the emerging importance of nuclear receptors in establishing human ovarian identity and indicate that nuclear receptors may have divergent functions in mouse and human biology.", "AuthorKeywords": ["COUP-TF2", "new syndrome", "NR2F2", "nuclear receptor", "sex determination", "testicular DSD"], "IndexKeywords": ["46, XX Disorders of Sex Development", "Amino Acid Sequence", "Base Sequence", "Child", "COUP Transcription Factor II", "Female", "Forkhead Box Protein L2", "Frameshift Mutation", "Heterozygote", "Humans", "Loss of Function Mutation", "Male", "Ovary", "Phenotype", "Testis"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85042507669", "SubjectAreas": [["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Genetics (clinical)", "MEDI", "2716"]], "AuthorData": {"6602229423": {"Name": "Bashamboo A.", "AuthorID": "6602229423", "AffiliationID": "60001772", "AffiliationName": "Human Developmental Genetics, Institut Pasteur"}, "55489153800": {"Name": "Eozenou C.", "AuthorID": "55489153800", "AffiliationID": "60001772", "AffiliationName": "Human Developmental Genetics, Institut Pasteur"}, "36503445900": {"Name": "Bignon-Topalovic J.", "AuthorID": "36503445900", "AffiliationID": "60001772", "AffiliationName": "Human Developmental Genetics, Institut Pasteur"}, "22933905300": {"Name": "Bertalan R.", "AuthorID": "22933905300", "AffiliationID": "60001772", "AffiliationName": "Human Developmental Genetics, Institut Pasteur"}, "7005172061": {"Name": "McElreavey K.", "AuthorID": "7005172061", "AffiliationID": "60001772", "AffiliationName": "Human Developmental Genetics, Institut Pasteur"}, "35576911700": {"Name": "Jorgensen A.", "AuthorID": "35576911700", "AffiliationID": "60006564", "AffiliationName": "Department of Growth and Reproduction, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen 2100"}, "7003356666": {"Name": "Rajpert-De Meyts E.", "AuthorID": "7003356666", "AffiliationID": "60006564", "AffiliationName": "Department of Growth and Reproduction, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen 2100"}, "7003727694": {"Name": "Siffroi J.P.", "AuthorID": "7003727694", "AffiliationID": "60013700, 60021567", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Genetics, Hospital Trousseau-APHP"}, "36898265000": {"Name": "Hyon C.", "AuthorID": "36898265000", "AffiliationID": "60013700, 60021567", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Genetics, Hospital Trousseau-APHP"}, "6603873627": {"Name": "Tar A.", "AuthorID": "6603873627", "AffiliationID": "60030374", "AffiliationName": "Heim P\u00e1l Children's Hospital"}, "57212536835": {"Name": "Nagy P.", "AuthorID": "57212536835", "AffiliationID": "60024812", "AffiliationName": "First Department of Pathology and Experimental Cancer Research, Semmelweis University"}, "7006527386": {"Name": "S\u00f3lyom J.", "AuthorID": "7006527386", "AffiliationID": "60024812", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatrics, Semmelweis University"}, "6602868566": {"Name": "Hal\u00e1sz Z.", "AuthorID": "6602868566", "AffiliationID": "60024812", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatrics, Semmelweis University"}, "22981146500": {"Name": "Paye-Jaouen A.", "AuthorID": "22981146500", "AffiliationID": "60011675", "AffiliationName": "Pediatric and Visceral Surgery and Urology, Hopital Robert Debre"}, "57200820386": {"Name": "Lambert S.", "AuthorID": "57200820386", "AffiliationID": "60011675", "AffiliationName": "Endocrinologie et Diabetologie Pediatrique, Hopital Robert Debre"}, "23482017600": {"Name": "Martinerie L.", "AuthorID": "23482017600", "AffiliationID": "60011675", "AffiliationName": "Endocrinologie et Diabetologie Pediatrique, Hopital Robert Debre"}, "56527184600": {"Name": "Rodriguez-Buritica D.", "AuthorID": "56527184600", "AffiliationID": "60027512, 60021568", "AffiliationName": "Division of Genetics, Department of Pediatrics, McGovern Medical School, University of Texas"}, "7003478493": {"Name": "Achermann J.C.", "AuthorID": "7003478493", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL GOSH Institute of Child Health"}}}
