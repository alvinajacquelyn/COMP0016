In addition, affects the nature of the timing distribution. It was found that when Photon Travel Spread (PTS) in the crystal is the only factor affecting the timing uncertainty, in which case, a Laplace kernel might describe the measured data, more accurately. It was shown that for crystals as thin as 20 mm the RMSE of the Laplace was smaller than that of a Normal. While when PTS is combined with an addition coincidence detection resolution (CDR) then, a Normal achieves better RMSE, but with dependency on the crystal size. Results in terms of CRC, of a simulated NEMA phantom, confirmed that reconstruction using a Laplace kernel can model the data better for thicker crystals.", "AuthorKeywords": ["GATE", "LYSO", "PET", "Scintillation Crystals", "STIR", "Time-Of-Flight"], "IndexKeywords": ["GATE", "LYSO", "Scintillation crystals", "STIR", "Time of flight"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85062439042", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"], ["Nuclear and High Energy Physics", "PHYS", "3106"]], "AuthorData": {"15821657900": {"Name": "Efthimiou N.", "AuthorID": "15821657900", "AffiliationID": "60030469", "AffiliationName": "PET Research Centre, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Hull"}, "57205073110": {"Name": "Emond E.", "AuthorID": "57205073110", "AffiliationID": "60090043, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Nuclear Medicine, University College London"}, "23480655200": {"Name": "Thielemans K.", "AuthorID": "23480655200", "AffiliationID": "60090043, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Nuclear Medicine, University College London"}, "8983656400": {"Name": "Cawthorne C.", "AuthorID": "8983656400", "AffiliationID": "60030469", "AffiliationName": "School of Life Sciences, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Hull"}, "23480821300": {"Name": "Tsoumpas C.", "AuthorID": "23480821300", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomedical Imaging Science, University of Leeds"}}}
