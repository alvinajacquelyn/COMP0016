Methods: This randomised controlled study evaluated the 'FRIENDS for Life' school-based Cognitive Behavioural Therapy programme on overall anxiety, anxiety subtypes and school adjustment. Sixty-two students aged 12-13 completed measures of anxiety and school adjustment before, immediately after and 4 months after completing the programme. Parents and teachers also rated the students on overall anxiety levels and school adjustment respectively. Results: The intervention group's 'overall anxiety' and specifically 'separation anxiety' reduced significantly during the programme and continued to decrease at the 4-month follow-up. Conclusions: A significant negative correlation was found between anxiety and school adjustment. The professional implications of these findings are discussed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Anxiety", "Cognitive therapy", "School", "School adjustment", "Separation anxiety"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84921515798", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"56489960100": {"Name": "Rodgers A.", "AuthorID": "56489960100", "AffiliationID": "114913010", "AffiliationName": "National Behaviour Support Service, Navan Education Centre"}, "8125960600": {"Name": "Dunsmuir S.", "AuthorID": "8125960600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
