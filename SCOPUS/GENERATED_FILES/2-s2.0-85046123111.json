The omission refers mainly to the history of changes that occurred during the delivery of the T2 programme in 3.1 Case Context. We next provide a detailed account of the changes sentence by sentence: 1. \u201cWhen it opened, the terminal hosted 26 airlines, comprising all 23 Star Alliance airlines, plus Air Lingus, Virgin Atlantic Little Red and Germanwings as non-alliance airlines.\u201d changes to \u201cOriginally designed to host 18 Star Alliance carriers, when it opened, the terminal hosted 26 airlines, comprising all 23 Star Alliance airlines, plus Air Lingus, Virgin Atlantic Little Red and Germanwings as non-alliance airlines.\u201d2. \u201cThe delivery phase of T2 was no exception in that regard as it experienced a disruption when the public announcement was made (Financial Times, 2012) that British Midland International (BMI) - the main anticipated airline occupier for the new Terminal 2 at the time of drawing up the contract and until that point - had been acquired by the International Airlines Group (IAG) with the consequence that all BMI operations were to be integrated with British Airways (BA) shortly thereafter.\u201d changes to \u201cThe delivery phase of T2 was no exception in that regard as it experienced a disruption when the public announcement was made (Financial Times 2012) that British Midland International (BMI)- a key Star Alliance occupier and main domestic carrier for the new Terminal 2 - had been acquired by the International Airlines Group (IAG) with the consequence that all BMI operations were to be integrated with British Airways (BA) shortly thereafter.\u201d3. \u201cGiven that Heathrow Terminal 5 is BA's main hub and base of operations, the main consequence of this merger was that BMI was going to move its operations to a different terminal, leaving T2 without its main occupier.\u201d changes to \u201cAs BMI ceased to exist as a company, its routes were absorbed by BA into its operations at Heathrow T5, creating an operational void at T2, particularly affecting the T2A building, which now had to fill a number of unused landing slots.\u201d4. \u201cAs a consequence of the unexpected acquisition of BMI, HAL developed and then negotiated a solution in which the new T2 was going to accommodate 23 of the Star Alliance (SA) airlines \u2013 a first for any major airport hub. To fully occupy the T2 space, three non-Alliance airlines: Air Lingus, Virgin Atlantic Little Red and Germanwings carriers would also be accommodated. Because these SA airlines were previously spread across other terminals of Heathrow, SA effectively became the lead occupier of the T2 building, with the goal of ultimately serving 22 million passengers per year from a single hub terminal. The business value-add for the SA to occupy the terminal was in the operational and commercial benefits of the hub-and-spoke model of operations. In other words, members of the alliance would enjoy the benefits of being collocated in a single terminal by improving the quality of service and opportunity for cross-selling of products of the SA member airlines.\u201d changes to \u201cAs a consequence of the unexpected acquisition of BMI, HAL developed and then negotiated a solution in which the new T2 was now going to accommodate all 23 of the Star Alliance members \u2013 a significant change from the original 18 carriers. In addition, to fully occupy the available space, three non-Alliance airlines: Air Lingus, Virgin Atlantic Little Red and Germanwings carriers would also be accommodated. In this manner, Star Alliance effectively became the lead occupier of T2, with the goal of ultimately serving 22 million passengers per year from a single hub terminal. The business value-add for the Star Alliance to fully occupy the terminal was in the operational and commercial benefits of the hub-and-spoke model of operations. In other words, members of the alliance would enjoy the benefits of being co-located in a single terminal by improving the quality of service and opportunity for cross-selling of products of the Star Alliance member airlines.\u201d5. \u201cAs opposed to more simplistic technical testing of devices, the trials involved people and were organised in a succession going from trialling the use of specific physical units to entire putting pretend or proxy passengers and their luggage in large areas in a progressively complex effort.\u201d changes to \u201cAs opposed to more simplistic technical testing of devices, the trials involved volunteers and were organised in a succession going from trialling the use of specific physical units to complex trial scenarios using volunteers and their luggage in large areas in a progressively complex effort.\u201d6. \u201cThe second capability-enabling mechanism that emerged as an aggregate dimension from the informant accounts related to how the project responded to an unforeseen event \u2013 the BMI merger \u2013 and the change from having to accommodate the shift from one airline to 26 airline occupiers.\u201d changes to: \u201cThe second capability-enabling mechanism that emerged as an aggregate dimension from the informant accounts related to how the project responded to an unforeseen event \u2013 the BMI merger \u2013 and the change from having to accommodate the shift from the original 18 to the final 26 airline occupiers.\u201d7. \u201cOne of such solutions refers to how the project team dealt with the new requirements for the check-in area, originally designed and built to accommodate predominantly one airline, but now having to accommodate 26 different airlines, many of which with very different check-in procedures.\u201d changes to: \u201cOne of such solutions refers to how the project team dealt with the new requirements for the check-in area, now having to accommodate 26 different airlines, many of which with very different check-in procedures.\u201d8.
