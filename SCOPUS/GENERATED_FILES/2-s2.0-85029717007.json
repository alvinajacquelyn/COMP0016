The present studies were aimed at refinement and validation. Method: Twenty-four experts reviewed the MuRQoL items for face validity. A refined version was completed by 147 adult CI users, and psychometric techniques were used for item selection, assessment of reliability, and definition of the factor structure. The same participants completed the Short Form Health Survey for construct validation. MuRQoL responses from 68 CI users were compared with those of a matched group of adults with normal hearing. Results: Eighteen items measuring music perception and engagement and 18 items measuring their importance were selected; they grouped together into 2 domains. The final questionnaire has high internal consistency and repeatability. Significant differences between CI users and adults with normal hearing and a correlation between music engagement and quality of life support construct validity. Scores of music perception and engagement and importance for the 18 items can be combined to assess the impact of music on the quality of life. Conclusion: The MuRQoL questionnaire is a reliable and valid measure of self-reported music perception, engagement, and their importance for adult CI users with potential to guide music aural rehabilitation.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Cochlear Implantation", "Cochlear Implants", "Correction of Hearing Impairment", "Deafness", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Music", "Music Therapy", "Quality of Life", "Reproducibility of Results", "Surveys and Questionnaires"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85029717007", "SubjectAreas": [["Speech and Hearing", "HEAL", "3616"]], "AuthorData": {"56548957100": {"Name": "Dritsakis G.", "AuthorID": "56548957100", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Sound and Vibration Research, University of Southampton"}, "10143166800": {"Name": "van Besouw R.M.", "AuthorID": "10143166800", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Sound and Vibration Research, University of Southampton"}, "35315883700": {"Name": "Kitterick P.", "AuthorID": "35315883700", "AffiliationID": "60172638", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health Research, Nottingham Hearing Biomedical Research Unit"}, "8901290000": {"Name": "Verschuur C.A.", "AuthorID": "8901290000", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "Auditory Implant Service, University of Southampton"}}}
