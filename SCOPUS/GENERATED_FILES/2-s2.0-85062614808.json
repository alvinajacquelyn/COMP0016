In two experiments, participants learned a route through a virtual environment until they reached a learning criterion. They were then asked to externalize their spatial knowledge in a verbal description task, a landmark recognition task, or a map completion task. Results revealed that participants with ID mainly described the route as a succession of actions (\u2018\u2018turn left\u2019\u2019), and participants in the CA group prescribed actions referring to a landmark (\u2018\u2018turn left at the swing\u2019\u2019). Yet, results from the other tasks showed that people with ID had good landmark knowledge of the environment.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Intellectual disability", "Spatial knowledge", "Verbal description", "Wayfinding"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Female", "Humans", "Intellectual Disability", "Male", "Recognition, Psychology", "Space Perception", "Spatial Navigation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85062614808", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Neuropsychology and Physiological Psychology", "PSYC", "3206"], ["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"], ["Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)", "ARTS", "1201"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"22034531800": {"Name": "Courbois Y.", "AuthorID": "22034531800", "AffiliationID": "60104665", "AffiliationName": "Universit\u00e9 de Lille"}, "36617581400": {"Name": "Mengue-Topio H.", "AuthorID": "36617581400", "AffiliationID": "60104665", "AffiliationName": "Universit\u00e9 de Lille"}, "6602308496": {"Name": "Sockeel P.", "AuthorID": "6602308496", "AffiliationID": "60104665", "AffiliationName": "Universit\u00e9 de Lille"}, "7006826263": {"Name": "Blades M.", "AuthorID": "7006826263", "AffiliationID": "60001881", "AffiliationName": "University of Sheffield"}, "6602319057": {"Name": "Farran E.K.", "AuthorID": "6602319057", "AffiliationID": "60021097", "AffiliationName": "University of Surrey"}}}
