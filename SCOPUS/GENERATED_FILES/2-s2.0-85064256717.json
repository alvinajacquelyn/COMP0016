All rights reserved.Objectives: This study aimed to evaluate physicians\u2019 perceptions of electronic prescribing in Kuwaiti primary healthcare centres. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted between June and August 2017 among 368 physicians from 25 primary healthcare centres in Kuwait. Data were collected from the participants using a selfreported questionnaire, including sociodemographic characteristics, previous experience with computers and awareness, knowledge and use of e-prescribing systems and their functional features. In addition, perceptions of the benefits and levels of satisfaction associated with e-prescribing were explored. Results: A total of 306 physicians completed the survey (response rate: 83%). The majority had positive perceptions regarding the use of e-prescribing, particularly in terms of time-savings (86%), healthcare quality (84%), productivity (80%) and clinical workflow and efficiency (83%). However, many respondents indicated that e-prescribing systems required additional improvements in terms of functionality. Conclusion: Most physicians in primary healthcare centres in Kuwait recognised the importance of e-prescribing to improve the quality of patient care, streamline workflow, increase productivity and reduce medical errors. However, there is a need to improve the design and infrastructure of e-prescribing systems, which may aid in the adoption of such systems in Kuwait.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Computer-Assisted Drug Therapies", "Electronic Medical Records", "Electronic Prescribing", "Kuwait", "Physicians", "Primary Healthcare"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Electronic Prescribing", "Female", "Humans", "Kuwait", "Male", "Medical Errors", "Middle Aged", "Perception", "Physicians", "Practice Patterns, Physicians'", "Quality of Health Care", "Surveys and Questionnaires"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85064256717", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"57208255518": {"Name": "Almutairi B.", "AuthorID": "57208255518", "AffiliationID": "60043484", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Records, College of Health Sciences, Public Authority of Applied Education & Training"}, "28067587200": {"Name": "Al-Azmi S.", "AuthorID": "28067587200", "AffiliationID": "60043484", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Records, College of Health Sciences, Public Authority of Applied Education & Training"}, "12783188400": {"Name": "Potts H.", "AuthorID": "12783188400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Health Informatics, University College London"}}}
