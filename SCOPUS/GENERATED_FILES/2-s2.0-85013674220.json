Karger AG, Basel.Background: Cognitive reserve was postulated to explain individual differences in susceptibility to ageing, offering apparent protection to those with higher education. We investigated the association between education and change in memory in early old age. Methods: Immediate and delayed memory scores from over 10,000 individuals aged 65 years and older, from 10 countries of the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe, were modeled as a function of time in the study over an 8-year period, fitting independent latent growth models. Education was used as a marker of cognitive reserve and evaluated in association with memory performance and rate of change, while accounting for income, general health, smoking, body mass index, gender, and baseline age. Results: In most countries, more educated individuals performed better on both memory tests at baseline, compared to those less educated. However, education was not protective against faster decline, except for in Spain for both immediate and delayed recall (0.007 [SE = 0.003] and 0.006 [SE = 0.002]), and Switzerland for immediate recall (0.006 [SE = 0.003]). Interestingly, highly educated Italian respondents had slightly faster declines in immediate recall (-0.006 [SE = 0.003]). Conclusions: We found weak evidence of a protective effect of education on memory change in most European samples, although there was a positive association with memory performance at individuals' baseline assessment.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cognitive reserve", "Education", "Latent growth curve model", "Memory", "Older adults"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Cognitive Reserve", "Educational Status", "Europe", "Female", "Geriatric Assessment", "Humans", "Male", "Memory"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85013674220", "SubjectAreas": [["Epidemiology", "MEDI", "2713"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"57016564400": {"Name": "Cadar D.", "AuthorID": "57016564400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London (UCL)"}, "24074784500": {"Name": "Robitaille A.", "AuthorID": "24074784500", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Unit for Lifelong Health and Ageing at UCL"}, "48161127800": {"Name": "Clouston S.", "AuthorID": "48161127800", "AffiliationID": "60028897", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Ottawa"}, "7004934589": {"Name": "Hofer S.M.", "AuthorID": "7004934589", "AffiliationID": "60003122", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, University of Victoria"}, "6603598774": {"Name": "Piccinin A.M.", "AuthorID": "6603598774", "AffiliationID": "60026415", "AffiliationName": "Department of Preventative Medicine, Stony Brook University"}, "35206359500": {"Name": "Muniz-Terrera G.", "AuthorID": "35206359500", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Dementia Prevention, University of Edinburgh"}}}
