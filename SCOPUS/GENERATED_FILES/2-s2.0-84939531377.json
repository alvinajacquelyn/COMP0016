The [Cr(NCS)5NH3]2- ion forms a related crystal packing arrangement with BEDT-TTF with a reduction in the number of \"tube\" motifs needed to accept an isothiocyanate ligand.", "AuthorKeywords": ["BEDT-TTF", "Chromium complexes", "Crystal packing", "Electrocrystallisation", "Radical cation salts"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84939531377", "SubjectAreas": [["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"], ["Inorganic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1604"], ["Materials Chemistry", "MATE", "2505"]], "AuthorData": {"36119671000": {"Name": "Brooks A.", "AuthorID": "36119671000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "56724311700": {"Name": "Martin L.", "AuthorID": "56724311700", "AffiliationID": "60006029", "AffiliationName": "School of Science and Technology, Nottingham Trent University"}, "7103223287": {"Name": "Wallis J.", "AuthorID": "7103223287", "AffiliationID": "60006029", "AffiliationName": "School of Science and Technology, Nottingham Trent University"}, "7202148950": {"Name": "Day P.", "AuthorID": "7202148950", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "36039126400": {"Name": "Clegg W.", "AuthorID": "36039126400", "AffiliationID": "60006222", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, Newcastle University"}, "7201653324": {"Name": "Harrington R.", "AuthorID": "7201653324", "AffiliationID": "60006222", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, Newcastle University"}}}
