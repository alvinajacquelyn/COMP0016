This special issue starts from the broad concepts of stories, narratives, and storytelling to go beyond these analytic conventions, approaching the intersection of nature, humanity, and technology in multiple ways, using lenses from social sciences, humanities, and practitioners\u2019 perspectives. The contributors use stories as data objects to gather, analyse, and critique; stories as an approach to research an inquiry; narrative analysis as a way of crystallising arguments and assumptions; and storytelling as a way of understanding, communicating, and influencing others. In using these forms of evidence and communication, and applying methods, analytical stances, and interpretations that these invite, something new and different results. This essay is a brief introduction to how, in our view, stories and their kin fit in energy and climate change research. We outline the diversity of data, approaches, and goals represented in the contributions to the special issue. And we reflect on some of the challenges of, and possibilities for, continuing to develop \u2018stories\u2019 as data sources, as modes of inquiry, and as creative paths toward social engagement.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Climate change", "Energy", "Imaginaries", "Narratives", "Stories", "Storytelling"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85028339899", "SubjectAreas": [["Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment", "ENER", "2105"], ["Nuclear Energy and Engineering", "ENER", "2104"], ["Fuel Technology", "ENER", "2103"], ["Energy Engineering and Power Technology", "ENER", "2102"], ["Social Sciences (miscellaneous)", "SOCI", "3301"]], "AuthorData": {"55885199500": {"Name": "Moezzi M.", "AuthorID": "55885199500", "AffiliationID": "60023908", "AffiliationName": "Portland State University"}, "7103164495": {"Name": "Janda K.", "AuthorID": "7103164495", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "55522448300": {"Name": "Rotmann S.", "AuthorID": "55522448300", "AffiliationID": "119128303", "AffiliationName": "Sustainable Energy Advice Ltd"}}}
