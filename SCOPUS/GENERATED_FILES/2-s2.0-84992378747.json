This retrieval study sought to better understand the performance of coated bearing surfaces. Methods: Forty-three coated MOP components were analysed post-retrieval for evidence of coating loss and gross polyethylene wear. Coating loss was graded using a visual semi-quantitative protocol. Evidence of gross polyethylene wear was determined by radiographic analysis and visual inspection of the retrieved implants. Results: All components with gross polyethylene wear (n = 10) were revised due to a malfunctioning acetabular component; 35 % (n = 15) of implants exhibited visible coating loss and the incidence of polyethylene wear in samples with coating loss was 54 %, significantly (p = 0.02) elevated compared to samples with intact coatings (14 %). Conclusions: In this study we found evidence of coating loss on metal femoral heads which was associated with increased wear of the corresponding polyethylene acetabular cups.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Coating", "Hip", "Metal-on-polyethylene", "Retrieval", "Wear"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Arthroplasty, Replacement, Hip", "Ceramics", "Female", "Femur Head", "Hip Prosthesis", "Humans", "Incidence", "Male", "Microscopy, Electron, Scanning", "Middle Aged", "Polyethylene", "Prosthesis Design", "Prosthesis Failure"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84992378747", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Orthopedics and Sports Medicine", "MEDI", "2732"]], "AuthorData": {"56925340800": {"Name": "Khatkar H.", "AuthorID": "56925340800", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60024067", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Orthopaedics and Musculoskeletal Science, Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital, University College London"}, "6506962865": {"Name": "Hothi H.", "AuthorID": "6506962865", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60024067", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Orthopaedics and Musculoskeletal Science, Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital, University College London"}, "56572440800": {"Name": "de Villiers D.", "AuthorID": "56572440800", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60024067", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Orthopaedics and Musculoskeletal Science, Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital, University College London"}, "8281611700": {"Name": "Skinner J.", "AuthorID": "8281611700", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60024067", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Orthopaedics and Musculoskeletal Science, Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital, University College London"}, "24597673100": {"Name": "Hart A.", "AuthorID": "24597673100", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60024067", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Orthopaedics and Musculoskeletal Science, Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital, University College London"}, "55912986800": {"Name": "Lausmann C.", "AuthorID": "55912986800", "AffiliationID": "60084833", "AffiliationName": "Orthopaedic Department, HELIOS Endo-Klinik"}, "6602241410": {"Name": "Kendoff D.", "AuthorID": "6602241410", "AffiliationID": "60084833", "AffiliationName": "Orthopaedic Department, HELIOS Endo-Klinik"}, "14013843900": {"Name": "Gehrke T.", "AuthorID": "14013843900", "AffiliationID": "60084833", "AffiliationName": "Orthopaedic Department, HELIOS Endo-Klinik"}}}
