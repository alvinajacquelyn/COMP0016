Voronoi tessellation was firstly created to convert the HA structure to a collection of partitions. The selected partitions were further merged together to mimic the random colloid aggregations. The fitted B-Spline curves were then used through the vertices of Voronoi cells to outline the boundaries of the irregular-shaped pores. In order to validate the proposed approach, a finite element analysis was conducted on the porous structure models under nanoindentation test. The proposed approach retained the irregular pore shapes, which are generally observed in natural HA structure, while reflecting the significant effect of this irregularity on simulation results. In comparison to other Computer-Aided Design (CAD) techniques, the proposed method could be employed to create more realistic porosities with irregular geometries for accurate simulation of natural HA structure.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Finite element analysis", "Hydroxyapatite", "Irregular porosity", "Nanoindentation"], "IndexKeywords": ["B spline curve", "Colloid aggregation", "Colloid aggregation models", "Finite element simulations", "Irregular geometries", "Nanoindentation tests", "Porous structures", "Voronoi tessellations"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84960086136", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Ceramics and Composites", "MATE", "2503"], ["Process Chemistry and Technology", "CENG", "1508"], ["Surfaces, Coatings and Films", "MATE", "2508"], ["Materials Chemistry", "MATE", "2505"]], "AuthorData": {"56962815900": {"Name": "Naderi S.", "AuthorID": "56962815900", "AffiliationID": "60029157", "AffiliationName": "Center of Advanced Manufacturing and Material Processing, AMMP Center, University Malaya"}, "56328801600": {"Name": "Razak B.", "AuthorID": "56328801600", "AffiliationID": "60029157", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical, Faculty of Engineering, University of Malaya"}, "56024854400": {"Name": "Dabbagh A.", "AuthorID": "56024854400", "AffiliationID": "60029157", "AffiliationName": "Department of Restorative Dentistry, Faculty of Dentistry, University of Malaya"}, "35808757000": {"Name": "Abdullah H.", "AuthorID": "35808757000", "AffiliationID": "60029157", "AffiliationName": "Department of Restorative Dentistry, Faculty of Dentistry, University of Malaya"}, "29667584200": {"Name": "Abu Kasim N.", "AuthorID": "29667584200", "AffiliationID": "60029157", "AffiliationName": "Department of Restorative Dentistry, Faculty of Dentistry, University of Malaya"}, "55416954900": {"Name": "Hassan M.", "AuthorID": "55416954900", "AffiliationID": "60000617", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Assiut University"}}}
