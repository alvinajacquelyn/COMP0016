Parents often ask how long the ACE will be required. We looked at our patients 5 years after ACE formation to answer the question. Methods: We reviewed clinical notes of all patients undergoing ACE procedure during January 1990 to December 2010. Only patients with >5 years follow-up were included. Data are given as median (range). Results: 133 patients were included with >5 years of follow-up. Primary pathology was anorectal anomaly (ARA) 64 (48 %); spinal dysraphism (SD) 40 (30 %); functional constipation (FC) 14 (10 %); Hirschsprung\u2019s Disease (HD) 10 (8 %) and others 5 (4 %). Median follow-up was 7 years (5\u201317 years). Overall 74 % still use their ACE; whilst 26 % no longer access their stoma, of whom 47 % recovered normal colonic function. 50 % of HD patient recover colonic function. FC has the highest failure rate at 21 %. Conclusions: Overall 86 % achieved excellent clinical outcome with 74 % of patient still using their ACE at 5 years. HD has the highest recovery rate of 50 %. FC has a more unreliable clinical outcome with 21 % recovered colonic function and 21 % failed. Outcome varied dependent on the background diagnosis.", "AuthorKeywords": ["ACE", "Antegrade continence enema", "Constipation", "Outcome"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Anorectal Malformations", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Chronic Disease", "Constipation", "Enema", "Enterostomy", "Fecal Incontinence", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Hirschsprung Disease", "Humans", "Infant", "Male", "Retrospective Studies", "Spinal Dysraphism", "Surgical Stomas", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84955608701", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"]], "AuthorData": {"56514685100": {"Name": "Chong C.", "AuthorID": "56514685100", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Surgery, Great Ormond Street Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "24801882300": {"Name": "De Coppi P.", "AuthorID": "24801882300", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Surgery, Great Ormond Street Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "42560973700": {"Name": "Cross K.", "AuthorID": "42560973700", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Surgery, Great Ormond Street Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57198123285": {"Name": "Curry J.", "AuthorID": "57198123285", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Surgery, Great Ormond Street Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "8932192000": {"Name": "Featherstone N.", "AuthorID": "8932192000", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Urology, Great Ormond Street Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57216881570": {"Name": "Sharif S.", "AuthorID": "57216881570", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Urology, Great Ormond Street Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "31168261100": {"Name": "Cherian A.", "AuthorID": "31168261100", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Urology, Great Ormond Street Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "6701750462": {"Name": "Cuckow P.", "AuthorID": "6701750462", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Urology, Great Ormond Street Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "54906493500": {"Name": "Mushtaq I.", "AuthorID": "54906493500", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Urology, Great Ormond Street Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
