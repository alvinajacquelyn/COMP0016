KGaA, Weinheim.In situ modification of antigen-presenting cells garnered interest in cancer immunotherapy. Therefore, we developed APC-targeted lentiviral vectors (LVs). Unexpectedly, these LVs were inferior vaccines to broad tropism LVs. Since IL-12 is a potent mediator of antitumor immunity, we evaluated whether this proinflammatory cytokine could enhance antitumor immunity of an APC-targeted LV-based vaccine. Therefore, we compared subcutaneous administration of broad tropism LVs (VSV-G-LV) with APC-targeted LVs (DC2.1-LV)-encoding enhanced GFP and ovalbumin, or IL-12 and ovalbumin in mice. We show that codelivery of IL-12 by VSV-G-LVs or DC2.1-LVs augments CD4+ or CD8+ T-cell proliferation, respectively. Furthermore, we demonstrate that codelivery of IL-12 enhances the CD4+ TH1 profile irrespective of its delivery mode, while an increase in cytotoxic and therapeutic CD8+ T cells was only induced upon VSV-G-LV injection. While codelivery of IL-12 by DC2.1-LVs did not enhance CD8+ T-cell performance, it increased expression of inhibitory checkpoint markers Lag3, Tim3, and PD-1. Finally, the discrepancy between CD4+ T-cell stimulation with and without functional CD8+ T-cell stimulation by VSV-G- and DC2.1-LVs is partly explained by the observation that IL-12 relieves CD8+ T cells from CD4+ T-cell help, implying that a TH1 profile is of minor importance for antitumor immunotherapy if IL-12 is exogenously delivered.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Antigen-presenting cell", "Cancer", "IL-12", "Immunotherapy", "Lentiviral vector", "Nanobody", "Targeting"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes", "CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes", "Female", "HEK293 Cells", "Humans", "Interleukin-12", "Lentivirus", "Lymphocyte Activation", "Membrane Glycoproteins", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Transduction, Genetic", "Viral Envelope Proteins"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84952638475", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"]], "AuthorData": {"54890771100": {"Name": "Goyvaerts C.", "AuthorID": "54890771100", "AffiliationID": "60026810", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Molecular and Cellular Therapy, Department of Biomedical Sciences, Vrije Universiteit Brussel"}, "56487807100": {"Name": "Broos K.", "AuthorID": "56487807100", "AffiliationID": "60026810", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Molecular and Cellular Therapy, Department of Biomedical Sciences, Vrije Universiteit Brussel"}, "6603578315": {"Name": "Heirman C.", "AuthorID": "6603578315", "AffiliationID": "60026810", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Molecular and Cellular Therapy, Department of Biomedical Sciences, Vrije Universiteit Brussel"}, "7006235125": {"Name": "Thielemans K.", "AuthorID": "7006235125", "AffiliationID": "60026810", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Molecular and Cellular Therapy, Department of Biomedical Sciences, Vrije Universiteit Brussel"}, "16201827600": {"Name": "Breckpot K.", "AuthorID": "16201827600", "AffiliationID": "60026810", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Molecular and Cellular Therapy, Department of Biomedical Sciences, Vrije Universiteit Brussel"}, "6507259181": {"Name": "Escors D.", "AuthorID": "6507259181", "AffiliationID": "60019454", "AffiliationName": "Navarrabiomed-Fundaci\u00f3n Miguel Servet, Complejo Hospitalario de Navarra"}, "6701644152": {"Name": "Raes G.", "AuthorID": "6701644152", "AffiliationID": "60019793", "AffiliationName": "VIB Laboratory of Myeloid Cell Immunology"}, "7005970441": {"Name": "De Baetselier P.", "AuthorID": "7005970441", "AffiliationID": "60019793", "AffiliationName": "VIB Laboratory of Myeloid Cell Immunology"}}}
