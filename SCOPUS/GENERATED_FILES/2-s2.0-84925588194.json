All rights reserved.Background: To define the burden of hospitalization due to 2 vaccine-preventable infections, invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) and varicella zoster (VZ), among HIV-infected children in the UK and Ireland. Methods: Analysis of hospitalizations of HIV-infected children <18 years receiving pediatric care and reported to the Collaborative HIV Paediatric Study (CHIPS) between 1996 and 2011. Results: Admissions for IPD and VZ combined accounted for \u223c5% of all hospital admissions for HIV-infected children each year. When compared with background rates for healthy children, the admission rate ratio for HIV-infected children on combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) was 16.7, 14.8 and 126.7 for IPD, varicella and herpes zoster, respectively, and 156.7, 86.1 and 470, respectively, for HIV-infected children not on cART. Those admitted with IPD or VZ were more likely to have Centers for Disease Control stage B/C at presentation with HIV than those without such admissions (36.8% for IPD, 29.7% for VZ and 22.1% for no IPD or VZ, P = 0.006), and were more likely to subsequently commence cART (94.7%, 91.3% and 80.2% respectively, P = 0.004). Conclusions: There is a clear increased risk of admission with IPD or VZ in HIV-infected compared with uninfected children, magnified in those who have not yet commenced cART. It is anticipated that the introduction of new guidelines will result in improved vaccine uptake and thereby reduce the burden of IPD and VZ disease. Subsequent evaluation will assess the impact of these guidelines.", "AuthorKeywords": ["HIV", "Pneumococcus", "UK", "Vaccine", "Varicella"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Chickenpox", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Cohort Studies", "Female", "Great Britain", "HIV Infections", "Hospitalization", "Humans", "Incidence", "Infant", "Ireland", "Male", "Pneumococcal Infections"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84925588194", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"7005709905": {"Name": "Payne H.", "AuthorID": "7005709905", "AffiliationID": "60032542", "AffiliationName": "Pediatric Infectious Diseases Unit, St. Georges Healthcare NHS Trust"}, "57203627482": {"Name": "Ladhani S.N.", "AuthorID": "57203627482", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "Public Health England"}, "57209983626": {"Name": "Doerholt K.", "AuthorID": "57209983626", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council Clinical Trials Unit, UCL"}, "19434501100": {"Name": "Judd A.", "AuthorID": "19434501100", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council Clinical Trials Unit, UCL"}, "55235394400": {"Name": "Donegan K.", "AuthorID": "55235394400", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council Clinical Trials Unit, UCL"}, "36131932000": {"Name": "Okike I.O.", "AuthorID": "36131932000", "AffiliationID": "60029329", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Sciences and Vaccine Institute, St. Georges, University of London"}, "7006029267": {"Name": "Heath P.T.", "AuthorID": "7006029267", "AffiliationID": "60029329", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Sciences and Vaccine Institute, St. Georges, University of London"}}}
