In this article, we use a theoretical and computational analysis to demonstrate an efficient mechanism for enhancing the third-harmonic generation in graphene diffraction gratings. By taking advantage of the relation between the resonance wavelength of localized surface-plasmon polaritons of graphene ribbons and disks their specific geometry, we can engineer the spectral response of graphene gratings so as strong plasmonic resonances exist at both the fundamental frequency and third-harmonic (TH). As a result of this dual resonance mechanism for optical near-field enhancement, the intensity of the TH can be increased greatly.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Graphene", "Plasmons", "Third-harmonic generation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Computational analysis", "Fundamental frequencies", "Localized surface plasmon polaritons", "Optical near field", "Plasmonic resonances", "Resonance wavelengths", "Spectral response", "Subwavelength scale"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85008330513", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"55487309400": {"Name": "You J.", "AuthorID": "55487309400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "55671101600": {"Name": "Weismann M.", "AuthorID": "55671101600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "7004097868": {"Name": "Panoiu N.", "AuthorID": "7004097868", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}}}
