Optimization of plasma polymerization process was carried out keeping cell culture application in mind. Thus, samples were rigorously tested for retention of amino groups under both dry and wet conditions. Physio-chemical characterization was carried out using ninhydrin test, X-ray photon spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and static water contact analysis. Results from physio chemical characterization shows that functionalization of the amino group is not stable under wet conditions and optimization of plasma process is required for stable bonding of amino groups to the POSS-PCU polymer. Optimized samples were later tested in vitro in short and long-term culture to study differentiation of ADSCs on amino modified samples. Short-term cell culture shows that initial cell attachment was significantly (p < 0.001) improved on amine modified samples (NH2-POSS-PCU) compared to unmodified POSS-PCU. NH2-POSS-PCU samples also facilitates osteogenic differentiation of ADSCs as confirmed by immunological staining of cells for extracellular markers such as collagen Type I and osteopontin. Quantification of total collagen and ALP activity also shows significant (p < 0.001) increase on NH2-POSS-PCU samples compared to unmodified POSS-PCU. A pilot study also confirms that these optimized amino modified POSS-PCU samples can further be functionalized using bone inducing peptide such as KRSR using conventional wet chemistry. This further provides an opportunity for biofunctionalization of the polymer for various tissue specific applications.", "AuthorKeywords": ["adipose-derived stem cells", "allylamine", "osteogenic differentiation", "plasma polymerization", "polyhedral oligomeric silsequioxane poly(carbonate-urea) urethane"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adipose derived stem cells", "Allyl amine", "Amino functionalization", "Osteogenic differentiation", "Plasma surface modifications", "Polyhedral oligomeric silsequioxane", "Short-and long-term cultures", "X ray photon spectroscopy", "Allylamine", "Carbonates", "Nanocomposites", "Organosilicon Compounds", "Osteogenesis", "Pilot Projects", "Polycarboxylate Cement", "Stem Cells", "Urea"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84979752451", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"]], "AuthorData": {"57190401658": {"Name": "Chaves C.", "AuthorID": "57190401658", "AffiliationID": "60106017, 60009907", "AffiliationName": "Universit\u00e9 Paris Sud, Orthopedic Surgery, H\u00f4pital Saint Antoine"}, "55706838700": {"Name": "Alshomer F.", "AuthorID": "55706838700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Centre for Nanotechnology and Regenerative Medicine, Division of Surgery and Interventional Science, University College London"}, "24070966200": {"Name": "Kalaskar D.M.", "AuthorID": "24070966200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Centre for Nanotechnology and Regenerative Medicine, Division of Surgery and Interventional Science, University College London"}, "8227436900": {"Name": "Palgrave R.G.", "AuthorID": "8227436900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}}}
