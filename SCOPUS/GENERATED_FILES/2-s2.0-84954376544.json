Our aim was to identify new plasma biomarkers to differentiate stroke subtypes and to combine their diagnostic ability with other biomarkers already described for this clinical indication. Plasma samples of ischemic stroke patients (36) and ICH patients (10) were screened using a 177 antibodies library, and 11 showed different concentrations among stroke subtypes (p < 0.05), mainly chemokines, growth factors and angiogenic factors. Five proteins were selected for replication in 16 ischemic stroke patients and 16 ICH patients, and retinol-binding protein 4 (RPB4), apolipoprotein B100 and pigment epithelial-derived factor were replicated (p < 0.05). These proteins, together with glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and receptor for advanced glycation end product, were tested in 38 ischemic stroke and 28 ICH samples. Finally, RBP4 >61 \u03bcg/mL and GFAP <0.07 ng/mL showed a specificity of 100% for both subtypes. Moreover, after multivariate logistic regression analysis, RBP4 >48.75 \u03bcg/mL (ORadj: 6.09 (1.3-28.57), p = 0.02) and GFAP <0.07 ng/mL (ORadj: 0.03 (0.003-0.31), p = 0.003) resulted in independent predictors of stroke subtype, improving discrimination by 29% (p < 0.0001). Both biomarkers might be useful as diagnostic biomarkers to differentiate ischemic stroke and ICH. A rapid differentiation of ischemic stroke from intracerebral hemorrhage is essential to provide the appropriate treatment. We describe the discovery and subsequent replications of RBP4 and its combination with circulating GFAP as plasmatic biomarkers for hyperacute stroke subtype differentiation. The combination of these biomarkers and others might aid to speed up the discrimination of both stroke subtypes improving the outcome of patients.
