The research conceptualized how program elements enabled both individual experiences and relational processes to occur. These components operated within a context that was enriched by the museum as a place to support wellbeing and enhance social interaction. To meaningfully support socially isolated older people as part of local public health strategies, museums need to be accessible and engaging places that purposively support social interaction by involving people and objects, participating in multiple sessions over time, that are facilitated by skilled and knowledgeable staff.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Healthy ageing", "Museums", "Social isolation", "Social prescribing, older people", "Wellbeing"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Female", "Grounded Theory", "Humans", "Interpersonal Relations", "Male", "Mental Health", "Museums", "Qualitative Research", "Quality of Life", "Social Isolation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85029494657", "SubjectAreas": [["Health (social science)", "SOCI", "3306"], ["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"], ["Life-span and Life-course Studies", "SOCI", "3319"]], "AuthorData": {"57195684047": {"Name": "Todd C.", "AuthorID": "57195684047", "AffiliationID": "60019444", "AffiliationName": "Salomons Centre for Applied Psychology, Canterbury Christ Church University"}, "35267762400": {"Name": "Camic P.", "AuthorID": "35267762400", "AffiliationID": "60019444", "AffiliationName": "Salomons Centre for Applied Psychology, Canterbury Christ Church University"}, "55857497100": {"Name": "Lockyer B.", "AuthorID": "55857497100", "AffiliationID": "60019444", "AffiliationName": "Salomons Centre for Applied Psychology, Canterbury Christ Church University"}, "55318159200": {"Name": "Thomson L.", "AuthorID": "55318159200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Culture, University College London"}, "14063145400": {"Name": "Chatterjee H.", "AuthorID": "14063145400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genetics, Evolution and Environment, Division of Biosciences, University College London"}}}
