JeanetteWing's seminal work on Computational Thinking (CT) is an important landmark for this goal: CT represents a way of thinking, a set of problem-solving skills which can be valuable when interacting with digital technologies, and with different fields of knowledge, such as Arts and Humanities. Even if this cross-areas relevance has been celebrated and acknowledged in theoretical research, there has been a lack of practical projects exploring these links between CT and non-STEM fields. This research develops these links. We present a specific case \u2013 a game produced by two 14 years-old boys \u2013 within Playing Beowulf, a collaboration with the British library's Young Researchers programme, in which students aged 13\u201314 from an inner-London (UK) school have developed games based on their own readings of the Anglo-Saxon poem Beowulf during an after-school club. The game was produced using MissionMaker, a software (currently under development at UCL Knowledge Lab) that allows users to create and code their own first-person 3D games in a simple way, using pre-made 3D assets, such as rooms, props, characters and weapons and a simplified programming language manipulated through drop-down lists. We argue that MissionMaker, by simplifying the development process (low floor), can be a means to foster the building of knowledge in both STEM (CT) and Arts and Humanities, building bridges between these two areas inside and outside traditional schooling.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Arts", "Computational thinking", "Game-making", "Humanities"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85036527076", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["Human-Computer Interaction", "COMP", "1709"]], "AuthorData": {"57207470297": {"Name": "de Paula B.H.", "AuthorID": "57207470297", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Education, University College London"}, "16645025400": {"Name": "Burn A.", "AuthorID": "16645025400", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Education, University College London"}, "7004339947": {"Name": "Noss R.", "AuthorID": "7004339947", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Education, University College London"}, "55575263600": {"Name": "Valente J.A.", "AuthorID": "55575263600", "AffiliationID": "60029570", "AffiliationName": "Instituto de Artes\u2014Universidade Estadual de Campinas"}}}
