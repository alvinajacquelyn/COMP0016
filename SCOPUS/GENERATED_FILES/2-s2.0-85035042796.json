In this research work, interlaminate shear strength of Vacuum assisted resin transfer molding (VARTM) manufactured CARALL has been investigated. Numerical simulation model incorporated with real time material data has been developed to predict the delamination behavior of CARALL laminates. Standard CARALL specimens with different surface morphologies were prepared by electric discharge machining, mechanical, chemical and electrochemical surface treatments. T-peel tests were carried out according to standard ASTM D1876-08 to find out inter laminate shear strength. FMLs made out of mechanically, chemically and electrochemically cleaned metal sheets depicted high interlaminate shear strength. SEM micrographs of failed surfaces verify the high adhesive strength of epoxy. Developed numerical simulation model accurately predicts the delamination behavior of CARALL as observed during experimentation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["CARALL", "FMLs", "Numerical simulation", "Surface treatments", "T-peel"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aircraft structure", "CARALL", "Carbon fiber reinforced", "Electrochemical surfaces", "Fiber metal laminates", "FMLs", "Surface preparation", "Vacuum assisted resin transfer molding"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85035042796", "SubjectAreas": [["Mechanics of Materials", "ENGI", "2211"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"]], "AuthorData": {"57197811599": {"Name": "Khan F.", "AuthorID": "57197811599", "AffiliationID": "60042800", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Engineering and Technology Taxila"}, "55974698900": {"Name": "Asghar W.", "AuthorID": "55974698900", "AffiliationID": "60042800", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Engineering and Technology Taxila"}, "56767792900": {"Name": "Azeem M.", "AuthorID": "56767792900", "AffiliationID": "60042800", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Engineering and Technology Taxila"}, "56902670800": {"Name": "Anjum Z.", "AuthorID": "56902670800", "AffiliationID": "60042800", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Engineering and Technology Taxila"}, "56402803800": {"Name": "Nasir A.", "AuthorID": "56402803800", "AffiliationID": "60042800", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Engineering and Technology Taxila"}, "57209674980": {"Name": "Shah M.", "AuthorID": "57209674980", "AffiliationID": "60042800", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Engineering and Technology Taxila"}, "56444292500": {"Name": "Qayyum F.", "AuthorID": "56444292500", "AffiliationID": "60008988", "AffiliationName": "Institut f\u00fcr Metallformung, Technische Universit\u00e4t Bergakademie Freiberg (Sachsen)"}}}
