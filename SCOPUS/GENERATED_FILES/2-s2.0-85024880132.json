It presents an overview of the range of neurological disease encountered in general medicine. The neurological consequences of aortic or cardiac disorders can be devastating. The chapter considers ischaemic stroke and transient ischaemic attack (TIA) - the main clinical result of embolism from the heart or great vessel. Thyroid disorders can have a major impact on neurological function; they affect any part of the central nervous system (CNS), peripheral nerves or muscle, mainly via high or low levels of circulating T4 and T3 or immune-mediated damage. It is especially important to recognise neurological manifestations of thyroid disease, as the symptoms will usually respond to appropriate treatment. The chapter summarizes the clinical features of abnormalities in serum sodium, potassium, calcium and magnesium.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Aortic disorders", "Cardiac disorders", "Central nervous system", "Immune-mediated damage", "Ischaemic stroke", "Neurological manifestations", "Transient ischaemic attack"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85024880132", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"6603707621": {"Name": "Werring D.", "AuthorID": "6603707621", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London Institute of Neurology"}, "7101797716": {"Name": "Shorvon S.", "AuthorID": "7101797716", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London Institute of Neurology"}, "7403674316": {"Name": "Howard R.", "AuthorID": "7403674316", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, University College London Hospitals, NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
