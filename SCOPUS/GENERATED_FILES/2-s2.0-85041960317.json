In particular, the mentalization-based model argues that insecure attachment indirectly accounts for increased BPD features, notably via disruption of RF capacities. Although the mediation relationship between attachment, RF, and BPD is supported by previous evidence, it remains to be directly tested in adults with BPD. In the current study, a sample of 55 female adult BPD patients and 105 female healthy controls completed a battery of self-report measures to investigate the interplay between attachment, RF capacities, and BPD clinical status. Overall, the results showed that BPD patients predominantly reported insecure attachment, characterized by negative internal working models of the self as unlovable and unimportant to others, and decreased RF abilities. Our findings further indicated that actual RF capacities mediated the relationships between adult insecure attachment and BPD clinical status.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Borderline Personality Disorder", "Case-Control Studies", "Female", "Humans", "Interpersonal Relations", "Male", "Mentalization", "Object Attachment", "Self Report", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "Theory of Mind", "Thinking", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85041960317", "SubjectAreas": [["Clinical Psychology", "PSYC", "3203"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"53979404300": {"Name": "Badoud D.", "AuthorID": "53979404300", "AffiliationID": "60026405, 60004718", "AffiliationName": "Developmental Clinical Psychology Unit, Faculty of Psychology, University of Geneva, Office M\u00e9dico-P\u00e9dagogique Research Unit, Department of Psychiatry, University of Geneva School of Medicine"}, "8724552100": {"Name": "Debban\u00e9 M.", "AuthorID": "8724552100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London"}, "55191487800": {"Name": "Prada P.", "AuthorID": "55191487800", "AffiliationID": "60009963", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mental Health and Psychiatry, University Hospitals of Geneva"}, "6506937700": {"Name": "Nicastro R.", "AuthorID": "6506937700", "AffiliationID": "60009963", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mental Health and Psychiatry, University Hospitals of Geneva"}, "57200629687": {"Name": "Germond C.", "AuthorID": "57200629687", "AffiliationID": "60009963", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mental Health and Psychiatry, University Hospitals of Geneva"}, "23470451800": {"Name": "Perroud N.", "AuthorID": "23470451800", "AffiliationID": "60004718", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, University of Geneva"}, "57203069499": {"Name": "Luyten P.", "AuthorID": "57203069499", "AffiliationID": "60025063", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Psychology and Educational Sciences, KU Leuven"}}}
