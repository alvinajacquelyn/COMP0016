Here, in the first in a Series of two papers, we discuss why slums are unhealthy places with especially high risks of infection and injury. We show that children are especially vulnerable, and that the combination of malnutrition and recurrent diarrhoea leads to stunted growth and longer-term effects on cognitive development. We find that the scientific literature on slum health is underdeveloped in comparison to urban health, and poverty and health. This shortcoming is important because health is affected by factors arising from the shared physical and social environment, which have effects beyond those of poverty alone. In the second paper we will consider what can be done to improve health and make recommendations for the development of slum health as a field of study.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Health Status Disparities", "Humans", "Poverty Areas", "Socioeconomic Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85005877153", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"6603938217": {"Name": "Ezeh A.", "AuthorID": "6603938217", "AffiliationID": "60016218", "AffiliationName": "School of Public Health, University of Witwatersrand"}, "14031638400": {"Name": "Mberu B.", "AuthorID": "14031638400", "AffiliationID": "106632915", "AffiliationName": "African Population and Health Research Centre"}, "55835130800": {"Name": "Haregu T.", "AuthorID": "55835130800", "AffiliationID": "106632915", "AffiliationName": "African Population and Health Research Centre"}, "35798567300": {"Name": "Oyebode O.", "AuthorID": "35798567300", "AffiliationID": "60000064, 60022020", "AffiliationName": "Warwick Centre for Applied Health Research and Delivery, University of Warwick"}, "57218382677": {"Name": "Chen Y.F.", "AuthorID": "57218382677", "AffiliationID": "60000064, 60022020", "AffiliationName": "Warwick Centre for Applied Health Research and Delivery, University of Warwick"}, "57192365324": {"Name": "Sartori J.", "AuthorID": "57192365324", "AffiliationID": "60000064, 60022020", "AffiliationName": "Warwick Centre for Applied Health Research and Delivery, University of Warwick"}, "57188672699": {"Name": "Melendez-Torres G.J.", "AuthorID": "57188672699", "AffiliationID": "60000064, 60022020", "AffiliationName": "Warwick Centre for Applied Health Research and Delivery, University of Warwick"}, "57189342156": {"Name": "Watson S.I.", "AuthorID": "57189342156", "AffiliationID": "60000064, 60022020", "AffiliationName": "Warwick Centre for Applied Health Research and Delivery, University of Warwick"}, "22835354400": {"Name": "Lilford R.J.", "AuthorID": "22835354400", "AffiliationID": "60000064, 60022020", "AffiliationName": "Warwick Centre for Applied Health Research and Delivery, University of Warwick"}, "6701599059": {"Name": "Satterthwaite D.", "AuthorID": "6701599059", "AffiliationID": "60092016", "AffiliationName": "International Institute for Environment and Development"}, "16837118200": {"Name": "Ndugwa R.", "AuthorID": "16837118200", "AffiliationID": "117842001", "AffiliationName": "Global Urban Observatory Research and Capacity Development Branch, United Nations Human Settlements Programme, UN Avenue Gigiri, UN Complex, GPO Nairobi"}, "55667154700": {"Name": "Caiaffa W.", "AuthorID": "55667154700", "AffiliationID": "60030074", "AffiliationName": "School of Medicine, Federal University of Minas Gerais"}, "7006403263": {"Name": "Capon A.", "AuthorID": "7006403263", "AffiliationID": "100924140", "AffiliationName": "United Nations University"}}}
