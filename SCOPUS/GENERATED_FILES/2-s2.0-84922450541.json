Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the European Society of Cardiology.Aims The purpose of this study was to create an epicardial electroanatomic map of the right ventricle (RV) and then apply post-operative-targeted single- and dual-site RV temporary pacing with measurement of haemodynamic parameters. Cardiac resynchronization therapy is an established treatment for symptomatic left ventricular (LV) dysfunction. In congenital heart disease, RV dysfunction is a common cause of morbidity - little is known regarding the potential benefits of CRT in this setting. Methods and results Sixteen adults (age = 32 \u00b1 8 years; 6 M, 10 F) with right bundle branch block (RBBB) and repaired tetralogy of Fallot (n = 8) or corrected congenital pulmonary stenosis (n = 8) undergoing surgical pulmonary valve replacement (PVR) for pulmonary regurgitation underwent epicardial RV mapping and haemodynamic assessment of random pacing configurations including the site of latest RV activation. The pre-operative pulmonary regurgitant fraction was 49 \u00b1 10%; mean LV end-diastolic volume (EDV) 85 \u00b1 19 mL/min/m2 and RVEDV 183 \u00b1 89 mL/min/m2 on cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. The mean pre-operative QRS duration is 136 \u00b1 26 ms. The commonest site of latest activation was the RV free wall and DDD pacing here alone or combined with RV apical pacing resulted in significant increases in cardiac output (CO) vs. AAI pacing (P < 0.01 all measures). DDDRV alternative site pacing significantly improved CO by 16% vs. AAI (P = 0.018), and 8.5% vs. DDDRV apical pacing (P = 0.02). Conclusion Single-site RV pacing targeted to the region of latest activation in patients with RBBB undergoing PVR induces acute improvements in haemodynamics and supports the concept of 'RV CRT'. Targeted pacing in such patients has therapeutic potential both post-operatively and in the long term.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Congenital heart disease", "Electroanatomic map", "Resynchronization", "Right ventricle"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Bundle-Branch Block", "Cardiac Output", "Cardiac Pacing, Artificial", "Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy", "Epicardial Mapping", "Female", "Heart Valve Prosthesis Implantation", "Heart Ventricles", "Hemodynamics", "Humans", "Male", "Pulmonary Valve Insufficiency", "Pulmonary Valve Stenosis", "Stroke Volume", "Tetralogy of Fallot", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84922450541", "SubjectAreas": [["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"], ["Physiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2737"]], "AuthorData": {"14042238000": {"Name": "Plymen C.M.", "AuthorID": "14042238000", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "34971090100": {"Name": "Finlay M.", "AuthorID": "34971090100", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "14424296500": {"Name": "O'Leary J.", "AuthorID": "14424296500", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "36521626400": {"Name": "Picaut N.", "AuthorID": "36521626400", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "7102265239": {"Name": "Cullen S.", "AuthorID": "7102265239", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "13906244100": {"Name": "Walker F.", "AuthorID": "13906244100", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "6603130488": {"Name": "Lambiase P.D.", "AuthorID": "6603130488", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "56509535700": {"Name": "Deanfiel J.E.", "AuthorID": "56509535700", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "56466227600": {"Name": "Tsang V.", "AuthorID": "56466227600", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiovascular Surgery, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children"}, "54883432300": {"Name": "Hsia T.Y.", "AuthorID": "54883432300", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiovascular Surgery, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children"}, "7006577623": {"Name": "Bolger A.P.", "AuthorID": "7006577623", "AffiliationID": "60009171", "AffiliationName": "East Midlands Congenital Heart Centre, Glenfield Hospital"}}}
