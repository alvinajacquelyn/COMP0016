But academic work on the subject has been hesitant to address the more complex political, economic, and institutional factors that underpinned the New Art Practice's emergence and secured its prolific development. In this article, I argue that the New Art Practice both came out of and responded to a complex and contradictory moment in Yugoslavia's history, when the country began to integrate itself deeper into the Western capitalist world system. I discuss the emergence of the OHO group in Ljubljana and two particular episodes in the youth cultural centers of Zagreb and Novi Sad against a brief but decisive period of political and economic liberalization, which began with a massive economic reform in 1965 and was briefly interrupted by a crisis in federal politics in 1971-72. During this period, growing personal, regional, and sectorial inequalities began to refuel nationalist resentments, culminating in the so-called Croatian Mass Movement and the purging of liberal leaderships throughout the entire federation. I propose that 1971 was not only a crucial turning point for the political direction of Yugoslav \u201cself-managing\u201d socialism-counteracting its promises of grassroots participation and a more experimental political culture-but also for the New Art Practice itself, driving many of its early proponents to stop making art altogether. 2 .", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85064267467", "SubjectAreas": [["Cultural Studies", "SOCI", "3316"], ["Visual Arts and Performing Arts", "ARTS", "1213"], ["History", "ARTS", "1202"]], "AuthorData": {"57204943508": {"Name": "Ili\u0107 M.", "AuthorID": "57204943508", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London's, School of Slavonic and East European Studies"}}}
