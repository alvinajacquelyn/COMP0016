We show how the recently introduced two-to-two and three-to-one kurt-spectra (and their associated correlation functions), which depend on the power spectrum of the lensing potential, can be used to probe modified gravity theories such as f(R) theories of gravity and quintessence models. We also investigate models based on effective field theory, which include the constant-\u03a9 model, and low-energy Ho\u0159ava theories. Estimates of the cumulative signal-to-noise for detection of lensing-induced morphology changes, reaches (103) for the future planned CMB polarization mission COrE+. Assuming foreground removal is possible to \u2113max=3000, we show that many modified gravity theories can be rejected with a high level of significance, making this technique comparable in power to galaxy weak lensing or redshift surveys. These topological estimators are also useful in distinguishing lensing from other scattering secondaries at the level of the four-point function or trispectrum. Examples include the kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) effect which shares, with lensing, a lack of spectral distortion. We also discuss the complication of foreground contamination from unsubtracted point sources.", "AuthorKeywords": ["CMBR theory", "modified gravity", "non-gaussianity"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85012880128", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"]], "AuthorData": {"35318355900": {"Name": "Munshi D.", "AuthorID": "35318355900", "AffiliationID": "60017317", "AffiliationName": "Astronomy Centre, School of Mathematical and Physical Sciences, University of Sussex"}, "36742499400": {"Name": "Coles P.", "AuthorID": "36742499400", "AffiliationID": "60017317", "AffiliationName": "Astronomy Centre, School of Mathematical and Physical Sciences, University of Sussex"}, "56591145400": {"Name": "Hu B.", "AuthorID": "56591145400", "AffiliationID": "60019816", "AffiliationName": "Institute Lorentz, Leiden University"}, "36053275800": {"Name": "Matsubara T.", "AuthorID": "36053275800", "AffiliationID": "60000264", "AffiliationName": "Kobayashi-Maskawa Institute, Nagoya University"}, "6701605678": {"Name": "Heavens A.", "AuthorID": "6701605678", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Imperial Centre for Inference and Cosmology, Blackett Laboratory"}}}
