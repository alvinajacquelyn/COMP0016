The American Astronomical Society. All rights reserved.We present deep near-infrared spectra for a sample of 24 quiescent galaxies in the redshift range 1.5 < z < 2.5 obtained with the MOSFIRE spectrograph at the W. M. Keck Observatory. In conjunction with a similar data set we obtained in the range 1 < z < 1.5 with the LRIS spectrograph, we analyze the kinematic and structural properties for 80 quiescent galaxies, the largest homogeneously selected sample to date spanning 3 Gyr of early cosmic history. Analysis of our Keck spectra together with measurements derived from associated Hubble Space Telescope images reveals increasingly larger stellar velocity dispersions and smaller sizes to redshifts beyond z \u223c 2. By classifying our sample according to S\u00e9rsic indices, we find that among disk-like systems the flatter ones show a higher dynamical to stellar mass ratio compared to their rounder counterparts, which we interpret as evidence for a significant contribution of rotational motion. For this subset of disk-like systems, we estimate that V s, the ratio of the circular velocity to the intrinsic velocity dispersion, is a factor of two larger than for presentday disky quiescent galaxies. We use the velocity dispersion measurements also to explore the redshift evolution of the dynamical to stellar mass ratio, and to measure for the first time the physical size growth rate of individual systems over two distinct redshift ranges, finding a faster evolution at earlier times. We discuss the physical origin of this time-dependent growth in size in the context of the associated reduction of the systematic rotation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["galaxies: evolution", "galaxies: formation", "galaxies: high-redshift", "galaxies: kinematics and dynamics", "galaxies: stellar content"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85010036578", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"45360925900": {"Name": "Belli S.", "AuthorID": "45360925900", "AffiliationID": "60021561", "AffiliationName": "Max-Planck-Institut f\u00fcr Extraterrestrische Physik (MPE)"}, "57201766919": {"Name": "Newman A.", "AuthorID": "57201766919", "AffiliationID": "60002312", "AffiliationName": "Observatories of the Carnegie Institution for Science"}, "7401985303": {"Name": "Ellis R.", "AuthorID": "7401985303", "AffiliationID": "60031581", "AffiliationName": "Department of Astronomy, California Institute of Technology"}}}
