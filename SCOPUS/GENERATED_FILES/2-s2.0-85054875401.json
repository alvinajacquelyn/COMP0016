We developed a structured interview\u2014the Pica, ARFID, and Rumination Disorder Interview (PARDI)\u2014to assess the presence and severity of these diagnoses for evaluation and treatment planning in clinical and research settings. Here, we describe the development of the PARDI and provide a preliminary report on feasibility, acceptability, reliability, and validity in relation to ARFID. Method: We created an initial item pool from existing measures of similar constructs and clinical experience. The PARDI includes items assessing the level of endorsement and overall severity of common ARFID features organized into profiles (i.e., sensory sensitivity, lack of interest in eating, and fear of aversive consequences) and algorithms for diagnosing ARFID, pica, and RD. We collected initial psychometric data from participants (10\u201322 years) with ARFID (n = 39), clinically significant avoidant/restrictive eating (n = 8), and healthy controls (n = 10). Results: On average, the PARDI took 39 min to complete and was acceptable to participants. All subscales achieved internal consistency greater \u22650.77, and inter-rater reliability for the ARFID diagnosis was moderate (\u03ba = 0.75). Individuals with ARFID scored significantly higher than healthy controls on ARFID severity and ARFID profiles. Discussion: The PARDI appears acceptable to respondents and preliminary evidence of reliability and validity has been demonstrated in an initial sample. Larger-scale validation studies are currently underway. The PARDI is freely available to clinicians and researchers.", "AuthorKeywords": ["ARFID", "assessment", "avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder", "clinical interview", "pica", "rumination disorder"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Child", "Feeding and Eating Disorders of Childhood", "Female", "Humans", "Interviews as Topic", "Male", "Pica", "Pilot Projects", "Reproducibility of Results", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85054875401", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"57204100230": {"Name": "Bryant-Waugh R.", "AuthorID": "57204100230", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "7006351296": {"Name": "Cooke L.", "AuthorID": "7006351296", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "16031429800": {"Name": "Micali N.", "AuthorID": "16031429800", "AffiliationID": "60026405, 60004718", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, Faculty of Medicine, University of Geneva"}, "14121470500": {"Name": "Lawson E.A.", "AuthorID": "14121470500", "AffiliationID": "60002746", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School"}, "6701752821": {"Name": "Eddy K.T.", "AuthorID": "6701752821", "AffiliationID": "60002746", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, Harvard Medical School"}, "26645214400": {"Name": "Thomas J.J.", "AuthorID": "26645214400", "AffiliationID": "60002746", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, Harvard Medical School"}}}
