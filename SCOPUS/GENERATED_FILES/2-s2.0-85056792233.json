Methods: Bite force and surface EMG from the masseter muscle were recorded simultaneously as participants (13 patients, 15 controls) held a force transducer between the upper and lower incisors very gently. Results: Tremor in 6\u20139 Hz band for bruxists was greater on average compared to controls, but the difference was not significant, both for force recordings and EMG activity. Conclusions: The low effect sizes measured with the current protocol contrast highly with those of our previous study, where larger, dynamic bite forces were used, and where jaw tremor was markedly different in bruxists compared with controls. Significance: We have now gained important insight into the conditions under which abnormal jaw tremor can be elicited in bruxism. From a scientific standpoint, this is critical for understanding the \u2018abnormality\u2019 of PMR feedback in bruxism. From a clinical perspective, our results represent progress towards the development of an optimal protocol in which jaw tremor can serve as a biological marker of bruxism.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bite force", "Bruxism", "Jaw", "Periodontal mechanoreceptors", "Tremor"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Bite Force", "Electromyography", "Female", "Humans", "Incisor", "Jaw", "Jaw Abnormalities", "Male", "Masseter Muscle", "Mechanoreceptors", "Sleep Bruxism", "Tremor", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85056792233", "SubjectAreas": [["Otorhinolaryngology", "MEDI", "2733"], ["Dentistry (all)", "DENT", "3500"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"56267470600": {"Name": "Yilmaz G.", "AuthorID": "56267470600", "AffiliationID": "60006369", "AffiliationName": "Ko\u00e7 University School of Medicine"}, "56529237700": {"Name": "\u00d6zyurt M.", "AuthorID": "56529237700", "AffiliationID": "60006369", "AffiliationName": "Ko\u00e7 University School of Medicine"}, "7005874092": {"Name": "T\u00fcrker K.", "AuthorID": "7005874092", "AffiliationID": "60006369", "AffiliationName": "Ko\u00e7 University School of Medicine"}, "26632964100": {"Name": "Laine C.", "AuthorID": "26632964100", "AffiliationID": "60029311", "AffiliationName": "Division of Biokinesiology and Physical Therapy, University of Southern California"}, "55659787100": {"Name": "Tinastepe N.", "AuthorID": "55659787100", "AffiliationID": "60029311", "AffiliationName": "Division of Biokinesiology and Physical Therapy, University of Southern California"}}}
