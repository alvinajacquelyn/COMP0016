However, static typing has a cost: Adding annotations, reading the added syntax, and wrestling with the type system to fix type errors. Type inference can ease the transition to more statically typed code and unlock the benefits of richer compile-time information, but is limited in languages like JavaScript as it cannot soundly handle duck-typing or runtime evaluation via eval. We propose DeepTyper, a deep learning model that understands which types naturally occur in certain contexts and relations and can provide type suggestions, which can often be verified by the type checker, even if it could not infer the type initially. DeepTyper, leverages an automatically aligned corpus of tokens and types to accurately predict thousands of variable and function type annotations. Furthermore, we demonstrate that context is key in accurately assigning these types and introduce a technique to reduce overfitting on local cues while highlighting the need for further improvements. Finally, we show that our model can interact with a compiler to provide more than 4,000 additional type annotations with over 95% precision that could not be inferred without the aid of DeepTyper.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Deep Learning", "Naturalness", "Type Inference"], "IndexKeywords": ["Compile time", "Dynamically typed languages", "Learning models", "Naturalness", "Static typing", "Type annotations", "Type checker", "Type inferences"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85058278739", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Artificial Intelligence", "COMP", "1702"]], "AuthorData": {"57021723600": {"Name": "Hellendoorn V.", "AuthorID": "57021723600", "AffiliationID": "60014439", "AffiliationName": "University of California, Davis"}, "17433640400": {"Name": "Bird C.", "AuthorID": "17433640400", "AffiliationID": "60021726", "AffiliationName": "Microsoft Research"}, "7005643860": {"Name": "Barr E.", "AuthorID": "7005643860", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "39361040300": {"Name": "Allamanis M.", "AuthorID": "39361040300", "AffiliationID": "60098463", "AffiliationName": "Microsoft Research Cambridge"}}}
