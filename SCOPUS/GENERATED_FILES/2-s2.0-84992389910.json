Evolution published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. on behalf of The Society for the Study of Evolution.Ecomorphological differentiation is a key feature of adaptive radiations, with a general trend for specialization and niche expansion following divergence. Ecological opportunity afforded by invasion of a new habitat is thought to act as an ecological release, facilitating divergence, and speciation. Here, we investigate trophic adaptive morphology and ecology of an endemic clade of oreochromine cichlid fishes (Alcolapia) that radiated along a herbivorous trophic axis following colonization of an isolated lacustrine environment, and demonstrate phenotype-environment correlation. Ecological and morphological divergence of the Alcolapia species flock are examined in a phylogenomic context, to infer ecological niche occupation within the radiation. Species divergence is observed in both ecology and morphology, supporting the importance of ecological speciation within the radiation. Comparison with an outgroup taxon reveals large-scale ecomorphological divergence but shallow genomic differentiation within the Alcolapia adaptive radiation. Ancestral morphological reconstruction suggests lake colonization by a generalist oreochromine phenotype that diverged in Lake Natron to varied herbivorous morphologies akin to specialist herbivores in Lakes Tanganyika and Malawi.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alcolapia", "ecomorphology", "geometric morphometrics", "herbivorous diversification", "soda lakes", "stable isotopes"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adaptation, Biological", "Animals", "Biological Evolution", "Cichlids", "Ecosystem", "Female", "Genetic Speciation", "Kenya", "Male", "Sequence Analysis, DNA", "Tanzania"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84992389910", "SubjectAreas": [["Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics", "AGRI", "1105"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"]], "AuthorData": {"56693909400": {"Name": "Ford A.G.P.", "AuthorID": "56693909400", "AffiliationID": "60025779", "AffiliationName": "Current Address: School of Biological Sciences, Bangor University"}, "57191658086": {"Name": "Bruun K.", "AuthorID": "57191658086", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genetics, Evolution and Environment, University College London"}, "36061648200": {"Name": "Day J.J.", "AuthorID": "36061648200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genetics, Evolution and Environment, University College London"}, "6602183330": {"Name": "R\u00fcber L.", "AuthorID": "6602183330", "AffiliationID": "60020486", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Ecology and Evolution, University of Bern"}, "57102626400": {"Name": "Newton J.", "AuthorID": "57102626400", "AffiliationID": "60017641", "AffiliationName": "NERC Life Sciences Mass Spectrometry Facility, SUERC"}, "6602134403": {"Name": "Dasmahapatra K.K.", "AuthorID": "6602134403", "AffiliationID": "60016418", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biology, University of York"}, "57191675574": {"Name": "Balarin J.D.", "AuthorID": "57191675574", "AffiliationID": "117729316", "AffiliationName": "Pact Inc"}}}
