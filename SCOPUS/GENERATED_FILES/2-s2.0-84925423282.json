Partnerships offer the opportunity to link the actions of diverse actors operating at different scales and, thus, they may be flexible enough to deal with uncertain futures and changing development demands. However, simultaneously, partnerships may lack effectiveness in delivering action at the local level, and may constitute a strategy for some actors to legitimate their objectives in spite of the interests of other partners. Engaging with the specific example of urban governance in Maputo, Mozambique, the authors present an analysis of potential partnerships in this context, in relation to the actors that are willing and able to intervene to deliver climate change action. What, they ask, are the challenges to achieving common objectives in partnerships from the perspective of local residents in informal settlements? The analysis describes a changing context of climate change governance in the city, in which the prospects of access to international finance for climate change adaptation are moving institutional actors towards engaging with participatory processes at the local level. However, the analysis suggests a question about the extent to which local communities are actually perceived as actors with legitimate interests who can intervene in partnerships, and whether their interests are recognized", "AuthorKeywords": ["Climate change adaptation", "Climate change governance", "Collaborative partnerships", "Mozambique", "Urban planning"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84925423282", "SubjectAreas": [["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"], ["Environmental Science (miscellaneous)", "ENVI", "2301"]], "AuthorData": {"18435898700": {"Name": "Broto V.C.", "AuthorID": "18435898700", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Bartlett Development Planning Unit, University College London"}, "56568453100": {"Name": "Macucule D.A.", "AuthorID": "56568453100", "AffiliationID": "60072688", "AffiliationName": "Physical Planning, University Eduardo Mondlane"}, "16306204400": {"Name": "Boyd E.", "AuthorID": "16306204400", "AffiliationID": "60012197", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography and Environmental Science, Reading University"}, "7004575630": {"Name": "Ensor J.", "AuthorID": "7004575630", "AffiliationID": "60016418, 60015157", "AffiliationName": "Stockholm Environment Institute, University of York"}, "57199688269": {"Name": "Allen C.", "AuthorID": "57199688269", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
