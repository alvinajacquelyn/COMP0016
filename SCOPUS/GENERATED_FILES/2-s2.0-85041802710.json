Two ancient Roman silver denarii were selected as test objects to establish whether the proposed digital recording methods can support professional numismatic comparison of features and properties. The coins raise questions concerning their provenance, authenticity, design, purpose of issue and historic usage, but they also pose considerable recording challenges due to their material and surface properties, which are the main focus in this paper. The coins have been examined by the following techniques: dome photography for image sets for PTM/RTI visualisation and photometric stereo; X-ray microtomography for detection of cracks or impurities; Scanning Electron Microscopy for detailed surface investigation; Energy-Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy for elemental analysis; micro X-ray fluorescence spectrometry mapping; 3D laser and structured light scanning for 3D spatial capture; photogrammetry/structure from motion, focus-stacking. The results indicate the feasibility of such techniques for museum documentation and as contribution to scientific examination of coins in general.[Figure not available: see fulltext.]", "AuthorKeywords": ["3D scanning", "Focus-stacking", "MicroCT", "Numismatic", "Photogrammetry", "Photometric stereo", "PTM/RTI", "SEM/EDX", "SfM", "XRF"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85041802710", "SubjectAreas": [["Conservation", "ARTS", "1206"], ["Archeology (arts and humanities)", "ARTS", "1204"], ["Archeology", "SOCI", "3302"]], "AuthorData": {"38861761200": {"Name": "Hess M.", "AuthorID": "38861761200", "AffiliationID": "60011372", "AffiliationName": "Otto-Friedrich University of Bamberg, Digital Technologies in Heritage Conservation, Institute of Archaeology, Heritage Conservation and Art History"}, "7103387453": {"Name": "MacDonald L.W.", "AuthorID": "7103387453", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London (UCL), 3DIMPact Research Group (3D Imaging Metrology and Photogrammetry Applied Coordinate Technologies), Department of Civil, Environmental and Geomatic Engineering"}, "16415510800": {"Name": "Valach J.", "AuthorID": "16415510800", "AffiliationID": "60104326", "AffiliationName": "Inst. of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic (ITAM)"}}}
