In the remainder, a polygenic aetiology may be the cause of the phenotype, due to the co-inheritance of common LDL-C raising variants. In 2013, we reported the development of a 12-SNP LDL-C \u201cSNP-Score\u201d based on common variants identified as LDL-C raising from genome wide association consortium studies, and have confirmed the validity of this score in samples of no-mutation FH adults and children from more than six countries with European-Caucasian populations. In more than 80% of those with a clinical diagnosis of FH but with no detectable mutation in LDLR/APOB/PCSK9, the polygenic explanation is the most likely for their hypercholesterolaemia. Those with a low score (in the bottom two deciles) may have a mutation in a novel gene, and further research including whole exome or whole genome sequencing is warranted. Only in families where the index case has a monogenic cause should cascade testing be carried out, using DNA tests for an unambiguous identification of affected relatives. The clinical utility of the polygenic explanation is that it supports a more conservative (less aggressive) treatment care pathway for those with no mutation. The ability to distinguish those with a clinical diagnosis of FH who have a monogenic or a polygenic cause of their hypercholesterolaemia is a paradigm example of the use of genomic information to inform Precision Medicine using lipid lowering agents with different efficacy and costs.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Familial hypercholesterolemia", "LDL-C SNP-Score", "Polygenic hyper-cholesterolemia", "Variants of unknown significance (VUS)"], "IndexKeywords": ["Biomarkers", "Cholesterol, LDL", "Gene Expression Profiling", "Genetic Markers", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Genetic Testing", "Heredity", "Humans", "Hyperlipoproteinemia Type II", "Multifactorial Inheritance", "Pedigree", "Phenotype", "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide", "Predictive Value of Tests", "Prognosis", "Risk Assessment", "Risk Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85049329737", "SubjectAreas": [["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"55446094500": {"Name": "Futema M.", "AuthorID": "55446094500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Heart Muscle Disease, Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}, "15768833600": {"Name": "Bourbon M.", "AuthorID": "15768833600", "AffiliationID": "60002769, 60106051", "AffiliationName": "Biosystems & Integrative Sciences Institute \u2013 BioISI, Faculty of Sciences, University of Lisbon"}, "7410005378": {"Name": "Williams M.", "AuthorID": "7410005378", "AffiliationID": "60027676", "AffiliationName": "Bristol Genetics Laboratory, North Bristol NHS Trust"}, "57217317601": {"Name": "Humphries S.E.", "AuthorID": "57217317601", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London, 5 University St"}}}
