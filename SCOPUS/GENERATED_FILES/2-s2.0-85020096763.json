All right reserved.Traditional multipactor prediction method based on plane approximation is fast but inaccurate, which cannot meet the electrical performance design requirements when devices become more and more complex. The finite difference time domain algorithm is one of the most popular methods in the computational electromagnetics. The particle tracing algorithm is a numerical method based on the Newton's force law. The two algorithms can be self-consistently combined by the discrete mesh in both time and space domains, which can be used to predict the multipactor breakdown threshold. In addition, the conformal and parallelizing technologies were well studied. Multipactor breakdown of classic microwave device was analyzed by the developed algorithm. The error is 0.3 dB compared with the experiments and the maximum parallel efficiency is 83%, which demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the algorithm.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Conformal", "Finite difference time domain", "Multipactor", "Parallelization", "Particle tracing"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": null, "EID": "2-s2.0-85020096763", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Aerospace Engineering", "ENGI", "2202"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"55878429100": {"Name": "Zhang J.", "AuthorID": "55878429100", "AffiliationID": "60005244", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Millimeter Waves, Southeast University"}, "55487309400": {"Name": "You J.", "AuthorID": "55487309400", "AffiliationID": "60005244", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Millimeter Waves, Southeast University"}, "55342807700": {"Name": "Cui T.", "AuthorID": "55342807700", "AffiliationID": "60005244", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Millimeter Waves, Southeast University"}, "55688945100": {"Name": "Wang H.", "AuthorID": "55688945100", "AffiliationID": "60018308, 60001604", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory for Physical Electronics and Devices of the Ministry of Education, Xi'an Jiaotong University"}, "54397505100": {"Name": "Li Y.", "AuthorID": "54397505100", "AffiliationID": "60102437", "AffiliationName": "National Key Laboratory of Science and Technology on Space Microwave, China Academy of Space Technology (Xi'an)"}, "8694896700": {"Name": "Cui W.", "AuthorID": "8694896700", "AffiliationID": "60102437", "AffiliationName": "National Key Laboratory of Science and Technology on Space Microwave, China Academy of Space Technology (Xi'an)"}}}
