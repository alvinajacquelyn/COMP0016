In the present study, we propose a methodology for full propagation of uncertainty from clinical data to model results that, unlike deterministic simulation, enables estimation of the confidence associated with model predictions. We illustrate this problem in a virtual stage II single ventricle palliation surgery example. First, probability density functions (PDFs) of right pulmonary artery (PA) flow split ratio and average pulmonary pressure are determined from clinical measurements, complemented by literature data. Starting from a zero-dimensional semi-empirical approximation, Bayesian parameter estimation is used to find the distributions of boundary conditions that produce the expected PA flow split and average pressure PDFs as pre-operative model results. To reduce computational cost, this inverse problem is solved using a Kriging approximant. Second, uncertainties in the boundary conditions are propagated to simulation predictions. Sparse grid stochastic collocation is employed to statistically characterize model predictions of post-operative hemodynamics in models with and without PA stenosis. The results quantify the statistical variability in virtual surgery predictions, allowing for placement of confidence intervals on simulation outputs.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Fontan palliation surgery", "Inverse Bayesian parameter estimation", "Single ventricle congenital heart disease", "Sparse grids", "Uncertainty quantification", "Virtual surgery"], "IndexKeywords": ["Bayesian parameter estimation", "Congenital heart disease", "Sparse grid", "Uncertainty quantifications", "Virtual surgery", "Bayes Theorem", "Blood Flow Velocity", "Cardiovascular Surgical Procedures", "Computer Simulation", "Heart Ventricles", "Hemodynamics", "Humans", "Models, Cardiovascular", "Pressure", "Pulmonary Artery", "Stress, Mechanical", "Uncertainty", "User-Computer Interface"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84959570319", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"], ["Modeling and Simulation", "MATH", "2611"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Computational Theory and Mathematics", "COMP", "1703"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"56024427100": {"Name": "Schiavazzi D.E.", "AuthorID": "56024427100", "AffiliationID": "60030612", "AffiliationName": "Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering Department, University of California at San Diego"}, "7006851741": {"Name": "Marsden A.L.", "AuthorID": "7006851741", "AffiliationID": "60030612", "AffiliationName": "Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering Department, University of California at San Diego"}, "57198875486": {"Name": "Baker C.", "AuthorID": "57198875486", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60018207", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children, UCL Institute of Cardiovascular Science"}, "54883432300": {"Name": "Hsia T.Y.", "AuthorID": "54883432300", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60018207", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children, UCL Institute of Cardiovascular Science"}, "12770860700": {"Name": "Hlavacek A.M.", "AuthorID": "12770860700", "AffiliationID": "60023222", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatrics Medical, University of South Carolina"}, "55481070300": {"Name": "Arbia G.", "AuthorID": "55481070300", "AffiliationID": "60032401, 60001422", "AffiliationName": "INRIA Paris-Rocquencourt and Sorbonne, Universit\u00e9s UPMC Paris 6"}, "13004394100": {"Name": "Vignon-Clementel I.E.", "AuthorID": "13004394100", "AffiliationID": "60032401, 60001422", "AffiliationName": "INRIA Paris-Rocquencourt and Sorbonne, Universit\u00e9s UPMC Paris 6"}, "null": {"Name": null, "AuthorID": null, "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
