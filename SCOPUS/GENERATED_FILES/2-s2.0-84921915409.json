A key question concerns the neurobiological substrates underlying biological motion perception. Although the ventral \"form\" visual cortex is standardly activated by biologically moving stimuli, whether these activations are functionally critical for biological motion perception or are epiphenomenal remains unknown. To address this question, we examined whether focal damage to regions of the ventral visual cortex, resulting in significant deficits in form perception, adversely affects biological motion perception. Six patients with damage to the ventral cortex were tested with sensitive point-light display paradigms. All patients were able to recognize unmasked point-light displays and their perceptual thresholds were not significantly different from those of three different control groups, one of which comprised brain-damaged patients with spared ventral cortex (n > 50). Importantly, these six patients performed significantly better than patients with damage to regions critical for biological motion perception. To assess the necessary contribution of different regions in the ventral pathway to biological motion perception, we complement the behavioral findings with a fine-grained comparison between the lesion location and extent, and the cortical regions standardly implicated in biological motion processing. This analysis revealed that the ventral aspects of the form pathway (e.g., fusiform regions, ventral extrastriate body area) are not critical for biological motion perception. We hypothesize that the role of these ventral regions is to provide enhanced multiview/posture representations of the moving person rather than to represent biological motion perception per se.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Action perception", "EBA", "Point-light displays", "Ventral stream", "Visual form agnosia"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Brain Injuries", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Motion Perception", "Visual Cortex", "Visual Pathways", "Visual Perception"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84921915409", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"6505604248": {"Name": "Gilaie-Dotan S.", "AuthorID": "6505604248", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60084279, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "7202374409": {"Name": "Rees G.", "AuthorID": "7202374409", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60084279, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "6602089152": {"Name": "Saygin A.P.", "AuthorID": "6602089152", "AffiliationID": "60121539, 60030612", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cognitive Science and Neurosciences Program, University of California"}, "55362235900": {"Name": "Lorenzi L.J.", "AuthorID": "55362235900", "AffiliationID": "60027950", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Carnegie Mellon University"}, "7005717481": {"Name": "Behrmann M.", "AuthorID": "7005717481", "AffiliationID": "60027950, 60136673", "AffiliationName": "Center for the Neural Basis of Cognition, Carnegie Mellon University"}}}
