Mutations in genes encoding proteins that localize to the mitotic spindle and centrosomes have been implicated in the pathogenicity of primary microcephaly. In contrast, the contractile ring and midbody required for cytokinesis, the final stage of mitosis, have not previously been implicated by human genetics in the molecular mechanisms of this phenotype. Citron kinase (CIT) is a multi-domain protein that localizes to the cleavage furrow and midbody of mitotic cells, where it is required for the completion of cytokinesis. Rodent models of Cit deficiency highlighted the role of this gene in neurogenesis and microcephaly over a decade ago. Here, we identify recessively inherited pathogenic variants in CIT as the genetic basis of severe microcephaly and neonatal death. We present postmortem data showing that CIT is critical to building a normally sized human brain. Consistent with cytokinesis defects attributed to CIT, multinucleated neurons were observed throughout the cerebral cortex and cerebellum of an affected proband, expanding our understanding of mechanisms attributed to primary microcephaly.", "AuthorKeywords": ["autosomal recessive", "citron kinase", "cytokinesis", "lissencephaly", "neurogenesis", "primary microcephaly", "splicing mutation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cerebellum", "Child", "Female", "Genes, Recessive", "Humans", "Infant", "Infant, Newborn", "Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins", "Male", "Microcephaly", "Neocortex", "Neurons", "Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases", "RNA Splicing"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84994112389", "SubjectAreas": [["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Genetics (clinical)", "MEDI", "2716"]], "AuthorData": {"7102046467": {"Name": "Harding B.N.", "AuthorID": "7102046467", "AffiliationID": "60030118, 60006297, 60003711", "AffiliationName": "Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania and Children's Hospital of Philadelphia"}, "57191848609": {"Name": "Moccia A.", "AuthorID": "57191848609", "AffiliationID": "60033182", "AffiliationName": "Department of Human Genetics, University of Michigan Medical School"}, "8758194700": {"Name": "Bielas S.L.", "AuthorID": "8758194700", "AffiliationID": "60033182", "AffiliationName": "Department of Human Genetics, University of Michigan Medical School"}, "6602316620": {"Name": "Drunat S.", "AuthorID": "6602316620", "AffiliationID": "60011675, 60000905", "AffiliationName": "INSERM U1141, H\u00f4pital Robert Debr\u00e9"}, "7102892249": {"Name": "Verloes A.", "AuthorID": "7102892249", "AffiliationID": "60011675, 60000905", "AffiliationName": "INSERM U1141, H\u00f4pital Robert Debr\u00e9"}, "18233807600": {"Name": "Passemard S.", "AuthorID": "18233807600", "AffiliationID": "60123796, 60011675", "AffiliationName": "Universit\u00e9 Paris Diderot, H\u00f4pital Robert Debr\u00e9"}, "57203054731": {"Name": "Gressens P.", "AuthorID": "57203054731", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Center for Developing Brain, King's College, St. Thomas\u2019 Campus"}, "6602516624": {"Name": "El Ghouzzi V.", "AuthorID": "6602516624", "AffiliationID": "60011675, 60000905", "AffiliationName": "INSERM U1141, H\u00f4pital Robert Debr\u00e9"}, "57128661400": {"Name": "Soukarieh O.", "AuthorID": "57128661400", "AffiliationID": "60190682, 60138806, 60000905, 60032922", "AffiliationName": "INSERM U1079, Institute for Research and Innovation in Biomedicine, University of Rouen, Normandy Centre for Genomic and Personalized Medicine"}, "57191845966": {"Name": "Tubeuf H.", "AuthorID": "57191845966", "AffiliationID": "110985973", "AffiliationName": "Interactive Biosoftware"}, "7203013542": {"Name": "Martins A.", "AuthorID": "7203013542", "AffiliationID": "110985973", "AffiliationName": "Interactive Biosoftware"}, "7006741537": {"Name": "Chitty L.S.", "AuthorID": "7006741537", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60018207", "AffiliationName": "Genetics and Genomic Medicine, UCL Institute of Child Health and Great Ormond Street NHS Foundation Trust"}, "24490768000": {"Name": "Joriot S.", "AuthorID": "24490768000", "AffiliationID": "60017724", "AffiliationName": "Service de Neurop\u00e9diatrie, Centre Hospitalier R\u00e9gional Universitaire de Lille"}, "6603047526": {"Name": "Di Cunto F.", "AuthorID": "6603047526", "AffiliationID": "60012259", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Biotechnology and Health Sciences, University of Turin"}}}
