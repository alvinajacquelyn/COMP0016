Yet, to improve and apply models of argument, we need methods for acquiring them. Current approaches include argument mining from text, hand coding of arguments by researchers, or generating arguments from knowledge bases. In this paper, we propose a new approach, which we call argument harvesting, that uses a chatbot to enter into a dialogue with a participant to get arguments and counterarguments from him or her. Because it is automated, the chatbot can be used repeatedly in many dialogues, and thereby it can generate a large corpus. We describe the architecture of the chatbot, provide methods for clustering arguments by their similarity and value, and an evaluation of our approach in a case study concerning attitudes of women to participation in sport.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Argument harvesting", "Behaviour change", "Chatbots", "Value-based argumentation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Behaviour changes", "Chatbot", "Chatbots", "Hand coding", "Knowledge basis", "Large corpora", "New approaches", "Value-based argumentations"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": null, "EID": "2-s2.0-85053899298", "SubjectAreas": [["Artificial Intelligence", "COMP", "1702"]], "AuthorData": {"57194688681": {"Name": "Chalaguine L.", "AuthorID": "57194688681", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "7402779550": {"Name": "Hunter A.", "AuthorID": "7402779550", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "26657997700": {"Name": "Hamilton F.", "AuthorID": "26657997700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "eHealth Unit, University College London"}, "12783188400": {"Name": "Potts H.", "AuthorID": "12783188400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Health Informatics, University College London"}}}
