Hb Peterborough [\u03b2111(G13)Val\u2192Phe; HBB: c.334G>T] is a rare unstable Hb variant, predominantly found in individuals of Italian descent, due to a structural defect involving a single amino acid substitution (phenylalanine for valine at position 111 of the \u03b2-globin chain). Unstable Hb variants are often inherited in the heterozygous state with Hb A (\u03b12\u03b22) and rarely in compound heterozygosity with other Hb variants. The presence of another variant Hb often alters the phenotype, occasionally resulting in more severe disease. Using a combination of molecular techniques; multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) and Sanger sequencing, we identified a compound heterozygosity for Hb Peterborough and Hb Lepore-Boston-Washington (Hb LBW) [\u03b487, \u03b2116; NG_000007.3: g.63632_71046del] in a middle-aged gentleman with a history of chronic microcytic anemia and splenomegaly, presenting with severe drug-induced hemolysis, which was managed conservatively. The clinical history and presentation reflect the dual pathology due to the presence of two variant Hbs and their associated phenotypes. In this article, we discuss the phenotype resulting from the interaction of Hb Peterborough and Hb LBW and emphasize the importance of molecular testing in the diagnosis of rare Hb variants.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Hb Lepore-Boston-Washington (Hb LBW)", "Hb Peterborough", "Hemoglobinopathy", "hemolysis", "unstable hemoglobin (Hb)"], "IndexKeywords": ["Alleles", "Amino Acid Substitution", "Anemia, Hemolytic", "Anti-Bacterial Agents", "beta-Globins", "Disease Susceptibility", "DNA Mutational Analysis", "Hemoglobinopathies", "Hemoglobins, Abnormal", "Hemolysis", "Heterozygote", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Mutation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85065515764", "SubjectAreas": [["Hematology", "MEDI", "2720"], ["Clinical Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1308"], ["Genetics (clinical)", "MEDI", "2716"], ["Biochemistry (medical)", "MEDI", "2704"]], "AuthorData": {"57208682121": {"Name": "Agbuduwe C.", "AuthorID": "57208682121", "AffiliationID": "60170290", "AffiliationName": "Peterborough City Hospital, North West Anglia National Health Service (NHS) Foundation Trust"}, "57208684810": {"Name": "Asba N.", "AuthorID": "57208684810", "AffiliationID": "60170290", "AffiliationName": "Peterborough City Hospital, North West Anglia National Health Service (NHS) Foundation Trust"}, "7005082962": {"Name": "Sivakumaran M.", "AuthorID": "7005082962", "AffiliationID": "60170290", "AffiliationName": "Peterborough City Hospital, North West Anglia National Health Service (NHS) Foundation Trust"}, "12787698400": {"Name": "Rugless M.", "AuthorID": "12787698400", "AffiliationID": "60008323, 60170323", "AffiliationName": "National Hemoglobinopathy Reference Laboratory, Oxford University NHS Foundation Trust, Level 4, John Radcliffe Hospital"}, "56091411800": {"Name": "Proven M.", "AuthorID": "56091411800", "AffiliationID": "60008323, 60170323", "AffiliationName": "National Hemoglobinopathy Reference Laboratory, Oxford University NHS Foundation Trust, Level 4, John Radcliffe Hospital"}}}
