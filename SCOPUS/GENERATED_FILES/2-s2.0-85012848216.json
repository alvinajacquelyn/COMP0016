CT prevails in acute neurologic presentations, including traumatic brain injury (TBI), nontraumatic coma, stroke, and status epilepticus, because of easy availability, with images of diagnostic quality, e.g., to exclude hemorrhage, usually completed quickly enough to avoid sedation. Concerns over the risks of ionizing radiation mean re-imaging and higher-dose procedures, e.g., arteriography and venography, require justification. T1/T2-weighted imaging (T1/T2-WI) MR with additional sequences (arteriography, venography, T2*, spectroscopy, diffusion tensor, perfusion, diffusion- (DWI) and susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI)) often clarifies the diagnosis, which may alter management in acute settings, as well as chronic conditions, e.g., epilepsy. Clinical acumen remains essential to avoid imaging, e.g., in genetic epilepsies or migrainous headaches responding to treatment, or to target sequences to specific diagnosis, e.g., T1/T2-WI for shunt dysfunction (with SWI for TBI); DWI, arteriography including neck vessels, and venography for acute hemiplegia or coma; coronal temporal cuts for partial epilepsy; or muscle imaging for motor delay. The risk of general anesthesia is low; \u201chead-only\u201d scanners may allow rapid MRI without sedation. Timely and accurate reporting, with discrepancy discussion between expert neuroradiologists, is important for management of the child and the family's expectations.", "AuthorKeywords": ["encephalitis", "epilepsy", "headache", "meningitis", "metabolic conditions", "movement disorders", "neurodegeneration", "status epilepticus", "stroke", "traumatic brain injury"], "IndexKeywords": ["Brain Diseases", "Child", "Humans", "Image Processing, Computer-Assisted", "Neuroimaging", "Pediatrics"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85012848216", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"26643012600": {"Name": "Kirkham F.", "AuthorID": "26643012600", "AffiliationID": "60025225, 60012662", "AffiliationName": "Neurosciences Unit, UCL Institute of Child Health, London; Southampton Children's Hospital and Clinical and Experimental Sciences, University of Southampton"}}}
