We report the experiences of visually impaired (VI) children and young people aged 10-15 years about growing up with impaired sight. Methods: The participants were 32 VI children and young people, aged 10-15 years [visual acuity logarithm of minimum angle of resolution (LogMAR) worse than 0.51] recruited through National Health Service (NHS) paediatric ophthalmology and developmental vision clinics and 11 VI pupils aged 12-17 attending a specialist school for pupils with disabilities. Individual semi-structured interviews with participants captured their experiences of living with a visual impairment. A child-centred interview topic guide was developed from a literature review, observations at ophthalmology clinics, consultation with health and education professionals working with VI children and young people, and interviews and a focus group with VI pupils from the specialist school. Collaborative qualitative thematic analysis by three researchers identified emergent themes. NVivo software was used for coding the data. Results: Analysis identified six themes concerning living with a visual impairment: (i) social relationships, participation and acceptance; (ii) independence and autonomy; (iii) psychological and emotional well-being; (iv) aspirations and concerns about the future; (v) functioning - home, school and leisure; and (vi) treatment of eye condition. Key issues included: the importance of family and peer support; balancing independence, support and safety; the emotional burden and adjustment of living with a disability; concerns about education and job prospects in the future; functional restrictions and limitations; and ongoing management of the eye condition. Conclusions: The findings offer insights into the complex realities of living with visual impairment. They provide the basis for development of patient-reported outcome measures. They can also serve to help enrich the understanding of health professionals working with VI children and young people, potentially enabling them to better support them.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Childhood disability", "Children's views", "Interviews", "Paediatric ophthalmology", "Quality of life", "Visual impairment"], "IndexKeywords": ["Activities of Daily Living", "Adolescent", "Age of Onset", "Attitude to Health", "Child", "Disabled Children", "Female", "Humans", "Independent Living", "Interpersonal Relations", "London", "Male", "Personal Autonomy", "Vision Disorders", "Visual Acuity"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84922604381", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"24077258100": {"Name": "Tadi\u0107 V.", "AuthorID": "24077258100", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Population, Policy and Practice Programme, Lifecourse Epidemiology and Biostatistics Section, UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "57191956020": {"Name": "Rahi J.", "AuthorID": "57191956020", "AffiliationID": "107151049", "AffiliationName": "Ulverscroft Vision Research Group"}, "56514038300": {"Name": "Hundt L.", "AuthorID": "56514038300", "AffiliationID": "60000064, 60022020", "AffiliationName": "Warwick Medical School, University of Warwick"}, "35848646200": {"Name": "Keeley S.", "AuthorID": "35848646200", "AffiliationID": "60000064, 60022020", "AffiliationName": "Warwick Medical School, University of Warwick"}}}
