Dis.", "Volume": "17", "Issue": 1, "Art.No": null, "PageStart": null, "PageEnd": null, "CitedBy": 2, "DOI": "10.1186/s12879-017-2661-9", "Link": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85027498839&origin=inward", "Abstract": "\u00a9 2017 The Author(s).Background: Reduction of accidental contamination of the near-patient environment has potential to reduce acquisition of healthcare-associated infection(s). Although medical gloves should be removed when soiled or touching the environment, compliance is variable. The use of antimicrobial-impregnated medical gloves could reduce the horizontal-transfer of bacterial contamination between surfaces. Aim: Determine the activity of antimicrobial-impregnated gloves against common hospital pathogens: Streptococcus pyogenes, carbapenem-resistant E.coli (CREC), MRSA and ESBL-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae. Methods: Fingerpads (~1cm2) of PHMB-treated and untreated gloves were inoculated with 10\u03bcL (~104 colony-forming-units [cfu]) of test-bacteria prepared in heavy-soiling (0.5%BSA), blood or distilled-water (no-soiling) and sampled after 0.25, 1, 10 or 15min contact-time. Donor surfaces (~1cm2 computer-keys) contaminated with wet/dry inoculum were touched with the fingerpad of treated/untreated gloves and subsequently pressed onto recipient (uncontaminated) computer-keys. Results: Approximately 4.50log10cfu of all bacteria persisted after 15min on untreated gloves regardless of soil-type. In the absence of soiling, PHMB-treated gloves reduced surface-contamination by ~4.5log10cfu (>99.99%) within 10min of contact-time but only ~2.5log10 (>99.9%) and ~1.0log10 reduction respectively when heavy-soiling or blood was present. Gloves became highly-contaminated (~4.52log10-4.91log10cfu) when handling recently-contaminated computer-keys. Untreated gloves contaminated \"recipient\" surfaces (~4.5log10cfu) while PHMB-treated gloves transferred fewer bacteria (2.4-3.6log10cfu). When surface contamination was dry, PHMB gloves transferred fewer bacteria (0.3-0.6log10cfu) to \"recipient\" surfaces than untreated gloves (1.0-1.9log10; P<0.05). Conclusions: Antimicrobial-impregnated gloves may be useful in preventing dissemination of organisms in the near-patient environment during routine care. However they are not a substitute for appropriate hand-hygiene procedures.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Gloves", "Hand hygiene", "PHMB"], "IndexKeywords": ["Biguanides", "Carbapenems", "Cross Infection", "Disease Transmission, Infectious", "Disinfectants", "Drug Resistance, Bacterial", "Escherichia coli", "Gloves, Protective", "Humans", "Infection Control", "Klebsiella pneumoniae", "Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus", "Streptococcus pyogenes"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85027498839", "SubjectAreas": [["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"7403093673": {"Name": "Ali S.", "AuthorID": "7403093673", "AffiliationID": "60027403, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "University College Hospital, EGA Wing, UCLH Environmental Research Laboratory"}, "35463228600": {"Name": "Wilson A.P.R.", "AuthorID": "35463228600", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Clinical Microbiology and Virology"}}}
