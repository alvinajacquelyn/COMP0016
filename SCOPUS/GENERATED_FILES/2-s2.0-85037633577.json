The effect is important because it spotlights a process dissociation between metacognitive judgments about memory and memory performance itself. Previous research has proposed a fluency theory to account for this effect, but this theory has been contradicted by a recent study which found no difference in response times (RTs) \u2013 and hence fluency \u2013 in a lexical decision task between large and small words (Mueller, Dunlosky, Tauber, & Rhodes, 2014). In the current research, we further tested the fluency theory by employing a continuous identification (CID) task in Experiment 1 and by explicitly comparing the CID and lexical decision tasks in Experiment 2. We show that lexical decision is an inappropriate instrument for measuring differences in perceptual fluency. The CID task, in contrast, provides direct evidence that the stimulus size effect on JOLs is substantially mediated by perceptual fluency. Experiment 3 found that fluency is at least as important as beliefs about font size in contributing to the font size effect on JOLs.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Continuous identification task", "Font size effect", "JOLs", "Perceptual fluency", "Stimulus size"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85037633577", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuropsychology and Physiological Psychology", "PSYC", "3206"], ["Language and Linguistics", "ARTS", "1203"], ["Experimental and Cognitive Psychology", "PSYC", "3205"], ["Linguistics and Language", "SOCI", "3310"], ["Artificial Intelligence", "COMP", "1702"]], "AuthorData": {"57193006516": {"Name": "Yang C.", "AuthorID": "57193006516", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "57199150138": {"Name": "Huang T.", "AuthorID": "57199150138", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "7005569087": {"Name": "Shanks D.", "AuthorID": "7005569087", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
