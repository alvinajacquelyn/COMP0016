The Authors.Planetary magnetospheres receive plasma and energy from the Sun or moons of planets and consequently stretch magnetic field lines. The process may last for varied timescales at different planets. From time to time, energy is rapidly released in the magnetosphere and subsequently precipitated into the ionosphere and upper atmosphere. Usually, this energy dissipation is associated with magnetic dipolarization in the magnetosphere.This process is accompanied by plasma acceleration and field-aligned current formation, and subsequently auroral emissions are often significantly enhanced. Using measurements from multiple instruments on board the Cassini spacecraft, we reveal that magnetic dipolarization events at Saturn could reoccur after one planetary rotation and name them as recurrent dipolarizations. Three events are presented, including one from the dayside magnetosphere, which has no known precedent with terrestrial magnetospheric observations. During these events, recurrent energizations of plasma (electrons or ions) were also detected, which clearly demonstrate that these processes shall not be simply attributed to modulation of planetary periodic oscillation, although we do not exclude the possibility that the planetary periodic oscillation may modulate other processes (e.g., magnetic reconnection) which energizes particles. We discuss the potential physical mechanisms for generating the recurrent dipolarization process in a comprehensive view, including aurora and energetic neutral atom emissions.", "AuthorKeywords": ["aurora", "Cassini", "dipolarization", "field-aligned current", "magnetosphere", "Saturn"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85055677035", "SubjectAreas": [["Geophysics", "EART", "1908"], ["Forestry", "AGRI", "1107"], ["Oceanography", "EART", "1910"], ["Aquatic Science", "AGRI", "1104"], ["Ecology", "ENVI", "2303"], ["Water Science and Technology", "ENVI", "2312"], ["Soil Science", "AGRI", "1111"], ["Geochemistry and Petrology", "EART", "1906"], ["Earth-Surface Processes", "EART", "1904"], ["Atmospheric Science", "EART", "1902"], ["Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)", "EART", "1901"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"], ["Paleontology", "EART", "1911"]], "AuthorData": {"57197843335": {"Name": "Yao Z.H.", "AuthorID": "57197843335", "AffiliationID": "60000964", "AffiliationName": "Laboratoire de Physique Atmosph\u00e9rique et Plan\u00e9taire, Space sciences, Technologies and Astrophysics Research Institute, Universit\u00e9 de Li\u00e8ge"}, "14048953800": {"Name": "Radioti A.", "AuthorID": "14048953800", "AffiliationID": "60000964", "AffiliationName": "Laboratoire de Physique Atmosph\u00e9rique et Plan\u00e9taire, Space sciences, Technologies and Astrophysics Research Institute, Universit\u00e9 de Li\u00e8ge"}, "8286503700": {"Name": "Grodent D.", "AuthorID": "8286503700", "AffiliationID": "60000964", "AffiliationName": "Laboratoire de Physique Atmosph\u00e9rique et Plan\u00e9taire, Space sciences, Technologies and Astrophysics Research Institute, Universit\u00e9 de Li\u00e8ge"}, "56466085200": {"Name": "Palmaerts B.", "AuthorID": "56466085200", "AffiliationID": "60000964", "AffiliationName": "Laboratoire de Physique Atmosph\u00e9rique et Plan\u00e9taire, Space sciences, Technologies and Astrophysics Research Institute, Universit\u00e9 de Li\u00e8ge"}, "57216608170": {"Name": "G\u00e9rard J.C.", "AuthorID": "57216608170", "AffiliationID": "60000964", "AffiliationName": "Laboratoire de Physique Atmosph\u00e9rique et Plan\u00e9taire, Space sciences, Technologies and Astrophysics Research Institute, Universit\u00e9 de Li\u00e8ge"}, "26022604500": {"Name": "Ray L.C.", "AuthorID": "26022604500", "AffiliationID": "60023643", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Lancaster University"}, "8220350900": {"Name": "Arridge C.S.", "AuthorID": "8220350900", "AffiliationID": "60023643", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Lancaster University"}, "6507327562": {"Name": "Badman S.V.", "AuthorID": "6507327562", "AffiliationID": "60023643", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Lancaster University"}, "55926094700": {"Name": "Sergis N.", "AuthorID": "55926094700", "AffiliationID": "60011619", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Astronomy, Astrophysics, Space Applications and Remote Sensing, National Observatory of Athens"}, "15831262300": {"Name": "Dialynas K.", "AuthorID": "15831262300", "AffiliationID": "60003185", "AffiliationName": "Office of Space Research and Technology, Academy of Athens"}, "7103145751": {"Name": "Coates A.J.", "AuthorID": "7103145751", "AffiliationID": "60084281", "AffiliationName": "UCL Mullard Space Science Laboratory"}, "22134695900": {"Name": "Krupp N.", "AuthorID": "22134695900", "AffiliationID": "60084281", "AffiliationName": "UCL Mullard Space Science Laboratory"}, "16064559500": {"Name": "Roussos E.", "AuthorID": "16064559500", "AffiliationID": "60017695", "AffiliationName": "Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research"}, "35239051400": {"Name": "Ye S.Y.", "AuthorID": "35239051400", "AffiliationID": "60024324", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Iowa"}, "6603141904": {"Name": "Delamere P.A.", "AuthorID": "6603141904", "AffiliationID": "60011976", "AffiliationName": "Geophysical Institute, University of Alaska Fairbanks"}, "55317746800": {"Name": "Guo R.L.", "AuthorID": "55317746800", "AffiliationID": "60019499, 60109828", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Geology and Geophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "7006788329": {"Name": "Pu Z.Y.", "AuthorID": "7006788329", "AffiliationID": "60014966", "AffiliationName": "School of Earth and Space Sciences, Peking University"}, "57193414534": {"Name": "Waite J.H.", "AuthorID": "57193414534", "AffiliationID": "60011533", "AffiliationName": "Southwest Research Institute"}, "57203296630": {"Name": "Mitchell D.G.", "AuthorID": "57203296630", "AffiliationID": "60022054", "AffiliationName": "The Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory"}, "7103132533": {"Name": "Dougherty M.K.", "AuthorID": "7103132533", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Natural Sciences, Department of Physics, Imperial College London"}}}
