These consist of antibody-derived antigen-binding regions linked to T cell signalling elements. CD19 is an ideal target because it is expressed on most B cell malignancies as well as normal B cells but not on other cell types, restricting any 'on target, off tumour' toxicity to B cell depletion. Recent clinical studies involving CD19 CAR-directed T cells have shown unprecedented responses in a range of B cell malignancies, even in patients with chemorefractory relapse. Durable responses have been achieved, although the persistence of modified T cells may be limited. This therapy is not without toxicity, however. Cytokine release syndrome and neurotoxicity appear to be frequent but are treatable and reversible. CAR T cell therapy holds the promise of a tailored cellular therapy, which can form memory and be adapted to the tumour microenvironment. This review will provide a perspective on the currently available data, as well as on future developments in the field.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cellular therapies", "Gene transfer", "Immunotherapy", "T lymphocytes"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Antigens, CD19", "B-Lymphocytes", "Gene Transfer Techniques", "Hematologic Neoplasms", "Humans", "Lymphocyte Depletion", "Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell", "Recombinant Fusion Proteins", "T-Lymphocytes", "Tumor Microenvironment"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84928413721", "SubjectAreas": [["Hematology", "MEDI", "2720"]], "AuthorData": {"23987460500": {"Name": "Ghorashian S.", "AuthorID": "23987460500", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Molecular and Cellular Immunology Unit, Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "6602889677": {"Name": "Amrolia P.", "AuthorID": "6602889677", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children National Health Service Trust"}, "57211009223": {"Name": "Pule M.", "AuthorID": "57211009223", "AffiliationID": "60027403", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, University College Hospitals NHS Trust"}}}
