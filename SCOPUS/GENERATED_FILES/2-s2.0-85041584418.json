The study\u2019s aim was to improve the load factor of the participating households. This has the potential to improve the attractiveness of DH and accelerate the roll out of DH networks. Capital costs are lowered by reducing required boiler capacity and pipework sizes. Operational costs are reduced by increasing the coverage of the primary plant and reducing heat losses and pumping energy. The interventions were found to increase the load factor of the participating homes from 0.29 to 0.44. This led to an increased energy demand of approximately 3%; however, the estimated network cost savings exceed this amount. While some participants noted the altered operation of their heating systems and expressed concern, the majority indicated they would be willing to participate in a commercial scheme for a small financial reward. In addition to specific insights for the deployment of demand shifting on DH networks, the results provide general lessons for the utilization of building thermal inertia for demand shifting.", "AuthorKeywords": ["behaviours", "buildings", "control systems", "demand-side response", "district heating", "energy demand", "energy efficiency", "occupant behaviour", "smart grids"], "IndexKeywords": ["behaviours", "Demand side response", "Energy demands", "Occupant behaviour", "Smart grid"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85041584418", "SubjectAreas": [["Civil and Structural Engineering", "ENGI", "2205"], ["Building and Construction", "ENGI", "2215"]], "AuthorData": {"56118125800": {"Name": "Sweetnam T.", "AuthorID": "56118125800", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Energy Institute, University College London"}, "26039534700": {"Name": "Spataru C.", "AuthorID": "26039534700", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Energy Institute, University College London"}, "12803419900": {"Name": "Barrett M.", "AuthorID": "12803419900", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Energy Institute, University College London"}, "57200544090": {"Name": "Carter E.", "AuthorID": "57200544090", "AffiliationID": "112371785", "AffiliationName": "PassivSystems Ltd, Newbury"}}}
