Published by Oxford University Press for the Infectious Diseases Society of America.A proportion of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients develop persistent, stigmatizing human papillomavirus (HPV)-related cutaneous and genital warts and anogenital (pre)cancer. This is the first study to investigate immunogenetic variations that might account for HPV susceptibility and the largest to date to categorize the HPV types associated with cutaneous warts in HIV-positive patients. The HLA class I and II allele distribution was analyzed in 49 antiretroviral (ART)-treated HIVpositive patients with persistent warts, 42 noninfected controls, and 46 HIV-positive controls. The allele HLA-B\u221744 was more frequently identified in HIV-positive patients with warts (P = .004); a susceptible haplotype (HLA-B\u221744, HLA-C\u221705; P = .001) and protective genes (HLA-DQB1\u221706; P = .03) may also contribute. Cutaneous wart biopsy specimens from HIV-positive patients harbored common wart types HPV27/57, the unusual wart type HPV7, and an excess of Betapapillomavirus types (P = .002), compared with wart specimens from noninfected controls. These findings suggest that HLA testing might assist in stratifying those patients in whom vaccination should be recommended.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cutaneous warts", "Genital warts", "HIV", "HLA", "HPV", "Human immunodeficiency virus", "Human leukocyte antigen", "Human papillomavirus", "Immunogenetics", "Warts"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Anti-HIV Agents", "Chronic Disease", "Histocompatibility Testing", "HIV Infections", "HLA Antigens", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Papillomaviridae", "Papillomavirus Infections", "Warts"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84978630892", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"35334802000": {"Name": "Meys R.", "AuthorID": "35334802000", "AffiliationID": "60002484, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Dermatology, Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, Imperial College"}, "7102435767": {"Name": "Bunker C.B.", "AuthorID": "7102435767", "AffiliationID": "60002484, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Dermatology, Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, Imperial College"}, "34975083200": {"Name": "Gotch F.M.", "AuthorID": "34975083200", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Department of Immunology"}, "57192658947": {"Name": "Asboe D.", "AuthorID": "57192658947", "AffiliationID": "60002484", "AffiliationName": "Department of HIV Medicine and Sexual Health, Chelsea and Westminster Hospital"}, "7202029505": {"Name": "Hawkins D.", "AuthorID": "7202029505", "AffiliationID": "60002484", "AffiliationName": "Department of HIV Medicine and Sexual Health, Chelsea and Westminster Hospital"}, "7006658003": {"Name": "Francis N.", "AuthorID": "7006658003", "AffiliationID": "60012558, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Histopathology, Charing Cross Hospital, Imperial College London"}, "6603405131": {"Name": "Purdie K.J.", "AuthorID": "6603405131", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cutaneous Research, Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London"}, "7102980450": {"Name": "Harwood C.A.", "AuthorID": "7102980450", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cutaneous Research, Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London"}, "55424287200": {"Name": "Little A.M.", "AuthorID": "55424287200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Institute, University College London"}, "7202513855": {"Name": "Baker F.", "AuthorID": "7202513855", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Anthony Nolan Research Institute, Royal Free Hospital"}, "55942654100": {"Name": "Marsh S.G.E.", "AuthorID": "55942654100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Institute, University College London"}, "16302887900": {"Name": "De Koning M.N.C.", "AuthorID": "16302887900", "AffiliationID": "112766833", "AffiliationName": "DDL Diagnostic Laboratory"}, "23010200400": {"Name": "Quint K.D.", "AuthorID": "23010200400", "AffiliationID": "60015618", "AffiliationName": "Department of Dermatology, Leiden University Medical Centre"}}}
