They are commonly studied in hippocampal brain slices in vitro, where they can be evoked via pharmacological activation of various receptor families. One limitation of this approach is that neuronal activity is studied in a highly artificial extracellular fluid environment, as provided by artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF). Here, we examine the influence of human cerebrospinal fluid (hCSF) on kainate-evoked and spontaneous gamma oscillations in mouse hippocampus. We show that hCSF, as compared to aCSF of matched electrolyte and glucose composition, increases the power of kainate-evoked gamma oscillations and induces spontaneous gamma activity in areas CA3 and CA1 that is reversed by washout. Bath application of atropine entirely abolished hCSF-induced gamma oscillations, indicating critical contribution from muscarinic acetylcholine receptor-mediated signaling. In separate whole-cell patch clamp recordings from rat hippocampus, hCSF increased theta resonance frequency and strength in pyramidal cells along with enhancement of h-current (Ih) amplitude. We found no evidence of intrinsic gamma frequency resonance at baseline (aCSF) among fast-spiking interneurons, and this was not altered by hCSF. However, hCSF increased the excitability of fast-spiking interneurons, which likely contributed to gamma rhythmogenesis. Our findings show that hCSF promotes network gamma oscillations in the hippocampus in vitro and suggest that neuromodulators distributed in CSF could have significant influence on neuronal network activity in vivo.", "AuthorKeywords": ["CSF", "fast-spiking interneuron", "hippocampal brain slice", "neuromodulation", "pyramidal cell"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85069940753", "SubjectAreas": [["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"]], "AuthorData": {"56004647800": {"Name": "Bjorefeldt A.", "AuthorID": "56004647800", "AffiliationID": "60011460", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Brown University"}, "57208178254": {"Name": "Forsberg M.", "AuthorID": "57208178254", "AffiliationID": "60016437", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physiology, Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, University of Gothenburg"}, "6701735143": {"Name": "Hanse E.", "AuthorID": "6701735143", "AffiliationID": "60016437", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physiology, Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, University of Gothenburg"}, "57199328134": {"Name": "Roshan F.", "AuthorID": "57199328134", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Neuronal Oscillations Laboratory, Center for Alzheimer Research, Department of Neurobiology, Care Sciences and Society, Karolinska Institutet"}, "6603307950": {"Name": "Fisahn A.", "AuthorID": "6603307950", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Neuronal Oscillations Laboratory, Center for Alzheimer Research, Department of Neurobiology, Care Sciences and Society, Karolinska Institutet"}, "6701454676": {"Name": "Zetterberg H.", "AuthorID": "6701454676", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UK Dementia Research Institute at UCL"}}}
