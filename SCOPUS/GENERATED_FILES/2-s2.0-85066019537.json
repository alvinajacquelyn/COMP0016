It is unavailable in public hospitals in India due to limited resources. Our objective was to develop a scalable model of CR for India based on yoga, which could also appeal to some groups with low uptake of CR (e.g., ethnic minorities, women, and older people) globally. The intervention was developed using a structured process. A literature review and consultations with yoga experts, CR experts, and postmyocardial infarction patients were conducted to systematically identify and shortlist appropriate yoga exercises and postures, breathing exercises, meditation and relaxation practices, and lifestyle changes, which were incorporated into a conventional CR framework. The draft intervention was further refined based on the feedback from an internal stakeholder group and an external panel of international experts, before being piloted with yoga instructors and patients with myocardial infarction. A four-phase yoga-based CR (Yoga-CaRe) programme was developed for delivery by a single yoga instructor with basic training. The programme consists of a total of 13 instructor-led sessions (2 individual and 11 group) over a 3-month period. Group sessions include guided practice of yoga exercises and postures, breathing exercises, and meditation and relaxation practices, and support for the lifestyle change and coping through a moderated discussion. Patients are encouraged to self-practice daily at home and continue long-term with the help of a booklet and digital video disc (DVD). Family members/carers are encouraged to join throughout. In conclusion, a novel yoga-based CR programme has been developed, which promises to provide a scalable CR solution for India and an alternative choice for CR globally. It is currently being evaluated in a large multicentre randomised controlled trial across India.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85066019537", "SubjectAreas": [["Complementary and Alternative Medicine", "MEDI", "2707"]], "AuthorData": {"56583665300": {"Name": "Chattopadhyay K.", "AuthorID": "56583665300", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "56500020000": {"Name": "Ebrahim S.", "AuthorID": "56500020000", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "35231017100": {"Name": "Pocock S.", "AuthorID": "35231017100", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "7004283783": {"Name": "Prabhakaran D.", "AuthorID": "7004283783", "AffiliationID": "60139048", "AffiliationName": "Public Health Foundation of India"}, "6603836017": {"Name": "Kinra S.", "AuthorID": "6603836017", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "57204760401": {"Name": "Chandrasekaran A.M.", "AuthorID": "57204760401", "AffiliationID": "113042269", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Chronic Disease Control"}, "55345984100": {"Name": "Praveen P.A.", "AuthorID": "55345984100", "AffiliationID": "60009790", "AffiliationName": "All India Institute of Medical Sciences"}, "24385268500": {"Name": "Ajay V.S.", "AuthorID": "24385268500", "AffiliationID": "113042269", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Chronic Disease Control"}, "56506007300": {"Name": "Singh K.", "AuthorID": "56506007300", "AffiliationID": "60139048", "AffiliationName": "Public Health Foundation of India"}, "7101833756": {"Name": "Tandon N.", "AuthorID": "7101833756", "AffiliationID": "60009790", "AffiliationName": "All India Institute of Medical Sciences"}, "55395747400": {"Name": "Manchanda S.C.", "AuthorID": "55395747400", "AffiliationID": "60024218", "AffiliationName": "Sir Ganga Ram Hospital"}, "55796759000": {"Name": "Madan K.", "AuthorID": "55796759000", "AffiliationID": "60024218", "AffiliationName": "Sir Ganga Ram Hospital"}, "35417788900": {"Name": "Reddy K.S.", "AuthorID": "35417788900", "AffiliationID": "60139048", "AffiliationName": "Public Health Foundation of India"}, "8878251700": {"Name": "Tillin T.", "AuthorID": "8878251700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "7401765648": {"Name": "Hughes A.D.", "AuthorID": "7401765648", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Imperial College London"}, "35412645300": {"Name": "Chaturvedi N.", "AuthorID": "35412645300", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Imperial College London"}}}
