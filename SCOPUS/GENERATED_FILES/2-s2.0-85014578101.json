This paper presents a monitoring study of overheating in 122 London dwellings during the summers of 2009 and 2010. Dry Bulb Temperature and Relative Humidity in the main living and sleeping area were monitored at 10 min intervals. The ASHRAE Standard 55 adaptive thermal comfort method was applied, which uses outdoor temperature to derive the optimum indoor comfort temperature. It was found that 29% of all living rooms and 31% of all bedrooms monitored during 2009 had more than 1% of summertime occupied hours outside the comfort zone recommended by the standard to achieve 90% acceptability. In 2010, 37% of monitored living rooms and 49% of monitored bedrooms had more than 1% of summertime occupied hours outside this comfort zone. The findings of this study indicate that London dwellings face a significant risk of overheating under the current climate. Occupant exposure to excess indoor temperatures is likely to be exacerbated in the future if climate change adaptation strategies are not incorporated in Building Regulations, building design and retrofit.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Climate change", "Dwellings", "Housing", "Monitoring", "Overheating", "Temperature"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adaptive thermal comfort", "Climate change adaptation", "Climate change projections", "Domestic environments", "Dry bulb temperature", "Dwellings", "Indoor comfort temperatures", "Overheating"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85014578101", "SubjectAreas": [["Civil and Structural Engineering", "ENGI", "2205"], ["Building and Construction", "ENGI", "2215"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"56518383400": {"Name": "Pathan A.", "AuthorID": "56518383400", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute for Environmental Design and Engineering (IEDE), The Bartlett School of Environment, Energy and Resources (BSEER), The Bartlett Faculty of the Built Environment, University College London (UCL)"}, "35077188000": {"Name": "Mavrogianni A.", "AuthorID": "35077188000", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute for Environmental Design and Engineering (IEDE), The Bartlett School of Environment, Energy and Resources (BSEER), The Bartlett Faculty of the Built Environment, University College London (UCL)"}, "57202098246": {"Name": "Davies M.", "AuthorID": "57202098246", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute for Environmental Design and Engineering (IEDE), The Bartlett School of Environment, Energy and Resources (BSEER), The Bartlett Faculty of the Built Environment, University College London (UCL)"}, "25643378500": {"Name": "Summerfield A.", "AuthorID": "25643378500", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Energy Institute, The Bartlett School of Environment, Energy and Resources (BSEER), The Bartlett Faculty of the Built Environment, University College London (UCL)"}, "6602850020": {"Name": "Oreszczyn T.", "AuthorID": "6602850020", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Energy Institute, The Bartlett School of Environment, Energy and Resources (BSEER), The Bartlett Faculty of the Built Environment, University College London (UCL)"}}}
