As part of a nutrition trial (ISRCTN19918531), fat mass (FM) and fat-free mass (FFM) were measured using 2H dilution at 6 and 15 months of age. Of 419 infants enrolled, 98 % were breastfed, 15 % stunted and 4 % wasted at 6 months. At 15 months, 78 % were breastfed, 24 % stunted and 11 % wasted. Those not breastfed had lower FMI at 6 months but not at 15 months. Stunted children had lower FM at 6 months and lower FFM at 6 and 15 months compared with children with length-for-age z \u22650. Stunting was not associated with height-adjusted indexes fat mass index (FMI) or fat-free mass index (FFMI). Wasted children had lower FM, FFM, FMI and FFMI at 6 and 15 months compared with children with weight-for-length z (WLZ) \u22650. Generally, FFM and FFMI deficits increased with age, whereas FM and FMI deficits decreased, reflecting interactions between age and WLZ. For example, the FFM deficits were-0\u00b799 (95 % CI-1\u00b726,-0\u00b772) kg at 6 months and-1\u00b744 (95 % CI-1\u00b769;-1\u00b719) kg at 15 months (interaction, P<0\u00b705), while the FMI deficits were-2\u00b712 (95 % CI-2\u00b753,-1\u00b772) kg/m2 at 6 months and-1\u00b732 (95 % CI-1\u00b777,-0\u00b787) kg/m2 at 15 months (interaction, P<0\u00b705). This indicates that undernourished children preserve body fat at the detriment of fat-free tissue, which may have long-term consequences for health and working capacity.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Body composition", "Childhood", "Fat mass", "Fat-free mass", "Infancy", "Stunting", "Wasting"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adipose Tissue", "Body Composition", "Body Mass Index", "Breast Feeding", "Cambodia", "Female", "Growth Disorders", "Humans", "Infant", "Infant Nutritional Physiological Phenomena", "Male", "Nutritional Status", "Wasting Syndrome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85060395692", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (miscellaneous)", "MEDI", "2701"], ["Nutrition and Dietetics", "NURS", "2916"]], "AuthorData": {"24336223600": {"Name": "Skau J.K.H.", "AuthorID": "24336223600", "AffiliationID": "60030840", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nutrition Exercise and Sports, University of Copenhagen"}, "57189608136": {"Name": "Grenov B.", "AuthorID": "57189608136", "AffiliationID": "60030840", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nutrition Exercise and Sports, University of Copenhagen"}, "56441102400": {"Name": "Ritz C.", "AuthorID": "56441102400", "AffiliationID": "60030840", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nutrition Exercise and Sports, University of Copenhagen"}, "16064551900": {"Name": "Roos N.", "AuthorID": "16064551900", "AffiliationID": "60030840", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nutrition Exercise and Sports, University of Copenhagen"}, "7004634697": {"Name": "Michaelsen K.F.", "AuthorID": "7004634697", "AffiliationID": "60030840", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nutrition Exercise and Sports, University of Copenhagen"}, "57208122605": {"Name": "Friis H.", "AuthorID": "57208122605", "AffiliationID": "60030840", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nutrition Exercise and Sports, University of Copenhagen"}, "16314945700": {"Name": "Chamnan C.", "AuthorID": "16314945700", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Department of Fisheries Post-harvest Technologies and Quality Control, Fisheries Administration"}, "55353332000": {"Name": "Chea M.", "AuthorID": "55353332000", "AffiliationID": "60071993", "AffiliationName": "National Nutrition Programme, National Maternal and Child Health Centre, Ministry of Health"}, "6603346861": {"Name": "Wieringa F.T.", "AuthorID": "6603346861", "AffiliationID": "60025735, 60108503, 60083820", "AffiliationName": "Institut de Recherche pour le D\u00e9veloppement (IRD), UMR-204 Nutripass, Nutrition et Alimentation des Populations Aux Suds, IRD/UM/SupAgro"}, "6603061239": {"Name": "Dijkhuizen M.A.", "AuthorID": "6603061239", "AffiliationID": "60025735, 60108503, 60083820", "AffiliationName": "Institut de Recherche pour le D\u00e9veloppement (IRD), UMR-204 Nutripass, Nutrition et Alimentation des Populations Aux Suds, IRD/UM/SupAgro"}, "55134381200": {"Name": "Berger J.", "AuthorID": "55134381200", "AffiliationID": "60025735, 60108503, 60083820", "AffiliationName": "Institut de Recherche pour le D\u00e9veloppement (IRD), UMR-204 Nutripass, Nutrition et Alimentation des Populations Aux Suds, IRD/UM/SupAgro"}, "55603815000": {"Name": "Wells J.C.", "AuthorID": "55603815000", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Childhood Nutrition Research Centre, UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "7007060408": {"Name": "Filteau S.", "AuthorID": "7007060408", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Epidemiology and Population Health, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}}}
