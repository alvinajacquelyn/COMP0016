We performed a biomechanical investigation of the use of a personalized external aortic root support or exostent as a possibility for supporting the autograft. In ten sheep a short length of pulmonary artery was interposed in the descending aorta, serving as a simplified version of the Ross procedure. In seven of these cases, the autograft was supported by an external mesh or so-called exostent. Three sheep served as control, of which one was excluded from the mechanical testing. The sheep were sacrificed six months after the procedure. Samples of the relevant tissues were obtained for subsequent mechanical testing: normal aorta, normal pulmonary artery, aorta with exostent, pulmonary artery with exostent, and pulmonary artery in aortic position for six months. After mechanical testing, the material parameters of the Gasser-Ogden-Holzapfel model were determined for the different tissue types. Stress-strain curves of the different tissue types show significantly different mechanical behavior. At baseline, stress-strain curves of the pulmonary artery are lower than aortic stress-strain curves, but at the strain levels at which the collagen fibers are recruited, the pulmonary artery behaves stiffer than the aorta. After being in aortic position for six months, the pulmonary artery tends towards aorta-like behavior, indicating that growth and remodeling processes have taken place. When adding an exostent around the pulmonary autograft, the mechanical behavior of the composite artery (exostent + artery) differs from the artery alone, the non-linearity being more evident in the former.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Arterial tissue", "Constitutive modeling", "Exostent", "Planar biaxial testing"], "IndexKeywords": ["Arterial tissue", "Biaxial testing", "Biomechanical evaluation", "Exostent", "Growth and remodeling", "Material parameter", "Mechanical behavior", "Pulmonary valves", "Animals", "Aorta", "Biomechanical Phenomena", "Mechanical Phenomena", "Precision Medicine", "Sheep", "Stress, Mechanical", "Vascular Surgical Procedures"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85034644014", "SubjectAreas": [["Biomaterials", "MATE", "2502"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"], ["Mechanics of Materials", "ENGI", "2211"]], "AuthorData": {"57197768595": {"Name": "Vastmans J.", "AuthorID": "57197768595", "AffiliationID": "60025063", "AffiliationName": "Biomechanics section, KU Leuven"}, "56734498000": {"Name": "Fehervary H.", "AuthorID": "56734498000", "AffiliationID": "60025063", "AffiliationName": "Biomechanics section, KU Leuven"}, "56235308700": {"Name": "Vander Sloten J.", "AuthorID": "56235308700", "AffiliationID": "60025063", "AffiliationName": "Biomechanics section, KU Leuven"}, "24780421600": {"Name": "Famaey N.", "AuthorID": "24780421600", "AffiliationID": "60025063", "AffiliationName": "Biomechanics section, KU Leuven"}, "35312801000": {"Name": "Verbrugghe P.", "AuthorID": "35312801000", "AffiliationID": "60025063", "AffiliationName": "Centre of Experimental Cardiac Surgery, KU Leuven"}, "36174559500": {"Name": "Verbelen T.", "AuthorID": "36174559500", "AffiliationID": "60025063", "AffiliationName": "Centre of Experimental Cardiac Surgery, KU Leuven"}, "57197775353": {"Name": "Vanderveken E.", "AuthorID": "57197775353", "AffiliationID": "60025063", "AffiliationName": "Centre of Experimental Cardiac Surgery, KU Leuven"}, "6602268848": {"Name": "Rega F.", "AuthorID": "6602268848", "AffiliationID": "60025063", "AffiliationName": "Centre of Experimental Cardiac Surgery, KU Leuven"}, "57196678944": {"Name": "Treasure T.", "AuthorID": "57196678944", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Operational Research Unit, UCL"}}}
