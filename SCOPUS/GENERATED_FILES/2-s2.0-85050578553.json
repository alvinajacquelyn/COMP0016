The pulmonary veins entered a confluence posterior to the left atrial wall, which drained into the right superior cavoatrial junction. There were no other major structural defects and no evidence of isomerism. Because of the severe cyanosis, and the restrictive nature of the interatrial communication, we performed balloon atrioseptostomy to improve oxygenation. We then achieved successful surgical repair when the baby was aged 7 months.", "AuthorKeywords": ["cardiopulmonary bypass", "congenital heart defects", "congenital heart surgery", "totally anomalous pulmonary venous connection"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cardiac Surgical Procedures", "Cyanosis", "Female", "Heart Septal Defects, Atrial", "Humans", "Infant, Newborn", "Pulmonary Veins", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85050578553", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"57190571171": {"Name": "Shamsuddin A.M.", "AuthorID": "57190571171", "AffiliationID": "60009171", "AffiliationName": "Pediatric Cardiac Surgery Unit, East Midlands Congenital Heart Center, Glenfield Hospital"}, "57205636771": {"Name": "Wong A.R.", "AuthorID": "57205636771", "AffiliationID": "60009171", "AffiliationName": "Pediatric Cardiac Surgery Unit, East Midlands Congenital Heart Center, Glenfield Hospital"}, "55574190847": {"Name": "Anderson R.H.", "AuthorID": "55574190847", "AffiliationID": "60009171", "AffiliationName": "Pediatric Cardiac Surgery Unit, East Midlands Congenital Heart Center, Glenfield Hospital"}, "7006784699": {"Name": "Corno A.F.", "AuthorID": "7006784699", "AffiliationID": "60009171", "AffiliationName": "Pediatric Cardiac Surgery Unit, East Midlands Congenital Heart Center, Glenfield Hospital"}}}
