A paradigm can be defined as \u2018a set of basic beliefs that deals with ultimates or first principles\u2019 (Guba and Lincoln 1994: 108). It denotes a particular world view. Within the paradigm a particular world view is defined and within that world view the individuals define their relationships to the world. Guba and Lincoln also note that the ultimate truthfulness of the beliefs that underpin a paradigm may not be knowable. Nevertheless, research paradigms define researchers\u2019 central concerns and characterise their research. These central concerns are formed by ontological, epistemological, and axiological assumptions. From this basis, methodological choices will be made that draw on these assumptions. Methodology is where all these assumptions, made by the researcher, come together to inform the proposed study. Value based issues will be part of these assumptions. When that study is concerned with maladministration, this chapter suggests that value-based issues are of particular relevance.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85048923035", "SubjectAreas": [["Social Sciences (all)", "SOCI", "3300"]], "AuthorData": {"21738963400": {"Name": "Crawford M.", "AuthorID": "21738963400", "AffiliationID": "120865535", "AffiliationName": "Multi Academy Trust"}}}
