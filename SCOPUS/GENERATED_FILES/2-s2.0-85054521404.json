Objectives: The objective of this study was to assess striatal dopaminergic denervation in a cohort of symptomatic carriers of the p.A53T SNCA mutation as compared to PD patients. Methods: Data from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative database of 11 symptomatic p.A53T SNCA mutation carriers who underwent 123I-FP-CIT SPECT [(123) I-2\u03b2-carbomethoxy-3\u03b2-(4-iodophenyl)-N-(3-fluoropropyl) nortropane single photon emission computed tomography] imaging at our site were compared with those of 33 age-, sex-, and disease duration\u2013matched PD patients. Results: The p.A53T mutation carriers had significantly lower caudate nucleus binding ratio both contralaterally and ipsilaterally to the most affected side (P =.002 and P =.006) and a decreased contralateral caudate/putamen signal ratio (P =.007) as compared to PD. A similar degree of striatal asymmetry was observed in both subgroups. No correlation between scores in neuropsychological tests and caudate nucleus dopaminergic denervation could be demonstrated. Conclusions: PD patients harboring the p.A53T SNCA mutation show evidence of a more severe nigrostriatal denervation, especially evident in the caudate nucleus. The lack of significant differences in the putaminal binding ratios may reflect a floor effect or a true preferential targeting of the caudate terminals in p.A53T SNCA-associated PD. \u00a9 2018 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.", "AuthorKeywords": ["123I-FP-CIT SPECT", "alpha-synuclein", "caudate nucleus", "neuropsychological tests", "Parkinson's disease"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Alanine", "alpha-Synuclein", "Cognition Disorders", "Cohort Studies", "Corpus Striatum", "Dopamine", "Female", "Functional Laterality", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Mutation", "Parkinson Disease", "Threonine", "Tomography, Emission-Computed, Single-Photon", "Tropanes"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85054521404", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"15834998200": {"Name": "Koros C.", "AuthorID": "15834998200", "AffiliationID": "60067083, 60015528", "AffiliationName": "2nd Neurology Clinic, Attikon Hospital, Athens University Medical School"}, "56575103000": {"Name": "Simitsi A.", "AuthorID": "56575103000", "AffiliationID": "60067083, 60015528", "AffiliationName": "2nd Neurology Clinic, Attikon Hospital, Athens University Medical School"}, "57208560010": {"Name": "Stamelou M.", "AuthorID": "57208560010", "AffiliationID": "60029813", "AffiliationName": "Parkinson's Disease and Movement Disorders Department, HYGEIA Hospital"}, "57202963715": {"Name": "Stefanis L.", "AuthorID": "57202963715", "AffiliationID": "60067083, 60015528", "AffiliationName": "2nd Neurology Clinic, Attikon Hospital, Athens University Medical School"}, "56806839400": {"Name": "Beratis I.", "AuthorID": "56806839400", "AffiliationID": "60067083, 60015528", "AffiliationName": "2nd Neurology Clinic, Attikon Hospital, Athens University Medical School"}, "55351956300": {"Name": "Kontaxopoulou D.", "AuthorID": "55351956300", "AffiliationID": "60067083, 60015528", "AffiliationName": "2nd Neurology Clinic, Attikon Hospital, Athens University Medical School"}, "57190171797": {"Name": "Fragkiadaki S.", "AuthorID": "57190171797", "AffiliationID": "60067083, 60015528", "AffiliationName": "2nd Neurology Clinic, Attikon Hospital, Athens University Medical School"}, "57188849793": {"Name": "Papagiannakis N.", "AuthorID": "57188849793", "AffiliationID": "60067083, 60015528", "AffiliationName": "2nd Neurology Clinic, Attikon Hospital, Athens University Medical School"}, "15770367100": {"Name": "Papageorgiou S.G.", "AuthorID": "15770367100", "AffiliationID": "60067083, 60015528", "AffiliationName": "2nd Neurology Clinic, Attikon Hospital, Athens University Medical School"}, "57219427205": {"Name": "Prentakis A.", "AuthorID": "57219427205", "AffiliationID": "60015528", "AffiliationName": "Nuclear Medicine Unit, Attikon Hospital"}, "37011587500": {"Name": "Trapali X.G.", "AuthorID": "37011587500", "AffiliationID": "60015528", "AffiliationName": "Nuclear Medicine Unit, Attikon Hospital"}, "56430631100": {"Name": "Papadimitriou D.", "AuthorID": "56430631100", "AffiliationID": "100403312", "AffiliationName": "Neurology Clinic, Henry Dunan Hospital"}, "7004955269": {"Name": "Seibyl J.", "AuthorID": "7004955269", "AffiliationID": "60023924", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Neurodegenerative Disorders"}, "7102813513": {"Name": "Marek K.", "AuthorID": "7102813513", "AffiliationID": "60023924", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Neurodegenerative Disorders"}}}
