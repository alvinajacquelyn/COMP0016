An important feature of such a blood biomarker is that its concentration is not confounded by varying degrees of release from the brain into the blood across the blood-brain barrier (BBB). In this study, we investigated serum neurofilament light protein (NFL) concentrations in 21-day old mice following a single dose of cranial irradiation (8 Gy). Cranial irradiation resulted in acute cell injury measured as a 12.9-fold increase in caspase activity 6 h after irradiation; activation of inflammation measured by levels of CCL2 and increased BBB permeability measured by 14C-sucrose concentration ratios in brain and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Serum levels of NFL peaked at 6 h after both anesthesia and cranial irradiation, but no timely correlation of serum NFL concentration with BBB permeability was found. Further, three groups of patients with different degrees of BBB impairment (measured as the CSF/serum albumin ratio) were investigated. There was no correlation between serum NFL concentration and CSF/serum albumin ratio (r = 0.139, p = 0.3513), however a strong correlation was found for NFL concentration in serum and NFL concentration in CSF (r = 0.6303, p < 0.0001). In conclusion, serum NFL appears to be a reliable blood biomarker for neuronal injury, and its concentration is not confounded by BBB permeability.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Biomarker", "Cranial radiotherapy", "Juvenile brain", "Late effects", "Neurotoxicity"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Axons", "Biomarkers", "Blood-Brain Barrier", "Brain Injuries", "Disease Progression", "Female", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Neurofilament Proteins", "Neurons", "Permeability"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85019882773", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Developmental Biology", "BIOC", "1309"]], "AuthorData": {"25936280200": {"Name": "Kalm M.", "AuthorID": "25936280200", "AffiliationID": "60027675, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacology, Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, Sahlgrenska Academy at the University of Gothenburg"}, "57194395729": {"Name": "Eriksson Y.", "AuthorID": "57194395729", "AffiliationID": "60027675, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacology, Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, Sahlgrenska Academy at the University of Gothenburg"}, "55618100000": {"Name": "Bostr\u00f6m M.", "AuthorID": "55618100000", "AffiliationID": "60027675, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Department of Oncology, Institute of Clinical Sciences, Sahlgrenska Academy at the University of Gothenburg"}, "6602837455": {"Name": "Bj\u00f6rk-Eriksson T.", "AuthorID": "6602837455", "AffiliationID": "60027675, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Department of Oncology, Institute of Clinical Sciences, Sahlgrenska Academy at the University of Gothenburg"}, "57194388277": {"Name": "Sandelius \u00c5.", "AuthorID": "57194388277", "AffiliationID": "60027675, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry and Neurochemistry, Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, Sahlgrenska Academy at the University of Gothenburg"}, "56415176000": {"Name": "Blennow K.", "AuthorID": "56415176000", "AffiliationID": "60031699", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Neurochemistry Laboratory, Sahlgrenska University Hospital"}, "6701454676": {"Name": "Zetterberg H.", "AuthorID": "6701454676", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "8630435400": {"Name": "Ek C.J.", "AuthorID": "8630435400", "AffiliationID": "60027675", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physiology, Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, Sahlgrenska Academy at the University of Gothenburg"}}}
