Experimental studies show that statins exert additive effects with agents, such as cisplatin, to impair tumor growth, and observational studies suggest that statins combined with anticancer therapies delay relapse and prolong life in several cancer types. To our knowledge, we report the first large, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial of a statin with standard-of-care for patients with cancer, specifically SCLC. Patients and Methods: Patients with confirmed SCLC (limited or extensive disease) and performance status 0 to 3 were randomly assigned to receive daily pravastatin 40 mg or placebo, combined with up to six cycles of etoposide plus cisplatin or carboplatin every 3 weeks, until disease progression or intolerable toxicity. Primary end point was overall survival (OS), and secondary end points were progression-free survival (PFS), response rate, and toxicity. Results: Eight hundred forty-six patients from 91 United Kingdom hospitals were recruited. The median age of recruited patients was 64 years of age, 43% had limited disease, and 57% had extensive disease. There were 758 deaths and 787 PFS events. No benefit was found for pravastatin, either in all patients or in several subgroups. For pravastatin versus placebo, the 2-year OS rate was 13.2% (95% CI, 10.0 to 16.7) versus 14.1% (95% CI, 10.9 to 17.7), respectively, with a hazard ratio of 1.01 (95% CI, 0.88 to 1.16; P = .90. The median OS was 10.7 months v 10.6 months, respectively. The median PFS was 7.7 months v 7.3 months, respectively. The median OS (pravastatin v placebo) was 14.6 months in both groups for limited disease and 9.1 months versus 8.8 months, respectively, for extensive disease. Adverse events were similar between groups. Conclusion: Pravastatin 40 mg combined with standard SCLC therapy, although safe, does not benefit patients. Our conclusions are the same as those found in all four much smaller, randomized, placebo-controlled trials specifically designed to evaluate statin therapy in patients with cancer.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols", "Carboplatin", "Cisplatin", "Disease-Free Survival", "Double-Blind Method", "Etoposide", "Female", "Humans", "Lung Neoplasms", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Pravastatin", "Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors", "Small Cell Lung Carcinoma", "Survival Rate"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85018243573", "SubjectAreas": [["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Cancer Research", "BIOC", "1306"]], "AuthorData": {"35418220500": {"Name": "Seckl M.J.", "AuthorID": "35418220500", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Imperial College London"}, "55388344300": {"Name": "Ngai Y.", "AuthorID": "55388344300", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60012754", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Research UK, University College London Cancer Trials Centre"}, "56844919000": {"Name": "Nash S.", "AuthorID": "56844919000", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60012754", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Research UK, University College London Cancer Trials Centre"}, "57204025378": {"Name": "Hackshaw A.", "AuthorID": "57204025378", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60012754", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Research UK, University College London Cancer Trials Centre"}, "6701768909": {"Name": "Ottensmeier C.H.", "AuthorID": "6701768909", "AffiliationID": "60025225, 60000703", "AffiliationName": "University of Southampton, Southampton University Hospitals"}, "7201439511": {"Name": "Cullen M.", "AuthorID": "7201439511", "AffiliationID": "60012191", "AffiliationName": "Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham"}, "24833774300": {"Name": "Thompson J.", "AuthorID": "24833774300", "AffiliationID": "101909155", "AffiliationName": "Heart of England Birmingham"}, "7005254685": {"Name": "Middleton G.", "AuthorID": "7005254685", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "University of Birmingham"}, "57203057134": {"Name": "Schmid P.", "AuthorID": "57203057134", "AffiliationID": "60100018", "AffiliationName": "Brighton and Sussex Medical School"}, "57194184135": {"Name": "Muthukumar D.", "AuthorID": "57194184135", "AffiliationID": "60004413", "AffiliationName": "Colchester Hospital"}, "57193354987": {"Name": "Harden S.", "AuthorID": "57193354987", "AffiliationID": "60016390", "AffiliationName": "Cambridge University Hospital"}, "7006421347": {"Name": "Fife K.M.", "AuthorID": "7006421347", "AffiliationID": "60170290", "AffiliationName": "Peterborough City Hospital"}, "57194187461": {"Name": "Crosse B.", "AuthorID": "57194187461", "AffiliationID": "60002370", "AffiliationName": "Calderdale and Huddersfield NHS Foundation Trust"}, "55206073900": {"Name": "Taylor P.", "AuthorID": "55206073900", "AffiliationID": "60120605", "AffiliationName": "University Hospital South Manchester"}}}
