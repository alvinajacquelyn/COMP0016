We compared age-related changes in glycaemic traits between non-diabetic South Asian and white participants.Methods: In a prospective British occupational cohort with 5-yearly clinical examinations (n = 230/5,749 South Asian/white participants, age 39\u201379 years at baseline), age-related trajectories of fasting glucose (FG) and 2 h post-load glucose (PLG), log-transformed fasting insulin (FINS) and 2 h post-load insulin (PLINS), HOMA insulin sensitivity (HOMA2-%S) and HOMA insulin secretion (HOMA2-%B) were fitted for South Asian and white individuals who remained free of diabetes between 1991 and 2009.Results: In sex-adjusted multilevel models, FG was stable in white participants but increased with age in South Asians (0.12 [SE = 0.04] mmol/l per decade). PLG, FINS and PLINS levels were lower among white participants (by 0.271 [SE = 0.092] mmol/l, 0.306 [SE = 0.046] log pmol/l, 0.707 [SE = 0.059] log pmol/l at age 50, respectively) compared with South Asians, although their age-related trajectories were parallel. HOMA2-%S was higher (0.226 [SE = 0.038] at age 50) and HOMA2-%B lower (by 0.189 [SE = 0.026] at age 50) among white than South Asian participants. The age-related decline in HOMA2-%S was similar in these groups, but the age-related increase in HOMA2-%B was greater in white participants (0.04 [SE = 0.02] per decade). This difference was explained by obesity, lifestyle and social status.Conclusions/interpretation: Findings from a diabetes-free population suggest an inadequate pancreatic beta cell reserve in South Asians, as a significantly steeper age-related increase in FG was observed in this ethnic group compared with white individuals.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cohort study", "Ethnicity", "Fasting glucose", "Fasting insulin", "Glycaemic trajectory", "Insulin resistance", "Insulin secretion", "Insulin sensitivity", "Post-load glucose", "South Asian"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Asia", "Blood Glucose", "Cohort Studies", "Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2", "Female", "Humans", "Insulin", "Insulin Resistance", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Prospective Studies"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84925515659", "SubjectAreas": [["Internal Medicine", "MEDI", "2724"], ["Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism", "MEDI", "2712"]], "AuthorData": {"13611386400": {"Name": "Ikehara S.", "AuthorID": "13611386400", "AffiliationID": "60024322, 60175967", "AffiliationName": "Public Health, Department of Social and Environmental Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka University"}, "7003480687": {"Name": "Tab\u00e1k A.G.", "AuthorID": "7003480687", "AffiliationID": "100576250", "AffiliationName": "First Department of Medicine"}, "15070433300": {"Name": "Akbaraly T.N.", "AuthorID": "15070433300", "AffiliationID": "60108525, 60000905, 60108488", "AffiliationName": "Inserm U1061, Universit\u00e9 Montpellier II"}, "7004391239": {"Name": "Kivim\u00e4ki M.", "AuthorID": "7004391239", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "24576354300": {"Name": "Brunner E.J.", "AuthorID": "24576354300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "35227393400": {"Name": "Iso H.", "AuthorID": "35227393400", "AffiliationID": "60024322, 60175967", "AffiliationName": "Public Health, Department of Social and Environmental Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka University"}, "55450518100": {"Name": "Hulm\u00e1n A.", "AuthorID": "55450518100", "AffiliationID": "60027332", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Medical Informatics, University of Szeged"}, "6603478414": {"Name": "Forouhi N.G.", "AuthorID": "6603478414", "AffiliationID": "60031101, 60009969, 60120909", "AffiliationName": "MRC Epidemiology Unit, Institute of Metabolic Science, University of Cambridge"}}}
