The aim was to examine the association of physical activity with trajectories in cognitive function, measured from repeated assessments over 10 years. Methods We conducted a 10-year follow-up of 10 652 (aged 65\u00b110.1 years) men and women from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing, a cohort of community dwelling older adults. Self-reported physical activity was assessed at baseline and neuropsychological tests of memory and executive function were administered at regular 2-year intervals. Data from six repeated measurements of memory over 10 years and five repeated measurements of executive function over 8 years were used. Results The multivariable models revealed relatively small baseline differences in cognitive function by physical activity status in both men and women. Over the 10-year follow-up, physically inactive women experienced a greater decline in their memory (-0.20 recalled words, 95% CI -0.29 to -0.11, per study wave) and in executive function ability (-0.33 named animals; -0.54 to -0.13, per study wave) in comparison with the vigorously active reference group. In men, there were no differences in memory (-0.08 recalled words, 95% CI -0.18 to 0.01, per study wave), but small differences in executive function (-0.23 named animals; -0.46 to -0.01, per study wave) between inactive and vigorously active. Conclusion Physical activity was associated with preservation of memory and executive function over 10 years follow-up. The results were, however, more pronounced in women.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aging", "Cognition", "Cognition Disorders", "England", "Exercise", "Female", "Humans", "Life Style", "Longevity", "Longitudinal Studies", "Male", "Memory", "Middle Aged"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85052875845", "SubjectAreas": [["Epidemiology", "MEDI", "2713"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"8502496600": {"Name": "Hamer M.", "AuthorID": "8502496600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "6505997583": {"Name": "Demakakos P.", "AuthorID": "6505997583", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "24344984000": {"Name": "Terrera G.M.", "AuthorID": "24344984000", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Dementia Prevention, University of Edinburgh"}}}
