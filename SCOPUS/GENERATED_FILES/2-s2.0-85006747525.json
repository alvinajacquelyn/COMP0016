Addiction published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of Society for the Study of Addiction.Background and Aims: Naloxone is an opioid antagonist used for emergency resuscitation following opioid overdose. Prisoners with a history of heroin injection have a high risk of drug-related death soon after release from prison. The NALoxone InVEstigation (N-ALIVE) pilot trial (ISRCTN34044390) tested feasibility measures for randomized provision of naloxone-on-release (NOR) to eligible prisoners in England. Design.: Parallel-group randomized controlled pilot trial. Setting: English prisons. Participants: A total of 1685 adult heroin injectors, incarcerated for at least 7 days pre-randomization, release due within 3 months and more than 6 months since previous N-ALIVE release. Intervention: Using 1 : 1 minimization, prisoners were randomized to receive on release a pack containing either a single \u2018rescue\u2019 injection of naloxone or a control pack with no syringe. Measurements: Key feasibility outcomes were tested against prior expectations: on participation (14 English prisons; 2800 prisoners), consent (75% for randomization), returned prisoner self-questionnaires (RPSQs: 207), NOR-carriage (75% in first 4 weeks) and overdose presence (80%). Findings: Prisons (16) and prisoners (1685) were willing to participate [consent rate, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 70\u201374%]; 218 RPSQs were received; NOR-carriage (95% CI = 63\u201379%) and overdose presence (95% CI = 75\u201384%) were as expected. We randomized 842 to NOR and 843 to control during 30 months but stopped early, because only one-third of NOR administrations were to the ex-prisoner. Nine deaths within 12 weeks of release were registered for 1557 randomized participants released before 9 December 2014. Conclusions: Large randomized trials are feasible with prison populations. Provision of take-home emergency naloxone prior to prison release may be a life-saving interim measure to prevent heroin overdose deaths among ex-prisoners and the wider population.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Fatality", "naloxone", "opioid-overdose", "post-release", "prevention", "prisoners", "randomization", "trial"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Drug Overdose", "England", "Female", "Heroin Dependence", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Naloxone", "Narcotic Antagonists", "Pilot Projects", "Prisoners", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85006747525", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (miscellaneous)", "MEDI", "2701"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"57206147296": {"Name": "Parmar M.K.B.", "AuthorID": "57206147296", "AffiliationID": "60003108, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "MRC Clinical Trials Unit at University College London"}, "26028757100": {"Name": "Choo L.", "AuthorID": "26028757100", "AffiliationID": "60003108, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "MRC Clinical Trials Unit at University College London"}, "16835191900": {"Name": "Meade A.M.", "AuthorID": "16835191900", "AffiliationID": "60003108, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "MRC Clinical Trials Unit at University College London"}, "7102963151": {"Name": "Strang J.", "AuthorID": "7102963151", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "National Addiction Centre at King's College London"}, "7201459524": {"Name": "Bird S.M.", "AuthorID": "7201459524", "AffiliationID": "60009587, 60006654", "AffiliationName": "MRC Biostatistics Unit, University of Cambridge Institute of Public Health"}}}
