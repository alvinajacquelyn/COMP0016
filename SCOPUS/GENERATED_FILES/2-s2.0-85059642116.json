In 2015, the binder jet process was adapted as an alternative mass manufacturing technique to enable the production of Spritam\u00ae (the first 3D printed tablet) approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Binder jet printing is expected to continue making a widespread impact to formulation manufacture over the next decade. In particular, binder jet printing offers benefits of producing oral dosage forms with unique release characteristics ranging from fast-dissolving through to controlled-release platforms. This chapter aims to discuss the history and methodology of binder jet printing, pharmaceutical and medical applications, considerations for formulations development and advantages and disadvantages of such processes in the pharmaceutical space.", "AuthorKeywords": ["3D printing", "Additive manufacturing", "Digital healthcare", "Drug delivery systems", "Personalized medications", "Printing medicines"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85059642116", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmaceutical Science", "PHAR", "3003"]], "AuthorData": {"57190062563": {"Name": "Trenfield S.J.", "AuthorID": "57190062563", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60016379", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmaceutics, UCL School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "57200558361": {"Name": "Madla C.M.", "AuthorID": "57200558361", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60016379", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmaceutics, UCL School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "7003826707": {"Name": "Basit A.W.", "AuthorID": "7003826707", "AffiliationID": "60118373", "AffiliationName": "FabRx Ltd."}, "6602683597": {"Name": "Gaisford S.", "AuthorID": "6602683597", "AffiliationID": "60118373", "AffiliationName": "FabRx Ltd."}}}
