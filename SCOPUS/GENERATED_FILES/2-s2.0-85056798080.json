Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.The general problem of asset pricing when the discount rate differs from the rate at which an asset\u2019s cash flows accrue is considered. A pricing kernel framework is used to model an economy that is segmented into distinct markets, each identified by a yield curve having its own market, credit and liquidity risk characteristics. The proposed framework precludes arbitrage within each market, while the definition of a curve-conversion factor process links all markets in a consistent arbitrage-free manner. A pricing formula is then derived, referred to as the across-curve pricing formula, which enables consistent valuation and hedging of financial instruments across curves (and markets). As a natural application, a consistent multi-curve framework is formulated for emerging and developed inter-bank swap markets, which highlights an important dual feature of the curve-conversion factor process. Given this multi-curve framework, existing multi-curve approaches based on HJM and rational pricing kernel models are recovered, reviewed and generalised and single-curve models extended. In another application, inflation-linked, currency-based and fixed-income hybrid securities are shown to be consistently valued using the across-curve valuation method.", "AuthorKeywords": ["HJM", "Inflation-linked and foreign-exchanged securities", "Linear-rational term structure models", "Multi-curve potential model", "Multi-curve term structures", "OIS and LIBOR", "Pricing kernel approach", "Rational pricing models", "Spread models", "Valuation in emerging markets"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85056798080", "SubjectAreas": [["Accounting", "BUSI", "1402"], ["Economics, Econometrics and Finance (miscellaneous)", "ECON", "2001"], ["Strategy and Management", "BUSI", "1408"]], "AuthorData": {"24281766900": {"Name": "Macrina A.", "AuthorID": "24281766900", "AffiliationID": "60000356", "AffiliationName": "Department of Actuarial Science, University of Cape Town"}, "57204703657": {"Name": "Mahomed O.", "AuthorID": "57204703657", "AffiliationID": "60000356", "AffiliationName": "African Institute of Financial Markets and Risk Management, University of Cape Town"}}}
