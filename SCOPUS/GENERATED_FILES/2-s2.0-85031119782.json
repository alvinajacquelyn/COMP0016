Aging Cell published by the Anatomical Society and John Wiley & Sons Ltd. Cellular senescence is accompanied by a senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). We show here that primary human senescent CD8 + T cells also display a SASP comprising chemokines, cytokines and extracellular matrix remodelling proteases that are unique to this subset and contribute to age-associated inflammation. We found the CD8 + CD45RA + CD27 \u2212 EMRA subset to be the most heterogeneous, with a population aligning with the na\u00efve T cells and another with a closer association to the effector memory subset. However, despite the differing processes that give rise to these senescent CD8 + T cells once generated, they both adopt a unique secretory profile with no commonality to any other subset, aligning more closely with senescence than quiescence. Furthermore, we also show that the SASP observed in senescent CD8 + T cells is governed by p38 MAPK signalling.", "AuthorKeywords": ["aging", "cytokine", "inflammation", "microarray", "SASP", "T cell"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85031119782", "SubjectAreas": [["Aging", "BIOC", "1302"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"57196033634": {"Name": "Callender L.", "AuthorID": "57196033634", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Translational Medicine and Therapeutics, William Harvey Research Institute, Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London"}, "57196031836": {"Name": "Carroll E.", "AuthorID": "57196031836", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Translational Medicine and Therapeutics, William Harvey Research Institute, Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London"}, "7005668027": {"Name": "Henson S.", "AuthorID": "7005668027", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Translational Medicine and Therapeutics, William Harvey Research Institute, Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London"}, "57196036946": {"Name": "Beal R.", "AuthorID": "57196036946", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Microvascular Research, William Harvey Research Institute, Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London"}, "7004387169": {"Name": "Nourshargh S.", "AuthorID": "7004387169", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Microvascular Research, William Harvey Research Institute, Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London"}, "36625044000": {"Name": "Chambers E.", "AuthorID": "36625044000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London"}, "7006856048": {"Name": "Akbar A.", "AuthorID": "7006856048", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London"}}}
