Different characteristics of clusterings are required in different situations. Researchers should be explicit about on what requirements and what idea of \"true clusters\" their research is based, because clustering becomes scientific not through uniqueness but through transparent and open communication. The idea of \"natural kinds\" is a human construct, but it highlights the human experience that the reality outside the observer's control seems to make certain distinctions between categories inevitable. Various desirable characteristics of clusterings and various approaches to define a context-dependent truth are listed, and I discuss what impact these ideas can have on the comparison of clustering methods, and the choice of a clustering methods and related decisions in practice.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Active scientific realism", "Categorization", "Constructivism", "Mixture models", "Natural kinds", "Variable selection"], "IndexKeywords": ["Active scientific realism", "Categorization", "Constructivism", "Mixture model", "Natural kinds", "Variable selection"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84939570606", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Signal Processing", "COMP", "1711"], ["Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition", "COMP", "1707"], ["Artificial Intelligence", "COMP", "1702"]], "AuthorData": {"57196610402": {"Name": "Hennig C.", "AuthorID": "57196610402", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Statistical Science, University College London"}}}
