The aim of this study was to compare the distal pulmonary vasculature of <2 mm in diameter in Systemic Sclerosis (SSc) patients with (n=17) and without (n=5) associated PAH using Optical Coherence Tomography during Right Heart catheterization. SSc-PAH patients showed significant thickening of Intima Media Thickening Area compared to patients without PAH (27 +/-5.8% vs. 21 +/-1.4%, p = 0.024). A good haemodynamic response to previous targeted PAH treatment was associated with a significantly greater number of small pulmonary artery side branches <300 \u03bcm per cm vessel (3.8 +/-1.1 vs. 1.8 +/-1.1; p = 0.010) and not associated with Intima Media thickening Area (26 +/-5.4% vs. 28 +/-6.7%; p = 0.6). Unexpected evidence of pulmonary artery thrombus formation was found in 19% of SSc-PAH patients. This is the first in-vivo study demonstrating a direct link between a structural abnormality of pulmonary arteries and a response to targeted treatment in PAH. Intravascular imaging may identify subgroups that may benefit from anticoagulation.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Female", "Hemodynamics", "Humans", "Hypertension, Pulmonary", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Pulmonary Artery", "Scleroderma, Systemic", "Tomography, Optical Coherence", "Vascular Diseases"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85013817310", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"14052989000": {"Name": "Schwaiger J.P.", "AuthorID": "14052989000", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57193421069": {"Name": "Loder C.D.", "AuthorID": "57193421069", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "24068612500": {"Name": "Dobarro D.", "AuthorID": "24068612500", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57193415577": {"Name": "Kaier T.", "AuthorID": "57193415577", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57193419902": {"Name": "Reddecliffe S.", "AuthorID": "57193419902", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "36106322600": {"Name": "Schreiber B.E.", "AuthorID": "36106322600", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Department of Rheumatology, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57204346399": {"Name": "Handler C.", "AuthorID": "57204346399", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "35393553500": {"Name": "Coghlan J.G.", "AuthorID": "35393553500", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7006031021": {"Name": "Denton C.P.", "AuthorID": "7006031021", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Department of Rheumatology, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
