All rights reserved.Objectives: To conduct two economic analyses addressing whether to: routinely monitor HIV-infected children on antiretroviral therapy (ART) clinically or with laboratory tests; continue or stop cotrimoxazole prophylaxis when children become stabilized on ART. Design and methods: The ARROW randomized trial investigated alternative strategies to deliver paediatric ART and cotrimoxazole prophylaxis in 1206 Ugandan/Zimbabwean children. Incremental cost-effectiveness and value of implementation analyses were undertaken. Scenario analyses investigated whether laboratory monitoring (CD4+ tests for efficacy monitoring; haematology/biochemistry for toxicity) could be tailored and targeted to be delivered cost-effectively. Cotrimoxazole use was examined in malaria-endemic and non-endemic settings. Results: Using all trial data, clinical monitoring delivered similar health outcomes to routine laboratory monitoring, but at a reduced cost, so was cost-effective. Continuing cotrimoxazole improved health outcomes at reduced costs. Restricting routine CD4+ monitoring to after 52 weeks following ART initiation and removing toxicity testing was associated with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $6084 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) across all age groups, but was much lower for older children (12+ years at initiation; incremental cost-effectiveness ratio = $769/QALY). Committing resources to improve cotrimoxazole implementation appears cost-effective. A healthcare system that could pay $600/QALY should be willing to spend up to $12.0 per patient-year to ensure continued provision of cotrimoxazole. Conclusion: Clinically driven monitoring of ART is cost-effective in most circumstances. Routine laboratory monitoring is generally not cost-effective at current prices, except possibly CD4+ testing amongst adolescents initiating ART. Committing resources to ensure continued provision of cotrimoxazole in health facilities is more likely to represent an efficient use of resources.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Africa", "Children", "Cotrimoxazole", "HIV", "Laboratory monitoring"], "IndexKeywords": ["Antiretroviral Therapy, Highly Active", "CD4 Lymphocyte Count", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Cost-Benefit Analysis", "Female", "Health Care Costs", "HIV Infections", "Humans", "Male", "Quality-Adjusted Life Years", "Treatment Outcome", "Trimethoprim, Sulfamethoxazole Drug Combination", "Uganda", "Zimbabwe"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84920277101", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"55192732700": {"Name": "Revill P.A.", "AuthorID": "55192732700", "AffiliationID": "60016418", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Health Economics, University of York"}, "56427413300": {"Name": "Walker S.", "AuthorID": "56427413300", "AffiliationID": "60016418", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Health Economics, University of York"}, "7006749329": {"Name": "Sculpher M.J.", "AuthorID": "7006749329", "AffiliationID": "60016418", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Health Economics, University of York"}, "55855324800": {"Name": "Mabugu T.", "AuthorID": "55855324800", "AffiliationID": "60033774", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Research Centre, University of Zimbabwe"}, "57210663714": {"Name": "Nathoo K.J.", "AuthorID": "57210663714", "AffiliationID": "60033774", "AffiliationName": "University of Zimbabwe, College of Health Sciences"}, "36554025300": {"Name": "Bwakura-Dangarembizi M.", "AuthorID": "36554025300", "AffiliationID": "60033774", "AffiliationName": "University of Zimbabwe, College of Health Sciences"}, "6603691631": {"Name": "Mugyenyi P.", "AuthorID": "6603691631", "AffiliationID": "60071691", "AffiliationName": "Joint Clinical Research Centre"}, "17135681200": {"Name": "Musiime V.", "AuthorID": "17135681200", "AffiliationID": "60071691", "AffiliationName": "Joint Clinical Research Centre"}, "56427987500": {"Name": "Kekitinwa A.", "AuthorID": "56427987500", "AffiliationID": "60071696", "AffiliationName": "Paediatric Infectious Diseases Clinic/Baylor - Uganda, Mulago Hospital"}, "10139376400": {"Name": "Bakeera-Kitaka S.", "AuthorID": "10139376400", "AffiliationID": "60071696", "AffiliationName": "Paediatric Infectious Diseases Clinic/Baylor - Uganda, Mulago Hospital"}, "14825365500": {"Name": "Munderi P.", "AuthorID": "14825365500", "AffiliationID": "60071671", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council/Uganda Research Unit on AIDS, Uganda Virus Research Institute"}, "55905224100": {"Name": "Nahirya-Ntege P.", "AuthorID": "55905224100", "AffiliationID": "60071671", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council/Uganda Research Unit on AIDS, Uganda Virus Research Institute"}, "35402208300": {"Name": "Walker A.S.", "AuthorID": "35402208300", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council (MRC), Clinical Trials Unit, University College London"}, "35495600000": {"Name": "Gibb D.M.", "AuthorID": "35495600000", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council (MRC), Clinical Trials Unit, University College London"}}}
