However, food intake also impacts multiple biochemical processes that influence our behavior. Here, we investigate the causal relationship between macronutrient composition, its bodily biochemical impact, and a modulation of human social decision making. Across two studies, we show that breakfasts with different macronutrient compositions modulated human social behavior. Breakfasts with a high-carbohydrate/protein ratio increased social punishment behavior in response to norm violations compared with that in response to a low carbohydrate/ protein meal. We show that these macronutrient-induced behavioral changes in social decision making are causally related to a lowering of plasma tyrosine levels. The findings indicate that, in a limited sense, \"we are what we eat\" and provide a perspective on a nutrition-driven modulation of cognition. The findings have implications for education, economics, and public policy, and emphasize that the importance of a balanced dietmay extend beyond themere physical benefits of adequate nutrition.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Decision making", "Nutrition", "Social decision", "Tyrosine", "Ultimatum game"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Decision Making", "Dietary Carbohydrates", "Dietary Fats", "Eating", "Energy Intake", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Nutritional Status", "Punishment", "Social Behavior", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85021181350", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"56058383400": {"Name": "Strang S.", "AuthorID": "56058383400", "AffiliationID": "60012408", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology i, University of Lubeck"}, "35215904500": {"Name": "Park S.", "AuthorID": "35215904500", "AffiliationID": "60012408", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology i, University of Lubeck"}, "57194585639": {"Name": "Hoeber C.", "AuthorID": "57194585639", "AffiliationID": "60012408", "AffiliationName": "Department of Internal Medicine i, University of Lubeck"}, "54407544600": {"Name": "Uhl O.", "AuthorID": "54407544600", "AffiliationID": "60000291, 60028717", "AffiliationName": "Von Hauner Children's Hospital, University of Munich Medical Center, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitat Munich"}, "25926500300": {"Name": "Koletzko B.", "AuthorID": "25926500300", "AffiliationID": "60015196", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Universitatsklinikum Schleswig-Holstein"}, "35564283300": {"Name": "Munte T.", "AuthorID": "35564283300", "AffiliationID": "60012408", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology II, University of Lubeck"}, "34570772200": {"Name": "Lehnert H.", "AuthorID": "34570772200", "AffiliationID": "114842903", "AffiliationName": "Deutsches Zentrum Fur Diabetes"}, "55027467100": {"Name": "Dolan R.", "AuthorID": "55027467100", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60084279", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, University College London"}, "36155629100": {"Name": "Schmid S.", "AuthorID": "36155629100", "AffiliationID": "60122566", "AffiliationName": "Max Planck University College London Centre for Computational Psychiatry and Ageing Research"}}}
