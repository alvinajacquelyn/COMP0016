Here we present a flexible aerosol-assisted chemical vapour deposition (AACVD) method for constructing nanostructured thin films of noble metal (Au, Pt, Pd or Ru) and metal oxide (PdO or RuOx) NPs supported on 1D WO3 nanorod arrays. The size of the NPs (1.6 to 7.3 nm) is directly controlled by the deposition time (0.5 to 36 minutes).", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Aerosol-assisted chemical vapour depositions", "Deposition time", "Gas-phase synthesis", "Metal oxide supports", "Metal oxides", "Nano-rod arrays", "Nanoparticle (NPs)", "Nanostructured thin film"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85058471060", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"]], "AuthorData": {"35933361700": {"Name": "Ling M.", "AuthorID": "35933361700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "7005826606": {"Name": "Blackman C.", "AuthorID": "7005826606", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}}}
