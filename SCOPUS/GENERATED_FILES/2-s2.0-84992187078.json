Despite the importance of this phenomenon, little is known regarding its neural mechanisms. Here we show that two patterns of electrical brain activity known to index prediction errors-the Feedback-Related Negativity (FRN) and the feedback-related P300 -were sensitive to price offers that were cheaper than participants' expectations. In addition, we also found that FRN amplitude time-locked to price offers predicted whether a product would be subsequently purchased or not, and further analyses suggest that this result was driven by the sensitivity of the FRN to positive price expectation violations. This finding strongly suggests that ensembles of neurons coding positive prediction errors play a critical role in real-life consumer behaviour. Further, these findings indicate that theoretical models based on the notion of prediction error, such as the Reinforcement Learning Theory, can provide a neurobiologically grounded account of consumer behavior.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84992187078", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"12446718600": {"Name": "Schaefer A.", "AuthorID": "12446718600", "AffiliationID": "60018894", "AffiliationName": "Monash University, Malaysia Campus, School of Business"}, "23134394900": {"Name": "Buratto L.G.", "AuthorID": "23134394900", "AffiliationID": "60024989", "AffiliationName": "University of Bras\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdlia, Institute of Psychology"}, "56079056500": {"Name": "Brotherhood E.V.", "AuthorID": "56079056500", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Institute of Neurology"}, "39761808300": {"Name": "Goto N.", "AuthorID": "39761808300", "AffiliationID": "60018894", "AffiliationName": "Monash University, Malaysia Campus, School of Business"}}}
