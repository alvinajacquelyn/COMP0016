KGaA, Weinheim.Complexation of a boron atom with a series of bi-dentate heterocyclic ligands successfully gives rise to corresponding BF2-chelated heteroarenes, which could be considered as novel boron(III)-cored dyes. These dye molecules exhibit planar structures and expanded \u03c0-conjugated backbones due to the locked conformation with a boron center. The geometric and electronic structures of these BF2 complexes can be tailored by embedding heteroatoms in the unique modes to form positional isomer and isoelectronic structures. The structure-property relationship is further elucidated by studying the photophysical properties, electrochemical behavior and quantum-chemical calculations.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Boron(III)-cored dyes", "Embedding", "Heterocyclic ligands", "Structure-property relationships", "Theoretical calculations"], "IndexKeywords": ["Electrochemical behaviors", "Embedding", "Heterocyclic ligands", "Isoelectronic structures", "Photophysical properties", "Quantum chemical calculations", "Structure property relationships", "Theoretical calculations", "Boron Compounds", "Coloring Agents", "Heterocyclic Compounds", "Ligands", "Models, Molecular", "Molecular Structure"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84923343332", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Organic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1605"]], "AuthorData": {"57199010413": {"Name": "Sun L.", "AuthorID": "57199010413", "AffiliationID": "60025084", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, State Key Laboratory of Metal Matrix Composites, Shanghai Jiao Tong University"}, "55613230870": {"Name": "Zhang F.", "AuthorID": "55613230870", "AffiliationID": "60025084", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, State Key Laboratory of Metal Matrix Composites, Shanghai Jiao Tong University"}, "55933782600": {"Name": "Wang X.", "AuthorID": "55933782600", "AffiliationID": "60025084", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, State Key Laboratory of Metal Matrix Composites, Shanghai Jiao Tong University"}, "56462114700": {"Name": "Qiu F.", "AuthorID": "56462114700", "AffiliationID": "60025084", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, State Key Laboratory of Metal Matrix Composites, Shanghai Jiao Tong University"}, "8315702200": {"Name": "Xue M.", "AuthorID": "8315702200", "AffiliationID": "60025084", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, State Key Laboratory of Metal Matrix Composites, Shanghai Jiao Tong University"}, "13406555300": {"Name": "Feng X.", "AuthorID": "13406555300", "AffiliationID": "60018353", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry and Food Chemistry, Center for Advancing Electronics Dresden (cfaed), Technische Universitaet Dresden"}, "55562231300": {"Name": "Tregnago G.", "AuthorID": "55562231300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "7006071546": {"Name": "Cacialli F.", "AuthorID": "7006071546", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "57190521694": {"Name": "Osella S.", "AuthorID": "57190521694", "AffiliationID": "60010758", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory for Chemistry of Novel Materials, University of Mons"}, "7004588449": {"Name": "Beljonne D.", "AuthorID": "7004588449", "AffiliationID": "60010758", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory for Chemistry of Novel Materials, University of Mons"}}}
