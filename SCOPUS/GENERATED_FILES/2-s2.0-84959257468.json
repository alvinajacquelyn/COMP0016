These bounds are where, demonstrably, people start experiencing cognitive strain and consequently committing errors in the tasks execution. We argue that the usable security discipline should scientifically understand such bounds in order to have realistic expectations about what people can or cannot attain when coping with security tasks. This may shed light on whether Johnny will be ever be able to encrypt. We propose a conceptual framework for evaluation of human capacities in security that also assigns systems to complexity categories according to their security and usability. From what we have initiated in this paper, we ultimately aim at providing designers of security mechanisms and policies with the ability to say: \"This feature of the security mechanism X or this security policy element Y is inappropriate, because this evidence shows that it is beyond the capacity of its target community\".", "AuthorKeywords": ["Human capacities", "Usable security models"], "IndexKeywords": ["Complexity theory", "Conceptual frameworks", "Human capacities", "Neuroscience literature", "Security and usabilities", "Security mechanism", "Security policy", "Usable security"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84959257468", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Human-Computer Interaction", "COMP", "1709"], ["Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition", "COMP", "1707"], ["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"]], "AuthorData": {"14035187000": {"Name": "Benenson Z.", "AuthorID": "14035187000", "AffiliationID": "60000765", "AffiliationName": "Computer Science Department, Friedrich-Alexander-Universit\u00e4t"}, "16643267300": {"Name": "Lenzini G.", "AuthorID": "16643267300", "AffiliationID": "60072562", "AffiliationName": "Interdisciplinary Centre for Security Reliability and Trust, University of Luxembourg"}, "56718643300": {"Name": "Oliveira D.", "AuthorID": "56718643300", "AffiliationID": "60013959", "AffiliationName": "Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, University of Florida"}, "19640579100": {"Name": "Parkin S.", "AuthorID": "19640579100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "56473598900": {"Name": "Uebelacker S.", "AuthorID": "56473598900", "AffiliationID": "60010338", "AffiliationName": "Security in Distributed Applications, Hamburg University of Technology"}}}
