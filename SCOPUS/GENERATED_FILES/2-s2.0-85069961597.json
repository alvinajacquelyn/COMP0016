Objective: A comprehensive (nonsystematic) review to determine the suggested sequence or combinations for the systemic treatment of mRCC. Evidence acquisition: PubMed and abstracts from main conferences up to December 2018 were reviewed to retrieve the current evidence for treatment of mRCC. Search terms included renal cell carcinoma, systemic therapy, targeted therapy (TT), and immunotherapy. Evidence synthesis: Marked advances in the treatment of mRCC have been made with novel VEGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors and multiple ICIs that have been included in the current treatment paradigm of mRCC. Remarkable advance has been made with the combination of double checkpoint blockade. The combination of ipilimumab and nivolumab compared with sunitinib has shown to increase the overall survival in the intermediate- and poor-risk patients based on the International Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma Database Consortium (IMDC) model. Conclusions: Double checkpoint blockade with ipilimumab and nivolumab has reported overall survival benefit in IMDC intermediate- and poor-risk patients, providing a durable response for a subset of patients. VEGF inhibitors remain the standard of care for favorable-risk patients in the first line. In the immediate future, more consolidated data on combination of VEGF-TT plus ICIs may show similar robust benefit with different safety profiles. Patient summary: Multiple drugs and sequences are now accepted as effective treatment for metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC). Combination of immune checkpoint inhibitors has shown to increase the overall survival in treatment-na\u00efve mRCC patients. Combinations of immunotherapy and antiangiogenics may be another option in the near future. Outcomes of the first line will determine the sequence, although the best sequence has yet to be defined. Double checkpoint blockade with ipilimumab and nivolumab has reported the best data at the first line in terms of overall survival, providing a long durable response. After progression, treatment management should focus on efficacy as well as safety profile.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Combination", "Immunotherapy", "Kidney cancer", "Renal cell carcinoma", "Sequencing", "Treatment"], "IndexKeywords": ["Angiogenesis Inhibitors", "Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological", "Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols", "Carcinoma, Renal Cell", "Clinical Trials as Topic", "CTLA-4 Antigen", "Humans", "Kidney Neoplasms", "Molecular Targeted Therapy", "Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor", "Progression-Free Survival", "Protein Kinase Inhibitors", "Standard of Care", "Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85069961597", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"], ["Urology", "MEDI", "2748"]], "AuthorData": {"37030783300": {"Name": "de Velasco G.", "AuthorID": "37030783300", "AffiliationID": "60004024", "AffiliationName": "Hospital Universitario 12 de Octubre"}, "7004237921": {"Name": "Bex A.", "AuthorID": "7004237921", "AffiliationID": "60176023", "AffiliationName": "UCL DIvision of Surgery and Interventional Science"}, "9233462800": {"Name": "Albiges L.", "AuthorID": "9233462800", "AffiliationID": "60027386", "AffiliationName": "Institut Gustave Roussy"}, "7005082754": {"Name": "Escudier B.", "AuthorID": "7005082754", "AffiliationID": "60027386", "AffiliationName": "Institut Gustave Roussy"}, "34572458000": {"Name": "Powles T.", "AuthorID": "34572458000", "AffiliationID": "60021435", "AffiliationName": "Barts Cancer Institute"}, "57209071043": {"Name": "Rini B.I.", "AuthorID": "57209071043", "AffiliationID": "60032732, 60021160", "AffiliationName": "Cleveland Clinic, Taussig Cancer Institute"}, "35433052300": {"Name": "Motzer R.J.", "AuthorID": "35433052300", "AffiliationID": "60009343", "AffiliationName": "Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center"}, "57200952034": {"Name": "Heng D.Y.C.", "AuthorID": "57200952034", "AffiliationID": "60007140", "AffiliationName": "Tom Baker Cancer Center"}}}
