ATP additionally reflects microbial biomass thus has potential as a surrogate marker of urinary tract infection (UTI). The optimum clinical sampling method for ATP urinalysis has not been established. We tested the potential of urinary ATP in the assessment of lower urinary tract symptoms, infection and inflammation, and validated sampling methods for clinical practice. Methods: A prospective, blinded, cross-sectional observational study of adult patients presenting with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) and asymptomatic controls, was conducted between October 2009 and October 2012. Urinary ATP was assayed by a luciferin-luciferase method, pyuria counted by microscopy of fresh unspun urine and symptoms assessed using validated questionnaires. The sample collection, storage and processing methods were also validated. Results: 75 controls and 340 patients with LUTS were grouped as without pyuria (n = 100), pyuria 1-9 wbc \u03bcl-1 (n = 120) and pyuria \u226510 wbc \u03bcl-1 (n = 120). Urinary ATP was higher in association with female gender, voiding symptoms, pyuria greater than 10 wbc \u03bcl-1 and negative MSU culture. ROC curve analysis showed no evidence of diagnostic test potential. The urinary ATP signal decayed with storage at 23\u00b0C but was prevented by immediate freezing at \u2264-20\u00b0, without boric acid preservative and without the need to centrifuge urine prior to freezing. Conclusions: Urinary ATP may have a role as a research tool but is unconvincing as a surrogate, clinical diagnostic marker.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Adenosine-5\u2032-triphosphate (ATP)", "Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS)", "Urinary tract infection (UTI)"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adenosine Triphosphate", "Adult", "Aged", "Biomarkers", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Humans", "Linear Models", "Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Multivariate Analysis", "Prospective Studies", "Pyuria", "Reference Values", "Risk Factors", "ROC Curve", "Severity of Illness Index", "Single-Blind Method", "Urinalysis", "Urinary Tract Infections"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84928719547", "SubjectAreas": [["Reproductive Medicine", "MEDI", "2743"], ["Urology", "MEDI", "2748"]], "AuthorData": {"56611436400": {"Name": "Gill K.", "AuthorID": "56611436400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Clinical Medicine, Division of Medicine, University College London, Wolfson House"}, "55547998600": {"Name": "Horsley H.", "AuthorID": "55547998600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Clinical Medicine, Division of Medicine, University College London, Wolfson House"}, "55547210700": {"Name": "Kupelian A.S.", "AuthorID": "55547210700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Clinical Medicine, Division of Medicine, University College London, Wolfson House"}, "56612009600": {"Name": "Sathiananamoorthy S.", "AuthorID": "56612009600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Clinical Medicine, Division of Medicine, University College London, Wolfson House"}, "23392797800": {"Name": "Khasriya R.", "AuthorID": "23392797800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Clinical Medicine, Division of Medicine, University College London, Wolfson House"}, "7003803831": {"Name": "Rohn J.L.", "AuthorID": "7003803831", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Clinical Medicine, Division of Medicine, University College London, Wolfson House"}, "7003536229": {"Name": "Malone-Lee J.", "AuthorID": "7003536229", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Clinical Medicine, Division of Medicine, University College London, Wolfson House"}, "6603354734": {"Name": "Baio G.", "AuthorID": "6603354734", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Statistics, University College London"}, "54790582600": {"Name": "De Iorio M.", "AuthorID": "54790582600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Statistics, University College London"}, "7005894042": {"Name": "Wildman S.S.", "AuthorID": "7005894042", "AffiliationID": "60110397, 60010818, 60021889", "AffiliationName": "Medway School of Pharmacy, Universities of Kent and Greenwich at Medway"}}}
