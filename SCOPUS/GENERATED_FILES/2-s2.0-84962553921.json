Interestingly, several clinically relevant and human pathogenic strains are inherently resistant towards lantibiotics. The expression of the genes responsible for lantibiotic resistance is regulated by a specific two-component system consisting of a histidine kinase and a response regulator. Here, we focused on a response regulator involved in lantibiotic resistance, NsrR from Streptococcus agalactiae, and determined the crystal structures of its N-terminal receiver domain and C-terminal DNA-binding effector domain. The C-terminal domain exhibits a fold that classifies NsrR as a member of the OmpR/PhoB subfamily of regulators. Amino acids involved in phosphorylation, dimerization, and DNA-binding were identified and demonstrated to be conserved in lantibiotic resistance regulators. Finally, a model of the full-length NsrR in the active and inactive state provides insights into protein dimerization and DNA-binding.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Amino Acid Sequence", "Anti-Bacterial Agents", "Bacterial Proteins", "Bacteriocins", "Catalytic Domain", "Cloning, Molecular", "Crystallography, X-Ray", "DNA", "Drug Resistance, Bacterial", "Humans", "Models, Molecular", "Molecular Sequence Data", "Protein Multimerization", "Protein Structure, Tertiary", "Sequence Alignment", "Streptococcal Infections", "Streptococcus agalactiae"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84962553921", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"55936196500": {"Name": "Khosa S.", "AuthorID": "55936196500", "AffiliationID": "60025310", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Biochemistry, Heinrich Heine University Duesseldorf"}, "35312368200": {"Name": "Schmitt L.", "AuthorID": "35312368200", "AffiliationID": "60025310", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Biochemistry, Heinrich Heine University Duesseldorf"}, "35973697300": {"Name": "Smits S.", "AuthorID": "35973697300", "AffiliationID": "60025310", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Biochemistry, Heinrich Heine University Duesseldorf"}, "55428511700": {"Name": "Hoeppner A.", "AuthorID": "55428511700", "AffiliationID": "60025310", "AffiliationName": "X-Ray Facility and Crystal Farm, Heinrich Heine University Duesseldorf"}, "7006624651": {"Name": "Gohlke H.", "AuthorID": "7006624651", "AffiliationID": "60025310", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Pharmaceutical and Medicinal Chemistry, Heinrich Heine University Duesseldorf"}}}
