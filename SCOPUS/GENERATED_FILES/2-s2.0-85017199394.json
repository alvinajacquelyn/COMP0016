IFN-\u03b3 production in this population distinctly correlated to parameters of clinical disease activity, inflammation, and neuronal damage. These V\u03b41 T lymphocytes belong to a population of innate T lymphocytes that recognize antigen in the context of CD1d/CD1c and which include reactivity to the myelin glycosphingolipid sulfatide. Importantly, patients treated with natalizumab, blocking leukocyte transmigration to central nervous system, had completely normalized levels of interferon-\u03b3-producing V\u03b41 T lymphocytes. A biomarker and early sign of demyelinating disease in MS is much warranted and would help identify immunopathogenesis and prognosis of disease as well as monitor success with adequate treatment. The present study identifies the V\u03b41 T lymphocytes as an early marker of MS and a possible link to understanding the disease etiology.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cerebrospinal fluid", "Gamma-delta T cells", "Interferon-gamma", "Multiple sclerosis", "Natalizumab", "Vdelta1 T cells"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85017199394", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"]], "AuthorData": {"55502190300": {"Name": "Singh A.", "AuthorID": "55502190300", "AffiliationID": "60079626, 60016437, 60027675", "AffiliationName": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Institute of Biomedicine, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg"}, "57211197033": {"Name": "Cardell S.", "AuthorID": "57211197033", "AffiliationID": "60079626, 60016437, 60027675", "AffiliationName": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Institute of Biomedicine, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg"}, "57193174708": {"Name": "Novakova L.", "AuthorID": "57193174708", "AffiliationID": "60027675, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Neuroscience, Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg"}, "36697625700": {"Name": "Axelsson M.", "AuthorID": "36697625700", "AffiliationID": "60027675, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Neuroscience, Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg"}, "7801366222": {"Name": "Malmestr\u00f6m C.", "AuthorID": "7801366222", "AffiliationID": "60027675, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Neuroscience, Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg"}, "57205654889": {"Name": "Lycke J.", "AuthorID": "57205654889", "AffiliationID": "60027675, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Neuroscience, Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg"}, "6701454676": {"Name": "Zetterberg H.", "AuthorID": "6701454676", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology"}}}
