Published by Elsevier B.V.To foster the transition to more sustainable energy systems, policymakers have been approving measures to improve energy efficiency as well as promoting smart grids. In this setting, building managers are encouraged to adapt their energy operations to real-time market and weather conditions. Yet, most fail to do so as they rely on conventional building energy management systems (BEMS) that have static temperature set points for heating and cooling equipment. In this paper, we investigate how effective policy measures are at improving building-level energy efficiency compared to a smart BEMS with dynamic temperature set points. To this end, we present an integrated optimisation model mimicking the smart BEMS that combines decisions on heating and cooling systems operations with decisions on energy sourcing. Using data from an Austrian and a Spanish building, we find that the smart BEMS results in greater reduction in energy consumption than a conventional BEMS with policy measures.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Dynamic energy consumption", "Energy-efficiency policy measures", "Non-linear optimisation", "Smart building energy management"], "IndexKeywords": ["Building energy management systems", "Building energy managements", "Dynamic energy consumption", "Heating and cooling systems", "Non-linear optimisation", "Policy measures", "Reduction in energy consumption", "Sustainable energy systems"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84919681380", "SubjectAreas": [["Civil and Structural Engineering", "ENGI", "2205"], ["Building and Construction", "ENGI", "2215"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"56457838600": {"Name": "Rocha P.", "AuthorID": "56457838600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Statistical Science, University College London"}, "7201954788": {"Name": "Siddiqui A.", "AuthorID": "7201954788", "AffiliationID": "60028378", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer and Systems Sciences, Stockholm University"}, "7103237238": {"Name": "Stadler M.", "AuthorID": "7103237238", "AffiliationID": "60007174", "AffiliationName": "Ernesto Orlando Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory"}}}
