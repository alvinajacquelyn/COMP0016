A model 4\u00d74 Hamiltonian is constructed in a diabatic electronic representation employing normal coordinates of vibrational modes and standard vibronic coupling theory. Extensive ab initio quantum chemistry calculations are carried out to determine the parameters of the Hamiltonian and energetic ordering of the electronic states. The topographical features of the latter are examined at length and several conical intersections are established. Nuclear dynamics calculations on coupled electronic states are carried out from first principles by propagating wave packet. Theoretically calculated broad band vibronic structure of the four states are found to be in good accord with the experimental results.", "AuthorKeywords": ["conical intersection", "diabatic Hamiltonian", "vibronic coupling"], "IndexKeywords": ["Ab-initio quantum chemistry calculations", "Conical intersection", "Coupled electronic state", "Diabatic", "Electronic representations", "Topographical features", "Vibronic coupling", "Vibronic structure"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84960408121", "SubjectAreas": [["Biophysics", "BIOC", "1304"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"]], "AuthorData": {"56506501100": {"Name": "Sarkar R.", "AuthorID": "56506501100", "AffiliationID": "60029516", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, University of Hyderabad"}, "7102526835": {"Name": "Mahapatra S.", "AuthorID": "7102526835", "AffiliationID": "60029516", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, University of Hyderabad"}}}
