Methods: Individual-level data of people with epilepsy treated with perampanel at 45 European centers were merged into a single dataset. Prespecified outcomes were: 1-year retention rate, 1-year seizure freedom rate (duration \u22656 months), and incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs). In addition, relationships were explored with logistic regression analyses. Results: The full analysis set comprised 2396 people: 95% had focal seizures; median epilepsy duration was 27 years; median number of concomitant antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) was 2; and median prior AEDs was 6. One-year retention rate was 48% (1117/2332; 95% confidence interval [CI] 46-50%), and 1-year seizure-free rate (\u22656-month duration) was 9.2% (74/803; 95% CI 7-11%). Median treatment duration was 11.3 months (1832 patient-years); median dose was 8 mg. In 388 individuals with available data at 3, 6, and 12 months, responder rates were 42%, 46%, and 39%, respectively. During the first year, TEAEs were reported in 68% of participants (1317/1497; 95% CI 66-70%). Logistic regression found higher age at perampanel initiation was associated with higher seizure-free rate, and higher number of prior AEDs with lower seizure-free rate and lower rates of somatic TEAEs. In 135 individuals aged \u226565 years, 1-year retention rate was 48% and seizure-free rate was 28%. Significance: Across a large, treatment-resistant population, add-on perampanel was retained for \u22651 year by 48% of individuals, and 9% were seizure-free for \u22656 months. TEAEs were in line with previous reports in routine clinical use, and less frequent than in the clinical trial setting. No new or unexpected TEAEs were seen. Despite the limitations of observational studies, our data indicate that some individuals may derive a marked benefit from the use of perampanel.", "AuthorKeywords": ["antiepileptic drug", "elderly", "pharmacotherapy", "real-world evidence", "seizure freedom"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Age Factors", "Anticonvulsants", "Datasets as Topic", "Epilepsy", "Europe", "Humans", "Kaplan-Meier Estimate", "Longitudinal Studies", "Middle Aged", "Outcome Assessment (Health Care)", "Pyridones", "Regression Analysis", "Retrospective Studies", "Time Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85052576911", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"56422394400": {"Name": "Rohracher A.", "AuthorID": "56422394400", "AffiliationID": "60014976", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Christian Doppler Medical Center and Center for Cognitive Neuroscience, Paracelsus Medical University"}, "57143766400": {"Name": "Zimmermann G.", "AuthorID": "57143766400", "AffiliationID": "60014976", "AffiliationName": "Spinal Cord Injury and Tissue Regeneration Center Salzburg, Paracelsus Medical University"}, "54917691600": {"Name": "Trinka E.", "AuthorID": "54917691600", "AffiliationID": "60023048", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Public Health, Medical Decision Making and HTA, Private University for Health Sciences Medical Informatics and Technology"}, "8589497100": {"Name": "Villanueva V.", "AuthorID": "8589497100", "AffiliationID": "60032451", "AffiliationName": "University Hospital and Polytechnic La Fe"}, "8895470000": {"Name": "Garamendi I.", "AuthorID": "8895470000", "AffiliationID": "60029271", "AffiliationName": "Cruces University Hospital"}, "57188659835": {"Name": "Sander J.W.", "AuthorID": "57188659835", "AffiliationID": "60027759", "AffiliationName": "Stichting Epilepsie Instellingen Nederland (SEIN)"}, "55913795300": {"Name": "Wehner T.", "AuthorID": "55913795300", "AffiliationID": "60019630", "AffiliationName": "Ruhr-Epileptology, Department of Neurology, Knappschaftskrankenhaus Bochum"}, "24173533500": {"Name": "Shankar R.", "AuthorID": "24173533500", "AffiliationID": "60170524", "AffiliationName": "Cornwall Partnership NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7005756071": {"Name": "Ben-Menachem E.", "AuthorID": "7005756071", "AffiliationID": "60027675, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg"}, "7103381552": {"Name": "Brodie M.J.", "AuthorID": "7103381552", "AffiliationID": "116607226", "AffiliationName": "Epilepsy Unit, West Glasgow ACH"}, "57201309007": {"Name": "Pensel M.C.", "AuthorID": "57201309007", "AffiliationID": "60030465", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epileptology, University Hospital of Bonn"}, "55080393400": {"Name": "R\u00e1cz A.", "AuthorID": "55080393400", "AffiliationID": "60030465", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epileptology, University Hospital of Bonn"}, "7005055979": {"Name": "Di Gennaro G.", "AuthorID": "7005055979", "AffiliationID": "60023773", "AffiliationName": "IRCCS NEUROMED (IS)"}, "57190091613": {"Name": "Maurousset A.", "AuthorID": "57190091613", "AffiliationID": "60159370, 60027381", "AffiliationName": "University Hospital Bretonneau and INSERM U 930"}, "24067864600": {"Name": "Strzelczyk A.", "AuthorID": "24067864600", "AffiliationID": "60007762", "AffiliationName": "Epilepsy Center Frankfurt Rhine-Main, Goethe University"}, "24339474300": {"Name": "Rheims S.", "AuthorID": "24339474300", "AffiliationID": "60012357, 60102126", "AffiliationName": "Department of Functional Neurology and Epileptology, Hospices Civils de Lyon and University of Lyon"}, "35307345600": {"Name": "Menzler K.", "AuthorID": "35307345600", "AffiliationID": "60002681", "AffiliationName": "Epilepsy Center Hessen, University Hospital Marburg"}, "6603017052": {"Name": "Bertol-Alegre V.", "AuthorID": "6603017052", "AffiliationID": "60022336", "AffiliationName": "University Hospital Miguel Servet"}, "6603804985": {"Name": "Garc\u00eda-Morales I.", "AuthorID": "6603804985", "AffiliationID": "60032461", "AffiliationName": "Hospital Clinic San Carlos"}, "6602072472": {"Name": "L\u00f3pez-Gonz\u00e1lez F.J.", "AuthorID": "6602072472", "AffiliationID": "60002983", "AffiliationName": "University Hospital Complex Santiago"}, "9233524100": {"Name": "Toledo M.", "AuthorID": "9233524100", "AffiliationID": "60012486", "AffiliationName": "University Hospital Vall d'Hebron"}, "57203654080": {"Name": "Carpenter K.J.", "AuthorID": "57203654080", "AffiliationID": "114402328", "AffiliationName": "Freelance Medical Writer"}}}
