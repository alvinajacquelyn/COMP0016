The IC comprises a wideband high power current driver (up to 6 mAp-p output current), a low noise voltage amplifier and two shape sensor buffers. The IC has been designed in a 0.35-\u03bcm CMOS technology. It operates from \u00b19 V power supplies and occupies a total die area of 5 mm2. Post-layout simulations are presented.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Active electrodes", "CMOS technology", "Electrical impe dance tomography (EIT)", "Electrical impedance tomography", "Low noise voltage amplifiers", "Output current", "Post layout simulation", "Real time monitoring"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84983442566", "SubjectAreas": [["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"56673175100": {"Name": "Wu Y.", "AuthorID": "56673175100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "36936417600": {"Name": "Langlois P.", "AuthorID": "36936417600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "6603720155": {"Name": "Demosthenous A.", "AuthorID": "6603720155", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "6603764288": {"Name": "Bayford R.", "AuthorID": "6603764288", "AffiliationID": "60014105", "AffiliationName": "Department of Natural Sciences, Middlesex University"}}}
