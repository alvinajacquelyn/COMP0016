The catalysts used were Co/Al<inf>2</inf>O<inf>3</inf>, Cu/Al<inf>2</inf>O<inf>3</inf>, Fe/Al<inf>2</inf>O<inf>3</inf>, and Ni/Al<inf>2</inf>O<inf>3</inf>. The pyrolysis temperature and catalyst temperature were 600 and 800 \u00b0C, respectively. The fresh catalysts were analyzed by temperature-programmed reduction and X-ray diffraction. The product gases including hydrogen were analyzed by gas chromatography, and the carbon nanotubes were characterized by scanning and transmission electron microscopy and Raman spectrometry. The results showed that the Ni/Al<inf>2</inf>O<inf>3</inf> catalyst produced high-quality multi-walled carbon nanotubes along with the highest H<inf>2</inf> yield of 18.14 mmol g<sup>-1</sup> tire compared to the other catalysts, while the Co/Al<inf>2</inf>O<inf>3</inf> and Cu/Al<inf>2</inf>O<inf>3</inf> catalysts produced lower hydrogen yields, which is suggested to be associated with the formation of amorphous-type carbons on the surface of the Co/Al<inf>2</inf>O<inf>3</inf> and Cu/Al<inf>2</inf>O<inf>3</inf> catalysts.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Catalyst temperature", "Fresh catalysts", "High quality", "Hydrogen yields", "Pyrolysis temperature", "Raman spectrometries", "Scanning and transmission electron microscopy", "Temperature-programmed reduction"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84930227239", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"], ["Fuel Technology", "ENER", "2103"], ["Energy Engineering and Power Technology", "ENER", "2102"]], "AuthorData": {"56662820300": {"Name": "Zhang Y.", "AuthorID": "56662820300", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "Energy Research Institute, University of Leeds"}, "36129840500": {"Name": "Nahil M.", "AuthorID": "36129840500", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "Energy Research Institute, University of Leeds"}, "7404956386": {"Name": "Williams P.", "AuthorID": "7404956386", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "Energy Research Institute, University of Leeds"}, "14424662900": {"Name": "Wu C.", "AuthorID": "14424662900", "AffiliationID": "60030469", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University of Hull"}}}
