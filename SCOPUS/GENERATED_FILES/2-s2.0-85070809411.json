However, the role of adverse emotional traits such as trait anxiety and rumination in bilingual cognitive control has not been established. Attentional Control Theory holds that anxiety disproportionately impacts processing efficiency (typically measured via reaction time) in comparison to accuracy (performance effectiveness). We administered eye tracking and behavioural measures of inhibition to young, healthy monolingual and highly proficient bilingual adults. We found that trait anxiety was a reliable risk factor for decreased inhibitory control accuracy in bilingual but not monolingual participants. These findings, therefore, indicate that adverse emotional traits may differentially modulate performance in monolingual and bilingual individuals, an interpretation which has implications both for ACT and future research on bilingual cognition.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Attentional Control Theory", "Bilingualism", "Executive function", "Eye tracking", "Inhibitory control", "Rumination", "Trait anxiety"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85070809411", "SubjectAreas": [["Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics", "AGRI", "1105"], ["Development", "SOCI", "3303"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Psychology (all)", "PSYC", "3200"], ["Behavioral Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2802"]], "AuthorData": {"57118241900": {"Name": "Ouzia J.", "AuthorID": "57118241900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Multilanguage and Cognition lab (MULTAC), University College London"}, "36142674300": {"Name": "Filippi R.", "AuthorID": "36142674300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Multilanguage and Cognition lab (MULTAC), University College London"}, "7005381462": {"Name": "Bright P.", "AuthorID": "7005381462", "AffiliationID": "60000913", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Science and Engineering, Department of Psychology, Anglia Ruskin University"}}}
