All rights reserved.Two mummies of the Hungarian mummy collection from V\u00e1c were the subjects of anthropological, paleopathological, radiological, paleomicrobiological, paleohistological and paleoproteomic studies. Both individuals belonged to the same family. The father, J\u00f3zsef Nigrovits (No 29), died at the age of 55 on the 11th of November 1793; his son, Antal Nigrovits (No 54), died on the 16th of July 1803, at the age of 22. They lived in the 18th century in V\u00e1c, a small town in northern Hungary. The macroscopic examination of the son showed a severely deformed neck and back region; the father has no visible mark of any illnesses. As earlier researches showed that tuberculosis was widespread in the community, the etiology of these deformities was examined. The paleomicrobiological results found that both individuals were infected with tuberculosis. Although they suffered from TB, the CT scan data of the bodies and their 3D reconstructions showed no skeletal evidence of tuberculosis. The deformity of the son turned to be a developmental abnormality of unknown origin, but no Pott's gibbus was present.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Hungary", "Mummies", "Mycobacterium tuberculosis", "Paleomicrobiology", "Paleopathology", "V\u00e1c"], "IndexKeywords": ["DNA, Bacterial", "History, 18th Century", "Humans", "Hungary", "Joint Deformities, Acquired", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Mummies", "Mycobacterium tuberculosis", "Paleopathology", "Polymerase Chain Reaction", "Tomography, X-Ray Computed", "Tuberculosis, Osteoarticular", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84931575036", "SubjectAreas": [["Microbiology", "IMMU", "2404"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"], ["Microbiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2726"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"6506973016": {"Name": "Szikossy I.", "AuthorID": "6506973016", "AffiliationID": "60010644", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anthropology, Hungarian Natural History Museum"}, "16637693000": {"Name": "Kust\u00e1r \u00c1.", "AuthorID": "16637693000", "AffiliationID": "60010644", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anthropology, Hungarian Natural History Museum"}, "7004366473": {"Name": "Pap I.", "AuthorID": "7004366473", "AffiliationID": "60010644", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anthropology, Hungarian Natural History Museum"}, "6601976533": {"Name": "P\u00e1lfi G.", "AuthorID": "6601976533", "AffiliationID": "60027332", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biological Anthropology, University of Szeged"}, "7103079286": {"Name": "Moln\u00e1r E.", "AuthorID": "7103079286", "AffiliationID": "60027332", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biological Anthropology, University of Szeged"}, "6602166128": {"Name": "Karlinger K.", "AuthorID": "6602166128", "AffiliationID": "60024812", "AffiliationName": "Semmelweis University, Department of Diagnostic Radiology and Oncotherapy"}, "57091280600": {"Name": "Kov\u00e1cs B.", "AuthorID": "57091280600", "AffiliationID": "60024812", "AffiliationName": "Semmelweis University, Department of Diagnostic Radiology and Oncotherapy"}, "56199956600": {"Name": "Korom C.", "AuthorID": "56199956600", "AffiliationID": "60024812", "AffiliationName": "Semmelweis University, Department of Diagnostic Radiology and Oncotherapy"}, "7202779621": {"Name": "Schultz M.", "AuthorID": "7202779621", "AffiliationID": "60031514", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anatomy, University Medical School G\u00f6ttingen"}, "8928648600": {"Name": "Schmidt-Schultz T.", "AuthorID": "8928648600", "AffiliationID": "60031514", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anatomy, University Medical School G\u00f6ttingen"}, "55242127500": {"Name": "Spigelman M.", "AuthorID": "55242127500", "AffiliationID": "60005037, 60005681", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anatomy and Anthropology, Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University"}, "6701847443": {"Name": "Donoghue H.", "AuthorID": "6701847443", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for the History of Medicine, Division of Biosciences, University College London"}}}
