Methods Cross-sectional analysis of Facebook related to four congenital anomalies: anorectal malformation (ARM), congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH), congenital heart disease (CHD) and hypospadias/epispadias (HS/ES). A keyword search was performed to identify relevant Groups/Pages. An anonymous survey was posted to obtain quantitative/qualitative data on users and their healthcare needs. Results 54 Groups and 24 Pages were identified (ARM: 10 Groups; CDH: 9 Groups, 7 Pages; CHD: 32 Groups, 17 Pages; HS/ES: 3 Groups), with 16,191 Group members and 48,766 Page likes. 868/1103 (79%) of respondents were parents. Male:female ratio was 1:10.9. 65% of the users were 26\u201340 years old. Common reasons for joining these Groups/Pages included: seeking support, education, making friends, and providing support to others. 932/1103 (84%) would like healthcare professionals (HCPs) to actively participate in their Group. 31% of the respondents felt that they did not receive enough support from their healthcare system. 97% of the respondents would like to join a Group linked to their primary hospital. Conclusions Facebook Groups/Pages related to congenital anomalies are highly populated and active. There is a need for HCPs and policy makers to better understand and participate in social media to support families and improve patient care.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Anorectal malformation", "Congenital anomalies", "Congenital diaphragmatic hernia", "Congenital heart disease", "Epispadias", "Facebook", "Hypospadias", "Online support groups", "Social media"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Anorectal Malformations", "Attitude to Health", "Congenital Abnormalities", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Epispadias", "Female", "Heart Defects, Congenital", "Hernias, Diaphragmatic, Congenital", "Humans", "Hypospadias", "Male", "Parents", "Qualitative Research", "Social Media", "Social Support", "Surveys and Questionnaires"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84981743865", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"]], "AuthorData": {"36824824300": {"Name": "Jacobs R.", "AuthorID": "36824824300", "AffiliationID": "60032542", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric and Neonatal Surgery, St. George's University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57190619277": {"Name": "Brennan K.", "AuthorID": "57190619277", "AffiliationID": "60032542", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric and Neonatal Surgery, St. George's University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "8148554300": {"Name": "Sinha C.K.", "AuthorID": "8148554300", "AffiliationID": "60032542", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric and Neonatal Surgery, St. George's University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7102544316": {"Name": "Giuliani S.", "AuthorID": "7102544316", "AffiliationID": "60032542", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric and Neonatal Surgery, St. George's University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57190620260": {"Name": "Boyd L.", "AuthorID": "57190620260", "AffiliationID": "60029329", "AffiliationName": "St. George's University of London, Cranmer Terrace"}}}
