In particular, understanding the roles of different hosts, how to measure contact and infection patterns, heterogeneities in contact rates, and the dynamics close to elimination are all relevant challenges, regardless of the mode of transmission. However, there remain a number of challenges that are specific and unique to modelling vector-borne diseases and macroparasites. Moreover, many of the neglected tropical diseases which are currently targeted for control and elimination are vector-borne, macroparasitic, or both, and so this article includes challenges which will assist in accelerating the control of these high-burden diseases. Here, we discuss the challenges of indirect measures of infection in humans, whether through vectors or transmission life stages and in estimating the contribution of different host groups to transmission. We also discuss the issues of \"evolution-proof\" interventions against vector-borne disease.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Helminths", "Macroparasites", "Neglected tropical diseases", "Vector-borne disease", "Vectors"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Disease Reservoirs", "Disease Transmission, Infectious", "Disease Vectors", "Humans", "Incidence", "Models, Statistical", "Neglected Diseases", "Parasitic Diseases", "Risk Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84988265028", "SubjectAreas": [["Parasitology", "IMMU", "2405"], ["Epidemiology", "MEDI", "2713"], ["Microbiology", "IMMU", "2404"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"], ["Virology", "IMMU", "2406"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"57202501909": {"Name": "Hollingsworth T.D.", "AuthorID": "57202501909", "AffiliationID": "60020934", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Sciences, Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine"}, "8756780800": {"Name": "Pulliam J.R.C.", "AuthorID": "8756780800", "AffiliationID": "60006577, 60028170", "AffiliationName": "Fogarty International Center, National Institutes of Health"}, "35555137200": {"Name": "Lloyd A.L.", "AuthorID": "35555137200", "AffiliationID": "60004923", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics and Biomathematics Graduate Program, North Carolina State University"}, "26634997200": {"Name": "Funk S.", "AuthorID": "26634997200", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Centre for the Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "56254185000": {"Name": "Truscott J.E.", "AuthorID": "56254185000", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "London Centre for Neglected Tropical Disease Research, Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London"}, "6701600227": {"Name": "Isham V.", "AuthorID": "6701600227", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Statistical Science, University College"}}}
