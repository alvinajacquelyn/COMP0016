Distinctions between these sources of interference can be found when people search for a target in multiple rapid streams instead of a single stream: voluntary encoding of a preceding target often elicits subsequent perceptual lapses across the visual field, whereas spontaneous attention to emotionally salient distractors appears to elicit a spatially localized lapse, giving rise to a theoretical account suggesting that emotional distractors and subsequent targets compete spatiotemporally during rapid serial visual processing. We used gaze-contingent eye-tracking to probe the roles of spatiotemporal competition and memory encoding on the spatial distribution of interference caused by emotional distractors, while also ruling out the role of eye-gaze in driving differences in spatial distribution. Spontaneous target perception impairments caused by emotional distractors were localized to the distractor location regardless of where participants fixated. But when emotional distractors were task-relevant, perceptual lapses occurred across both streams while remaining strongest at the distractor location. These results suggest that spatiotemporal competition and memory encoding reflect a dual-route impact of emotional stimuli on target perception during rapid visual processing.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Attentional blink", "Attentional capture", "Visual awareness"], "IndexKeywords": ["Attention", "Blinking", "Emotions", "Female", "Fixation, Ocular", "Form Perception", "Humans", "Male", "Memory", "Psychomotor Performance", "Space Perception", "Visual Perception", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85034267412", "SubjectAreas": [["Language and Linguistics", "ARTS", "1203"], ["Experimental and Cognitive Psychology", "PSYC", "3205"], ["Sensory Systems", "NEUR", "2809"], ["Linguistics and Language", "SOCI", "3310"]], "AuthorData": {"55343051300": {"Name": "Kennedy B.L.", "AuthorID": "55343051300", "AffiliationID": "60029311", "AffiliationName": "Leonard Davis School of Gerontology, University of Southern California"}, "56402562600": {"Name": "Pearson D.", "AuthorID": "56402562600", "AffiliationID": "60028333", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, University of New South Wales"}, "57191371784": {"Name": "Sutton D.J.", "AuthorID": "57191371784", "AffiliationID": "60028333", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, University of New South Wales"}, "14424213800": {"Name": "Beesley T.", "AuthorID": "14424213800", "AffiliationID": "60023643", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Lancaster University"}, "6601986889": {"Name": "Most S.B.", "AuthorID": "6601986889", "AffiliationID": "60028333", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, University of New South Wales"}}}
