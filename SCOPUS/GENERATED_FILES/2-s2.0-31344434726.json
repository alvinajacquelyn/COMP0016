However, historical associations of longevity with paternal ancestors' food supply in the slow growth period (SGP) in mid childhood have been reported. Using the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC), we identified 166 fathers who reported starting smoking before age 11 years and compared the growth of their offspring with those with a later paternal onset of smoking, after correcting for confounders. We analysed food supply effects on offspring and grandchild mortality risk ratios (RR) using 303 probands and their 1818 parents and grandparents from the 1890, 1905 and 1920 \u00d6verkalix cohorts, northern Sweden. After appropriate adjustment, early paternal smoking is associated with greater body mass index (BMI) at 9 years in sons, but not daughters. Sex-specific effects were also shown in the \u00d6verkalix data; paternal grandfather's food supply was only linked to the mortality RR of grandsons, while paternal grandmother's food supply was only associated with the granddaughters' mortality RR. These transgenerational effects were observed with exposure during the SGP (both grandparents) or fetal/infant life (grandmothers) but not during either grandparent's puberty. We conclude that sex-specific, male-line transgenerational responses exist in humans and hypothesise that these transmissions are mediated by the sex chromosomes, X and Y. Such responses add an entirely new dimension to the study of gene-environment interactions in development and health. \u00a9 2006 Nature Publishing Group All rights reserved.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Body mass index mortality", "Paternal ancestors", "Sex-specificity", "Slow growth period", "Transgenerational responses"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-31344434726", "SubjectAreas": [["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Genetics (clinical)", "MEDI", "2716"]], "AuthorData": {"7006415948": {"Name": "Pembrey M.", "AuthorID": "7006415948", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, Bristol University"}, "55665775100": {"Name": "Northstone K.", "AuthorID": "55665775100", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, Bristol University"}, "35233306100": {"Name": "Golding J.", "AuthorID": "35233306100", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, Bristol University"}, "7004308908": {"Name": "Bygren L.", "AuthorID": "7004308908", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biosciences, Preventive Nutrition Karolinska Institute"}, "6602254222": {"Name": "Kaati G.", "AuthorID": "6602254222", "AffiliationID": "60031040", "AffiliationName": "Department of Public Health and Clinical Medicine, Ume\u00e5 University"}, "8892637000": {"Name": "Edvinsson S.", "AuthorID": "8892637000", "AffiliationID": "60031040", "AffiliationName": "Department of Demographic Database, Ume\u00e5 University"}, "7005331698": {"Name": "Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m M.", "AuthorID": "7005331698", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biosciences, Preventive Nutrition Karolinska Institute"}}}
