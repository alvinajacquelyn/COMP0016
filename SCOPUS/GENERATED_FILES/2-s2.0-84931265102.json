Theoretical differential and integral cross sections are calculated using the UK molecular R-matrix codes in the energy range from 1 eV to 10 eV. The dynamic interaction is represented within a static-exchange plus polarization model based on the use of an extensive orbital sets. Both molecule have a large permanent dipole moment and a Born closure procedure is used to get more reliable cross sections. These molecules show low-energy, \u03c0\u2217 resonances at 2.4 and 2.7 eV for CH3CN and CH3NC, respectively; and very broad \u03c3\u2217 ones at about 6 eV. Our results suggest that electron collisions with CH3CN / CH3NC show similar properties to those found for electron collisions with HCN / HNC.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Atomic and Molecular Collisions"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84931265102", "SubjectAreas": [["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"]], "AuthorData": {"7401866863": {"Name": "Fujimoto M.M.", "AuthorID": "7401866863", "AffiliationID": "60015043", "AffiliationName": "Departamento de F\u00edsica, Universidade Federal Do Paran\u00e1"}, "56688253700": {"Name": "De Lima E.V.R.", "AuthorID": "56688253700", "AffiliationID": "60015043", "AffiliationName": "Departamento de F\u00edsica, Universidade Federal Do Paran\u00e1"}, "7101645601": {"Name": "Tennyson J.", "AuthorID": "7101645601", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}}}
