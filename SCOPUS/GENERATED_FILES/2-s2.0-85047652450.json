Worldwide, prevalence of hypertension is highest in the African region (46%) and a very high proportion is undiagnosed. This study examined diagnosed and undiagnosed hypertension in The Gambian adult population. Methods: Data were collected in 2010 from a nationally representative random sample of 4111 adults aged 25\u201364 years, using the World Health Organization STEPwise cross-sectional survey methods. Analyses were restricted to non-pregnant participants with three valid blood pressure measurements (n \u00bc 3573). We conducted gender-stratified univariate and multivariate regression analyses to identify the strongest sociodemographic, behavioural and biological risk factors associated with hypertension. Results: Almost one-third of adults were hypertensive; a high proportion were undiagnosed, particularly among men (86% of men vs 71% of women with hypertension, P < 0.001). Rural and semi-urban residents and overweight/obese persons had increased odds of hypertension. Compared with urban residents, participants from one of the most rural regions had higher odds of hypertension among both men [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 3.2; 95% CI: 1.6\u20136.4] and women (AOR 2.5; 95% CI: 1.3\u20134.6). Other factors strongly associated with hypertension in multivariate analyses were age, smoking, physical inactivity and ethnicity. Conclusions: Rural and semi-urban residence were strongly associated with hypertension, contrary to what has been found in similar studies in sub-Saharan Africa. Intervention to reduce the burden of hypertension in The Gambia could be further targeted towards rural areas.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Gambia", "Health examination survey", "Hypertension", "Sub-Saharan Africa", "WHO STEP survey"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85047652450", "SubjectAreas": [["Epidemiology", "MEDI", "2713"]], "AuthorData": {"57205673381": {"Name": "Cham B.", "AuthorID": "57205673381", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL, Department of Epidemiology and Public Health"}, "35363010600": {"Name": "Scholes S.", "AuthorID": "35363010600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Department of Epidemiology and Public Health"}, "55208167800": {"Name": "Fat L.N.", "AuthorID": "55208167800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Department of Epidemiology and Public Health"}, "7005836049": {"Name": "Mindell J.S.", "AuthorID": "7005836049", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Department of Epidemiology and Public Health"}, "57205667571": {"Name": "Badjie O.", "AuthorID": "57205667571", "AffiliationID": "112595962", "AffiliationName": "Non-Communicable Diseases Unit, Ministry of Health and Social Welfare"}}}
