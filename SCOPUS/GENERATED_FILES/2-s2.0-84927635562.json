All rights reserved.We examine the efficacy of conventional cognitive behavioral therapy (CCBT) versus religiously integratedCBT (RCBT) in personswithmajor depression and chronic medical illness. Participants were randomized to either CCBT (n = 67) or RCBT (n = 65). The intervention in both groups consisted of ten 50-minute sessions delivered remotely during 12 weeks (94% by telephone). Adherence to treatment was similar, except in more religious participants in whom adherence to RCBTwas slightly greater (85.7% vs. 65.9%, p = 0.10). The intention-to-treat analysis at 12 weeks indicated no significant difference in outcome between the two groups (B = 0.33; SE, 1.80; p = 0.86). Response rates and remission rateswere also similar. Overall religiosity interacted with treatment group (B = -0.10; SE, 0.05; p = 0.048), suggesting that RCBTwas slightly more efficacious in the more religious participants. These preliminary findings suggest that CCBT and RCBT are equivalent treatments of major depression in persons with chronic medical illness. Efficacy, as well as adherence, may be affected by client religiosity.", "AuthorKeywords": ["CBT", "chronic illness", "major depression", "psychotherapy", "randomized clinical trial", "Religious", "spiritual"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Chronic Disease", "Cognitive Therapy", "Comorbidity", "Depressive Disorder, Major", "Faith Healing", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Patient Compliance", "Pilot Projects", "Religion and Psychology", "Telephone", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84927635562", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"26642890600": {"Name": "Koenig H.G.", "AuthorID": "26642890600", "AffiliationID": "60017763", "AffiliationName": "School of Public Health, Ningxia Medical University"}, "7102484277": {"Name": "Pearce M.J.", "AuthorID": "7102484277", "AffiliationID": "60014653", "AffiliationName": "School of Medicine, University of Maryland"}, "57202975091": {"Name": "Cohen H.J.", "AuthorID": "57202975091", "AffiliationID": "60008724", "AffiliationName": "Center for Spirituality, Theology and Health, Duke University"}, "7402428046": {"Name": "Nelson B.", "AuthorID": "7402428046", "AffiliationID": "60004582", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, King Abdulaziz University"}, "7006670553": {"Name": "Berk L.S.", "AuthorID": "7006670553", "AffiliationID": "60113483", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology and Human Anatomy, School of Medicine, Loma Linda University"}, "56179067400": {"Name": "Shaw S.F.", "AuthorID": "56179067400", "AffiliationID": "101479064", "AffiliationName": "Department of Research, Glendale Adventist Medical Center"}, "56592379900": {"Name": "Nies D.", "AuthorID": "56592379900", "AffiliationID": "101479064", "AffiliationName": "Department of Research, Glendale Adventist Medical Center"}, "7006544180": {"Name": "Robins C.J.", "AuthorID": "7006544180", "AffiliationID": "60113147", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology and Neuroscience, Duke University Medical Center"}, "7004653266": {"Name": "Daher N.S.", "AuthorID": "7004653266", "AffiliationID": "60113483", "AffiliationName": "Allied Health Studies, School of Allied Health Professions, Loma Linda University"}, "7103230220": {"Name": "Bellinger D.L.", "AuthorID": "7103230220", "AffiliationID": "60113483", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology and Human Anatomy, School of Medicine, Loma Linda University"}, "7004253169": {"Name": "Pargament K.I.", "AuthorID": "7004253169", "AffiliationID": "60018475", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Bowling Green State University"}, "26221441400": {"Name": "Rosmarin D.H.", "AuthorID": "26221441400", "AffiliationID": "60002746, 60015527", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, McLean Hospital/Harvard Medical School"}, "18839204600": {"Name": "Vasegh S.", "AuthorID": "18839204600", "AffiliationID": "60018934", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences"}, "7003374163": {"Name": "Kristeller J.", "AuthorID": "7003374163", "AffiliationID": "60008599", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Indiana State University"}, "8095594600": {"Name": "Juthani N.", "AuthorID": "8095594600", "AffiliationID": "60002388", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, Albert Einstein College of Medicine"}, "56591241100": {"Name": "King M.B.", "AuthorID": "56591241100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, Faculty of Brain Sciences, University College London"}}}
