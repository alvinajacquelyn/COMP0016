All rights reserved.B cells are increasingly recognized as playing an important role in the ongoing control of hepatitis B virus (HBV). The development of antibodies against the viral surface antigen (HBV surface antigen [HBsAgs]) constitutes the hallmark of resolution of acute infection and is a therapeutic goal for functional cure of chronic HBV (CHB). We characterized B cells directly ex vivo from the blood and liver of patients with CHB to investigate constraints on their antiviral potential. Unexpectedly, we found that HBsAg-specific B cells persisted in the blood and liver of many patients with CHB and were enriched for T-bet, a signature of antiviral potential in B cells. However, purified, differentiated HBsAg-specific B cells from patients with CHB had defective antibody production, consistent with undetectable anti-HBs antibodies in vivo. HBsAg-specific and global B cells had an accumulation of CD21-CD27- atypical memory B cells (atMBC) with high expression of inhibitory receptors, including PD-1. These atMBC demonstrated altered signaling, homing, differentiation into antibody-producing cells, survival, and antiviral/proinflammatory cytokine production that could be partially rescued by PD-1 blockade. Analysis of B cells within healthy and HBV-infected livers implicated the combination of this tolerogenic niche and HBV infection in driving PD-1hiatMBC and impairing B cell immunity.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "B-Lymphocytes", "Female", "Hepatitis B Antibodies", "Hepatitis B Surface Antigens", "Hepatitis B virus", "Hepatitis B, Chronic", "Humans", "Liver", "Lymphocyte Activation", "Male", "Middle Aged"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85054428639", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"57196075608": {"Name": "Kennedy P.T.F.", "AuthorID": "57196075608", "AffiliationID": "60021435", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Immunobiology, Barts and the London"}, "55934460700": {"Name": "Gill U.S.", "AuthorID": "55934460700", "AffiliationID": "60021435", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Immunobiology, Barts and the London"}, "35269482300": {"Name": "Mauri C.", "AuthorID": "35269482300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Medicine, University College London"}, "23975740200": {"Name": "Blair P.A.", "AuthorID": "23975740200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Medicine, University College London"}, "57214542248": {"Name": "Pelletier N.", "AuthorID": "57214542248", "AffiliationID": "60008201", "AffiliationName": "Roche Innovation Center"}, "57194745480": {"Name": "Burton A.R.", "AuthorID": "57194745480", "AffiliationID": "60176023", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity, Institute of Immunity and Transplantation, UCL, Rayne Building"}, "55613142700": {"Name": "Pallett L.J.", "AuthorID": "55613142700", "AffiliationID": "60176023", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity, Institute of Immunity and Transplantation, UCL, Rayne Building"}, "36630795600": {"Name": "McCoy L.E.", "AuthorID": "36630795600", "AffiliationID": "60176023", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity, Institute of Immunity and Transplantation, UCL, Rayne Building"}, "57204093393": {"Name": "Suveizdyte K.", "AuthorID": "57204093393", "AffiliationID": "60176023", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity, Institute of Immunity and Transplantation, UCL, Rayne Building"}, "57204086766": {"Name": "Amin O.E.", "AuthorID": "57204086766", "AffiliationID": "60176023", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity, Institute of Immunity and Transplantation, UCL, Rayne Building"}, "54882279100": {"Name": "Swadling L.", "AuthorID": "54882279100", "AffiliationID": "60176023", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity, Institute of Immunity and Transplantation, UCL, Rayne Building"}, "57204087684": {"Name": "Alberts E.", "AuthorID": "57204087684", "AffiliationID": "60176023", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity, Institute of Immunity and Transplantation, UCL, Rayne Building"}, "7402965763": {"Name": "Davidson B.R.", "AuthorID": "7402965763", "AffiliationID": "60176023", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity, Institute of Immunity and Transplantation, UCL, Rayne Building"}, "7003333032": {"Name": "Maini M.K.", "AuthorID": "7003333032", "AffiliationID": "60176023", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity, Institute of Immunity and Transplantation, UCL, Rayne Building"}}}
