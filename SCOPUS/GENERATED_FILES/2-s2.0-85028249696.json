Health Expectations. Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.RESULTS: End-user input (i) guided the direction of the research, (ii) contributed to a typology of interventions and outcomes, (iii) contributed to the direction of data analysis and (iv) contributed to the robustness of the syntheses by demonstrating the alignment of interim findings with lived experiences. Challenges included (i) managing expectations, (ii) managing the intensity of emotion, (iii) ensuring that involvement was fruitful for all not just the researcher, (iv) our capacity to communicate and manage the process and (v) engendering a sense of involvement amongst end-users.CONCLUSIONS: End-user involvement was an important aspect of this project. To minimize challenges in future projects, a recognition by the project management team and the funding provider that end-user involvement even in evidence synthesis projects is resource intensive is essential to allow appropriate allocation of time and resources for meaningful engagement.BACKGROUND: The benefits of end-user involvement in health-care research are widely recognized by research agencies. There are few published evaluations of end-user involvement in systematic reviews.OBJECTIVES: (i) Describe end-user involvement in a complex mixed-methods systematic review of ADHD in schools, (ii) reflect on the impact of end-user involvement, (iii) highlight challenges and benefits experienced and (iv) provide suggestions to inform future involvement.METHODS: End-users were involved in all stages of the project, both as authors and as members of an advisory group. In addition, several events were held with groups of relevant end-users during the project.", "AuthorKeywords": ["end-user involvement", "engagement", "methods", "systematic review"], "IndexKeywords": ["Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity", "Child", "Community Participation", "Cooperative Behavior", "Humans", "Research Personnel", "Review Literature as Topic", "School Health Services"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85028249696", "SubjectAreas": [["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"56608826500": {"Name": "Coon J.T.", "AuthorID": "56608826500", "AffiliationID": "60026479", "AffiliationName": null}, "56493758000": {"Name": "Moore D.", "AuthorID": "56493758000", "AffiliationID": "60026479", "AffiliationName": null}, "56367026700": {"Name": "Stein K.", "AuthorID": "56367026700", "AffiliationID": "60026479", "AffiliationName": null}, "35487202400": {"Name": "Gwernan-Jones R.", "AuthorID": "35487202400", "AffiliationID": "60026479", "AffiliationName": null}, "36053555200": {"Name": "Richardson M.", "AuthorID": "36053555200", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": null}, "57195414241": {"Name": "Shotton C.", "AuthorID": "57195414241", "AffiliationID": "60111707, 60026479", "AffiliationName": null}, "7202760757": {"Name": "Ford T.", "AuthorID": "7202760757", "AffiliationID": "60111707, 60026479", "AffiliationName": null}, "57195414275": {"Name": "Pritchard W.", "AuthorID": "57195414275", "AffiliationID": "119123789", "AffiliationName": null}, "7401472396": {"Name": "Morris C.", "AuthorID": "7401472396", "AffiliationID": "119124167", "AffiliationName": null}}}
