Methods and results Linked cohort study of 94 966 patients with SCAD in England, 1 January 2001 to 31 March 2010, identified from primary care, secondary care, disease, and death registries. Resource use and costs, and cost predictors by time and 5-year cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk profile were estimated using generalized linear models. Coronary heart disease hospitalizations were 20.5% in the first year and 66% in the year following a non-fatal (myocardial infarction, ischaemic or haemorrhagic stroke) event. Mean healthcare costs were \u00a33133 per patient in the first year and \u00a310 377 in the year following a non-fatal event. First-year predictors of cost included sex (mean cost \u00a3549 lower in females), SCAD diagnosis (non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction cost \u00a3656 more than stable angina), and co-morbidities (heart failure cost \u00a3657 more per patient). Compared with lower risk patients (5-year CVD risk 3.5%), those of higher risk (5-year CVD risk 44.2%) had higher 5-year costs (\u00a323 393 vs. \u00a39335) and lower lifetime costs (\u00a343 020 vs. \u00a3116 888). Conclusion Patients with SCAD incur substantial healthcare utilization and costs, which varies and may be predicted by 5-year CVD risk profile. Higher risk patients have higher initial but lower lifetime costs than lower risk patients as a result of shorter life expectancy. Improved cardiovascular survivorship among an ageing CVD population is likely to require stratified care in anticipation of the burgeoning demand.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Costs", "Electronic health records", "Resource use", "Stable coronary artery disease"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85020528205", "SubjectAreas": [["Health Policy", "MEDI", "2719"], ["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"56427413300": {"Name": "Walker S.", "AuthorID": "56427413300", "AffiliationID": "60016418", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Health Economics, University of York"}, "55931970200": {"Name": "Asaria M.", "AuthorID": "55931970200", "AffiliationID": "60016418", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Health Economics, University of York"}, "7006261947": {"Name": "Manca A.", "AuthorID": "7006261947", "AffiliationID": "60016418", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Health Economics, University of York"}, "57196790814": {"Name": "Palmer S.", "AuthorID": "57196790814", "AffiliationID": "60016418", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Health Economics, University of York"}, "7006749329": {"Name": "Sculpher M.", "AuthorID": "7006749329", "AffiliationID": "60016418", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Health Economics, University of York"}, "35837808000": {"Name": "Gale C.P.", "AuthorID": "35837808000", "AffiliationID": "60023959, 60012070, 60163612", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Medicine and Health, Leeds Institute of Cardiovascular and Metabolic Medicine, University of Leeds"}, "36669369400": {"Name": "Shah A.D.", "AuthorID": "36669369400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Farr Institute of Health Informatics Research, UCL Institute of Health Informatics, University College London"}, "7004642497": {"Name": "Hemingway H.", "AuthorID": "7004642497", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Farr Institute of Health Informatics Research, UCL Institute of Health Informatics, University College London"}, "35453440300": {"Name": "Abrams K.R.", "AuthorID": "35453440300", "AffiliationID": "112492561", "AffiliationName": "Department of Health Sciences, Centre for Biostatistics and Genetic Epidemiology"}, "55058953200": {"Name": "Crowther M.", "AuthorID": "55058953200", "AffiliationID": "60033125", "AffiliationName": "Department of Health Sciences, University of Leicester"}, "7006508725": {"Name": "Timmis A.", "AuthorID": "7006508725", "AffiliationID": "60159931", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Unit, Barts and the London NHS Trust"}}}
