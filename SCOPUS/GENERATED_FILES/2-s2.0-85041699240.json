Microelectrode arrays based on complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology, such as Neuropixels probes, look set to transform these methods. Neuropixels probes provide \u223c1000 recording sites on an extremely narrow shank, with on-board amplification, digitization, and multiplexing. They deliver low-noise recordings from hundreds of neurons, providing a step change in the type of data available to neuroscientists. Here we discuss the opportunities afforded by these probes for large-scale electrophysiology, the challenges associated with data processing and anatomical localization, and avenues for further improvements of the technology.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Brain", "Electrophysiology", "Humans", "Microelectrodes", "Nerve Net", "Neurons", "Semiconductors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85041699240", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"]], "AuthorData": {"14056985700": {"Name": "Steinmetz N.", "AuthorID": "14056985700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "57211720309": {"Name": "Harris K.", "AuthorID": "57211720309", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "6701363142": {"Name": "Carandini M.", "AuthorID": "6701363142", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "7402657185": {"Name": "Koch C.", "AuthorID": "7402657185", "AffiliationID": "60105842", "AffiliationName": "Allen Institute for Brain Science"}}}
