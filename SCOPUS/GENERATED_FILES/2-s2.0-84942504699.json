This includes Jahn-Teller and Renner-Teller systems. The model approximates diabatic potential energy functions as polynomials expanded about a point of high symmetry. One must ensure the model Hamiltonian belongs to the totally symmetric irreducible representation of this point group. Here, a simple approach is presented to generate functions that form a basis for totally symmetric irreducible representations of non-Abelian groups and apply it to D<inf>\u221eh</inf> (2D) and O (3D). For the O group, the use of a well known basis-generating operator is also required. The functions generated for D<inf>\u221eh</inf> are then used to construct a ten state, four coordinate model of acetylene. The calculated absorption spectrum is compared to the experimental spectrum to serve as a validation of the approach.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Acetylene spectrum", "Pseudo Jahn-Teller", "Renner-Teller", "Singlet excited states", "Symmetry-adapted basis", "Vibronic coupling"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84942504699", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"]], "AuthorData": {"56814254700": {"Name": "Robertson C.", "AuthorID": "56814254700", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "University of Birmingham"}, "7006625328": {"Name": "Worth G.", "AuthorID": "7006625328", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "University of Birmingham"}}}
