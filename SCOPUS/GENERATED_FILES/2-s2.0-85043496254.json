These shares vary substantially across issue types, and the average share attributable to ideology doubles when a second ideological dimension is permitted. We also find that (unidimensional) ideology accounts for almost twice as much response variation (and response instability is substantially lower) among respondents with high, rather than low, political knowledge. Our estimation strategy is based on an ordinal probit model with random effects and is applicable to other data sets that include repeated measurements of ordinal issue position data.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85043496254", "SubjectAreas": [["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"]], "AuthorData": {"16239402000": {"Name": "Lauderdale B.E.", "AuthorID": "16239402000", "AffiliationID": "60003059", "AffiliationName": "London School of Economics and Political Science, Department of Methodology"}, "26633842200": {"Name": "Hanretty C.", "AuthorID": "26633842200", "AffiliationID": "60020595", "AffiliationName": "Royal Holloway, University of London, Department of Politics and International Relations"}, "14046394300": {"Name": "Vivyan N.", "AuthorID": "14046394300", "AffiliationID": "60176037", "AffiliationName": "School of Government and International Affairs, Durham University"}}}
