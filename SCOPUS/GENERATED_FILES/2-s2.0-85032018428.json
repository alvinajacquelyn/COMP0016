We report a case of gelastic seizures associated with a hypothalamic hamartoma, which followed a benign course. A 31-year-old woman with episodes of laughter was referred for diagnostic evaluation. Her initial MRI and EEG were reported as normal. However, her episodes of laughter were typical of gelastic seizures from history and video review. Repeat MRI revealed a small HH. She declined any medical treatment and was medication free until last follow-up. This benign course of HH-associated epilepsy, not necessitating treatment, to our knowledge, has not been previously reported.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Benign outcome", "Gelastic seizures", "Hypothalamic hamartoma"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85032018428", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Behavioral Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2802"]], "AuthorData": {"56146689900": {"Name": "Gosavi T.D.", "AuthorID": "56146689900", "AffiliationID": "60025076, 60017958", "AffiliationName": "National Neuroscience Institute and Singapore General Hospital"}, "35243898700": {"Name": "Walker M.C.", "AuthorID": "35243898700", "AffiliationID": "60020736", "AffiliationName": "Dept. of Clinical and Experimental Epilepsy, National Hospital of Neurology and Neurosurgery"}}}
