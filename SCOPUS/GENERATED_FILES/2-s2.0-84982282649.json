Methods: Natsal-3, a probability sample survey of men and women ages 16 to 74, resident in Britain, interviewed 8,869 women in 2010 to 2012. We explored risk factors for HR-HPV (in urine from 2,569 sexually experienced women ages 16 to 44), nonattendance for cervical screening in the past 5 years, and noncompletion of HPV catch-up vaccination. Results: HR-HPV was associated with increasing numbers of lifetime partners, younger age, increasing area-level deprivation, and smoking. Screening nonattendance was associated with younger and older age, increasing area-level deprivation (ageadjusted OR 1.91, 95% confidence interval, 1.48-2.47 for living in most vs. least deprived two quintiles), Asian/Asian British ethnicity (1.96, 1.32-2.90), smoking (1.97, 1.57-2.47), and reporting no partner in the past 5 years (2.45, 1.67-3.61 vs. 1 partner) butnotwithHR-HPV(1.35,0.79-2.31). Loweruptakeof HPV catch-up vaccination was associated with increasing arealevel deprivation, non-white ethnicity, smoking, and increasing lifetime partners. Conclusions: Socioeconomic markers and smoking were associated with HR-HPV positivity, nonattendance for cervical screening, and noncompletion of catch-up HPV vaccination. Impact: The cervical screening program needs to engage those missing HPV catch-up vaccination to avoid a potential widening of cervical cancer disparities in these cohorts. As some screening nonattenders are at low risk for HR-HPV, tailored approaches may be appropriate to increase screening among higher-risk women.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Female", "Health Surveys", "Humans", "Mass Screening", "Middle Aged", "Papillomaviridae", "Papillomavirus Infections", "Papillomavirus Vaccines", "Probability", "Risk Factors", "Smoking", "Socioeconomic Factors", "United Kingdom", "Uterine Cervical Neoplasms", "Vaccination", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84982282649", "SubjectAreas": [["Epidemiology", "MEDI", "2713"], ["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"]], "AuthorData": {"24069384200": {"Name": "Tanton C.", "AuthorID": "24069384200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Infection and Population Health, University College London, Centre for Sexual Health and HIV Research, Mortimer Market Centre"}, "7103014246": {"Name": "Mercer C.H.", "AuthorID": "7103014246", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Infection and Population Health, University College London, Centre for Sexual Health and HIV Research, Mortimer Market Centre"}, "7005762559": {"Name": "Field N.", "AuthorID": "7005762559", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Infection and Population Health, University College London, Centre for Sexual Health and HIV Research, Mortimer Market Centre"}, "55245779400": {"Name": "Clifton S.", "AuthorID": "55245779400", "AffiliationID": "60120458", "AffiliationName": "NatCen Social Research"}, "7003490365": {"Name": "Copas A.J.", "AuthorID": "7003490365", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Infection and Population Health, University College London, Centre for Sexual Health and HIV Research, Mortimer Market Centre"}, "57203665921": {"Name": "Johnson A.M.", "AuthorID": "57203665921", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Infection and Population Health, University College London, Centre for Sexual Health and HIV Research, Mortimer Market Centre"}, "35556409600": {"Name": "Sonnenberg P.", "AuthorID": "35556409600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Infection and Population Health, University College London, Centre for Sexual Health and HIV Research, Mortimer Market Centre"}, "6701456519": {"Name": "Soldan K.", "AuthorID": "6701456519", "AffiliationID": "60000733, 60111140", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Infectious Disease Surveillance and Control (CIDSC), Public Health England"}, "6601961353": {"Name": "Beddows S.", "AuthorID": "6601961353", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "Virus Reference Department, Public Health England"}, "55923872800": {"Name": "Panwar K.", "AuthorID": "55923872800", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "Virus Reference Department, Public Health England"}, "55923403300": {"Name": "Manyenga P.", "AuthorID": "55923403300", "AffiliationID": "60030968", "AffiliationName": "Department of Histocompatibility and Immunogenetics, NHSBT Filton"}, "37003576900": {"Name": "Da Silva F.", "AuthorID": "37003576900", "AffiliationID": "121405131", "AffiliationName": "Direccao Nacional de Investigacao Criminal, Ministerio de Interior"}, "57191898211": {"Name": "Waller J.", "AuthorID": "57191898211", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60012754", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Research UK Health Behaviour Research Centre, Research Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "7003609534": {"Name": "Wellings K.", "AuthorID": "7003609534", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Sexual and Reproductive Health Research, Department of Social and Environmental Health Research, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "35592025300": {"Name": "Ison C.A.", "AuthorID": "35592025300", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "Sexually Transmitted Bacteria Reference Unit, Public Health England"}}}
