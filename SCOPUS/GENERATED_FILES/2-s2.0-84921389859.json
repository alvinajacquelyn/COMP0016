However, the development of robust pipelines to relate genotypic functional modules to disease phenotypes through known molecular interactions is still at its early stages.In this article we first discuss methodologies that employ groups of genes in disease classification tasks that aim to link gene expression patterns with disease outcome. Then we present a pathway-based approach for disease classification through a mathematical programming model based on hyper-box principles. Association rules derived from the model are extracted and discussed with respect to pathway-specific molecular patterns related to the disease. Overall, we argue that the use of gene sets corresponding to disease-relevant pathways is a promising route to uncover expression-to-phenotype relations in disease classification and we illustrate the potential of hyper-box classification in assessing the predictive power of functional pathways and uncover the effect of specific genes in the prediction of disease phenotypes.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Disease classification", "Hyper-box-representation", "Mathematical programming", "Mixed integer optimisation", "Pathway-based classification"], "IndexKeywords": ["Biochemical pathway", "Disease associations", "Disease classification", "Gene expression patterns", "Hyper-box-representation", "Mathematical programming models", "Microarray data analysis", "Optimisations", "Breast Neoplasms", "Data Mining", "Gene Expression Profiling", "Humans", "Models, Theoretical", "Psoriasis"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84921389859", "SubjectAreas": [["Statistics and Probability", "MATH", "2613"], ["Modeling and Simulation", "MATH", "2611"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Immunology and Microbiology (all)", "IMMU", "2400"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"54384562100": {"Name": "Yang L.", "AuthorID": "54384562100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Process Systems Engineering, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "7003608896": {"Name": "Papageorgiou L.G.", "AuthorID": "7003608896", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Process Systems Engineering, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "38960930500": {"Name": "Ainali C.", "AuthorID": "38960930500", "AffiliationID": "60002803, 60177635, 60009797", "AffiliationName": "St John's Institute of Dermatology, Division of Genetics and Molecular Medicine, King's College London School of Medicine Tower Wing Guy's Hospital"}, "26421238500": {"Name": "Kittas A.", "AuthorID": "26421238500", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Informatics, School of Natural and Mathematical Sciences, King's College London"}, "6603414724": {"Name": "Tsoka S.", "AuthorID": "6603414724", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Informatics, School of Natural and Mathematical Sciences, King's College London"}, "7005117051": {"Name": "Nestle F.O.", "AuthorID": "7005117051", "AffiliationID": "60002803, 60177635, 60009797", "AffiliationName": "St John's Institute of Dermatology, Division of Genetics and Molecular Medicine, King's College London School of Medicine Tower Wing Guy's Hospital"}}}
