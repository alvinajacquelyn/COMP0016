The water uptake measures the number of water molecules adsorbed by the ionomer per functional group and is determined in-situ using the QCM frequency responses allowing for comparison with nanogram precision. Crystal admittance spectroscopy, along with equivalent circuit fitting, is applied to both thin films for the first time and is used to investigate the ionomer's viscoelastic changes during hydration; to elucidate the mechanisms at play during low, medium and high relative humidities.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Crystal admittance spectroscopy", "Fuel cell water management", "Membrane swelling", "Quartz crystal microbalance", "Solid polymer electrolyte"], "IndexKeywords": ["Admittance spectroscopies", "Alkaline anion exchange membrane", "Exchange membranes", "High relative humidities", "Membrane swelling", "Solid polymer electrolytes", "Swelling characteristics", "Water molecule"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84943303059", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"], ["Filtration and Separation", "CENG", "1506"]], "AuthorData": {"56069704400": {"Name": "Bharath V.J.", "AuthorID": "56069704400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electrochemical Innovation Lab, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "42061920200": {"Name": "Millichamp J.", "AuthorID": "42061920200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electrochemical Innovation Lab, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "54962772600": {"Name": "Neville T.P.", "AuthorID": "54962772600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Nature Inspired Engineering, University College London"}, "55324237200": {"Name": "Mason T.J.", "AuthorID": "55324237200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electrochemical Innovation Lab, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "24178516700": {"Name": "Shearing P.R.", "AuthorID": "24178516700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electrochemical Innovation Lab, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "7004913362": {"Name": "Manos G.", "AuthorID": "7004913362", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electrochemical Innovation Lab, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "13805905800": {"Name": "Brett D.J.L.", "AuthorID": "13805905800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electrochemical Innovation Lab, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "57197860377": {"Name": "Brown R.J.C.", "AuthorID": "57197860377", "AffiliationID": "60010785", "AffiliationName": "National Physical Laboratory"}}}
