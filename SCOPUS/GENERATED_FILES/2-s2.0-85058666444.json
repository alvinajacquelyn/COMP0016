Ever since the Wright brothers\u2019 first powered flight in 1903, commercial aircraft have relied on liquid hydrocarbon fuels. However, the need for greenhouse gas emission reductions along with recent progress in battery technology for automobiles has generated strong interest in electric propulsion in aviation. This Analysis provides a first-order assessment of the energy, economic and environmental implications of all-electric aircraft. We show that batteries with significantly higher specific energy and lower cost, coupled with further reductions of costs and CO 2 intensity of electricity, are necessary for exploiting the full range of economic and environmental benefits provided by all-electric aircraft. A global fleet of all-electric aircraft serving all flights up to a distance of 400\u2013600 nautical miles (741\u20131,111 km) would demand an equivalent of 0.6\u20131.7% of worldwide electricity consumption in 2015. Although lifecycle CO 2 emissions of all-electric aircraft depend on the power generation mix, all direct combustion emissions and thus direct air pollutants and direct non-CO 2 warming impacts would be eliminated.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["All-electric aircraft", "Commercial aircraft", "Economic and environmental benefits", "Electricity-consumption", "Environmental implications", "Greenhouse gas emission reduction", "Liquid hydrocarbon fuel", "Power generation mix"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85058666444", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment", "ENER", "2105"], ["Fuel Technology", "ENER", "2103"], ["Energy Engineering and Power Technology", "ENER", "2102"]], "AuthorData": {"57209993091": {"Name": "Sch\u00e4fer A.W.", "AuthorID": "57209993091", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Air Transportation Systems Laboratory, UCL Energy Institute, University College London, Central House"}, "57205121724": {"Name": "Doyme K.", "AuthorID": "57205121724", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Air Transportation Systems Laboratory, UCL Energy Institute, University College London, Central House"}, "6603160782": {"Name": "Dray L.M.", "AuthorID": "6603160782", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Air Transportation Systems Laboratory, UCL Energy Institute, University College London, Central House"}, "57195122280": {"Name": "O\u2019Sullivan A.", "AuthorID": "57195122280", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Air Transportation Systems Laboratory, UCL Energy Institute, University College London, Central House"}, "24773185500": {"Name": "Barrett S.R.H.", "AuthorID": "24773185500", "AffiliationID": "60022195", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory for Aviation and the Environment, Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Massachusetts Institute of Technology"}, "57204878680": {"Name": "Gnadt A.R.", "AuthorID": "57204878680", "AffiliationID": "60022195", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory for Aviation and the Environment, Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Massachusetts Institute of Technology"}, "7005650027": {"Name": "Self R.", "AuthorID": "7005650027", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Sound and Vibration Research, Engineering and the Environment, University of Southampton, Highfield"}, "57191203304": {"Name": "Synodinos A.P.", "AuthorID": "57191203304", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Sound and Vibration Research, Engineering and the Environment, University of Southampton, Highfield"}, "35331453300": {"Name": "Torija A.J.", "AuthorID": "35331453300", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Sound and Vibration Research, Engineering and the Environment, University of Southampton, Highfield"}}}
