Karger AG, Basel.Background: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a commonly used outcome for randomized neonatal trials. Objectives: The aim of the present study was to determine whether a diagnosis of BPD or respiratory morbidity (RM<inf>1</inf> or RM<inf>2</inf>) at 12 months corrected age better predicted subsequent RM in extremely low gestational age infants (23-28 weeks of gestation). Methods: Initial analysis was undertaken in a development cohort of 76 infants who underwent pulmonary function tests (PFTs) at 12 months corrected age. Parents completed infant respiratory diaries 2 weeks before the PFTs. Analysis was then undertaken in a validation cohort of 227 infants whose parents completed a 4-week respiratory diary when their infant was 12 months corrected age. BPD at 28 days (BPD<inf>28d</inf>) and 36 weeks post-menstrual age (BPD<inf>36w</inf>), RM<inf>1</inf> (\u22653 days and/or nights of cough, wheeze, and/or medicine use) and RM<inf>2</inf> (\u22654 days and/or nights of cough, wheeze, and/or respiratory medicine use) each week for 2 weeks at 12 months corrected age were assessed with regard to prediction of respiratory outcomes at 24 months documented by respiratory health questionnaires. Results: BPD<inf>28d</inf> and BPD<inf>36w</inf> were not significantly associated with any respiratory outcome. Areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves were significantly better for either definition of RM than BPD<inf>28d</inf> or BPD<inf>36w</inf> for all outcomes. Conclusions: RM documented by parental completed diaries at 12 months corrected age better predicted respiratory outcome at 24 months corrected age than BPD regardless of diagnostic criteria.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bronchopulmonary dysplasia", "Premature infant", "Pulmonary function", "Respiratory outcome"], "IndexKeywords": ["Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia", "Female", "Gestational Age", "Humans", "Infant", "Infant, Extremely Premature", "Infant, Newborn", "Male", "Respiratory Function Tests", "Risk Factors", "ROC Curve"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84924663823", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Developmental Biology", "BIOC", "1309"]], "AuthorData": {"7003354448": {"Name": "Parad R.B.", "AuthorID": "7003354448", "AffiliationID": "60016782", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatric Newborn Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital"}, "57216624368": {"Name": "Davis J.M.", "AuthorID": "57216624368", "AffiliationID": "60011387, 60001344", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatrics, Floating Hospital for Children at Tufts Medical Center"}, "55636391300": {"Name": "Lo J.", "AuthorID": "55636391300", "AffiliationID": "60005518, 60011520, 60171763", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, Guy's and St. Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust, King's College London"}, "35548124700": {"Name": "Peacock J.L.", "AuthorID": "35548124700", "AffiliationID": "60005518, 60011520, 60171763", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, Guy's and St. Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust, King's College London"}, "55085707900": {"Name": "Greenough A.", "AuthorID": "55085707900", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Division of Asthma, Allergy and Lung Biology, King's College London"}, "55471998100": {"Name": "Thomas M.", "AuthorID": "55471998100", "AffiliationID": "60002484", "AffiliationName": "Neonatal Medicine, Chelsea and Westminster Hospital"}, "7006171979": {"Name": "Marlow N.", "AuthorID": "7006171979", "AffiliationID": "113483397", "AffiliationName": "Neonatal Medicine, Institute for Women's Health"}, "57213449631": {"Name": "Calvert S.", "AuthorID": "57213449631", "AffiliationID": "60010426", "AffiliationName": "Child Health, St. George's Hospital"}}}
