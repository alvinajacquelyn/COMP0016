KGaA, Weinheim.Vertical arrays of nanostructures can provide access to the cell cytoplasma and probe intracellular molecules. Here, the simple combination of diamond nanoneedle arrays with centrifugation-induced supergravity is shown to efficiently deliver drugs and biomaterials into the cytosol within several minutes, negotiating the endocytososomal system. The potential influence of the technique on cell metabolism is thoroughly studied. By detecting the phosphorylated histone variant H2AX (pH2AX) in the nucleus, it is proved that the operating process will not lead to DNA double-strand breaks. However, the mechanical disruption can temporarily improve the permeability of the cell membranes. Nanoneedle treatment affects cell metabolism at multiple points. The treatment can slightly elevate the apoptotic signal in A549 cells and can significantly increase the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in cells, particularly if combined with anticancer drugs. Meanwhile, the activity of cytosolic glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) is also raised to counterbalance the elevated ROS content. A detected depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane potential suggests mitochondrial involvement in the intracellular redox reactions and cell apoptosis which are induced by diamond nanoneedle treatment. Overall this study provides a novel understanding on the intracellular delivery mediated by nanoneedles, especially the impact on cell physiology.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Diamond nanoneedle arrays", "Glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase", "Intracellular delivery", "Mitochondrial membrane potential", "Reactive oxygen species"], "IndexKeywords": ["DNA double strand breaks", "Intracellular delivery", "Mechanical disruption", "Mitochondrial membrane potential", "Nanoneedle arrays", "Operating process", "Phosphorylated histone", "Reactive oxygen species", "A549 Cells", "Antineoplastic Agents", "Apoptosis", "Biocompatible Materials", "Cell Line, Tumor", "Cell Membrane", "Cell Membrane Permeability", "Cell Nucleus", "Cell Physiological Phenomena", "Cytosol", "Diamond", "Drug Delivery Systems", "Glucosephosphate Dehydrogenase", "Humans", "MCF-7 Cells", "Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial", "Mitochondria", "Nanostructures", "Needles", "Reactive Oxygen Species"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84961267192", "SubjectAreas": [["Biomaterials", "MATE", "2502"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"], ["Pharmaceutical Science", "PHAR", "3003"]], "AuthorData": {"55910834500": {"Name": "Zhu X.", "AuthorID": "55910834500", "AffiliationID": "60013983", "AffiliationName": "Center of Super-Diamond and Advanced Films (COSDAF) and Department of Physics and Materials Science, City University of Hong Kong"}, "54882046300": {"Name": "Yuen M.", "AuthorID": "54882046300", "AffiliationID": "60013983", "AffiliationName": "Center of Super-Diamond and Advanced Films (COSDAF) and Department of Physics and Materials Science, City University of Hong Kong"}, "55793238000": {"Name": "Yan L.", "AuthorID": "55793238000", "AffiliationID": "60013983", "AffiliationName": "Center of Super-Diamond and Advanced Films (COSDAF) and Department of Physics and Materials Science, City University of Hong Kong"}, "56150320000": {"Name": "Zhang Z.", "AuthorID": "56150320000", "AffiliationID": "60013983", "AffiliationName": "Center of Super-Diamond and Advanced Films (COSDAF) and Department of Physics and Materials Science, City University of Hong Kong"}, "57193219600": {"Name": "Yang Y.", "AuthorID": "57193219600", "AffiliationID": "60013983", "AffiliationName": "Center of Super-Diamond and Advanced Films (COSDAF) and Department of Physics and Materials Science, City University of Hong Kong"}, "37070726100": {"Name": "Zhang W.", "AuthorID": "37070726100", "AffiliationID": "60013983", "AffiliationName": "Center of Super-Diamond and Advanced Films (COSDAF) and Department of Physics and Materials Science, City University of Hong Kong"}, "56411756900": {"Name": "Ai F.", "AuthorID": "56411756900", "AffiliationID": "60013983", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biology and Chemistry, City University of Hong Kong"}, "55451894000": {"Name": "Zhu G.", "AuthorID": "55451894000", "AffiliationID": "60013983", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biology and Chemistry, City University of Hong Kong"}, "7403385896": {"Name": "Yu P.", "AuthorID": "7403385896", "AffiliationID": "60013983", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Materials Science, City University of Hong Kong"}, "55936425600": {"Name": "Chen X.", "AuthorID": "55936425600", "AffiliationID": "60008524", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry and Forensic Sciences, Faculty of Life Sciences, University of Bradford"}}}
