The GDSC and CCLE investigators recently reported that their respective studies exhibit reasonable agreement and yield similar molecular predictors of drug response, seemingly contradicting our previous findings. Reanalyzing the authors' published methods and results, we found that their analysis failed to account for variability in the genomic data and more importantly compared different drug sensitivity measures from each study, which substantially deviate from our more stringent consistency assessment. Our comparison of the most updated genomic and pharmacological data from the GDSC and CCLE confirms our published findings that the measures of drug response reported by these two groups are not consistent. We believe that a principled approach to assess the reproducibility of drug sensitivity predictors is necessary before envisioning their translation into clinical settings.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85010961092", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Immunology and Microbiology (all)", "IMMU", "2400"], ["Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics (all)", "PHAR", "3000"]], "AuthorData": {"55928732700": {"Name": "Safikhani Z.", "AuthorID": "55928732700", "AffiliationID": "60016849", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Biophysics, University of Toronto"}, "56769416600": {"Name": "Quevedo R.", "AuthorID": "56769416600", "AffiliationID": "60016849", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Biophysics, University of Toronto"}, "56650720800": {"Name": "Smirnov P.", "AuthorID": "56650720800", "AffiliationID": "60008768, 60014468", "AffiliationName": "Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network"}, "23667678400": {"Name": "Haibe-Kains B.", "AuthorID": "23667678400", "AffiliationID": "60016849", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University of Toronto"}, "36930289700": {"Name": "El-Hachem N.", "AuthorID": "36930289700", "AffiliationID": "60002878", "AffiliationName": "Institut de recherches cliniques de Montr\u00e9al"}, "57209785076": {"Name": "Goldenberg A.", "AuthorID": "57209785076", "AffiliationID": "60016849", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University of Toronto"}, "37005365300": {"Name": "Birkbak N.J.", "AuthorID": "37005365300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "7202125538": {"Name": "Mason C.", "AuthorID": "7202125538", "AffiliationID": "60109878", "AffiliationName": "The Feil Family Brain and Mind Research Institute (BMRI)"}, "6602077638": {"Name": "Hatzis C.", "AuthorID": "6602077638", "AffiliationID": "60030849, 60005455", "AffiliationName": "Yale Cancer Center, Yale University"}, "7401640714": {"Name": "Shi L.", "AuthorID": "7401640714", "AffiliationID": "60024885", "AffiliationName": "University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences"}, "16479697600": {"Name": "Aerts H.J.W.L.", "AuthorID": "16479697600", "AffiliationID": "60016782, 60002746, 60014334", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiation Oncology and Radiology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School"}, "7004974520": {"Name": "Quackenbush J.", "AuthorID": "7004974520", "AffiliationID": "60014334", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biostatistics and Computational Biology, Center for Cancer Computational Biology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute"}}}
