It is unclear however, which type of alteration may be more informative of cancer risk. We analyzed genome-wide DNA methylation and copy-number calls from the same DNA assay in a cohort of healthy breast samples and age-matched normal samples collected adjacent to breast cancer. Using statistical methods to adjust for cell type heterogeneity, we show that DNA methylation changes can discriminate normal-adjacent from normal samples better than somatic copy-number variants. We validate this important finding in an independent dataset. These results suggest that DNA methylation alterations in the normal cell of origin may offer better cancer risk prediction and early detection markers than copy-number changes.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Breast cancer", "Cancer", "Cancer-risk", "Copy-number", "DNA methylation", "Early detection", "Epigenetic"], "IndexKeywords": ["Breast", "Breast Neoplasms", "DNA Methylation", "DNA, Neoplasm", "Female", "Gene Dosage", "Genes, Neoplasm", "Humans", "Predictive Value of Tests", "Risk"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85046620661", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"56991656900": {"Name": "Gao Y.", "AuthorID": "56991656900", "AffiliationID": "60027363, 60019499, 60122632", "AffiliationName": "CAS Key Laboratory of Computational Biology, CAS-MPG Partner Institute for Computational Biology, Shanghai Institute of Nutrition and Health, Shanghai Institute for Biological Sciences, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "8528968400": {"Name": "Teschendorff A.", "AuthorID": "8528968400", "AffiliationID": "60109234, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Cancer Institute, University College London"}, "7006520678": {"Name": "Widschwendter M.", "AuthorID": "7006520678", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Women's Cancer, University College London"}}}
