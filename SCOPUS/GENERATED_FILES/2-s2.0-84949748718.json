Aim To explore trajectories and predictors of social recovery following a first episode of psychosis (FEP). Method A sample of 764 individuals with FEP were assessed on entry into early intervention in psychosis (EIP) services and followed up over 12 months. Social recovery profiles were examined using latent class growth analysis. Results Three types of social recovery profile were identified: Low Stable (66%), Moderate-Increasing (27%), and High-Decreasing (7%). Poor social recovery was predicted by male gender, ethnic minority status, younger age at onset of psychosis, increased negative symptoms, and poor premorbid adjustment. Conclusions Social disability is prevalent in FEP, although distinct recovery profiles are evident. Where social disability is present on entry into EIP services it can remain stable, highlighting a need for targeted intervention.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adaptation, Psychological", "Adolescent", "Adult", "Age of Onset", "Female", "Humans", "Longitudinal Studies", "Male", "Psychiatric Status Rating Scales", "Psychotic Disorders", "Regression Analysis", "Social Adjustment", "Social Skills", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "United Kingdom", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84949748718", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"26534383400": {"Name": "Hodgekins J.", "AuthorID": "26534383400", "AffiliationID": "60117932, 60000112", "AffiliationName": "Norwich Medical School, University of East Anglia"}, "56457972100": {"Name": "Christopher R.", "AuthorID": "56457972100", "AffiliationID": "60117932, 60000112", "AffiliationName": "Norwich Medical School, University of East Anglia"}, "57202413502": {"Name": "Coker S.", "AuthorID": "57202413502", "AffiliationID": "60117932, 60000112", "AffiliationName": "Norwich Medical School, University of East Anglia"}, "55635993400": {"Name": "Birchwood M.", "AuthorID": "55635993400", "AffiliationID": "60022020", "AffiliationName": "University of Warwick"}, "57202910558": {"Name": "Singh S.", "AuthorID": "57202910558", "AffiliationID": "60022020", "AffiliationName": "University of Warwick"}, "7402449340": {"Name": "Marshall M.", "AuthorID": "7402449340", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "University of Manchester"}, "55780653300": {"Name": "Everard L.", "AuthorID": "55780653300", "AffiliationID": "60099531", "AffiliationName": "Birmingham and Solihull NHS Mental Health Foundation Trust"}, "7102915574": {"Name": "Lester H.", "AuthorID": "7102915574", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "University of Birmingham"}, "56489064900": {"Name": "Jones P.", "AuthorID": "56489064900", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "University of Cambridge"}, "7003468422": {"Name": "Amos T.", "AuthorID": "7003468422", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "University of Bristol"}, "57220762644": {"Name": "Sharma V.", "AuthorID": "57220762644", "AffiliationID": "60102026, 60171205", "AffiliationName": "University of Chester, Cheshire and Wirral Partnership NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7006066134": {"Name": "Freemantle N.", "AuthorID": "7006066134", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "7203066856": {"Name": "Fowler D.", "AuthorID": "7203066856", "AffiliationID": "60017317", "AffiliationName": "University of Sussex, Psychology Department"}}}
