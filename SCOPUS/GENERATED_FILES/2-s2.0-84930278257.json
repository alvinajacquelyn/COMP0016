Therefore, the investigation of determinants of onset and course of mental health problems is of high importance. The present paper investigates the impact of protective and risk factors on the development of depressive symptoms in children and adolescents. The BELLA study is the mental health module of the German National Health Interview and Examination Survey for children and adolescents (KIGGS). Based on the first three measurement points of the BELLA study (covering a period of 2 years), the present analysis focused on children and adolescents aged 11\u201317 years at baseline (n = 1,643; 50.6 % female). A longitudinal growth modelling approach was used. Mental health problems in parents (parent-reports) predicted depressive symptoms in children and adolescents (self-reports) as well as the development of these symptoms over time. Further, child-reported protective factors of self-efficacy, positive family climate and social support were associated with less depressive symptoms at baseline. Additionally, positive changes in protective factors were associated with the development of less depressive symptoms over time. Finally, family climate and social support moderated the detrimental influence of parental psychopathology on child\u2019s depressive symptoms. The addressed determinants for the development of depressive symptoms in children and adolescents are highly relevant for prevention and intervention strategies. Future research should investigate specific risk and protective factors focusing in detail on further mental health disorders and their development in children and adolescents.", "AuthorKeywords": ["BELLA study", "Children and adolescents", "Depression", "Mental health", "Protective factors", "Risk factors"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Child", "Depression", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Germany", "Health Surveys", "Humans", "Longitudinal Studies", "Male", "Mental Health", "Parents", "Protective Factors", "Risk Factors", "Self Efficacy", "Social Support"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84930278257", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"18233586400": {"Name": "Klasen F.", "AuthorID": "18233586400", "AffiliationID": "60005036", "AffiliationName": "Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Psychotherapy, and Psychosomatics, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf"}, "55697480800": {"Name": "Otto C.", "AuthorID": "55697480800", "AffiliationID": "60005036", "AffiliationName": "Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Psychotherapy, and Psychosomatics, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf"}, "16304061900": {"Name": "Kriston L.", "AuthorID": "16304061900", "AffiliationID": "60005036", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Psychology, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf"}, "6603777301": {"Name": "Ravens-Sieberer U.", "AuthorID": "6603777301", "AffiliationID": "60005036", "AffiliationName": "Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Psychotherapy, and Psychosomatics, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf"}, "55746318400": {"Name": "Patalay P.", "AuthorID": "55746318400", "AffiliationID": "60170329, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Evidence Based Practice Unit, University College London and Anna Freud Centre"}, "16480776000": {"Name": "Schlack R.", "AuthorID": "16480776000", "AffiliationID": "60016183", "AffiliationName": "Robert Koch Institute"}}}
