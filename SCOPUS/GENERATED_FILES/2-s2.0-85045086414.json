All rights reserved.The index of T-wave morphology restitution (TMR) has recently been presented as a sudden cardiac death (SCD) predictor in a population of chronic heart failure (CHF) patients. This index quantifies the level of variation in the T-wave morphology per RR interval (RRI) increment. The impact of using different definitions of ranges of RRI (Delta;RRI) and the study of the interaction between TMR and Delta;RRI are relevant for both the optimization and the mechanistic interpretation of the index. This study aims to investigate the interaction between Delta;RRI and TMR and to assess whether different definitions of Delta;RRI (patients-independent or patient-specific) may affect the predictive value of TMR. Holter ECG recordings from 651 patients with CHF, including SCD, victims of other causes and survivors, were analyzed. Mann-Whitney test was used to evaluate significant differences between SCD victims and the rest of patients. In the patient-independent analysis, TMR values only showed significant differences when 0.25s\u2264 Delta;RR\u22640.3s, while in the patient-specific analysis TMR values were significantly different when Delta;RR\u22650.6 of the maximum RR range, Delta;RRmax. In conclusion, the index TMR is a predictor of SCD robust to variations in Delta;RR values evaluated in segments comprising at least 0.6 of Delta;RRmax.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Chronic heart failures", "Independent analysis", "Mechanistic interpretations", "Patient specific", "Predictive values", "Sudden cardiac deaths", "Sudden cardiac deaths (SCD)", "T-wave morphologies"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85045086414", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"], ["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"55637370300": {"Name": "Ram\u00edrez J.", "AuthorID": "55637370300", "AffiliationID": "60085101", "AffiliationName": "Biomedical Research Networking Center in Bioengineering, Biomaterials and Nanomedicine (CIBER-BBN)"}, "7004512193": {"Name": "Pueyo E.", "AuthorID": "7004512193", "AffiliationID": "60085101", "AffiliationName": "Biomedical Research Networking Center in Bioengineering, Biomaterials and Nanomedicine (CIBER-BBN)"}, "56216881700": {"Name": "Laguna P.", "AuthorID": "56216881700", "AffiliationID": "60085101", "AffiliationName": "Biomedical Research Networking Center in Bioengineering, Biomaterials and Nanomedicine (CIBER-BBN)"}, "26321773400": {"Name": "Orini M.", "AuthorID": "26321773400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}}}
