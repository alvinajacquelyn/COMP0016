Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) experiments were carried out for different operating conditions including fluid height, h, and shaker rotational speed, N. A detailed flow analysis is provided for conditions when the fluid and vessel motions are in-phase (Fr = 0.23) and out-of-phase (Fr = 0.47). PIV measurements in vertical and horizontal planes were combined to reconstruct low order models of the full 3D flow and to determine its Finite-Time Lyapunov Exponent (FTLE) within OSBs. The combined results from the mode decomposition and the FTLE fields provide a useful insight into the flow dynamics and Lagrangian coherent structures in OSBs and offer a valuable tool to optimise bioprocess design in terms of mixing and cell suspension.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Different operating conditions", "Dynamic mode decompositions", "Finite-time Lyapunov exponent", "Lagrangian coherent structures", "Lagrangian structures", "Mode decomposition techniques", "Particle image velocimetries", "Proper orthogonal decompositions"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85044003483", "SubjectAreas": [["Computational Mechanics", "ENGI", "2206"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Mechanics of Materials", "ENGI", "2211"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"], ["Fluid Flow and Transfer Processes", "CENG", "1507"]], "AuthorData": {"55499259000": {"Name": "Weheliye W.", "AuthorID": "55499259000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Chemical Engineering Department, University College London"}, "55555319600": {"Name": "Cagney N.", "AuthorID": "55555319600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Mechanical Engineering Department, University College London"}, "8259228300": {"Name": "Ducci A.", "AuthorID": "8259228300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Mechanical Engineering Department, University College London"}, "57195616643": {"Name": "Rodriguez G.", "AuthorID": "57195616643", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Biochemical Engineering Department, University College London"}, "9743977900": {"Name": "Micheletti M.", "AuthorID": "9743977900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Biochemical Engineering Department, University College London"}}}
