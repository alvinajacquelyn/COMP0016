We investigated associations between different types of childhood adversity and outcomes of FEP patients over the 5 years following their first contact with mental health services for psychosis. 237 FEP cases aged 18\u201365 years were followed on average for 5 years after first presentation to psychiatric services in South London, UK. Childhood adversity prior to 17 years of age was assessed at baseline using the Childhood Experience of Care and Abuse Questionnaire (CECA.Q). The results showed that exposure to at least one type of childhood adversity was significantly associated with a lower likelihood of achieving symptomatic remission, longer inpatient stays, and compulsory admission over the 5-year follow-up. There was no evidence though of a dose-response effect. Some specificity was evident. Childhood parental separation was associated with significantly greater likelihood of non-compliance with antipsychotic medications, compulsory admission, and substance dependence. Institutional care was significantly associated with longer total length of inpatient stays; and parental death was significantly associated with compulsory admissions. Clinicians should screen FEP patients for childhood adversity and tailor interventions accordingly to improve outcomes.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Child abuse", "Functioning", "Inpatient admission", "Longitudinal", "Maltreatment", "Parental separation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Adverse Childhood Experiences", "Aged", "Child", "Cohort Studies", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Humans", "London", "Longitudinal Studies", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Parental Death", "Parents", "Psychotic Disorders", "Time Factors", "Treatment Outcome", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85052160270", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"], ["Biological Psychiatry", "NEUR", "2803"]], "AuthorData": {"56080212900": {"Name": "Ajnakina O.", "AuthorID": "56080212900", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "King's College London, Department of Psychosis Studies, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience"}, "35763823400": {"Name": "Stilo S.A.", "AuthorID": "35763823400", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "King's College London, Department of Psychosis Studies, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience"}, "34971723600": {"Name": "Lopez-Morinigo J.", "AuthorID": "34971723600", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "King's College London, Department of Psychosis Studies, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience"}, "6602336142": {"Name": "Gaughran F.", "AuthorID": "6602336142", "AffiliationID": "60006579, 60028884", "AffiliationName": "National Psychosis Unit, South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust, Bethlem Royal Hospital"}, "57208765987": {"Name": "David A.S.", "AuthorID": "57208765987", "AffiliationID": "60028884, 60011520, 60171762, 60172638", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Maudsley Biomedical Research Centre, South London, Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust, King's College London"}, "6602196376": {"Name": "Dazzan P.", "AuthorID": "6602196376", "AffiliationID": "60028884, 60011520, 60171762, 60172638", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Maudsley Biomedical Research Centre, South London, Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust, King's College London"}, "35406239400": {"Name": "Murray R.M.", "AuthorID": "35406239400", "AffiliationID": "60028884, 60011520, 60171762, 60172638", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Maudsley Biomedical Research Centre, South London, Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust, King's College London"}, "55334322400": {"Name": "Trotta A.", "AuthorID": "55334322400", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "King's College London, Social, Genetic & Developmental Psychiatry Centre, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience"}, "57203530520": {"Name": "Forti M.D.", "AuthorID": "57203530520", "AffiliationID": "60028884, 60011520, 60171762, 60172638", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Maudsley Biomedical Research Centre, South London, Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust, King's College London"}, "9235818300": {"Name": "Fisher H.L.", "AuthorID": "9235818300", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "King's College London, Social, Genetic & Developmental Psychiatry Centre, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience"}, "7003615668": {"Name": "Pariante C.", "AuthorID": "7003615668", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "King's College London, Department of Psychological Medicine, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience"}, "15073211100": {"Name": "Mondelli V.", "AuthorID": "15073211100", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "King's College London, Department of Psychological Medicine, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience"}, "24344199200": {"Name": "Kolliakou A.", "AuthorID": "24344199200", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "King's College London, Department of Psychological Medicine, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience"}, "55701629400": {"Name": "Gardner-Sood P.", "AuthorID": "55701629400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Imaging, University College London, Charles Bell House"}}}
