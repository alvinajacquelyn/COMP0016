Given that one possible consequence from the responses to contemporary climate change, or lack thereof, is migration, that also applies for climate change. To understand the complex interplay amongst climate change, conflict, and migration, many frameworks and models exist for analysis within sustainable development.One framework which has not been explored extensively for climate change and migration is \u2018disaster diplomacy\u2019, how disaster-related activities do and not influence conflict and peace. This chapter is conceptual, exploring a disaster diplomacy perspective for climate change and migration. It provides reflections rather than results, further helping to indicate the importance of diplomacy for those involved in disaster-related activities.After describing the disaster diplomacy framework and applying it to climate change diplomacy, this chapter reflects on why so few disaster-related activities, including those linked to climate change, support long-term peace and conflict resolution efforts. The implications for climate change related migration are described, suggesting that those forced to move due to climate change cannot expect much external support. Yet pessimism is not fully justified because many prospects exist for the situation to change, especially if those with power choose to do so.Ultimately, the key is having the choice to migrate or not and having the resources to successfully carry out that choice so that sustainable development is pursued, which includes dealing with any present conflicts and preventing others. Rather than climate change diplomacy or disaster diplomacy, this chapter suggests seeking \u2018migration diplomacy\u2019 so that neither the migrants nor the hosts nor those left behind experience conflict due to the migration, but instead support the decisions which people make and gain positive outcomes from it.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Climate change", "Disaster diplomacy", "Migration"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85048042300", "SubjectAreas": [["Earth and Planetary Sciences (all)", "EART", "1900"], ["Engineering (all)", "ENGI", "2200"], ["Environmental Science (all)", "ENVI", "2300"], ["Social Sciences (all)", "SOCI", "3300"]], "AuthorData": {"23390064600": {"Name": "Kelman I.", "AuthorID": "23390064600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
