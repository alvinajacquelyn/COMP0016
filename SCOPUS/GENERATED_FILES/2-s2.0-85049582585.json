KGaA, Weinheim The integration of additive manufacturing (AM) technology within biological systems holds significant potential, specifically when refining the methods utilized for the creation of in vitro models. Therefore, examination of cellular interaction with the physical/physicochemical properties of 3D-printed polymers is critically important. In this work, skeletal muscle (C 2 C 12 ), neuronal (SH-SY5Y) and hepatic (HepG2) cell lines are utilized to ascertain critical evidence of cellular behavior in response to 3D-printed candidate polymers: Clear-FL (stereolithography, SL), PA-12 (laser sintering, LS), and VeroClear (PolyJet). This research outlines initial critical evidence for a framework of polymer/AM process selection when 3D printing biologically receptive scaffolds, derived from industry standard, commercially available AM instrumentation. C 2 C 12 , SH-SY5Y, and HepG2 cells favor LS polymer PA-12 for applications in which cellular adherence is necessitated. However, cell type specific responses are evident when cultured in the chemical leachate of photopolymers (Clear-FL and VeroClear). With the increasing prevalence of 3D-printed biointerfaces, the development of rigorous cell type specific biocompatibility data is imperative. Supplementing the currently limited database of functional 3D-printed biomaterials affords the opportunity for experiment-specific AM process and polymer selection, dependent on biological application and intricacy of design features required.", "AuthorKeywords": ["3D printing", "biocompatibility", "hepatocyte", "neuronal", "skeletal muscle"], "IndexKeywords": ["3-D printing", "Biological applications", "Cellular adherences", "Cellular interaction", "Hepatocytes", "Industry standards", "neuronal", "Skeletal muscle", "Animals", "Biocompatible Materials", "Cell Adhesion", "Cell Line", "Cell Line, Tumor", "Cell Survival", "Hep G2 Cells", "Humans", "Mice", "Myoblasts", "Neurons", "Photochemical Processes", "Polymers", "Printing, Three-Dimensional"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85049582585", "SubjectAreas": [["Biotechnology", "BIOC", "1305"], ["Bioengineering", "CENG", "1502"], ["Biomaterials", "MATE", "2502"], ["Polymers and Plastics", "MATE", "2507"], ["Materials Chemistry", "MATE", "2505"]], "AuthorData": {"57195434260": {"Name": "Rimington R.", "AuthorID": "57195434260", "AffiliationID": "60000891", "AffiliationName": "Musculoskeletal Biology Research Group, School of Sport, Exercise and Health Sciences, Loughborough University"}, "55937083600": {"Name": "Capel A.", "AuthorID": "55937083600", "AffiliationID": "60000891", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, School of Science, Loughborough University"}, "44861723400": {"Name": "Player D.", "AuthorID": "44861723400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Orthopaedics and Musculoskeletal Science, Division of Surgery and Interventional Science, University College London"}, "7404188977": {"Name": "Lewis M.", "AuthorID": "7404188977", "AffiliationID": "60000891", "AffiliationName": "Musculoskeletal Biology Research Group, School of Sport, Exercise and Health Sciences, Loughborough University"}, "35233165100": {"Name": "Christie S.", "AuthorID": "35233165100", "AffiliationID": "60000891", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, School of Science, Loughborough University"}, "6602145084": {"Name": "Bibb R.", "AuthorID": "6602145084", "AffiliationID": "60000891", "AffiliationName": "Design School, Loughborough University"}}}
