A densely sampled calibrated phylogeny for a widespread butterfly subtribe, Oleriina (Nymphalidae: Ithomiini) was used to estimate the origin, colonization history and diversification of this species-rich group. Location: Neotropics. Methods: Ancestral elevation and biogeographical ranges were reconstructed using data generated from detailed range maps and applying the dispersal-extinction-cladogenesis model using stratified palaeogeographical time slice matrices. The pattern of diversification through time was examined by comparing constant and variable rate models. We also tested the hypothesis that a change in elevation is associated with speciation. Results: The Oleriina likely originated in the Andes in the Early to Middle Miocene and rapidly diversified to include four genera all of which also originated in the Andes. These clades, together with four species groups, experienced varying spatial and temporal patterns of diversification. An overall early burst and decreasing diversification rate is identified, and this pattern is reflected for most subclades. Main conclusions: Changes in the palaeogeological landscape, particularly the prolonged uplift of the Andes, had a profound impact on the diversification of the subtribe. The Oleriina mostly remained within the Andes and vicariant speciation resulted in some instances. Dynamic dispersal occurred with the disappearance of geological barriers such as the Acre System and the subtribe exploited newly available habitats. Our results confirm the role of the Andean uplift in the evolution of Neotropical biodiversity.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Hyposcada", "Megoleria", "Oleria", "Ollantaya", "Andes", "Biogeography", "Diversification", "Ithomiini butterflies", "Neotropics"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84955170279", "SubjectAreas": [["Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics", "AGRI", "1105"], ["Ecology", "ENVI", "2303"]], "AuthorData": {"35755569800": {"Name": "De-Silva D.", "AuthorID": "35755569800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genetics, Evolution and Environment, University College London"}, "7202700383": {"Name": "Elias M.", "AuthorID": "7202700383", "AffiliationID": "60008134, 60028311, 60027946, 60001422", "AffiliationName": "Institut de Syst\u00e9matique, \u00c9volution, Biodiversit\u00e9, ISYEB - UMR 7205 - CNRS, MNHN, UPMC, EPHE, Mus\u00e9um National d'Histoire Naturelle, Sorbonne Universit\u00e9s"}, "36061648200": {"Name": "Day J.", "AuthorID": "36061648200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genetics, Evolution and Environment, University College London"}, "6602649782": {"Name": "Willmott K.", "AuthorID": "6602649782", "AffiliationID": "60027033, 60013959", "AffiliationName": "McGuire Center for Lepidoptera, Florida Museum of Natural History, University of Florida"}, "7202284097": {"Name": "Mallet J.", "AuthorID": "7202284097", "AffiliationID": "60009982", "AffiliationName": "Department of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology, Harvard University Biology Laboratories"}}}
