We examine how the history of Phanerozoic marine biodiversity relates to environmental change. Our focus is on North America, which has a relatively densely sampled history. By transforming time series into the time-frequency domain using wavelets, histories of biodiversity are shown to be similar to sea level, temperature and oceanic chemistry at multiple timescales. Fluctuations in sea level play an important role in driving Phanerozoic biodiversity at timescales >50 Myr, and during finite intervals at shorter periods. Subsampled and transformed marine genera time series reinforce the idea that Permian-Triassic, Triassic-Jurassic, and Cretaceous-Paleogene mass extinctions were geologically rapid, whereas the Ordovician-Silurian and Late Devonian \u2018events\u2019 were longer lived. High cross wavelet power indicates that biodiversity is most similar to environmental variables (sea level, plate fragmentation, \u03b4 18 O, \u03b4 13 C, \u03b4 34 S and 87 Sr/ 86 Sr) at periods >200 Myr, when they are broadly in phase (i.e. no time lag). They are also similar at shorter periods for finite durations of time (e.g. during some mass extinctions). These results suggest that long timescale processes (e.g. plate kinematics) are the primary drivers of biodiversity, whilst processes with significant variability at shorter periods (e.g. glacio-eustasy, continental uplift and erosion, volcanism, asteroid impact) play a moderating role. Wavelet transforms are a useful approach for isolating information about times and frequencies of biological activity and commonalities with environmental variables.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85064551301", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"56354957900": {"Name": "Roberts G.G.", "AuthorID": "56354957900", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Science and Engineering, Imperial College London, South Kensington Campus"}, "25632385300": {"Name": "Mannion P.D.", "AuthorID": "25632385300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, University College London"}}}
