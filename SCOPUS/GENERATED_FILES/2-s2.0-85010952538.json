Motion-capture technology has allowed researchers to build up a detailed and complex picture of how action kinematics vary across different social contexts. Here we review three task domains\u2014point-to-point imitation tasks, motor interference tasks and reach-to-grasp tasks\u2014to critically evaluate how these tasks can inform our understanding of social interactions. First, we consider how actions within these task domains are performed in a non-social context, before highlighting how a plethora of social cues can perturb the baseline kinematics. We show that there is considerable overlap in the findings from these different tasks domains but also highlight the inconsistencies in the literature and the possible reasons for this. Specifically, we draw attention to the pitfalls of dealing with rich, kinematic data. As a way to avoid these pitfalls, we call for greater standardisation and clarity in the reporting of kinematic measures and suggest the field would benefit from a move towards more naturalistic tasks.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Imitation", "Kinematics", "Motor", "Social"], "IndexKeywords": ["Biomechanical Phenomena", "Hand Strength", "Humans", "Imitative Behavior", "Interpersonal Relations", "Motor Activity"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85010952538", "SubjectAreas": [["Experimental and Cognitive Psychology", "PSYC", "3205"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"], ["Behavioral Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2802"]], "AuthorData": {"57193121246": {"Name": "Krishnan-Barman S.", "AuthorID": "57193121246", "AffiliationID": "60109771, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, University College London"}, "57164501700": {"Name": "Forbes P.", "AuthorID": "57164501700", "AffiliationID": "60109771, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, University College London"}, "38060964400": {"Name": "Hamilton A.", "AuthorID": "38060964400", "AffiliationID": "60109771, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, University College London"}}}
