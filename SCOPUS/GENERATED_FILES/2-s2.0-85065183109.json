SLT students frequently participate as raters of intelligibility but we lack information about whether they rate intelligibility in the same way as the general public. This paper aims to determine if there is a difference in the intelligibility ratings made by SLT students (trained in speech related topics) compared to individuals from the general public (untrained). The SLT students were in year 2 of a BSc programme or the first 6 months of a MSc programme. We recorded 10 speakers with Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) related speech reading aloud the words and sentences from the Assessment of Intelligibility of Dysarthric Speech. These speech recordings were rated for intelligibility by \u2018trained\u2019 raters and \u2018untrained\u2019 raters. The effort required to understand the speech was also reported. There were no significant differences in the measures of intelligibility from the trained and untrained raters for words or sentences after adjusting for speaker by including them as a covariate in the model. There was a slight increase in effort reported by the untrained raters for the sentences. This difference in reported effort was not evident with the words. SLT students can be recruited alongside individuals from the general public as na\u00efve raters for evaluating intelligibility in people with speech disorders.", "AuthorKeywords": ["dysarthria", "Intelligibility", "Parkinson\u2019s disease", "rating", "speech"], "IndexKeywords": ["Auditory Perception", "Dysarthria", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Observer Variation", "Parkinson Disease", "Reading", "Speech Intelligibility", "Speech Perception", "Speech-Language Pathology", "Students"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85065183109", "SubjectAreas": [["Language and Linguistics", "ARTS", "1203"], ["Linguistics and Language", "SOCI", "3310"], ["Speech and Hearing", "HEAL", "3616"]], "AuthorData": {"57154237300": {"Name": "Smith C.H.", "AuthorID": "57154237300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychology and Language Science, University College London"}, "57208582203": {"Name": "Halfpenny R.", "AuthorID": "57208582203", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychology and Language Science, University College London"}, "57208582201": {"Name": "Rontiris A.", "AuthorID": "57208582201", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychology and Language Science, University College London"}, "57208586143": {"Name": "Knox-Smith L.", "AuthorID": "57208586143", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychology and Language Science, University College London"}, "25947716300": {"Name": "Patel S.", "AuthorID": "25947716300", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "Birmingham Clinical Trials Unit, University of Birmingham"}, "56354791000": {"Name": "Woolley R.L.", "AuthorID": "56354791000", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "Birmingham Clinical Trials Unit, University of Birmingham"}, "56189707700": {"Name": "Dowling F.", "AuthorID": "56189707700", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "Birmingham Clinical Trials Unit, University of Birmingham"}, "56397872600": {"Name": "Au P.", "AuthorID": "56397872600", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "Birmingham Clinical Trials Unit, University of Birmingham"}, "7003439441": {"Name": "Ives N.", "AuthorID": "7003439441", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "Birmingham Clinical Trials Unit, University of Birmingham"}, "55620170800": {"Name": "Wheatley K.", "AuthorID": "55620170800", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "Birmingham Clinical Trials Unit, University of Birmingham"}, "7202710019": {"Name": "Brady M.C.", "AuthorID": "7202710019", "AffiliationID": "60007573", "AffiliationName": "Nursing, Midwifery and Allied Health Professions Research Unit, Glasgow Caledonian University"}, "7003534063": {"Name": "Rick C.E.", "AuthorID": "7003534063", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "Nottingham Clinical Trials Unit, University of Nottingham"}, "7401438536": {"Name": "Clarke C.E.", "AuthorID": "7401438536", "AffiliationID": "60019702, 60017140", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Applied Health Research, University of Birmingham & Department of Neurology, Sandwell and West Birmingham Hospitals NHS Trust"}, "6602595266": {"Name": "Sackley C.M.", "AuthorID": "6602595266", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Life Sciences and Medicine, King\u2019s College London"}}}
