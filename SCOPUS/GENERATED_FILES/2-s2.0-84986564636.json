ZnO nanowires (NWs) are often grown onto the carbon fiber (CF) surface to improve the electrical conductivity and flexibility of ZnO, and it is important to understand and further enhance the interaction between ZnO NWs and CFs. Herein, ZnO NWs were grown onto carbon fabrics through a facile hydrothermal method, and the pull-off force to detach an individual ZnO nanowire from CF was measured using a nano-manipulator inside a scanning electron microscope chamber. Also, a novel dopamine-based functionalization method was developed to improve the interfacial adhesion between ZnO NWs and CFs. It was found that introducing polydopamine (PDA) on CF could increase significantly the adhesion strength between CF and ZnO NW and their interfacial shear strength with epoxy as measured by the single fiber microbond test. The hierarchical ZnO NWs on CF fabrics were then utilized to fabricate the laminates. The highest mode I and mode II interlaminar toughness were obtained in those laminates comprising CF/PDA/ZnO NWs owing to the high chemical bonding between ZnO NWs and PDA modified CF surface and strong mechanical interlocking between ZnO NWs and epoxy.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Electrical conductivity", "Hydrothermal methods", "Interfacial adhesions", "Interfacial shear strength", "Interlaminar toughness", "Mechanical interlocking", "Piezoelectric property", "Zno nanowires (NWs)"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84986564636", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"]], "AuthorData": {"55844323500": {"Name": "Zheng N.", "AuthorID": "55844323500", "AffiliationID": "60025709", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Advanced Materials Technology (CAMT), School of Aerospace, Mechanical and Mechatronic Engineering J07, The University of Sydney"}, "7501568993": {"Name": "Huang Y.", "AuthorID": "7501568993", "AffiliationID": "60019616", "AffiliationName": "MIIT Key Laboratory of Critical Materials Technology for New Energy Conversion and Storage, State Key Laboratory of Urban Water Resource and Environment, School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology"}, "55600876400": {"Name": "Sun W.", "AuthorID": "55600876400", "AffiliationID": "60025709", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Advanced Materials Technology (CAMT), School of Aerospace, Mechanical and Mechatronic Engineering J07, The University of Sydney"}, "13007866800": {"Name": "Du X.", "AuthorID": "13007866800", "AffiliationID": "60025709", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Advanced Materials Technology (CAMT), School of Aerospace, Mechanical and Mechatronic Engineering J07, The University of Sydney"}, "56308874100": {"Name": "Liu H.", "AuthorID": "56308874100", "AffiliationID": "60025709", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Advanced Materials Technology (CAMT), School of Aerospace, Mechanical and Mechatronic Engineering J07, The University of Sydney"}, "35109054700": {"Name": "Gao J.", "AuthorID": "35109054700", "AffiliationID": "60007381", "AffiliationName": "College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Yangzhou University"}, "15128237800": {"Name": "Mai Y.", "AuthorID": "15128237800", "AffiliationID": "60025709", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Advanced Materials Technology (CAMT), School of Aerospace, Mechanical and Mechatronic Engineering J07, The University of Sydney"}, "24460240200": {"Name": "Moody S.", "AuthorID": "24460240200", "AffiliationID": "60025709", "AffiliationName": "Australian Centre for Microscopy & Microanalysis, The University of Sydney"}}}
