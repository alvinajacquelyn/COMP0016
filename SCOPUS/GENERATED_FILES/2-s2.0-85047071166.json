This admission mechanism is usually favoured to foster equality of opportunities in education. However, there has not been an effort to systematise existing evaluations of this type of interventions. This review protocol proposes to contribute to the literature on this topic with a systematic search and a meta-analysis, from an international perspective, of the effects that randomised school admissions have on student academic performance and school socioeconomic composition measures. The results and policy implications will serve as a new and relevant contribution for researchers and policy makers related to school choice, and for education authorities involved with school lotteries.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Education policy", "Impact evaluation", "Random assignment", "School lottery", "Student allocation"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85047071166", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"]], "AuthorData": {"57202078644": {"Name": "Gonz\u00e1lez Parrao C.", "AuthorID": "57202078644", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Social Science, UCL Institute of Education, University College London"}, "57193902912": {"Name": "Guti\u00e9rrez G.", "AuthorID": "57193902912", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Social Science, UCL Institute of Education, University College London"}, "55250051800": {"Name": "O'Mara-Eves A.", "AuthorID": "55250051800", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "EPPI-Centre, Social Science Research Unit, UCL Institute of Education, University College London"}}}
