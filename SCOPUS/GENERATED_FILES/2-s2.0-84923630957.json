All Rights Reserved.Here we describe a method to conditionally induce epithelial cell transformation by the use of the 4-Hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT) inducible KalTA4-ERT2/UAS expression system1 in zebrafish larvae, and the subsequent live imaging of innate immune cell interaction with HRASG12V expressing skin cells. The KalTA4-ERT2/UAS system is both inducible and reversible which allows us to induce cell transformation with precise temporal/spatial resolution in vivo. This provides us with a unique opportunity to live image how individual preneoplastic cells interact with host tissues as soon as they emerge, then follow their progression as well as regression. Recent studies in zebrafish larvae have shown a trophic function of innate immunity in the earliest stages of tumorigenesis2,3. Our inducible system would allow us to live image the onset of cellular transformation and the subsequent host response, which may lead to important insights on the underlying mechanisms for the regulation of oncogenic trophic inflammatory responses. We also discuss how one might adapt our protocol to achieve temporal and spatial control of ectopic gene expression in any tissue of interest", "AuthorKeywords": ["4-Hydroxytamoxifen", "Conditional gene expression", "Developmental biology", "HRASG12V", "Issue 96", "KalTA4-ERT2/UAS", "Live imaging", "Neutrophils", "Skin", "Zebrafish"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Animals, Genetically Modified", "Cell Communication", "Cell Transformation, Neoplastic", "DNA", "Genetic Engineering", "Immunity, Innate", "Larva", "Microinjections", "Plasmids", "Precancerous Conditions", "Skin", "Skin Physiological Phenomena", "Transgenes", "Zebrafish", "Zebrafish Proteins"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84923630957", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Immunology and Microbiology (all)", "IMMU", "2400"]], "AuthorData": {"56032297900": {"Name": "Ramezani T.", "AuthorID": "56032297900", "AffiliationID": "60010973, 60017780, 60027272", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Inflammation Research, Queen's Medical Research Institute, The University of Edinburgh"}, "56529209600": {"Name": "Laux D.W.", "AuthorID": "56529209600", "AffiliationID": "60010973, 60017780, 60027272", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Inflammation Research, Queen's Medical Research Institute, The University of Edinburgh"}, "56529156000": {"Name": "Bravo I.R.", "AuthorID": "56529156000", "AffiliationID": "60010973, 60017780, 60027272", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Inflammation Research, Queen's Medical Research Institute, The University of Edinburgh"}, "25629573600": {"Name": "Feng Y.", "AuthorID": "25629573600", "AffiliationID": "60010973, 60017780, 60027272", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Inflammation Research, Queen's Medical Research Institute, The University of Edinburgh"}, "7403302053": {"Name": "Tada M.", "AuthorID": "7403302053", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University College London"}}}
