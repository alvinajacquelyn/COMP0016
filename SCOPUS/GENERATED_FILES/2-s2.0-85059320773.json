To study the effects of this earthquake sequence on the built environment and the impact on the communities, a collaborative reconnaissance effort was organized by the Earthquake Engineering Research Institute (EERI), the Eucentre Foundation, the European Centre for Training and Research in Earthquake Engineering (EUCentre), and the Rete dei Laboratori Universitari di Ingegneria Sismica (ReLuis). The effort consisted of two reconnaissance missions: one following the Amatrice Earthquake of 24 August 2016 and one after the end of the earthquake sequence, in May 2017. One objective of the reconnaissance effort was to evaluate existing strengthening methodologies and assess their effectiveness in mitigating the damaging effects of ground shaking. Parallel studies by the Geotechnical Extreme Events Reconnaissance (GEER) Association, presented in a companion paper, demonstrate that variations in-ground motions due to topographic site effects had a significant impact on damage distribution in the affected area. This paper presents that, in addition to these ground motion variations, variations in the vulnerability of residential and critical facilities were observed to have a significant impact on the level of damage in the region. The damage to the historical centers of Amatrice and Norcia will be used in this evaluation: the historical center of Amatrice was devastated by the sequence of earthquakes; the significant damage in Norcia was localized to individual buildings. Amatrice has not experienced the same number of devastating earthquakes as Norcia in the last 150 years. As a result, its building stock is much older than that of Norcia and there appeared to be little visual evidence of strengthening of the buildings. The distribution of damage observed throughout the region was found to be indicative of the effectiveness of strengthening and of the need for a comprehensive implementation of retrofit policies.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Built environment", "Critical facilities", "Damage distribution", "Earthquake sequences", "Historical centers", "Reconnaissance mission", "Seismic retrofits", "Topographic site effects"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85059320773", "SubjectAreas": [["Geotechnical Engineering and Engineering Geology", "EART", "1909"], ["Geophysics", "EART", "1908"]], "AuthorData": {"7003348349": {"Name": "Mazzoni S.", "AuthorID": "7003348349", "AffiliationID": "60025038", "AffiliationName": "University of California, Berkeley"}, "25627148200": {"Name": "Castori G.", "AuthorID": "25627148200", "AffiliationID": "60003003", "AffiliationName": "Dipartimento di Ingegneria, Universita' degli Studi di Perugia"}, "55945439600": {"Name": "Fulco A.", "AuthorID": "55945439600", "AffiliationID": "60003003", "AffiliationName": "Dipartimento di Ingegneria, Universita' degli Studi di Perugia"}, "26537243900": {"Name": "Galasso C.", "AuthorID": "26537243900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "55599176200": {"Name": "Calvi P.", "AuthorID": "55599176200", "AffiliationID": "60015481", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, College of Engineering, University of Washington"}, "57205441548": {"Name": "Dreyer R.", "AuthorID": "57205441548", "AffiliationID": "118486524", "AffiliationName": "Holmes Structures"}, "56640558300": {"Name": "Fischer E.", "AuthorID": "56640558300", "AffiliationID": "60013402", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil and Construction Engineering, Oregon State University"}, "56338593400": {"Name": "Sorrentino L.", "AuthorID": "56338593400", "AffiliationID": "60032350", "AffiliationName": "Dipartimento di Ingegneria Strutturale e Geotecnica, Universita' di Roma Sapienza"}, "57205438380": {"Name": "Wilson J.", "AuthorID": "57205438380", "AffiliationID": "100769318", "AffiliationName": "Clackamas County"}, "24438325600": {"Name": "Penna A.", "AuthorID": "24438325600", "AffiliationID": "100468597", "AffiliationName": "EUCENTRE"}, "7003305265": {"Name": "Magenes G.", "AuthorID": "7003305265", "AffiliationID": "100468597", "AffiliationName": "EUCENTRE"}}}
