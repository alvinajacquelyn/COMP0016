Recent developments from transmission electron microscopy (TEM; cryo-electron microscopy, electron tomography) have yielded higher resolution and fresh insights into the structure and function of these complex organelles. Microscopy in ciliated organisms, disease models, and in patients with ciliopathy diseases has dramatically expanded our understanding of the ubiquity, multisystem involvement, and importance of cilia in normal human development. Here, we review the importance of motile cilia ultrastructural studies in understanding the basis of diseases other than primary ciliary dyskinesia.", "AuthorKeywords": ["ciliopathy disease", "motile cilia", "non-respiratory", "Transmission electron microscopy"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cilia", "Ciliary Motility Disorders", "Humans", "Microscopy, Electron, Transmission"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85029670150", "SubjectAreas": [["Pathology and Forensic Medicine", "MEDI", "2734"], ["Structural Biology", "BIOC", "1315"]], "AuthorData": {"7003490596": {"Name": "Mitchison H.M.", "AuthorID": "7003490596", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Newlife Birth Defects Research Centre, Experimental and Personalised Medicine, Genetics and Genomic Medicine Programme, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "16246385000": {"Name": "Shoemark A.", "AuthorID": "16246385000", "AffiliationID": "60171138", "AffiliationName": "Division of Molecular & Clinical Medicine, School of Medicine, Ninewells Hospital and Medical School"}}}
