These abnormalities were evident when comparing the behaviour of separate (inbred: 'Hom') wildtype and NK1R-/- mouse strains. Here, we investigated whether the inbreeding protocol could influence their phenotype by comparing the behaviour of these mice with that of wildtype (NK1R+/+) and NK1R-/- progeny of heterozygous parents ('Het', derived from the same inbred strains). First, we recorded the spontaneous motor activity of the two colonies/genotypes, over 7 days. This continuous monitoring also enabled us to investigate whether the diurnal rhythm in motor activity differs in the two colonies/genotypes. NK1R-/- mice from both colonies were hyperactive compared with their wildtypes and their diurnal rhythm was also disrupted. Next, we evaluated the performance of the four groups of mice in the 5-Choice Serial Reaction-Time Task (5-CSRTT). During training, NK1R-/- mice from both colonies expressed more impulsive and perseverative behaviour than their wildtypes. During testing, only NK1R-/- mice from the Hom colony were more impulsive than their wildtypes, but NK1R-/- mice from both colonies were more perseverative. There were no colony differences in inattentiveness. Moreover, a genotype difference in this measure depended on time of day. We conclude that the hyperactivity, perseveration and, possibly, inattentiveness of NK1R-/- mice is a direct consequence of a lack of functional NK1R. However, the greater impulsivity of NK1R-/- mice depended on an interaction between a functional deficit of NK1R and other (possibly environmental and/or epigenetic) factors. Comparison of the homozygous progeny of homozygous and heterozygous breeding-pairs reveals that certain behavioural abnormalities in NK1R-/- mice are explained by their genotype, alone, but others rest on an interaction between genotype and epigenetic/environmental factors.", "AuthorKeywords": ["5-choice serial reaction-time task", "ADHD", "Attention", "Diurnal motor rhythm", "Epigenetics", "Hyperactivity", "Impulsivity", "NK1 receptor", "Perseveration", "TACR1 gene"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity", "Behavior, Animal", "Choice Behavior", "Impulsive Behavior", "Mice, Knockout", "Phenotype", "Reaction Time", "Receptors, Neurokinin-1"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84925365648", "SubjectAreas": [["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Behavioral Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2802"]], "AuthorData": {"56379624200": {"Name": "Porter A.J.", "AuthorID": "56379624200", "AffiliationID": "115086591", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology"}, "55371518000": {"Name": "Pillidge K.", "AuthorID": "55371518000", "AffiliationID": "115086591", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology"}, "56379449900": {"Name": "Tsai Y.C.", "AuthorID": "56379449900", "AffiliationID": "115086591", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology"}, "55662869700": {"Name": "Stanford S.C.", "AuthorID": "55662869700", "AffiliationID": "115086591", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology"}, "42361252800": {"Name": "Dudley J.A.", "AuthorID": "42361252800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University College London"}, "57202506125": {"Name": "Hunt S.P.", "AuthorID": "57202506125", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University College London"}, "6506845266": {"Name": "Peirson S.N.", "AuthorID": "6506845266", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851, 60008323", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Neurosciences (Nuffield Laboratory of Ophthalmology), University of Oxford, John Radcliffe Hospital"}, "35576569400": {"Name": "Brown L.A.", "AuthorID": "35576569400", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851, 60008323", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Neurosciences (Nuffield Laboratory of Ophthalmology), University of Oxford, John Radcliffe Hospital"}}}
