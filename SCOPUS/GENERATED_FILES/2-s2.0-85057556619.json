It offers a preliminary analysis of data drawn from interviews with teachers and (mostly lesson) observations in schools. It argue that, first, the policy cannot be understood without a consideration of the multi-layered context in which it is being enacted in schools. Second, it locates the policy to promote FBV as a liberal nationalist one and considers some of the problematic issues that arise from this philosophy. Third, it turns to schools and teachers to consider their reactions and responses. It is concluded that teachers and schools in this research often did attempt to neutralize potentially exclusionary readings of the policy and were effective in absorbing the requirement to promote British values. However, doubt is cast on the policy\u2019s ability to meet its aims and the paper also raise concerns about the limited amount of time given to pupils\u2019 engagement with the values.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Fundamental British values", "liberal nationalism", "policy", "schools"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85057556619", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"]], "AuthorData": {"7202132753": {"Name": "Vincent C.", "AuthorID": "7202132753", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Education"}}}
