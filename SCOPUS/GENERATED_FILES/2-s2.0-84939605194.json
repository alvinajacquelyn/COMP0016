Elevated interleukin 6 (IL-6) levels have been linked to cardiovascular disease, cancer and death. Persons with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection receiving treatment have higher IL-6 levels, but few data are available on factors associated with circulating IL-6. Methods. Participants in 3 trials with IL-6 measured at baseline were included (N = 9864). Factors associated with IL-6 were identified by linear regression. Demographic and HIV variables (nadir/entry CD4+ cell count, HIV RNA level, antiretroviral therapy regimen) were investigated in all 3 trials. In the SMART (Strategies for Management of Anti-Retroviral Therapy) trial, CD4/CD8 ratio, smoking, comorbid conditions, serum lipids, renal function (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR]), and educational level were assessed. Results. Demographics associated with higher IL-6 levels were older age and lower education, whereas black race was associated with lower IL-6. Higher HIV RNA levels were associated with higher IL-6 levels, and higher nadir CD4+ cell counts with lower IL-6 levels. Compared with efavirenz, protease inhibitors were associated with higher and nevirapine with lower IL-6 levels. Smoking and all comorbid conditions were related to higher IL-6. IL-6 levels increased with decreasing eGFR and decreasing serum lipids. Conclusions. Higher levels of IL-6 were associated with older age, nonblack race, higher body mass index, lower serum lipid levels, HIV replication, low nadir CD4+ cell count, protease inhibitor use, comorbid conditions, and decreased eGFR. Multiple factors affect inflammation in HIV and should be considered in studies of IL-6 as a biomarker of clinical outcomes.", "AuthorKeywords": ["cancer", "cardiovascular disease", "HIV", "IL-6", "inflammation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Biological Markers", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Female", "Fibrin Fibrinogen Degradation Products", "HIV Infections", "Humans", "Inflammation", "Interleukin-6", "Male", "Middle Aged", "RNA, Viral", "Smoking", "Viral Load"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84939605194", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"54379858200": {"Name": "Borges \u00c1.H.", "AuthorID": "54379858200", "AffiliationID": "60030840", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Health and Infectious Diseases Research (CHIP), Department of Infectious Diseases, University of Copenhagen"}, "35307337700": {"Name": "Lundgren J.D.", "AuthorID": "35307337700", "AffiliationID": "60030840", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Health and Infectious Diseases Research (CHIP), Department of Infectious Diseases, University of Copenhagen"}, "55755507900": {"Name": "O'Connor J.L.", "AuthorID": "55755507900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Infection and Population Health, University College London"}, "35372648800": {"Name": "Phillips A.N.", "AuthorID": "35372648800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Infection and Population Health, University College London"}, "7004714193": {"Name": "Pett S.", "AuthorID": "7004714193", "AffiliationID": "60026655, 60028333", "AffiliationName": "Kirby Institute, University of New South Wales Australia"}, "16417818000": {"Name": "R\u00f6nsholt F.F.", "AuthorID": "16417818000", "AffiliationID": "60030840, 60006564", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infectious Diseases, Rigshospitalet, University of Copenhagen"}, "56526973000": {"Name": "Vjecha M.J.", "AuthorID": "56526973000", "AffiliationID": "60020147", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Clinical Research Inc., Veterans Affairs Medical Center"}, "7202594947": {"Name": "French M.A.", "AuthorID": "7202594947", "AffiliationID": "60030929, 60084490", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Immunology, Royal Perth Hospital, PathWest Laboratory Medicine"}}}
