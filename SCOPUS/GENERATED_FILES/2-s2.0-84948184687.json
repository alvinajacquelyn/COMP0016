All righrts reserved.Young people are impacted by the relations established in the context of multidimensional violence distributed in private and public spaces of urban areas. This article presents stories of violence suffered and committed by young individuals who live in Itapo\u00e3, part of the Metropolitan Area of Brasilia. This is a transversal and descriptive study, using a quantitative approach and a convenience sample of 190 young men and women aged 15 to 24 years. Forty-four questions previously validated were used as the data collection instrument. As for the experiences of violence, 51% reported having experienced some sort throughout life, and 24% in the last 12 months. Young people who have experienced some episode of violence throughout life also declared that the area or neighborhood where they live does not promote urban well-being for its residents (p <0.023); they expressed feelings compatible with depression (p = 001); and self-reported their health condition as bad (p = 000). The experiences of violence and youth vulnerabilities processes were discussed in the context of social injustice and limitations of human capabilities.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Social change", "Social determinants of health", "Urban", "Violence", "Young adult"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Brazil", "Depression", "Female", "Health Status", "Humans", "Male", "Residence Characteristics", "Social Justice", "Violence", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84948184687", "SubjectAreas": [["Health Policy", "MEDI", "2719"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"36010963900": {"Name": "Moura L.", "AuthorID": "36010963900", "AffiliationID": "60024989", "AffiliationName": "Sociedade e Coopera\u00e7\u00e3o Internacional, Universidade de Bras\u00edlia"}, "57208202014": {"Name": "Vasconcelos A.", "AuthorID": "57208202014", "AffiliationID": "60024989", "AffiliationName": "Sociedade e Coopera\u00e7\u00e3o Internacional, Universidade de Bras\u00edlia"}, "37075384600": {"Name": "Oliveira C.", "AuthorID": "37075384600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Epidemiology and Public Health Department, Institute of Epidemiology and Health Care, University College of London"}}}
