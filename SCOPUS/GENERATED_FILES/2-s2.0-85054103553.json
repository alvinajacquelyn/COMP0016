However, significant time and effort is frequently required to tune various Kalman filter model parameters, e.g. Process noise covariance, pre-whitening filter models for non-white noise, etc. Conventional optimization techniques for tuning can get stuck in poor local minima and can be expensive to implement with real sensor data. To address these issues, a new 'black box' Bayesian optimization strategy is developed for automatically tuning Kalman filters. In this approach, performance is characterized by one of two stochastic objective functions: Normalized estimation error squared (NEES) when ground truth state models are available, or the normalized innovation error squared (NIS) when only sensor data is available. By intelligently sampling the parameter space to both learn and exploit a nonparametric Gaussian process surrogate function for the NEESINIS costs, Bayesian optimization can efficiently identify multiple local minima and provide uncertainty quantification on its results.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Bayesian optimization", "Conventional optimization", "Data fusion applications", "Kalman filter model", "Objective functions", "Pre-whitening filters", "Simultaneous localization and mapping problems", "Uncertainty quantifications"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85054103553", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition", "COMP", "1707"], ["Signal Processing", "COMP", "1711"], ["Statistics, Probability and Uncertainty", "DECI", "1804"], ["Instrumentation", "PHYS", "3105"]], "AuthorData": {"57204017305": {"Name": "Chen Z.", "AuthorID": "57204017305", "AffiliationID": "60000221", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University of Colorado Boulder, 430 UCB"}, "35976340800": {"Name": "Heckman C.", "AuthorID": "35976340800", "AffiliationID": "60000221", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University of Colorado Boulder, 430 UCB"}, "7003972937": {"Name": "Julier S.", "AuthorID": "7003972937", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "57201043894": {"Name": "Ahmed N.", "AuthorID": "57201043894", "AffiliationID": "60000221", "AffiliationName": "Smead Aerospace Engineering Sciences, University of Colorado Boulder, 429 UCB"}}}
