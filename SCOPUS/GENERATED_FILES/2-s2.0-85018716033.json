Regional Studies. China has witnessed the orchestration of city-regionalism and two different regional-scale mechanisms have influenced this integration and cooperation: the top-down state-mandated process and the bottom-up process initiated by local governments. However, this has not been a smooth process and it is shaped by the internal politics generated by China\u2019s state configurations. Using the Yangtze River Delta as a case study, this paper argues that China\u2019s territorial administrative divisions are a historical configuration that is essential to understand the efforts to construct city-regions as well as to understand the failure to create a new sub-national state space.", "AuthorKeywords": ["China", "city-regionalism", "context specific", "political construct", "territorial administrative divisions"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85018716033", "SubjectAreas": [["Environmental Science (all)", "ENVI", "2300"], ["Social Sciences (all)", "SOCI", "3300"]], "AuthorData": {"56522945700": {"Name": "Li Y.", "AuthorID": "56522945700", "AffiliationID": "60010851", "AffiliationName": "School of Public Administration, National Research Centre for Resettlement, Hohai University"}, "7403463877": {"Name": "Wu F.", "AuthorID": "7403463877", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Bartlett School of Planning, University College London"}}}
