This prospective clinical study reports on preliminary outcomes of twenty volunteers diagnosed with BMS who have undergone the conventional treatment prior to laser phototherapy. LPT consisted of weekly sessions of LPT (660 nm), for a period of 10 weeks. The laser protocol consisted of the following parameters: 40 mW, 10 J cm<sup>2</sup> and 0.4 J per point, irradiation time of 10 s. In all sessions, the burning intensity was evaluated with a 10 cm Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). The burning intensity evaluation by VAS was performed immediately before and after each LPT session. Nonparametric test of Wilcoxon was used for statistical analysis, considering a significance level of 5%. All volunteers reported reduced burning intensity in all sessions when compared to the previous one and reduction in VAS scores by up to 49% in the last clinical session when compared to the first session. When only the VAS baseline of the first session was compared with the consecutive sessions, there was a statistically significant reduction in VAS scores in almost all sessions. The LPT may be an alternative treatment for the relief of oral burning symptoms in patients with BMS.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Burning Mouth Syndrome", "Female", "Humans", "Low-Level Light Therapy", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Prospective Studies"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84940963354", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"]], "AuthorData": {"55207693600": {"Name": "Dos Santos L.", "AuthorID": "55207693600", "AffiliationID": "60011039", "AffiliationName": "Instituto de Pesquisas Energ\u00e9ticas e Nucleares, Centro de Lasers e Aplica\u00e7\u00f5es"}, "12757725800": {"Name": "Nogueira G.", "AuthorID": "12757725800", "AffiliationID": "60011039", "AffiliationName": "Instituto de Pesquisas Energ\u00e9ticas e Nucleares, Centro de Lasers e Aplica\u00e7\u00f5es"}, "56754796300": {"Name": "De Andrade S.", "AuthorID": "56754796300", "AffiliationID": "60031482", "AffiliationName": "Departamento de Cl\u00ednica e Odontologia Preventiva, Centro de Ci\u00eancias da Sa\u00fade, Universidade Federal de Pernambuco"}, "7003789865": {"Name": "Le\u00e3o J.", "AuthorID": "7003789865", "AffiliationID": "60031482", "AffiliationName": "Departamento de Cl\u00ednica e Odontologia Preventiva, Centro de Ci\u00eancias da Sa\u00fade, Universidade Federal de Pernambuco"}, "8623600200": {"Name": "De Freitas P.", "AuthorID": "8623600200", "AffiliationID": "60008088", "AffiliationName": "Laborat\u00f5rio Especial de Lasers em Odontologia (LELO), Departamento de Dent\u00edstica, Faculdade de Odontologia, Universidade de S\u00e3o Paulo"}}}
