The special issue is premised on the concept that artistic life in Eastern Europe was profoundly shaped by the structures, conventions and workings of the overarching system, with artists and critics compelled to negotiate its productive contradictions. It examines the quotidian functioning of art scenes across the region that entailed the drawing up of tacit compromises and maintenance of calculated ambiguities in relations between party authorities and artists. Ultimately it was the latent and unrealised promise of actually existing socialism as much as its demonstrative failings that marked a crucial difference in the attitude of East European artists to the utopian reverberations of the era.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Amateur art", "Art institutions", "Eastern Europe", "Maja Fowkes", "Neo-avant-garde", "Official art", "Police informers", "Reuben Fowkes", "Socialism", "Socialist art", "Socialist internationalism"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85055346149", "SubjectAreas": [["Cultural Studies", "SOCI", "3316"], ["Visual Arts and Performing Arts", "ARTS", "1213"]], "AuthorData": {"56976224200": {"Name": "Fowkes M.", "AuthorID": "56976224200", "AffiliationID": "116154276", "AffiliationName": "Translocal Institute for Contemporary Art"}, "32067715200": {"Name": "Fowkes R.", "AuthorID": "32067715200", "AffiliationID": "116154276", "AffiliationName": "Translocal Institute for Contemporary Art"}}}
