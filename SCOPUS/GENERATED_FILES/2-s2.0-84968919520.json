TNF signaling can result in different biological outcomes including gene activation and cell death induction in the form of apoptosis or necroptosis. RIPK1 is believed to be crucial for regulating the balance between these opposing outcomes. It is therefore not surprising that RIPK1 is highly regulated, most notably by phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and their respective reversals. In this review, we discuss the biological functions of RIPK1 within the context of TNFR1 signaling. Finally, we discuss recent advances in the knowledge on three ubiquitin E3 ligases that exert regulatory functions on RIPK1 signaling: cIAP1, cIAP2, and LUBAC.", "AuthorKeywords": ["CIAP1/2", "LUBAC", "Necroptosis", "RIPK1", "TNFR1", "Ubiquitination"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Cell Death", "Humans", "Receptor-Interacting Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases", "Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Type I", "Signal Transduction", "Ubiquitin", "Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84968919520", "SubjectAreas": [["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"44261202600": {"Name": "Peltzer N.", "AuthorID": "44261202600", "AffiliationID": "60109234, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cell Death, Cancer, and Inflammation (CCCI), UCL Cancer Institute, University College London"}, "25228348600": {"Name": "Darding M.", "AuthorID": "25228348600", "AffiliationID": "60109234, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cell Death, Cancer, and Inflammation (CCCI), UCL Cancer Institute, University College London"}, "7003995251": {"Name": "Walczak H.", "AuthorID": "7003995251", "AffiliationID": "60109234, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cell Death, Cancer, and Inflammation (CCCI), UCL Cancer Institute, University College London"}}}
