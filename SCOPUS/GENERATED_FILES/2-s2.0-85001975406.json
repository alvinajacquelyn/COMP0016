Due to ineffective domestic influencing strategies, the CSOs adopted the TAN approach and escalated to an international supply chain movement approach (ISCMA) aiming to influence international stakeholders at each stage of the sugar supply chain in order to leverage boomerang pressure on the sugar producing companies and the Government of Cambodia. Despite its resourceful networking strategies, the ISCMA failed to leverage significant influence on the sugar companies and the government to achieve its demands. The failure was not due to weak networks, but was in part due to the political nexus between the government and the sugar companies. This article suggests that to ensure the effectiveness of CSOs\u2019 actions within the TAN framework in the global production networks, one should take into account the power of the government in relation to local politico-commercial elites.", "AuthorKeywords": ["civil society organizations", "global supply chains", "production networks", "Social movements", "transnational advocacy networks"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85001975406", "SubjectAreas": [["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"]], "AuthorData": {"57188650941": {"Name": "Sokphea Y.", "AuthorID": "57188650941", "AffiliationID": "60026553", "AffiliationName": "School of Social and Political Sciences, University of Melbourne"}}}
