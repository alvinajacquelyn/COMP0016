It is shown that the system is capable of producing the required multiple pulses burst with pulse widths of 12 ns and pulse inter-delays down to approximately 135 ns. With additional fluence considerations we expect no improvement from this technique for photoacoustic tomography setting, while our laser diode based setup is a highly promising compact alternative for Gr\u00fcneisen relaxation related studies in photoacoustic microscopy.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Gr\u00fcneisen parameter", "Laser diodes", "Photoacoustic imaging", "Photoacoustic microscopy"], "IndexKeywords": ["Fluences", "Induced signal", "Multiple pulse", "Photo-acoustic imaging", "Photoacoustic signals", "Photoacoustic tomography", "Pulsewidths", "Relaxation effect"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85019526759", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Mechanics of Materials", "ENGI", "2211"]], "AuthorData": {"56785637100": {"Name": "Cherkashin M.", "AuthorID": "56785637100", "AffiliationID": "60005322", "AffiliationName": "Photonics and Terahertz Technology, Ruhr-University Bochum"}, "56211779700": {"Name": "Brenner C.", "AuthorID": "56211779700", "AffiliationID": "60005322", "AffiliationName": "Photonics and Terahertz Technology, Ruhr-University Bochum"}, "56786410300": {"Name": "G\u00f6ring L.", "AuthorID": "56786410300", "AffiliationID": "60005322", "AffiliationName": "Photonics and Terahertz Technology, Ruhr-University Bochum"}, "56097226400": {"Name": "D\u00f6pke B.", "AuthorID": "56097226400", "AffiliationID": "60005322", "AffiliationName": "Photonics and Terahertz Technology, Ruhr-University Bochum"}, "6602136208": {"Name": "Gerhardt N.", "AuthorID": "6602136208", "AffiliationID": "60005322", "AffiliationName": "Photonics and Terahertz Technology, Ruhr-University Bochum"}, "7403255343": {"Name": "Hofmann M.", "AuthorID": "7403255343", "AffiliationID": "60005322", "AffiliationName": "Photonics and Terahertz Technology, Ruhr-University Bochum"}}}
