Quarterly Journal of the Royal Meteorological Society published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of the Royal Meteorological Society.Recent studies have identified the significance of urban heat advection (UHA) as the process whereby heat, originally generated through urban modifications to the Earth's surface, is transported downwind of urban areas. Current techniques to separate UHA from local heat signals do not exclude the additional potential impacts of regional heat advection (RHA). For example, large-scale coastal effects, in addition to latitude and longitude variations, could cause downwind temperature gradients to exist. In this study, the numerical Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model coupled with the Building Effect Parameterization (BEP) urban scheme is used to simulate meteorological fields for Birmingham, UK, at a high horizontal resolution (1 km2). The model is run over six case-studies to provide over 1600 h of simulations (called \u2018urban-case\u2019), and evaluated using a unique high-resolution dataset from 32 weather stations across Birmingham. The UHA component is decomposed from RHA by conducting a second set of simulations (called \u2018rural-case\u2019), where all urban land-use is replaced with vegetation. Simulated directional \u2018rural-case\u2019 time-mean temperature fields, that show RHA, are then subtracted from the equivalent \u2018urban-case\u2019 time-mean fields. This effectively separates UHA from RHA and shows that a significant portion of heat, previously attributed to UHA in mesoscale modelling, is found to be due to RHA. Using the new methodology, a UHA signal up to 1.9 \u00b0C is found largely confined to within, and several kilometres downwind of, the urban areas. These UHA effects highlight the importance of using wind direction segmentation when determining local climate.", "AuthorKeywords": ["mesoscale modelling", "regional heat advection", "temperature", "urban heat advection", "urban heat islands", "WRF"], "IndexKeywords": ["Heat advection", "Horizontal resolution", "Mesoscale modelling", "Meteorological fields", "Time mean temperature", "Urban heat island", "Weather research and forecasting", "Weather research and forecasting models"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85020214289", "SubjectAreas": [["Atmospheric Science", "EART", "1902"]], "AuthorData": {"55574825700": {"Name": "Bassett R.", "AuthorID": "55574825700", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "School of Geography, Earth and Environmental Sciences, University of Birmingham"}, "57201570597": {"Name": "Cai X.", "AuthorID": "57201570597", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "School of Geography, Earth and Environmental Sciences, University of Birmingham"}, "7102092302": {"Name": "Chapman L.", "AuthorID": "7102092302", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "School of Geography, Earth and Environmental Sciences, University of Birmingham"}, "55976888100": {"Name": "Heaviside C.", "AuthorID": "55976888100", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "Chemical and Environmental Effects Department, CRCE, Public Health England"}, "7003902659": {"Name": "Thornes J.", "AuthorID": "7003902659", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "Chemical and Environmental Effects Department, CRCE, Public Health England"}}}
