In response to these challenges, the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research has embarked on the development of a quantified integrated assessment model to support climate protection decision-making at a city scale. This chapter reviews the challenges faced by cities and city managers before introducing how the Tyndall Centre cities programme is addressing some of these challenges. As much as 80% of global greenhouse gas emissions are the result of urban activity and it is therefore appropriate to analyse emissions and develop mitigation strategies at this scale. A regional economic model is used to provide the quantified economic scenarios that are the starting point for analysis of vulnerability and greenhouse gas emissions. Effective decision-making relies on the engagement of stakeholders, of which there are many in urban areas.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85076078929", "SubjectAreas": [["Economics, Econometrics and Finance (all)", "ECON", "2000"], ["Business, Management and Accounting (all)", "BUSI", "1400"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Environmental Science (all)", "ENVI", "2300"], ["Social Sciences (all)", "SOCI", "3300"]], "AuthorData": {"36705547500": {"Name": "Dawson R.", "AuthorID": "36705547500", "AffiliationID": "60006222, 60122652", "AffiliationName": "Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research, Newcastle University"}, "57173422400": {"Name": "Hall J.", "AuthorID": "57173422400", "AffiliationID": "60122652", "AffiliationName": "Tyndall Centre for Climate Research"}, "7202693290": {"Name": "Barr S.", "AuthorID": "7202693290", "AffiliationID": "60122652", "AffiliationName": "Tyndall Centre for Climate Research"}, "56246892400": {"Name": "Ford A.", "AuthorID": "56246892400", "AffiliationID": "60006222", "AffiliationName": "Newcastle University"}, "8582225600": {"Name": "Walsh C.", "AuthorID": "8582225600", "AffiliationID": "60122652", "AffiliationName": "Tyndall Centre for Climate Research"}, "26634793600": {"Name": "Carney S.", "AuthorID": "26634793600", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "Manchester University"}, "38361319900": {"Name": "Harwatt H.", "AuthorID": "38361319900", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Transport Studies, University of Leeds"}, "7005713858": {"Name": "Batty M.", "AuthorID": "7005713858", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "7006226667": {"Name": "Bristow A.", "AuthorID": "7006226667", "AffiliationID": "60000891", "AffiliationName": "Transport Studies Group, Department of Civil and Building Engineering, Loughborough University"}, "35222804600": {"Name": "Zanni A.", "AuthorID": "35222804600", "AffiliationID": "60000891", "AffiliationName": "Transport Studies Group, Department of Civil and Building Engineering, Loughborough University"}, "8644142200": {"Name": "Dagoumas A.", "AuthorID": "8644142200", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Cambridge Centre for Climate Change Mitigation Research, University of Cambridge"}, "57189272480": {"Name": "Evans S.", "AuthorID": "57189272480", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "CASA (Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis), University College London"}, "57207500155": {"Name": "Tight M.", "AuthorID": "57207500155", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Transport Studies, University of Leeds"}, "7202427420": {"Name": "K\u00f6hler J.", "AuthorID": "7202427420", "AffiliationID": "60033451", "AffiliationName": "Fraunhofer ISI (Institute for Systems and Innovation research)"}}}
