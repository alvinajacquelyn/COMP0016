Following hypoxia-ischemia we assessed whether inhaled 45-50% Argon from 2-26h augmented hypothermia neuroprotection in a neonatal piglet model, using MRS and aEEG, which predict outcome in babies with neonatal encephalopathy, and immunohistochemistry. Following cerebral hypoxia-ischemia, 20 Newborn male Large White piglets<40h were randomized to: (i) Cooling (33\u00b0C) from 2-26 h (n=10); or (ii) Cooling and inhaled 45-50% Argon (Cooling+Argon) from 2-26h (n=8). Whole-brain phosphorus-31 and regional proton MRS were acquired at baseline, 24 and 48h after hypoxia-ischemia. EEG was monitored. At 48h after hypoxia-ischemia, cell death (TUNEL) was evaluated over 7 brain regions. There were no differences in body weight, duration of hypoxia-ischemia or insult severity; throughout the study there were no differences in heart rate, arterial blood pressure, blood biochemistry and inotrope support. Two piglets in the Cooling+Argon group were excluded. Comparing Cooling+Argon with Cooling there was preservation of whole-brain MRS ATP and PCr/Pi at 48h after hypoxia-ischemia (p<0.001 for both) and lower 1H MRS lactate/N acetyl aspartate in white (p=0.03 and 0.04) but not gray matter at 24 and 48h. EEG background recovery was faster (p<0.01) with Cooling+Argon. An overall difference between average cell-death of Cooling versus Cooling+Argon was observed (p<0.01); estimated cells per mm2 were 23.9 points lower (95% C.I. 7.3-40.5) for the Cooling+Argon versus Cooling. Inhaled 45-50% Argon from 2-26h augmented hypothermic protection at 48h after hypoxia-ischemia shown by improved brain energy metabolism on MRS, faster EEG recovery and reduced cell death on TUNEL. Argon may provide a cheap and practical therapy to augment cooling for neonatal encephalopathy.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Argon", "Hypoxia-ischemia", "Neonatal encephalopathy", "Noble gas", "Therapeutic hypothermia"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Animals, Newborn", "Argon", "Aspartic Acid", "Asphyxia Neonatorum", "Blood Chemical Analysis", "Blood Pressure", "Brain", "Cell Death", "Disease Models, Animal", "Heart Rate", "Hypothermia, Induced", "Hypoxia-Ischemia, Brain", "Inhalation", "Lactic Acid", "Male", "Neuroprotection", "Random Allocation", "Respiration, Artificial", "Sus scrofa"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84951117480", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"]], "AuthorData": {"7003578598": {"Name": "Broad K.D.", "AuthorID": "7003578598", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Women's Health, University College London"}, "55318034900": {"Name": "Fierens I.", "AuthorID": "55318034900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Women's Health, University College London"}, "55110477100": {"Name": "Rocha-Ferreira E.", "AuthorID": "55110477100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Women's Health, University College London"}, "55812285300": {"Name": "Ezzati M.", "AuthorID": "55812285300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Women's Health, University College London"}, "55755688000": {"Name": "Hassell J.", "AuthorID": "55755688000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Women's Health, University College London"}, "35085901300": {"Name": "Alonso-Alconada D.", "AuthorID": "35085901300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Women's Health, University College London"}, "56123701700": {"Name": "Kawano G.", "AuthorID": "56123701700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Women's Health, University College London"}, "7102941268": {"Name": "Robertson N.J.", "AuthorID": "7102941268", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Women's Health, University College London"}, "35784226800": {"Name": "Fleiss B.", "AuthorID": "35784226800", "AffiliationID": "60123796", "AffiliationName": "University Paris Diderot, Sorbonne Paris Cite, UMRS"}, "57203054731": {"Name": "Gressens P.", "AuthorID": "57203054731", "AffiliationID": "60123796", "AffiliationName": "University Paris Diderot, Sorbonne Paris Cite, UMRS"}, "8576309800": {"Name": "Bainbridge A.", "AuthorID": "8576309800", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Physics and Bioengineering, University College London NHS Trust"}, "57201771318": {"Name": "Ma D.", "AuthorID": "57201771318", "AffiliationID": "60002484, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anaesthetics, Intensive Care and Pain Medicine, Department of Surgery and Cancer, Imperial College London, Chelsea and Westminster Hospital"}, "6507301690": {"Name": "Tachtsidis I.", "AuthorID": "6507301690", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "7004309393": {"Name": "Golay X.", "AuthorID": "7004309393", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "57203045001": {"Name": "Sanders R.D.", "AuthorID": "57203045001", "AffiliationID": "60032179", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anesthesiology, University of Wisconsin"}}}
