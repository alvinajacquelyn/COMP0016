However, simulations have shown that this rotational symmetry can be broken when there are attractive interactions between the polymers. We investigate the phases that emerge in these circumstances, and we quantify the effect of the symmetry assumption on the phase behavior of the system. In the absence of this assumption, one can observe large differences in the equilibrium densities between the rotationally symmetric case and the non-rotationally symmetric case. A simple analytical model is developed that illustrates the driving thermodynamic forces responsible for this symmetry breaking. Our results have implications for the current understanding of the behavior of polymers in cylindrical nanopores.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Attractive interactions", "Cylindrical channel", "Cylindrical nanopores", "Equilibrium density", "Rotational symmetries", "Statistical theory", "Symmetry-breaking", "Thermodynamic forces", "Computer Simulation", "Monte Carlo Method", "Nanopores", "Polymers", "Rotation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84923777755", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"]], "AuthorData": {"55263532900": {"Name": "Osmanovi\u0107 D.", "AuthorID": "55263532900", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "London Centre for Nanotechnology (LCN), Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "6701845862": {"Name": "Hoogenboom B.W.", "AuthorID": "6701845862", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "London Centre for Nanotechnology (LCN), Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "57203260116": {"Name": "Ford I.J.", "AuthorID": "57203260116", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "London Centre for Nanotechnology (LCN), Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "56531960600": {"Name": "Kerr-Winter M.", "AuthorID": "56531960600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Mathematics, Physics and Engineering in the Life Sciences and Experimental Biology, University College London"}, "56531669700": {"Name": "Eccleston R.C.", "AuthorID": "56531669700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Mathematics, Physics and Engineering in the Life Sciences and Experimental Biology, University College London"}}}
