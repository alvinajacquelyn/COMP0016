Various approaches have recently been proposed to effectively exploit contextual information such as mobility, communication and mobile usage patterns for quantifying users' emotional states and wellbeing. In particular, it has been shown that location information collected by means of smartphones can be successfully used to monitor and predict depression levels, as measured by means of standard scores such as PHQ-8. In this paper, we investigate the design of novel digital biomarkers based on the fine-grained characterization of the mobility patterns of a user, also considering the temporal dimension of their movements (e.g., sequence of places visited by them). We show that the proposed biomarkers have a statistically significant association with emotional states. We also demonstrate that emotional states have a stronger relationship with mobility patterns of weekdays compared to all days of a week. Finally, we discuss the challenges in using these biomarkers in the implementation of \"emotion-aware\" systems for digital health.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Anticipatory computing", "Digital biomarkers", "Mobile sensing", "Mobility analysis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Anticipatory computing", "Contextual information", "Location information", "Machine learning techniques", "Mobile monitoring", "Mobile sensing", "Mobility analysis", "Temporal dimensions"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85029672273", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"56468916300": {"Name": "Mehrotra A.", "AuthorID": "56468916300", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60111768", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Alan Turing Institute"}, "9743656700": {"Name": "Musolesi M.", "AuthorID": "9743656700", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60111768", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Alan Turing Institute"}}}
