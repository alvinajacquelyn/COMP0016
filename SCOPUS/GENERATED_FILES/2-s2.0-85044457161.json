This paper presents the numerical approaches to analyse the integrated thermal and acoustical performance of ventilation windows, for a residential building in tropical climate which employs double-layer noise mitigation window for natural ventilation. Given a set of outdoor wind conditions, the distributions of indoor flow and temperature fields are simulated using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model. The thermal comfort is evaluated using statistical Predicted Mean Vote (PMV) method. For the acoustic performance, noise radiation from road traffic is assumed as the noise source, and the sound insulation of building fa\u00e7ade is simulated using Finite Element Method (FEM). From the simulation results, it is found that the thermal satisfaction response is closely related to the inlet wind temperature and speed, and the window opening size greatly affects the ventilation performance. From the case study in Singapore, during certain season, day/night time and with sufficient wind flow, the ventilation window can provide enough fresh air, maintain adequate thermal comfort and quiet acoustic environment for the occupants. The numerical approaches presented in this paper are applicable to general window design studies, and the simulation findings can be incorporated into green building planning. The advantages of using simulation approaches are highlighted and their limitations are discussed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["natural ventilation", "sound insulation", "thermal comfort", "ventilation window"], "IndexKeywords": ["Acoustic environment", "Acoustic performance", "Acoustical performance", "Computational fluid dynamics modeling", "Natural ventilation", "Numerical approaches", "Residential building", "Ventilation performance"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85044457161", "SubjectAreas": [["Building and Construction", "ENGI", "2215"], ["Energy (miscellaneous)", "ENER", "2101"]], "AuthorData": {"56088714900": {"Name": "Yu X.", "AuthorID": "56088714900", "AffiliationID": "60004678, 60025710", "AffiliationName": "Institute of High Performance Computing, Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR)"}, "57195635278": {"Name": "Zhang Q.", "AuthorID": "57195635278", "AffiliationID": "60004678, 60025710", "AffiliationName": "Institute of High Performance Computing, Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR)"}, "36056044500": {"Name": "Cui F.", "AuthorID": "36056044500", "AffiliationID": "60004678, 60025710", "AffiliationName": "Institute of High Performance Computing, Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR)"}, "55485135500": {"Name": "Kang J.", "AuthorID": "55485135500", "AffiliationID": "60001881", "AffiliationName": "School of Architecture, University of Sheffield"}}}
