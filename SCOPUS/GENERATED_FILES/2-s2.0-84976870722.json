The alkyl chain is largely in the all-trans conformation, which occurs despite the small size of the nanoparticle, (mean diameter = 3.9 nm). Inelastic neutron scattering spectroscopy is readily able to characterise organic surface layers on nanoparticles; the nature of the material is irrelevant: whether the nanoparticle core is an oxide, a metal or a semiconductor makes no difference. Comparison to DFT calculations allows insights into the nature and conformation of the adsorbed layer.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84976870722", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"]], "AuthorData": {"56204136500": {"Name": "Rogers S.M.", "AuthorID": "56204136500", "AffiliationID": "60170248, 60009523, 60023254", "AffiliationName": "UK Catalysis Hub, Research Complex at Harwell, STFC Rutherford Appleton Laboratory"}, "6507384807": {"Name": "Dimitratos N.", "AuthorID": "6507384807", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "Cardiff Catalysis Institute, School of Chemistry, Cardiff University"}, "7201752667": {"Name": "Wells P.P.", "AuthorID": "7201752667", "AffiliationID": "60170248, 60009523, 60023254", "AffiliationName": "UK Catalysis Hub, Research Complex at Harwell, STFC Rutherford Appleton Laboratory"}, "56488383400": {"Name": "Catlow C.R.A.", "AuthorID": "56488383400", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "Cardiff Catalysis Institute, School of Chemistry, Cardiff University"}, "57205871430": {"Name": "Jones W.", "AuthorID": "57205871430", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "Cardiff Catalysis Institute, School of Chemistry, Cardiff University"}, "7004775593": {"Name": "Bowker M.", "AuthorID": "7004775593", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "Cardiff Catalysis Institute, School of Chemistry, Cardiff University"}, "7401647290": {"Name": "Parker S.F.", "AuthorID": "7401647290", "AffiliationID": "60001724, 60009523, 60023254", "AffiliationName": "ISIS Facility, STFC Rutherford Appleton Laboratory"}, "6506096669": {"Name": "Kanaras A.G.", "AuthorID": "6506096669", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "School of Physics and Astronomy, Faculty of Physical Sciences and Engineering, University of Southampton"}}}
