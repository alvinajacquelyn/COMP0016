All rights reserved.Unequivocal demonstration of the therapeutic utility of \u03b3-retroviral vectors for gene therapy applications targeting the hematopoietic system was accompanied by instances of insertional mutagenesis. These events stimulated the ongoing development of putatively safer integrating vector systems and analysis methods to characterize and compare integration site (IS) biosafety profiles. Continuing advances in next-generation sequencing technologies are driving the generation of ever-more complex IS datasets. Available bioinformatic tools to compare such datasets focus on the association of integration sites (ISs) with selected genomic and epigenetic features, and the choice of these features determines the ability to discriminate between datasets. We describe the scalable application of point-process coherence analysis (CA) to compare patterns produced by vector ISs across genomic intervals, uncoupled from association with genomic features. To explore the utility of CA in the context of an unresolved question, we asked whether the differing transduction conditions used in the initial Paris and London SCID-X1 gene therapy trials result in divergent genome-wide integration profiles. We tested a transduction carried out under each condition, and showed that CA could indeed resolve differences in IS distributions. Existence of these differences was confirmed by the application of established methods to compare integration datasets.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84960952278", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Medicine", "BIOC", "1313"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"]], "AuthorData": {"8970366300": {"Name": "Hallwirth C.", "AuthorID": "8970366300", "AffiliationID": "60026571, 60016007", "AffiliationName": "Gene Therapy Research Unit, Children's Medical Research Institute, Children's Hospital at Westmead"}, "36699453100": {"Name": "Garg G.", "AuthorID": "36699453100", "AffiliationID": "60019544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry and Biomolecular Sciences, Macquarie University"}, "7004592947": {"Name": "Ginn S.", "AuthorID": "7004592947", "AffiliationID": "60121699, 60025709", "AffiliationName": "Sydney Medical School, University of Sydney"}, "56656357400": {"Name": "Hetherington N.", "AuthorID": "56656357400", "AffiliationID": "60026571, 60016007", "AffiliationName": "Gene Therapy Research Unit, Children's Medical Research Institute, Children's Hospital at Westmead"}, "7103382748": {"Name": "Alexander I.", "AuthorID": "7103382748", "AffiliationID": "60025709", "AffiliationName": "University of Sydney, Discipline of Paediatrics and Child Health"}, "55577597300": {"Name": "Ranganathan S.", "AuthorID": "55577597300", "AffiliationID": "60019544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry and Biomolecular Sciences, Macquarie University"}, "56625506900": {"Name": "Peters T.", "AuthorID": "56625506900", "AffiliationID": "60029470", "AffiliationName": "CSIRO Digital Productivity Flagship"}, "7202941819": {"Name": "Buckley M.", "AuthorID": "7202941819", "AffiliationID": "60029470", "AffiliationName": "CSIRO Digital Productivity Flagship"}, "8585041400": {"Name": "Kramer B.", "AuthorID": "8585041400", "AffiliationID": "60026571", "AffiliationName": "Children's Cancer Research Unit, Children's Hospital at Westmead"}, "36339625500": {"Name": "Hyman J.", "AuthorID": "36339625500", "AffiliationID": "60026571", "AffiliationName": "Children's Cancer Research Unit, Children's Hospital at Westmead"}, "24598009300": {"Name": "Malani N.", "AuthorID": "24598009300", "AffiliationID": "60003711", "AffiliationName": "University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Department of Microbiology"}, "35425749000": {"Name": "Bushman F.", "AuthorID": "35425749000", "AffiliationID": "60003711", "AffiliationName": "University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Department of Microbiology"}, "55262401500": {"Name": "Ruan X.", "AuthorID": "55262401500", "AffiliationID": "60031198, 60025710", "AffiliationName": "Genome Institute of Singapore, Agency for Science, Technology and Research"}, "55353268500": {"Name": "Veeravalli L.", "AuthorID": "55353268500", "AffiliationID": "60031198, 60025710", "AffiliationName": "Genome Institute of Singapore, Agency for Science, Technology and Research"}, "11142016600": {"Name": "Shahab A.", "AuthorID": "11142016600", "AffiliationID": "60031198, 60025710", "AffiliationName": "Genome Institute of Singapore, Agency for Science, Technology and Research"}, "7401658175": {"Name": "Wei C.", "AuthorID": "7401658175", "AffiliationID": "60031198, 60025710", "AffiliationName": "Genome Institute of Singapore, Agency for Science, Technology and Research"}, "55865672000": {"Name": "Liddle C.", "AuthorID": "55865672000", "AffiliationID": "60121699, 60003992, 60025709", "AffiliationName": "Storr Liver Centre, Westmead Millennium Institute, Sydney Medical School, University of Sydney"}, "7005085037": {"Name": "Thrasher A.", "AuthorID": "7005085037", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Molecular Immunology Unit, Institute of Child Health, University College London"}}}
