Objective To explore whether response rates with a new intensive chemotherapy regimen, CBOP/BEP (carboplatin, bleomycin, vincristine, cisplatin/BEP), versus those in concurrent patients treated with standard BEP justify a phase 3 trial. Design, setting, and participants We conducted a phase 2 open-label randomised trial in patients with germ cell tumours of any extracranial primary site and one or more International Germ Cell Cancer Collaborative Group poor-prognosis features. Patients were randomised between 2005 and 2009 at 16 UK centres. Intervention BEP (bleomycin 30 000 IU) was composed of four cycles over 12 wk. CBOP/BEP was composed of 2 \u00d7 CBOP, 2 \u00d7 BO, and 3 \u00d7 BEP (bleomycin 15 000 IU). Outcome measurements and statistical analysis Primary end point was favourable response rate (FRR) comprising complete response or partial response and normal markers. Success required the lower two-sided 90% confidence limit to exclude FRRs <60%; 44 patients on CBOP/BEP gives 90% power to achieve this if the true FRR is \u226480%. Equal numbers were randomised to BEP to benchmark contemporary response rates. Results and limitations A total of 89 patients were randomised (43 CBOP/BEP, 46 BEP); 40 and 41, respectively, completed treatment. CBOP/BEP toxicity, largely haematologic, was high (96% vs 63% on BEP had Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v.3 grade \u22643). FRRs were 74% (90% confidence interval [CI], 61-85) with CBOP/BEP, 61% with BEP (90% CI, 48-73). After a median of 58-mo follow-up, 1-yr progression-free survival (PFS) was 65% and 43%, respectively (hazard ratio: 0.59; 95% CI, 0.33-1.06); 2-yr overall survival (OS) was 67% and 61%. Overall, 3 of 14 CBOP/BEP and 2 of 18 BEP deaths were attributed to toxicity, one after an overdose of bleomycin during CBOP/BEP. The trial was not powered to compare PFS. Conclusions The primary outcome was met, the CI for CBOP/BEP excluding FRRs <61%, but CBOP/BEP was more toxic. PFS and OS data are promising but require confirmation in an international phase 3 trial. Patient summary In this study we tested a new, more intensive way to deliver a combination of drugs often used to treat men with testicular cancer. We found that response rates were higher but that the CBOP/BEP regimen caused more short-term toxicity. Because most patients are diagnosed when their cancer is less advanced, it took twice as long to complete the trial as expected. Although we plan to carry out a larger trial, we will need international collaboration.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Metastatic germ cell tumour", "Poor prognosis", "Randomised trial"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols", "Bleomycin", "Carboplatin", "Cisplatin", "Disease Progression", "Disease-Free Survival", "Etoposide", "Great Britain", "Humans", "Kaplan-Meier Estimate", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Neoplasms, Germ Cell and Embryonal", "Proportional Hazards Models", "Testicular Neoplasms", "Time Factors", "Treatment Outcome", "Vincristine", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84922172964", "SubjectAreas": [["Urology", "MEDI", "2748"]], "AuthorData": {"7006638051": {"Name": "Huddart R.A.", "AuthorID": "7006638051", "AffiliationID": "60017166, 60010337", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cancer Research, Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust"}, "16233182600": {"Name": "Gabe R.", "AuthorID": "16233182600", "AffiliationID": "60015879", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council Clinical Trials Unit"}, "22952670600": {"Name": "Cafferty F.H.", "AuthorID": "22952670600", "AffiliationID": "60015879", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council Clinical Trials Unit"}, "57214573293": {"Name": "Pollock P.", "AuthorID": "57214573293", "AffiliationID": "60015879", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council Clinical Trials Unit"}, "7003911215": {"Name": "Stenning S.P.", "AuthorID": "7003911215", "AffiliationID": "60015879", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council Clinical Trials Unit"}, "7405247019": {"Name": "White J.D.", "AuthorID": "7405247019", "AffiliationID": "60000265", "AffiliationName": "Beatson West of Scotland Cancer Centre"}, "15840749900": {"Name": "Shamash J.", "AuthorID": "15840749900", "AffiliationID": "60004093", "AffiliationName": "St. Bartholomew's Hospital"}, "7201439511": {"Name": "Cullen M.H.", "AuthorID": "7201439511", "AffiliationID": "60026493", "AffiliationName": "University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
