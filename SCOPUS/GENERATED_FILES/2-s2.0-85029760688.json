Karger AG, Basel.Coexistence of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) and congenital hypothyroidism (CH) due to TG mutation in the same non-consanguineous family is rare. Case Series: We report 4 siblings born to unrelated parents, the fa- Nicola Improda and Caroline Ponmani contributed equally to this work. ther being an asymptomatic carrier of homozygous p.V281L and heterozygous p.I172N CYP21A2 mutations. Sibling 1 had salt-wasting CAH (CYP21A2 genotype Intron 2 splice/p.I172N and p.V281L). She also had CH (TG genotype p.R296/ p.T1416Rfs30) and learning difficulties. Poor compliance and morbid obesity resulted in short stature, precocious puberty, hirsutism, amenorrhoea, insulin insensitivity and a possible adrenal adenoma. Sibling 3 (CYP21A2 and TG genotype similar to sibling 1) is a boy presenting with salt-wasting CAH, CH, and developmental delay. He was overweight and underwent precocious puberty. Although siblings 2 and 4 (both females) share the same CYP21A2 genotype (Intron 2 splice/p.V281L), the former only had biochemical evidence of CAH, while the latter presented at 9.8 years of age with a history of pubarche at 7 years and advanced bone age. Conclusions: We report the unusual occurrence of 2 rare autosomal recessive diseases, CAH and CH. Our cases highlight the phenotypic variability of CAH and CH due to TG mutations, even within a single family, and illustrate the importance of optimal disease control..", "AuthorKeywords": ["21-Hydroxylase", "Adrenal adenoma", "Developmental delay", "Thyroglobulin"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adrenal Hyperplasia, Congenital", "Child", "Congenital Hypothyroidism", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Mutation", "Patient Compliance", "Pedigree", "Phenotype", "Thyroglobulin"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85029760688", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism", "MEDI", "2712"], ["Endocrinology", "BIOC", "1310"]], "AuthorData": {"37061141100": {"Name": "Improda N.", "AuthorID": "37061141100", "AffiliationID": "60017293", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Translational Sciences, Federico II University of Naples"}, "55799175700": {"Name": "Ponmani C.", "AuthorID": "55799175700", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Endocrinology, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children"}, "57195759924": {"Name": "Atterbury A.", "AuthorID": "57195759924", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Endocrinology, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children"}, "7003534902": {"Name": "Dattani M.T.", "AuthorID": "7003534902", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Developmental Endocrinology Research Group, Section of Genetics and Epigenetics in Health and Disease, Genetics and Genomic Medicine Programme, UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "36070829700": {"Name": "Schoenmakers N.", "AuthorID": "36070829700", "AffiliationID": "60031101, 60017488, 60120909", "AffiliationName": "University of Cambridge Metabolic Research Laboratories, Wellcome Trust-Medical Research Council Institute of Metabolic Science, Addenbrooke's Hospital"}, "7202877557": {"Name": "Chatterjee K.", "AuthorID": "7202877557", "AffiliationID": "60031101, 60017488, 60120909", "AffiliationName": "University of Cambridge Metabolic Research Laboratories, Wellcome Trust-Medical Research Council Institute of Metabolic Science, Addenbrooke's Hospital"}, "24342425800": {"Name": "Senniappan S.", "AuthorID": "24342425800", "AffiliationID": "60024418", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Endocrinology, Alder Hey Children's Hospital"}, "7003924308": {"Name": "Barnicoat A.", "AuthorID": "7003924308", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Genetics, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children"}}}
