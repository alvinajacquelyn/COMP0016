This book is about Heritage Building Information Modelling (HBIM), which necessarily differs from the commonplace applications of BIM to new construction. Where BIM is being used, the focus is still very much on design and construction. However, its use as an operational and management tool for existing buildings, particularly heritage buildings, is lagging behind. The first of its kind, this book aims to clearly define the scope for HBIM and present cutting-edge research findings alongside international case studies, before outlining challenges for the future of HBIM research and practice. After an extensive introduction to HBIM, the core themes of the book are arranged into four parts: \u2022 Restoration philosophies in practice \u2022 Data capture and visualisation for maintenance and repair \u2022 Building performance \u2022 Stakeholder engagement This book will be a key reference for built environment practitioners, researchers, academics and students engaged in BIM, HBIM, building energy modelling, building surveying, facilities management and heritage conservation more widely.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85024924237", "SubjectAreas": [["Engineering (all)", "ENGI", "2200"], ["Arts and Humanities (all)", "ARTS", "1200"]], "AuthorData": {"8328617900": {"Name": "Arayici Y.", "AuthorID": "8328617900", "AffiliationID": "60008250", "AffiliationName": "School of the Built Environment, University of Salford"}, "6701858680": {"Name": "Counsell J.", "AuthorID": "6701858680", "AffiliationID": "60103682", "AffiliationName": "Cardiff School of Art and Design, Cardiff Metropolitan University"}, "57159700300": {"Name": "Mahdjoubi L.", "AuthorID": "57159700300", "AffiliationID": "60019611", "AffiliationName": "ICT at the Department of Architecture and the Built Environment, UWE"}, "57195038490": {"Name": "Nagy G.", "AuthorID": "57195038490", "AffiliationID": "60023356", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Engineering, British University"}, "57195036485": {"Name": "Hawas S.", "AuthorID": "57195036485", "AffiliationID": "60010294", "AffiliationName": "Department of Architecture and Urban Planning, Cairo University"}, "35611784900": {"Name": "Dewidar K.", "AuthorID": "35611784900", "AffiliationID": "100311222", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Engineering"}}}
