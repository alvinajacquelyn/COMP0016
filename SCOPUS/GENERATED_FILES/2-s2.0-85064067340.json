Transplant recipients presenting with cytomegalovirus (CMV) disease at the time of diagnosis of CMV DNAemia pose a challenge to a preemptive CMV management strategy. However, the rate and risk factors of such failure remain uncertain. Methods. Solid organ transplantation (SOT) and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) recipients with a first episode of CMV polymerase chain reaction (PCR) DNAemia within the first year posttransplantation were evaluated (n = 335). Patient records were reviewed for presence of CMV disease at the time of CMV DNAemia diagnosis. The distribution and prevalence of CMV disease were estimated, and the odds ratio (OR) of CMV disease was modeled using logistic regression. Results. The prevalence of CMV disease increased for both SOT and HSCT with increasing diagnostic CMV PCR load and with screening intervals >14 days. The only independent risk factor in multivariate analysis was increasing CMV DNAemia load of the diagnostic CMV PCR (OR = 6.16; 95% confidence interval, 2.09-18.11). Among recipients receiving weekly screening (n = 147), 16 (10.8%) had CMV disease at the time of diagnosis of CMV DNAemia (median DNAemia load 628 IU/mL; interquartile range, 432-1274); 93.8% of these cases were HSCT and lung transplant recipients. Conclusions. Despite application of weekly screening intervals, HSCT and lung transplant recipients in particular presented with CMV disease at the time of diagnosis of CMV DNAemia. Additional research to improve the management of patients at risk of presenting with CMV disease at low levels of CMV DNAemia and despite weekly screening is warranted.", "AuthorKeywords": ["CMV disease", "CMV DNAemia", "CMV PCR", "Cytomegalovirus", "Transplant recipient"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85064067340", "SubjectAreas": [["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"34970871300": {"Name": "Da Cunha Bang C.", "AuthorID": "34970871300", "AffiliationID": "118928938", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Haematology"}, "7003662684": {"Name": "Sengel\u00f8v H.", "AuthorID": "7003662684", "AffiliationID": "118928938", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Haematology"}, "7201971552": {"Name": "S\u00f8rensen S.S.", "AuthorID": "7201971552", "AffiliationID": "116521914", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Nephrology"}, "7005115957": {"Name": "Gustafsson F.", "AuthorID": "7005115957", "AffiliationID": "109905090", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Cardiology"}, "7006930745": {"Name": "Iversen M.", "AuthorID": "7006930745", "AffiliationID": "122759803", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Cardiology, Section for Lung Transplantation"}, "6602614740": {"Name": "Perch M.", "AuthorID": "6602614740", "AffiliationID": "122759803", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Cardiology, Section for Lung Transplantation"}, "23980551300": {"Name": "Kirkby N.", "AuthorID": "23980551300", "AffiliationID": "105378953", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Clinical Microbiology"}, "7102424066": {"Name": "Rasmussen A.", "AuthorID": "7102424066", "AffiliationID": "60006564", "AffiliationName": "Abdominal Surgery, Rigshospitalet"}, "7006513758": {"Name": "Mocroft A.", "AuthorID": "7006513758", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Global Health, Infection and Population Health, University College of London"}, "56638565600": {"Name": "Lodding I.P.", "AuthorID": "56638565600", "AffiliationID": "60030840", "AffiliationName": "University of Copenhagen, CHIP, Department of Infectious Diseases"}, "35307337700": {"Name": "Lundgren J.D.", "AuthorID": "35307337700", "AffiliationID": "60030840", "AffiliationName": "University of Copenhagen, CHIP, Department of Infectious Diseases"}}}
