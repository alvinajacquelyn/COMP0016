Published by Taylor & Francis.Recent calls for a revitalisation of the study of hospitality as central to anthropological theory have focussed on the material, affective, moral and cosmological aspects of hospitality. This paper argues that any such theory of hospitality should also afford consideration of how hosting practices can also be a form of medicinal experience, showing how in a Chinese hair salon these experiences ricochet into ideas of well-being by drawing on discourses and practices that are grounded in Traditional Chinese Medicine. This paper argues for an understanding of the dispersed and diffused nature of Chinese medicinal practices and concepts throughout society, while still taking into account the specificities and logics of the Chinese medical tradition. The concept of \u2018medicinal hospitality\u2019 helps to understand the social nature of these ostensibly medical treatments, and how they use the creation of distinct sensory experiences which are shared between groups of customers to generate social relations.", "AuthorKeywords": ["anthropology", "China", "consumption", "Hospitality", "senses", "traditional Chinese medicine"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84900368204", "SubjectAreas": [["Anthropology", "SOCI", "3314"], ["Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)", "ARTS", "1201"], ["Archeology", "SOCI", "3302"]], "AuthorData": {"37009827900": {"Name": "McDonald T.", "AuthorID": "37009827900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
