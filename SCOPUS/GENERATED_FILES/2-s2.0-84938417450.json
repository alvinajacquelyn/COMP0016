Historically, this is a group of diseases with limited treatment options and frequently poor prognosis. However, there are now 'targeted' therapeutics emerging in the form of stabilizers of the precursor protein, inhibitors of fibrillogenesis, fibril disruptors, and blockers of protein translation, transcription, and immunotherapy. We review many of these approaches that are currently being assessed in clinical trials.", "AuthorKeywords": ["amyloidosis", "chemotherapy", "diflunisal", "eprodisate", "immunotherapy", "oligonucleotides"], "IndexKeywords": ["Amyloid Neuropathies, Familial", "Amyloidosis", "Humans", "Immunoglobulin Light Chains", "Immunotherapy", "Kidney Transplantation", "Molecular Targeted Therapy", "Prealbumin", "Serum Amyloid A Protein", "Stem Cell Transplantation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84938417450", "SubjectAreas": [["Nephrology", "MEDI", "2727"]], "AuthorData": {"45662093200": {"Name": "Sayed R.H.", "AuthorID": "45662093200", "AffiliationID": "60032819, 60022148, 60029950", "AffiliationName": "UCL Centre for Nephrology, UCL Medical School, Royal Free Hospital"}, "35464959200": {"Name": "Hawkins P.N.", "AuthorID": "35464959200", "AffiliationID": "60032819, 60029950", "AffiliationName": "National Amyloidosis Centre, UCL Medical School, Royal Free Hospital"}, "7004915734": {"Name": "Lachmann H.J.", "AuthorID": "7004915734", "AffiliationID": "60032819, 60022148, 60029950", "AffiliationName": "UCL Centre for Nephrology, UCL Medical School, Royal Free Hospital"}}}
