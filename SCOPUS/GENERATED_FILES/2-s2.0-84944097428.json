All rights reserved.Pneumonia, caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, mainly affects the immunocompromised, the very young and the old, and remains one of the leading causes of death. A steady rise in disease numbers from non-vaccine serotypes necessitates a new vaccine formulation that ideally has better antigen stability and integrity, does not require cold-chain and can be delivered non-invasively. In this study, a dry powder vaccine containing an important antigen of S. pneumoniae, pneumococcal surface protein A (PspA) that has shown cross-reactivity amongst serotypes to be delivered via the pulmonary route has been formulated. The formulation contains the antigen PspA adsorbed onto the surface of polymeric nanoparticles encapsulated in l-leucine microparticles that can be loaded into capsules and delivered via an inhaler. We have successfully synthesized particles of \u223c150 nm and achieved \u223c20 \u03bcg of PspA adsorption per mg of NPs. In addition, the spray-dried powders displayed a FPF of 74.31 \u00b1 1.32% and MMAD of 1.70 \u00b1 0.03 \u03bcm suggesting a broncho-alveolar lung deposition facilitating the uptake of the nanoparticles by dendritic cells. Also, the PspA released from the dry powders maintained antigen stability (SDS-PAGE), integrity (Circular dichroism) and activity (lactoferrin binding assay). Moreover, the released antigen also maintained its antigenicity as determined by ELISA.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Antigen delivery system", "Dendritic cells", "Dry powder inhalation", "Nanocomposite microcarrier", "Nanoparticle", "Pneumococcal surface protein A (PspA)"], "IndexKeywords": ["Administration, Inhalation", "Adsorption", "Antigens, Bacterial", "Bacterial Proteins", "Bacterial Vaccines", "Cell Survival", "Chemistry, Pharmaceutical", "Dendritic Cells", "Drug Liberation", "Drug Stability", "Humans", "Lactoferrin", "Lung", "Nanoparticles", "Particle Size", "Powders"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84944097428", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmaceutical Science", "PHAR", "3003"]], "AuthorData": {"55371908400": {"Name": "Kunda N.K.", "AuthorID": "55371908400", "AffiliationID": "60013349, 60033021", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, University of New Mexico"}, "56388643700": {"Name": "Alfagih I.M.", "AuthorID": "56388643700", "AffiliationID": "60001933, 60013183", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmaceutics, College of Pharmacy, King Saud University"}, "57191359974": {"Name": "Hutcheon G.A.", "AuthorID": "57191359974", "AffiliationID": "60028355", "AffiliationName": "Formulation and Drug Delivery Research Group, School of Pharmacy and Biomolecular Sciences, Liverpool John Moores University, James Parson Building"}, "24831973500": {"Name": "Saleem I.Y.", "AuthorID": "24831973500", "AffiliationID": "60028355", "AffiliationName": "Formulation and Drug Delivery Research Group, School of Pharmacy and Biomolecular Sciences, Liverpool John Moores University, James Parson Building"}, "6603824505": {"Name": "Miyaji E.N.", "AuthorID": "6603824505", "AffiliationID": "60020402", "AffiliationName": "Centro de Biotecnologia, Instituto Butantan"}, "54790954200": {"Name": "Figueiredo D.B.", "AuthorID": "54790954200", "AffiliationID": "60020402", "AffiliationName": "Centro de Biotecnologia, Instituto Butantan"}, "35883103800": {"Name": "Gon\u00e7alves V.M.", "AuthorID": "35883103800", "AffiliationID": "60020402", "AffiliationName": "Centro de Biotecnologia, Instituto Butantan"}, "7102490856": {"Name": "Ferreira D.M.", "AuthorID": "7102490856", "AffiliationID": "60020934", "AffiliationName": "Respiratory Infection Group, Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine"}, "7003829263": {"Name": "Dennison S.R.", "AuthorID": "7003829263", "AffiliationID": "60031259", "AffiliationName": "UCLan Biomedical Research Facility, Research and Innovation, University of Central Lancashire"}, "8774245700": {"Name": "Somavarapu S.", "AuthorID": "8774245700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmaceutics, School of Pharmacy, University College London"}}}
