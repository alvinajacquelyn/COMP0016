In this study, pulsatile flow in a patient-based stenosed carotid artery bifurcation was examined using both large eddy simulation (LES) with dynamic Smagorinsky eddy viscosity model, and a Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) method with a transitional version of the shear stress transport (SST-Tran) model. In addition, an experimental phantom was built for the same bifurcation geometry and velocity measurements were made using particle image velocimetry (PIV). Comparisons with PIV measurements of axial velocity profiles demonstrated that both SST-Tran and LES predicted the experimental results fairly well, with LES being slightly superior. Furthermore, LES predicted cycle-to-cycle variations in the region where transition to turbulence occurred, indicating the unsteady nature of turbulence transition. On the other hand, the SST-Tran model was able to capture important flow features observed in the PIV experiment, demonstrating its potential as a cost-effective alternative to LES for haemodynamic analyses of highly disturbed flow in diseased arteries.", "AuthorKeywords": ["carotid artery bifurcation", "Large eddy simulation", "particle image velocimetry", "stenosis", "transitional flow"], "IndexKeywords": ["Carotid artery bifurcation", "Cycle to cycle variation", "Laminar turbulent transitions", "Particle image velocimetries", "Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes", "stenosis", "Transition to turbulence", "Transitional flow"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85066432718", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Mechanics of Materials", "ENGI", "2211"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"]], "AuthorData": {"41761458900": {"Name": "Johari N.H.", "AuthorID": "41761458900", "AffiliationID": "60090654", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Mechanical Engineering, Universiti Malaysia Pahang"}, "55421973100": {"Name": "Wood N.B.", "AuthorID": "55421973100", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, Imperial College London"}, "36009720300": {"Name": "Cheng Z.", "AuthorID": "36009720300", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, Imperial College London"}, "7005835193": {"Name": "Torii R.", "AuthorID": "7005835193", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "8079681500": {"Name": "Xu X.Y.", "AuthorID": "8079681500", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, Imperial College London"}, "36069865100": {"Name": "Oishi M.", "AuthorID": "36069865100", "AffiliationID": "60180342, 60025272", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Industrial Science, University of Tokyo"}, "7202536278": {"Name": "Oshima M.", "AuthorID": "7202536278", "AffiliationID": "60180342, 60025272", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Industrial Science, University of Tokyo"}}}
