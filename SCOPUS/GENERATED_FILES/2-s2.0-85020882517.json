Equivalently, the Riemannian cone over a nearly K\u00e4hler manifold has holonomy contained in G2. In this paper we study the deformation theory of nearly K\u00e4hler manifolds, showing that it is obstructed in general. More precisely, we show that the infinitesimal deformations of the homogeneous nearly K\u00e4hler structure on the flag manifold are all obstructed to second order.", "AuthorKeywords": ["53C10", "53C15", "53C25 (primary)", "58H15 (secondary)"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85020882517", "SubjectAreas": [["Mathematics (all)", "MATH", "2600"]], "AuthorData": {"56976414600": {"Name": "Foscolo L.", "AuthorID": "56976414600", "AffiliationID": "60026415", "AffiliationName": "Mathematics Department, Stony Brook University"}}}
