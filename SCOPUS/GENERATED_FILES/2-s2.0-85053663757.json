SkinSuit is a lightweight compression suit designed to provide head-to-foot (axial) loading to counteract spinal elongation during spaceflight. As synthetic garments may impact negatively on the skin microbiome, we used 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene amplicon procedures to define bacterial skin communities at sebaceous and moist body sites of five healthy male volunteers undergoing SkinSuit evaluation. Each volunteer displayed a diverse, distinct bacterial population at each skin site. Short (8 h) periods of dry hyper-buoyancy flotation wearing either gym kit or SkinSuit elicited changes in the composition of the skin microbiota at the genus level but had little or no impact on community structure at the phylum level or the richness and diversity of the bacterial population. We also determined the composition of the skin microbiota of an astronaut during pre-flight training, during an 8-day visit to the International Space Station involving two 6\u20137 h periods of SkinSuit wear, and for 1 month after return. Changes in composition of bacterial skin communities at five body sites were strongly linked to changes in geographical location. A distinct ISS bacterial microbiota signature was found which reversed to a pre-flight profile on return. No changes in microbiome complexity or diversity were noted, with little evidence for colonisation by potentially pathogenic bacteria; we conclude that short periods of SkinSuit wear induce changes to the composition of the skin microbiota but these are unlikely to compromise the healthy skin microbiome.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["16S ribosomal RNA", "Bacterial population", "Bone mineral density", "Community structures", "Geographical locations", "In compositions", "International Space stations", "Pathogenic bacterium"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85053663757", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (miscellaneous)", "MEDI", "2701"], ["Materials Science (miscellaneous)", "MATE", "2501"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (miscellaneous)", "BIOC", "1301"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (miscellaneous)", "AGRI", "1101"], ["Physics and Astronomy (miscellaneous)", "PHYS", "3101"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"7003483431": {"Name": "Stabler R.A.", "AuthorID": "7003483431", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathogen Molecular Biology, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "56013122300": {"Name": "Franco-Cendejas R.", "AuthorID": "56013122300", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathogen Molecular Biology, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "57193767266": {"Name": "Davies C.", "AuthorID": "57193767266", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathogen Molecular Biology, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "23986169000": {"Name": "Rosado H.", "AuthorID": "23986169000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "55544823700": {"Name": "Negus D.", "AuthorID": "55544823700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "7404775765": {"Name": "Taylor P.W.", "AuthorID": "7404775765", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "55940101600": {"Name": "Doyle R.", "AuthorID": "55940101600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London"}, "36086103600": {"Name": "Carvil P.A.", "AuthorID": "36086103600", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Centre of Human & Aerospace Physiological Sciences, King\u2019s College London"}, "57203937835": {"Name": "Kristj\u00e1nsson J.G.", "AuthorID": "57203937835", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Centre of Human & Aerospace Physiological Sciences, King\u2019s College London"}, "7404386609": {"Name": "Green D.A.", "AuthorID": "7404386609", "AffiliationID": "60029398", "AffiliationName": "European Astronaut Centre, European Space Agency"}, "57193778168": {"Name": "Mogensen A.", "AuthorID": "57193778168", "AffiliationID": "60029398", "AffiliationName": "European Astronaut Centre, European Space Agency"}, "55369909000": {"Name": "Scott J.", "AuthorID": "55369909000", "AffiliationID": "60029398", "AffiliationName": "European Astronaut Centre, European Space Agency"}}}
