Published by Taylor & Francis.This paper examines the relationship between space and the digital industries through everyday work practices in Shoreditch, London. Drawing on interviews with digital workers, the paper examines how work unfolds in multiple settings and how the built environment supports these work patterns. Digital work extends from the office or the residence (the base) to multiple settings (ancillary spaces) in what can be defined as an extended workplace. The study identifies micro and macro scale characteristics of the built environment that are relevant (spatial characteristics of semi-public and public spaces, access and control, location, and attributes of the neighbourhood) expanding the understanding of why and how place matters for these industries. A typology of ancillary spaces and some reflections on policy implications are advanced.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84921032435", "SubjectAreas": [["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"], ["Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)", "ARTS", "1201"], ["Urban Studies", "SOCI", "3322"]], "AuthorData": {"55228769200": {"Name": "Martins J.", "AuthorID": "55228769200", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Bartlett School of Planning, University College London"}}}
