Here the authors report the case of a 39-year-old woman who was admitted with acute-onset bilateral visual loss coinciding with ascending numbness. Clinical examination, neurological imaging, and nerve conduction studies revealed a syndrome of bilateral optic neuritis and Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS). Serological testing confirmed recent exposure to M. pneumoniae. The patient did not experience any clinical benefit with pulsed intravenous methylprednisolone but demonstrated marked clinical and radiological improvement following 5 days of plasma exchange. This report will explore the diagnostic and therapeutic approach to patients with neuro-ophthalmological and neurological complications of M. pneumoniae infection in addition to discussing previously encountered cases.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome", "Mycoplasma pneumoniae", "optic neuritis", "plasma exchange", "post-infectious inflammatory neuropathy", "post-infectious optic neuropathy"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85006954174", "SubjectAreas": [["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"55256284000": {"Name": "Baheerathan A.", "AuthorID": "55256284000", "AffiliationID": "60020736", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "57192593053": {"Name": "Ross Russell A.", "AuthorID": "57192593053", "AffiliationID": "60020736", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "7103161316": {"Name": "Farmer S.F.", "AuthorID": "7103161316", "AffiliationID": "60020736", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "7003310677": {"Name": "Bremner F.", "AuthorID": "7003310677", "AffiliationID": "60020736", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuro-ophthalmology, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}}}
