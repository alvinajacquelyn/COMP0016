Chromium oxides with the spinel structure have been predicted to be promising high voltage cathode materials in magnesium batteries. Perennial challenges involving the mobility of Mg 2+ and reaction kinetics can be circumvented by nano-sizing the materials in order to reduce diffusion distances, and by using elevated temperatures to overcome activation energy barriers. Herein, ordered 7 nm crystals of spinel-type MgCr 2 O 4 were synthesized by a conventional batch hydrothermal method. In comparison, the relatively underexplored Continuous Hydrothermal Flow Synthesis (CHFS) method was used to make highly defective sub-5 nm MgCr 2 O 4 crystals. When these materials were made into electrodes, they were shown to possess markedly different electrochemical behavior in a Mg 2+ ionic liquid electrolyte, at moderate temperature (110 \u00b0C). The anodic activity of the ordered nanocrystals was attributed to surface reactions, most likely involving the electrolyte. In contrast, evidence was gathered regarding the reversible bulk deintercalation of Mg 2+ from the nanocrystals made by CHFS. This work highlights the impact on electrochemical behavior of a precise control of size and crystal structure of MgCr 2 O 4 . It advances the understanding and design of new cathode materials for Mg-based batteries.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Continuous hydrothermal flow synthesis", "Electrochemical activities", "Electrochemical behaviors", "High voltage cathode", "Hydrothermal methods", "Ionic liquid electrolytes", "Moderate temperature", "New cathode material"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85059495681", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"]], "AuthorData": {"55588000500": {"Name": "Hu L.", "AuthorID": "55588000500", "AffiliationID": "60028609", "AffiliationName": "Joint Center for Energy Storage Research, Argonne National Laboratory"}, "42061926000": {"Name": "Nolis G.", "AuthorID": "42061926000", "AffiliationID": "60028609", "AffiliationName": "Joint Center for Energy Storage Research, Argonne National Laboratory"}, "15020118300": {"Name": "Cabana J.", "AuthorID": "15020118300", "AffiliationID": "60028609", "AffiliationName": "Joint Center for Energy Storage Research, Argonne National Laboratory"}, "57190051138": {"Name": "Kim S.", "AuthorID": "57190051138", "AffiliationID": "60028609", "AffiliationName": "Chemical Sciences and Engineering Division, Argonne National Laboratory"}, "14031477100": {"Name": "Fister T.", "AuthorID": "14031477100", "AffiliationID": "60028609", "AffiliationName": "Chemical Sciences and Engineering Division, Argonne National Laboratory"}, "56559457100": {"Name": "Johnson I.", "AuthorID": "56559457100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "55981914500": {"Name": "McCafferty L.", "AuthorID": "55981914500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "56096150800": {"Name": "Ashton T.", "AuthorID": "56096150800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "6603926697": {"Name": "Darr J.", "AuthorID": "6603926697", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "7005472846": {"Name": "Freeland J.", "AuthorID": "7005472846", "AffiliationID": "60028609", "AffiliationName": "X-ray Sciences Division, Argonne National Laboratory"}, "55829858300": {"Name": "Yoo H.", "AuthorID": "55829858300", "AffiliationID": "60008783", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Chemical Institute for Functional Materials, Pusan National University"}}}
