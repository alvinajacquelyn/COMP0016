HIV Medicine Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of British HIV AssociationObjectives: The aim of the study was to determine whether behaviourally informed short message service (SMS) primer and reminder messages could increase the return rate of HIV self-sampling kits ordered online. Methods: The study was a 2 \u00d7 2 factorial design randomized control trial. A total of 9585 individuals who ordered a self-sampling kit from www.freetesting.hiv different SMS combinations: 1) standard reminders sent days 3 and 7 after dispatch (control); 2) primer sent 1 day after dispatch plus standard reminders; 3) behavioural insights (BI) reminders (no primer); or 4) primer plus BI reminders. The analysis was restricted to individuals who received all messages (n = 8999). We used logistic regression to investigate independent effects of the primer and BI reminders and their interaction. We explored the impact of sociodemographic characteristics on kit return as a secondary analysis. Results: Those who received the primer and BI reminders had a return rate 4% higher than that of those who received the standard messages. We found strong evidence of a positive effect of the BI reminders (odds ratio 1.13; 95% confidence interval 1.04\u20131.23; P = 0.003) but no evidence for an effect of the primer, or for an interaction between the two interventions. Odds of kit return increased with age, with those aged \u2265 65 years being almost 2.5 times more likely to return the kit than those aged 25\u201334 years. Men who have sex with men were 1.5\u20134.5 times more likely to return the kit compared with other sexual behaviour and gender identity groups. Non-African black clients were 25% less likely to return the kit compared with other ethnicities. Conclusions: Adding BI to reminder messages was successful in improving return rates at no additional cost.", "AuthorKeywords": ["behavioural interventions", "HIV diagnostic tests", "public health", "randomized controlled trial", "text messaging"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Age Factors", "Aged", "Behavior", "England", "Female", "HIV Infections", "Humans", "Logistic Models", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Reagent Kits, Diagnostic", "Reminder Systems", "Sexual and Gender Minorities", "Text Messaging", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85052693971", "SubjectAreas": [["Health Policy", "MEDI", "2719"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"57203714168": {"Name": "Brown L.J.", "AuthorID": "57203714168", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "PHE Behavioural Insights Team, Research Training & Innovation, Health Improvement Directorate, Public Health England"}, "57203714694": {"Name": "Tan K.S.", "AuthorID": "57203714694", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "PHE Behavioural Insights Team, Research Training & Innovation, Health Improvement Directorate, Public Health England"}, "57203718210": {"Name": "Guerra L.E.", "AuthorID": "57203718210", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "Sexual Health Promotion Unit, HIV and STIs Department, Health Improvement Directorate, Public Health England"}, "56180747600": {"Name": "Naidoo C.J.", "AuthorID": "56180747600", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "Sexual Health Promotion Unit, HIV and STIs Department, Health Improvement Directorate, Public Health England"}, "7004496822": {"Name": "Nardone A.", "AuthorID": "7004496822", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "Sexual Health Promotion Unit, HIV and STIs Department, Health Improvement Directorate, Public Health England"}}}
