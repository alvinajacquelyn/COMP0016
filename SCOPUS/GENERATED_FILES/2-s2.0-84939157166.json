Published by Elsevier B.V.Modelling and simulation of multiscale systems constitutes a grand challenge in computational science, and is widely applied in fields ranging from the physical sciences and engineering to the life sciences and the socio-economic domain. To adequately simulate numerous intertwined processes characterized by different spatial and temporal scales (often spanning many orders of magnitude), sophisticated models and advanced computational techniques are required. Additionally, these multiscale models frequently need large scale computing capabilities as well as dedicated software and services that enable the exploitation of existing and evolving computational ecosystems. The aim of the annual Workshop on Multiscale Modelling and Simulation is to facilitate the progress in this multidisciplinary research field http://www.computationalscience.nl/MMS/. In this paper, we reflect on the 12 years of workshop history and glimpse at the latest developments presented in 2015 in Iceland, the Land of Fire and Ice. In Section 6, we invite new workshop co-organizers.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Complex systems", "ICCS", "Modelling", "Multiphysics", "Multiscale", "Simulation", "Workshop"], "IndexKeywords": ["ICCS", "Multi-physics", "Multiscale", "Simulation", "Workshop"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84939157166", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"]], "AuthorData": {"8385944600": {"Name": "Krzhizhanovskaya V.", "AuthorID": "8385944600", "AffiliationID": "60072485", "AffiliationName": "ITMO University"}, "7007050341": {"Name": "Hoekstra A.", "AuthorID": "7007050341", "AffiliationID": "60072485", "AffiliationName": "ITMO University"}, "23049787700": {"Name": "Groen D.", "AuthorID": "23049787700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "56780425900": {"Name": "Bozak B.", "AuthorID": "56780425900", "AffiliationID": "114993975", "AffiliationName": "Poznan Supercomputing and Networking Centre"}}}
