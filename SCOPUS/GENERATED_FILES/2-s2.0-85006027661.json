To date, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for heroin addiction have been limited; moreover they have been restricted to examining samples of European and African-American origin due to difficulty of recruiting samples from other populations. This is the first study to test a Han Chinese population; we performed a GWAS on a homogeneous sample of 370 Han Chinese subjects diagnosed with heroin dependence using the DSM-IV criteria and 134 ethnically matched controls. Analysis using the diagnostic criteria of heroin dependence yielded suggestive evidence for association between variants in the genes CCDC42 (coiled coil domain 42; p = 2.8x10-7) and BRSK2 (BR serine/threonine 2; p = 4.110-6). In addition, we found evidence for risk variants within the ARHGEF10 (Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor 10) gene on chromosome 8 and variants in a region on chromosome 20q13, which is gene-poor but has a concentration of mRNAs and predicted miRNAs. Gene-based association analysis identified genome-wide significant association between variants in CCDC42 and heroin addiction. Additionally, when we investigated shared risk variants between heroin addiction and risk of other addiction-related and psychiatric phenotypes using polygenic risk scores, we found a suggestive relationship with variants predicting tobacco addiction, and a significant relationship with variants predicting schizophrenia. Our genome wide association study of heroin dependence provides data in a novel sample, with functionally plausible results and evidence of genetic data of value to the field.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Asian Continental Ancestry Group", "China", "Female", "Gene Frequency", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Genome-Wide Association Study", "Heroin Dependence", "Humans", "Linkage Disequilibrium", "Male", "Polymorphism, Genetic", "Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases", "Rho Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85006027661", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"7003973785": {"Name": "Kalsi G.", "AuthorID": "7003973785", "AffiliationID": "60011520, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, MRC SGDP Centre, King's College"}, "56661677400": {"Name": "Coleman J.R.I.", "AuthorID": "56661677400", "AffiliationID": "60011520, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, MRC SGDP Centre, King's College"}, "6603362416": {"Name": "Ducci F.", "AuthorID": "6603362416", "AffiliationID": "60011520, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, MRC SGDP Centre, King's College"}, "8931613700": {"Name": "Newhouse S.J.", "AuthorID": "8931613700", "AffiliationID": "60011520, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, MRC SGDP Centre, King's College"}, "57212804309": {"Name": "Collier D.A.", "AuthorID": "57212804309", "AffiliationID": "60025685", "AffiliationName": "Lilly UK"}, "35402700900": {"Name": "Asherson P.", "AuthorID": "35402700900", "AffiliationID": "60011520, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, MRC SGDP Centre, King's College"}, "15742166000": {"Name": "Breen G.", "AuthorID": "15742166000", "AffiliationID": "60011520, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, MRC SGDP Centre, King's College"}, "56222646800": {"Name": "Euesden J.", "AuthorID": "56222646800", "AffiliationID": "60020650, 60172455", "AffiliationName": "MRC Integrative Epidemiology Unit, University of Bristol"}, "16041567200": {"Name": "Aliev F.", "AuthorID": "16041567200", "AffiliationID": "60085899", "AffiliationName": "Department of Actuarial Sciences and Risk Management, Faculty of Business, Karabuk University"}, "7409286408": {"Name": "Liu X.", "AuthorID": "7409286408", "AffiliationID": "60073509, 60016521", "AffiliationName": "Psychiatric Laboratory, State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy, West China Hospital, Sichuan University"}, "35354066000": {"Name": "Ma X.", "AuthorID": "35354066000", "AffiliationID": "60073509, 60016521", "AffiliationName": "Psychiatric Laboratory, State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy, West China Hospital, Sichuan University"}, "7601517986": {"Name": "Wang Y.", "AuthorID": "7601517986", "AffiliationID": "60073509, 60016521", "AffiliationName": "Psychiatric Laboratory, State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy, West China Hospital, Sichuan University"}, "56925739000": {"Name": "Li T.", "AuthorID": "56925739000", "AffiliationID": "60073509, 60016521", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, West China Hospital, School of Medicine, Sichuan University"}}}
