Bariatric medicine is attempting to address this with weight loss and exercise programmes, and with increasing frequency, various forms of bariatric surgery. There has been considerable success reported after bariatric surgery but not without. We describe 14 patients with orthostatic intolerance (OI) post bariatric surgery. We report on OI (postural dizziness, palpitations and fainting), the results of cardiovascular autonomic testing and the associated and/or causative findings as well as reviewing the literature to consider the possible mechanisms. Comprehensive autonomic testing revealed that 35.7% (Buchwald et al., 2004) of these patients fulfilled the criteria for the Postural Tachycardia Syndrome (PoTS), 57.1% (Cremieux et al., 2008) had low levels of basal BP and 42.9% (Cammisotto & Bendayan, 2007) patients were presyncopal and 14.3% (Billakanty et al., 2008) experienced syncope. We propose that the incidence of OI post-bariatric surgery is higher than considered, that certain cohorts may be more susceptible to complications, and that further research is needed to identify the prevalence and, ideally anticipate occurrence. With the increasing prevalence of obesity and required clinical interventions, further understanding of the pathophysiological processes causing autonomic dysfunction after bariatric interventions will aid management, which may differ in those with an underlying disposition to autonomic involvement, such as diabetics, in whom such procedures are increasingly used.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Autonomic nervous system", "Bariatric surgery", "Obesity", "Orthostatic intolerance", "Postural tachycardia syndrome", "Syncope"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Arrhythmias, Cardiac", "Autonomic Nervous System", "Humans", "Obesity", "Orthostatic Intolerance", "Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome", "Retrospective Studies"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84982261373", "SubjectAreas": [["Endocrine and Autonomic Systems", "NEUR", "2807"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"]], "AuthorData": {"57190683995": {"Name": "Ponnusamy V.", "AuthorID": "57190683995", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "Autonomic Unit, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, University College London Hospitals"}, "54796896600": {"Name": "Owens A.P.", "AuthorID": "54796896600", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "14123280900": {"Name": "Iodice V.", "AuthorID": "14123280900", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "Autonomic Unit, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, University College London Hospitals"}, "35393637700": {"Name": "Mathias C.J.", "AuthorID": "35393637700", "AffiliationID": "106566221", "AffiliationName": "Hospital of St John & St Elizabeth"}, "36151052000": {"Name": "Purkayastha S.", "AuthorID": "36151052000", "AffiliationID": "60111785", "AffiliationName": "Bariatric Surgery, Imperial College NHS Healthcare Trust"}}}
