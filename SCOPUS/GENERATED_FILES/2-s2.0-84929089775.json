In this paper we model the medium-term log-return dynamics in a market with both fundamental and technical traders. This is based on a trade arrival model with variable size orders and a general arrival-time distribution. With simplifications we are led in the jump-free case to a local volatility model defined by a hybrid SDE mixing both arithmetic and geometric or CIR Brownian motions, whose solution in the geometric case is given by a class of integrals of exponentials of one Brownian motion against another, in forms considered by Yor and collaborators. The reduction of the hybrid SDE to a single Brownian motion leads to an SDE of the form considered by Nagahara, which is a type of \u2018Pearson diffusion\u2019, or, equivalently, a hyperbolic OU SDE. Various dynamics and equilibria are possible depending on the balance of trades. Under mean-reverting circumstances we arrive naturally at an equilibrium fat-tailed return distribution with a Student or Pearson Type~IV form. Under less-restrictive assumptions, richer dynamics are possible, including time-dependent Johnson-SU distributions and bimodal structures. The phenomenon of variance explosion is identified that gives rise to much larger price movements that might have a priori been expected, so that \u201825\u03c3\u2019 events are significantly more probable. We exhibit simple example solutions of the Fokker\u2013Planck equation that shows how such variance explosion can hide beneath a standard Gaussian facade. These are elementary members of an extended class of distributions with a rich and varied structure, capable of describing a wide range of market behaviors. Several approaches to the density function are possible, and an example of the computation of a hyperbolic VaR is given. The model also suggests generalizations of the Bougerol identity. We touch briefly on the extent to which such a model is consistent with the dynamics of a \u2018flash-crash\u2019 event, and briefly explore the statistical evidence for our model.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Agent based modelling", "Complexity in finance", "Risk management", "Stochastic processes", "Structure of financial markets", "Tail analysis", "Technical trading", "Value at risk"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84929089775", "SubjectAreas": [["Finance", "ECON", "2003"], ["Economics, Econometrics and Finance (all)", "ECON", "2000"]], "AuthorData": {"57213380816": {"Name": "Shaw W.", "AuthorID": "57213380816", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Mathematics and Computer Science, University College London"}, "56637943100": {"Name": "Schofield M.", "AuthorID": "56637943100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University College London"}}}
