It argues that such processes are being standardized at different pace and degree, at the same time higher education systems, institutional types and disciplinary fields produce variation in practices. The implications for academics in terms of opportunities and constraints in their different contexts of recruitment are explored.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Academics\u2019 agency", "Convergence and divergence", "Institutionalism", "Standardization"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84945136824", "SubjectAreas": [["Social Sciences (all)", "SOCI", "3300"]], "AuthorData": {"35772284300": {"Name": "Fumasoli T.", "AuthorID": "35772284300", "AffiliationID": "60010348", "AffiliationName": "ARENA Centre for European Studies, University of Oslo"}, "23990714300": {"Name": "Goastellec G.", "AuthorID": "23990714300", "AffiliationID": "60000239", "AffiliationName": "Observatory Science, Politics and Society, University of Lausanne, Quartier UNIL-Mouline"}}}
