Methods: Contrast thresholds were measured for seven achromatic spot stimuli (diameter 0.48\u00b0) of varying duration (nominal values: 10-200 ms) at an eccentricity of 8.8\u00b0 along the 45\u00b0, 135\u00b0, 225\u00b0 and 315\u00b0 meridians of the visual field in three healthy, psychophysically experienced observers. Stimuli were presented on a CRT display with a refresh rate of 60 and 160 Hz. Contrast thresholds were expressed as contrast energy with stimulus durations being estimated using (1) the sum-of-frames (SOF) method and (2) Bridgeman's method incorporating measurements of phosphor persistence. Estimates of the critical duration were produced using iterative two-phase regression analysis. Results: With stimulus duration expressed as SOF equivalent the critical duration was, on average, 10.6 ms longer with a refresh rate of 60 Hz (mean 45.7 ms, S.D. 10.1 ms) relative to 160 Hz (35.1 ms, S.D. 7.6 ms). When the Bridgeman method was used, minimal differences (1.8 ms) in critical duration values between the two refresh rates (60 Hz: 33.0 ms, S.D. 9.4 ms; 160 Hz: 31.2 ms, S.D. 7.0 ms) were observed. Identical trends were observed in all three subjects. Conclusions: Psychophysical measurements of temporal summation are independent of variations in CRT refresh rate when the Bridgeman method, incorporating measured values of phosphor persistence, is used to estimate stimulus duration. This has significant implications for the specification of stimulus duration in psychophysical studies of vision employing conventional display monitors.
