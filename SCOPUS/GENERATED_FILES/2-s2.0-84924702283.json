I argue that such approaches often end up displacing the idea of political education and, through their language and stated aims, avoid any genuine engagement with the very concept of the political in all but its most superficial sense. In discussing some of the points raised by critics of character education, I defend the need for a more robust and radical conception of the political as a basis for a form of political education.", "AuthorKeywords": ["character education", "citizenship education", "political education", "political imagination", "resilience"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84924702283", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["Philosophy", "ARTS", "1211"]], "AuthorData": {"57203671809": {"Name": "Suissa J.", "AuthorID": "57203671809", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "Department of Humanities and Social Sciences, Institute of Education"}}}
