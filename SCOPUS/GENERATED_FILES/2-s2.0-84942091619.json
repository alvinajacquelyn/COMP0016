We analysed genetic risk factors associated with early and late onset Alzheimer\u2019s disease (EOAD and LOAD) in a population from Liguria (northern Italy), as part of an ongoing longitudinal study. We screened 37 AD, 8 mild cognitive impairment (MCI), 3 AD and CVD (cerebrovascular disease), 3 MCI and CVD, 8 frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and 2 progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) patients, and 28 normal controls (NCs). We sequenced PSEN1, PSEN2 and APP (EOAD risk factors), as well as MAPT, GRN and TARDBP for all cases and NCs, and analysed the APOE, CLU, CR1 and PICALM genotypes as well as the MAPT and ACE haplotypes (LOAD risk factors) for the AD (n = 37) and AD + MCI (n = 45) cases and NCs (n = 28). We identified variants in PSEN1, PSEN2 and TARDBP across a range of phenotypes (AD, AD and CVD, FTD and PSP), suggesting that screening of all known candidate genes of Alzheimer\u2019s and non-Alzheimer\u2019s forms of dementias in all dementia cases might be warranted. The analysis of the LOAD risk factors revealed no association with AD or AD + MCI status after Bonferroni correction. Lack of association with APOE is supported by previous studies in the Italian population. Our data also evidenced: 1) a potentially protective haplotype at the PSEN2 locus; 2) a nominal association with the GWAS-risk allele A for rs3818361 in CR1 and; 3) a threefold prevalenceof AD in the femalepopulation compared to men. Our results will need to be further assessed and confirmed in larger cohorts from this area.", "AuthorKeywords": ["EOAD", "Gender", "Genotyping", "LOAD", "Population specificity", "Risk factors", "Sequencing"], "IndexKeywords": ["Age of Onset", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Alzheimer Disease", "Cohort Studies", "Dementia", "Female", "Genetic Association Studies", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Genotype", "Humans", "Italy", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Mild Cognitive Impairment", "Risk Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84942091619", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"57204297305": {"Name": "Ferrari R.", "AuthorID": "57204297305", "AffiliationID": "60021285", "AffiliationName": "Texas Tech University, Health Sciences Center, Department of Internal Medicine"}, "8681867700": {"Name": "Alinani A.", "AuthorID": "8681867700", "AffiliationID": "60021285", "AffiliationName": "Texas Tech University, Health Sciences Center, Department of Internal Medicine"}, "57194507126": {"Name": "Momeni P.", "AuthorID": "57194507126", "AffiliationID": "60021285", "AffiliationName": "Texas Tech University, Health Sciences Center, Department of Internal Medicine"}, "42261249800": {"Name": "Ferrara M.", "AuthorID": "42261249800", "AffiliationID": "60025153", "AffiliationName": "University of Genoa, Clinical Neurology, Department of Neurosciences (DINOGMI)"}, "57076226000": {"Name": "Fam\u00e0 F.", "AuthorID": "57076226000", "AffiliationID": "60025153", "AffiliationName": "University of Genoa, Clinical Neurology, Department of Neurosciences (DINOGMI)"}, "40462180900": {"Name": "Picco A.", "AuthorID": "40462180900", "AffiliationID": "60025153", "AffiliationName": "University of Genoa, Clinical Neurology, Department of Neurosciences (DINOGMI)"}, "7203006761": {"Name": "Rodriguez G.", "AuthorID": "7203006761", "AffiliationID": "60025153", "AffiliationName": "University of Genoa, Clinical Neurology, Department of Neurosciences (DINOGMI)"}, "57206948479": {"Name": "Nobili F.", "AuthorID": "57206948479", "AffiliationID": "60025153", "AffiliationName": "University of Genoa, Clinical Neurology, Department of Neurosciences (DINOGMI)"}, "56865358700": {"Name": "Sutton R.", "AuthorID": "56865358700", "AffiliationID": "60021285", "AffiliationName": "Texas Tech University, Health Sciences Center, Department of Cell Physiology and Molecular Biophysics"}}}
