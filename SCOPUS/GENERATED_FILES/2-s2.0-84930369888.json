To untangle these biophysical processes we explore factors influencing the distribution of epi- and meso-pelagic (0\u20131000 m) micronektonic crustaceans (>15 mm; order Lophogastridea, family Gnathophausiidea; and order Decapoda) on and off seamounts along the South West Indian Ridge (SWIR, 27\u00b0 to 42\u00b0S) and on a seamount off the Madagascar Ridge (31.6\u00b0S, 42.8\u00b0E). Thirty-one species of micronektic crustaceans were caught using mid-water trawls within the study area but there was no apparent latitude-related patterns in species richness or abundance. Species richness predicted by rarefraction curves and numerical abundance was highest in the vicinity (<1 km) of seamounts (species richness: 15 to 21; abundance: 10\u00b12 to 20\u00b11 ind.10\u22123 m\u22121) compared with over the abyssal plains and ridge slopes (species richness: 9.2\u20139.9; abundance: 24\u00b12 to 79\u00b18 ind.10\u22123 m\u22121). Multivariate analysis of assemblage composition revealed significant groupings of individual trawl samples with respect to whether the sample was on or off a seamount and hydrographic region, but not with time of sampling relative to diel cycle (day/night or dawn) or depth of sampling (0\u2013500, 500\u2013800, >800 m). The dominant species assemblage comprised the shrimps Systellaspis debilis (37%) and Sergia prehensilis (34%), and was restricted to seamounts on the subtropical SWIR. Our observations suggest that the \u2018oasis effect\u2019 of seamounts conventionally associated with higher trophic levels is also applicable to pelagic micronektic crustaceans at lower trophic levels. We suggest that the enhanced biomass and species richness attributed is due to \u2018habitat enrichment\u2019, whereby seamounts provide favourable habitats for both pelagic and bentho-pelagic mid-water crustaceans.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Conservation", "Decapod shrimp", "Deep Sea", "Gnathophausia", "Indian ocean"], "IndexKeywords": ["Assemblage composition", "Biological variables", "Biophysical process", "Decapod shrimp", "Deep sea", "Gnathophausia", "Indian ocean", "Multi variate analysis"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84930369888", "SubjectAreas": [["Oceanography", "EART", "1910"]], "AuthorData": {"33867647700": {"Name": "Letessier T.B.", "AuthorID": "33867647700", "AffiliationID": "60031806", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Marine Futures, The UWA Oceans Institute, The University of Western Australia"}, "54941264000": {"Name": "Boersch-Supan P.H.", "AuthorID": "54941264000", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "University of Oxford, Department of Zoology"}, "7004643777": {"Name": "Brierley A.S.", "AuthorID": "7004643777", "AffiliationID": "60022132", "AffiliationName": "Pelagic Ecology Research Group, Scottish Oceans Institute, University of St Andrews"}, "7004594061": {"Name": "De Grave S.", "AuthorID": "7004594061", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Oxford Natural History Museum, Parks Road"}, "7402815969": {"Name": "Rogers A.D.", "AuthorID": "7402815969", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "University of Oxford, Department of Zoology"}, "55217303300": {"Name": "Kemp K.M.", "AuthorID": "55217303300", "AffiliationID": "60005453, 60009498", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Zoology, Zoological Society of London, Regent\u05f3s Park"}}}
