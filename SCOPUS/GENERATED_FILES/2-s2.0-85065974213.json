This cessation of biological time allows cells to be preserved for months or years in medicine and biotechnology. This review discusses the historical development of cryobiology, the basic scientific principles underpinning cryopreservation, and how the technologies are currently used.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Biological clock", "Cellular activities", "Cryo-preservation", "Functional recovery", "Historical development", "On demands", "Scientific principles"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85065974213", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Engineering (all)", "ENGI", "2200"]], "AuthorData": {"57192269036": {"Name": "Getreu N.", "AuthorID": "57192269036", "AffiliationID": "60170516, 60029950", "AffiliationName": "Division of Surgery and Interventional Science, Centre for Surgical Innovation, Organ Repair and Transplantation, UCL Medical School and Royal Free London NHS Trust"}, "7102974662": {"Name": "Fuller B.", "AuthorID": "7102974662", "AffiliationID": "60170516, 60029950", "AffiliationName": "Division of Surgery and Interventional Science, Centre for Surgical Innovation, Organ Repair and Transplantation, UCL Medical School and Royal Free London NHS Trust"}}}
