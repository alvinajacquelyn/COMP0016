The response of these structures when loaded cyclically, as occurs during the earthquakes, is partially controlled by the bond properties between the reinforcing bars and the surrounding concrete. This paper presents the results of an experimental campaign of unidirectional cyclic tests carried out on six full-scale beam-column joints built with plain bars. These joint specimens are representative of existing reinforced concrete structures, that is, built without adequate reinforcement detailing for seismic demands. For comparison, an additional specimen is built with deformed bars and tested. The seven specimens are designed and detailed to allow the investigation of the influence of bond properties, lapping of the longitudinal bars in columns and beams, bent-up bars in the beams, slab contribution and concrete strength. The lateral force-drift relationships, global dissipated energy evolution, contribution of the joint, beams and columns to the global dissipated energy, ductility, equivalent damping, final damage observed, homogenized reinforced concrete damage index, displacement components, curvature evolutions and Eurocode requirements are presented and discussed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cyclic behaviour", "Full-scale tests", "Interior joints", "Old RC structures", "Plain reinforcing bars"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cyclic behaviour", "Full scale tests", "Interior joints", "RC structure", "Reinforcing bar"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84931393183", "SubjectAreas": [["Geotechnical Engineering and Engineering Geology", "EART", "1909"], ["Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)", "EART", "1901"]], "AuthorData": {"12039997100": {"Name": "Melo J.", "AuthorID": "12039997100", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60012808", "AffiliationName": "EPICentre, Department of Civil, Environmental and Geomatic Engineering, University College of London"}, "23135674700": {"Name": "Varum H.", "AuthorID": "23135674700", "AffiliationID": "60007249", "AffiliationName": "Civil Engineering Department, Faculty of Engineering, University of Porto"}, "7801656850": {"Name": "Rossetto T.", "AuthorID": "7801656850", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60012808", "AffiliationName": "EPICentre, Department of Civil, Environmental and Geomatic Engineering, University College of London"}}}
