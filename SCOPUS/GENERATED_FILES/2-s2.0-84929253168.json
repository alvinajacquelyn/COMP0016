However, despite the proposed importance of self-reference information to these internal representations of space, their congruence with vestibular signaling remains unclear. Here we have undertaken brain-wide functional mapping using both fMRI and electrophysiological methods to directly determine the spatial extent, strength, and time course of vestibular signaling across the rat forebrain. We find distributed activity throughout thalamic, limbic, and particularly primary sensory cortical areas in addition to known head-direction pathways. We also observe activation of frontal regions, including infralimbic and cingulate cortices, indicating integration of vestibular information throughout functionally diverse cortical regions. These whole-brain activity maps therefore suggest a widespread contribution of vestibular signaling to a self-centered framework for multimodal sensorimotor integration in support of movement planning, execution, spatial navigation, and autonomic responses to gravito-inertial changes.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Evoked potential", "fMRI", "Rat", "Self movement", "Spatial navigation", "Vestibular cortex"], "IndexKeywords": ["Action Potentials", "Afferent Pathways", "Animals", "Brain Mapping", "Cerebral Cortex", "Image Processing, Computer-Assisted", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Neurons", "Oxygen", "Physical Stimulation", "Rats", "Rats, Wistar", "Vestibule, Labyrinth"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84929253168", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"]], "AuthorData": {"14009775600": {"Name": "Rancz E.", "AuthorID": "14009775600", "AffiliationID": "60023477", "AffiliationName": "Division of Neurophysiology, National Institute for Medical Research"}, "56642719800": {"Name": "Drawitsch F.", "AuthorID": "56642719800", "AffiliationID": "60023477", "AffiliationName": "Division of Neurophysiology, National Institute for Medical Research"}, "6602716645": {"Name": "Margrie T.", "AuthorID": "6602716645", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Sainsbury Wellcome Centre for Neural Circuits and Behaviour, University College London"}, "56642419000": {"Name": "Moya J.", "AuthorID": "56642419000", "AffiliationID": "60017107", "AffiliationName": "Instituto de Neurociencias (CSIC-UMH)"}, "6602952764": {"Name": "Canals S.", "AuthorID": "6602952764", "AffiliationID": "60017107", "AffiliationName": "Instituto de Neurociencias (CSIC-UMH)"}, "7003558132": {"Name": "Brichta A.", "AuthorID": "7003558132", "AffiliationID": "60089816, 60010571", "AffiliationName": "School of Biomedical Sciences and Pharmacy, Hunter Medical Research Institute, University of Newcastle"}}}
