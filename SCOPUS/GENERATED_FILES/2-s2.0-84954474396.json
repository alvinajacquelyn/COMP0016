The particular focus is on how teachers, head teachers and teaching assistants (n = 59) articulate pupils\u2019 learning success in five highly achieving schools in deprived communities. Six key themes are highlighted which are identified by participants as influencing successful pupil learning and progress. These are analysed in relation to Biesta's theory on the parameters of \u2018Good Education\u2019 [Biesta, G. J. J. 2010. Good Education in an Age of Measurement. Boulder, CO: Paradigm] and within Bourdieu's understanding of \u2018distinction\u2019 [Bourdieu, P. 1998. Practical Reason: On the Theory of Action. Oxford: Polity Press]. The research reveals that issues related to socialisation and subjectivity are presented as critical and foundational for the more formal measures of success in pupil learning.", "AuthorKeywords": ["attainment", "deprivation", "distinction", "Learning"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84954474396", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["Life-span and Life-course Studies", "SOCI", "3319"]], "AuthorData": {"55096462700": {"Name": "Dann R.", "AuthorID": "55096462700", "AffiliationID": "60022046", "AffiliationName": "Manchester Metropolitan University"}}}
