All rights reserved.Penile carcinomas are rare in most developed countries; in contrast, this cancer is not infrequent in the tropical and subtropical regions of Latin America, Asia, and Africa. In addition, penile cancer is common in regions with high prevalence of human papilloma virus infection. More than 95% of penile carcinomas are of the squamous cell type; other histologic types include basal cell carcinoma, melanoma, and sarcoma. Penile carcinoma usually spreads through lymphatic channels to the superficial and deep inguinal lymph nodes; subsequently iliac lymph nodes are involved. The presence and extent of metastatic disease in inguinal nodes is the single most important prognostic factor in patients with penile cancer. Primary evaluation of penile cancer is based on physical examination including inguinal lymph node palpation. Ultrasound and MRI can provide information on tumor invasion of the corpora cavernosa if organ preservation is planned. Ultrasound can be used to evaluate nonpalpable inguinal lymph nodes, whereas pelvic CT scan can be used to assess pelvic lymph nodes. Lymphoscintigraphy, preferably with SPECT/CT imaging, and subsequently sentinel lymph node biopsy is gaining popularity in clinical practice, especially in patients with nonpalpable lymph nodes; sensitivity reported for this local staging approach ranges from 70% to 86%.Assessment of distant metastases should be performed in patients with positive inguinal nodes; this includes abdomen and pelvis CT, chest X-ray, or thoracic CT. [18F]FDG PET/CT can be used for initial staging of penile cancer with pooled sensitivity and specificity of 80.9% and 92.4% respectively; this staging technique is particularly advocated for patients with positive lymph nodes. [18F]FDG PET/CT can also be employed to monitor the efficacy of induction chemotherapy. Follow-up of penile cancer is based mainly on clinical evaluation, while radionuclide imaging techniques have rarely been used for restaging purposes during regular follow- up.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Imaging", "Penile cancer", "[18F]FDG PET/CT"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85055386992", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"6508135269": {"Name": "Chiacchio S.", "AuthorID": "6508135269", "AffiliationID": "60082061", "AffiliationName": "Regional Center of Nuclear Medicine, University Hospital of Pisa"}, "22933755500": {"Name": "AlSharif A.", "AuthorID": "22933755500", "AffiliationID": "60052340, 60064180", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology and Nuclear Medicine, University of Jordan, Jordan University Hospital"}, "54399175900": {"Name": "Saad Z.", "AuthorID": "54399175900", "AffiliationID": "60027403, 60024544, 60090043", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Nuclear Medicine, University College London Hospitals, NHS Foundation Trust, University College Hospital"}, "7005791371": {"Name": "Bomanji J.", "AuthorID": "7005791371", "AffiliationID": "60027403, 60024544, 60090043", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Nuclear Medicine, University College London Hospitals, NHS Foundation Trust, University College Hospital"}, "6506384652": {"Name": "Giovacchini G.", "AuthorID": "6506384652", "AffiliationID": "60084996", "AffiliationName": "Nuclear Medicine Department, 'S.
