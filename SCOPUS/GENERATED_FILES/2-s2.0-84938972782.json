Methods: Patients aged \u226510 yr with transfusion-dependent anemias from 11 countries were screened. Data were summarized descriptively, overall and across regions. Results: Among 925 patients (99.1% with \u03b2-thalassemia major; 98.5% receiving prior chelation; mean age 19.2 yr), 36.7% had myocardial iron overload (myocardial T2* \u226420 ms), 12.1% had low left ventricular ejection fraction. Liver iron concentration (LIC) (mean 25.8 mg Fe/g dw) and serum ferritin (median 3702 ng/mL) were high. Fewer patients in the Middle East (ME; 28.5%) had myocardial T2* \u226420 ms vs. patients in the West (45.9%) and Far East (FE, 40.9%). Patients in the West had highest myocardial iron burden, but lowest LIC (26.9% with LIC <7 mg Fe/g dw) and serum ferritin. Among patients with normal myocardial iron, a higher proportion of patients from the ME and FE had LIC \u226515 than <7 mg Fe/g dw (ME, 56.7% vs. 17.2%; FE, 78.6% vs. 7.8%, respectively), a trend which was less evident in the West (44.6% vs. 33.9%, respectively). Transfusion and chelation practices differed between regions. Conclusions: Evidence of substantial myocardial and liver iron burden across regions revealed a need for optimization of effective, convenient iron chelation regimens. Significant regional variation exists in myocardial and liver iron loading that are not well explained; improved understanding of factors contributing to differences in body iron distribution may be of clinical benefit.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Distribution", "Heart", "Iron", "Liver", "Prevalence", "Thalassemia"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Anemia", "Blood Transfusion", "Child", "Deferoxamine", "Female", "Humans", "Iron", "Iron Chelating Agents", "Iron Overload", "Liver", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Myocardium", "Prevalence", "Tissue Distribution", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84938972782", "SubjectAreas": [["Hematology", "MEDI", "2720"]], "AuthorData": {"6701871501": {"Name": "Aydinok Y.", "AuthorID": "6701871501", "AffiliationID": "60009761", "AffiliationName": "Ege University Hospital"}, "7403427269": {"Name": "Porter J.B.", "AuthorID": "7403427269", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "56436936600": {"Name": "Piga A.", "AuthorID": "56436936600", "AffiliationID": "60012259", "AffiliationName": "University of Turin"}, "57219783968": {"Name": "Elalfy M.", "AuthorID": "57219783968", "AffiliationID": "60016618", "AffiliationName": "Ain Shams University"}, "6603278914": {"Name": "El-Beshlawy A.", "AuthorID": "6603278914", "AffiliationID": "60010294", "AffiliationName": "Cairo University"}, "7003755311": {"Name": "Kilin\u00e7 Y.", "AuthorID": "7003755311", "AffiliationID": "60002278", "AffiliationName": "Cukurova University Medical Faculty"}, "7003851192": {"Name": "Viprakasit V.", "AuthorID": "7003851192", "AffiliationID": "60011189, 60012718", "AffiliationName": "Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University"}, "8327807300": {"Name": "Yesilipek A.", "AuthorID": "8327807300", "AffiliationID": "60010104", "AffiliationName": "Akdeniz University"}, "14219107100": {"Name": "Habr D.", "AuthorID": "14219107100", "AffiliationID": "60009968", "AffiliationName": "Novartis Pharmaceuticals"}, "6603571922": {"Name": "Quebe-Fehling E.", "AuthorID": "6603571922", "AffiliationID": "60009968", "AffiliationName": "Novartis Pharma AG"}, "7103221771": {"Name": "Pennell D.J.", "AuthorID": "7103221771", "AffiliationID": "60009009", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Cardiovascular Biomedical Research Unit, Royal Brompton Hospital"}}}
