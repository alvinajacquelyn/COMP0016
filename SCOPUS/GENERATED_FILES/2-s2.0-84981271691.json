Objective To investigate current practice and accuracy during preparation of morphine N/PCA infusions in hospital theatres and wards at a UK children\u2019s hospital. Methods Direct observation of infusion preparation methods and morphine concentration quantification using UV\u2013Vis spectrophotometry. The British Pharmacopoeia specification for morphine sulphate injection drug content (\u00b17.5 %) was used as a reference limit. Results Preparation of 153 morphine infusions for 128 paediatric patients was observed. Differences in preparation method were identified, with selection of inappropriate syringe size noted. Lack of appreciation of the existence of a volume overage (i.e. volume in excess of the nominal volume) in morphine ampoules was identified. Final volume of the infusion was greater than the target (50 mL) in 33.3 % of preparations. Of 78 infusions analysed, 61.5 % had a morphine concentration outside 92.5\u2013107.5 % of label strength. Ten infusions deviated by more than 20 %, with one by 100 %. Conclusions Variation in morphine infusion preparation method was identified. Lack of appreciation of the volume overage in ampoules, volumetric accuracy of different syringe sizes and ability to perform large dilutions of small volumes were sources of inaccuracy in infusion concentration, resulting in patients receiving morphine doses higher or lower than prescribed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Analgesia", "Children", "Medication Error", "Morphine", "Nurse", "Opioid intravenous infusions", "Paediatrics", "Preparation", "United Kingdom"], "IndexKeywords": ["Analgesia, Patient-Controlled", "Analgesics, Opioid", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug", "Female", "Hospitals, Pediatric", "Humans", "Infusions, Intravenous", "Male", "Medication Errors", "Morphine", "Nurse's Role", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84981271691", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmacy", "HEAL", "3611"], ["Toxicology", "PHAR", "3005"], ["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"], ["Pharmaceutical Science", "PHAR", "3003"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"54584268300": {"Name": "Rashed A.N.", "AuthorID": "54584268300", "AffiliationID": "60107269, 60005518", "AffiliationName": "Pharmacy Department, Evelina London Children\u2019s Hospital, Guy\u2019s & St. Thomas\u2019 NHS Foundation Trust"}, "55404681700": {"Name": "Tomlin S.", "AuthorID": "55404681700", "AffiliationID": "60107269, 60005518", "AffiliationName": "Pharmacy Department, Evelina London Children\u2019s Hospital, Guy\u2019s & St. Thomas\u2019 NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7005525236": {"Name": "Forbes B.", "AuthorID": "7005525236", "AffiliationID": "60177635", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Pharmaceutical Science, King\u2019s College London"}, "6506031628": {"Name": "Aguado V.", "AuthorID": "6506031628", "AffiliationID": "60107269, 60005518", "AffiliationName": "Pharmacy Department, Evelina London Children\u2019s Hospital, Guy\u2019s & St. Thomas\u2019 NHS Foundation Trust"}, "6507777030": {"Name": "Whittlesea C.", "AuthorID": "6507777030", "AffiliationID": "60022175", "AffiliationName": "School of Medicine, Pharmacy and Health, Durham University"}}}
