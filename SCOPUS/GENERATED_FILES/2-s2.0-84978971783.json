The aim of these short-separation channels is to measure the same superficial hemodynamics observed by standard fNIRS channels while also being insensitive to the brain. We use Monte Carlo simulations of photon transport in anatomically informed multilayer models to determine the optimum source-detector distance for short-separation channels in adult and newborn populations. We present a look-up plot that provides (for an acceptable value of short-separation channel brain sensitivity relative to standard channel brain sensitivity) the optimum short-separation distance. Though values vary across the scalp, when the acceptable ratio of the short-separation channel brain sensitivity to standard channel brain sensitivity is set at 5%, the optimum short-separation distance is 8.4 mm in the typical adult and 2.15 mm in the term-age infant.", "AuthorKeywords": ["functional near-infrared spectroscopy", "Monte Carlo simulations", "short-separation channel", "source-detector distance"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cerebral tissues", "Functional near infrared spectroscopy", "Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fnirs)", "Multilayer models", "Photon transport", "Short separations", "Source-detector distance"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84978971783", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (miscellaneous)", "NEUR", "2801"], ["Radiological and Ultrasound Technology", "HEAL", "3614"], ["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"52263340900": {"Name": "Brigadoi S.", "AuthorID": "52263340900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, Biomedical Optics Research Laboratory"}, "55793189898": {"Name": "Cooper R.", "AuthorID": "55793189898", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, Biomedical Optics Research Laboratory"}}}
