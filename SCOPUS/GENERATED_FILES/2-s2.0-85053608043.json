In this Letter, we demonstrate the growth of GaAs/Ge core-shell nanowires on Si substrates by molecular beam epitaxy and investigate the radial and axial Ge epitaxy on GaAs nanowires in detail. High-quality core-shell nanowires with smooth side facets and dislocation-free, sharp interfaces are achieved. It is found that the low shell growth temperature leads to smoother side facets, while higher shell growth temperatures lead to more relaxed structures with significantly faceted sidewalls. The possibility of forming a III-V/IV heterostructure nanowire with a Ge section development in the axial direction of a GaAs nanowire using a Ga droplet is also revealed. These nanowires provide an ideal platform for nanoscale III-V/IV combination, which is promising for highly integrated photonic and electronic hybrid devices on a single chip.", "AuthorKeywords": ["hybrid heterostructure", "III\u00e2'V/group IV", "MBE", "Nanowires", "single-crystalline"], "IndexKeywords": ["Axial direction", "Core-shell nanowires", "Dislocation free", "III-V/group IV", "Integrated photonics", "Optically Active", "Sharp interface", "Single-crystalline"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85053608043", "SubjectAreas": [["Bioengineering", "CENG", "1502"], ["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"]], "AuthorData": {"57205017416": {"Name": "Zeng H.", "AuthorID": "57205017416", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "7404114635": {"Name": "Yu X.", "AuthorID": "7404114635", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "55365959800": {"Name": "Tang M.", "AuthorID": "55365959800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "37017831000": {"Name": "Zhang Y.", "AuthorID": "37017831000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "57203923596": {"Name": "Boras G.", "AuthorID": "57203923596", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "57203924480": {"Name": "Xu J.", "AuthorID": "57203924480", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "15765485000": {"Name": "Liu H.", "AuthorID": "15765485000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "55635913700": {"Name": "Fonseka H.A.", "AuthorID": "55635913700", "AffiliationID": "60022020", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of Warwick"}, "57195331675": {"Name": "Gott J.A.", "AuthorID": "57195331675", "AffiliationID": "60022020", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of Warwick"}, "56946096400": {"Name": "Sanchez A.M.", "AuthorID": "56946096400", "AffiliationID": "60022020", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of Warwick"}}}
