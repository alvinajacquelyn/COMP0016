The gravity is also included. The problem is solved by using the boundary element method in the time domain. The method of the stretched coordinate system is adopted at the initial stage. A condition is imposed at the intersection of the free surface and the body surface after flow detachment to allow the liquid to leave the body surface smoothly. A new methodology is developed to treat free jet with free surface on both sides. The auxiliary function method is used to calculate the pressure on the body surface. Detailed results for the free surface shape and pressure distribution are provided, and the effect of physical parameters on water entry is discussed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Boundary element method", "Flow detachment", "Free jet flow", "Fully nonlinear boundary conditions", "Stretched coordinate system", "Water entry"], "IndexKeywords": ["Co-ordinate system", "Flow detachment", "Free jets", "Fully nonlinear", "Water entry"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84971331016", "SubjectAreas": [["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"]], "AuthorData": {"57189460056": {"Name": "Bao C.", "AuthorID": "57189460056", "AffiliationID": "60003353", "AffiliationName": "College of Shipbuilding Engineering, Harbin Engineering University"}, "14012675900": {"Name": "Wu G.", "AuthorID": "14012675900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "57193195851": {"Name": "Xu G.", "AuthorID": "57193195851", "AffiliationID": "60003353", "AffiliationName": "College of Shipbuilding Engineering, Harbin Engineering University"}}}
