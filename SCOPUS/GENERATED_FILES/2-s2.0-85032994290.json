However, magnetic resonance imaging alone provides limited information for predicting an individual patient's disability progression. In part, this is because magnetic resonance imaging lacks sensitivity and specificity for detecting chronic diffuse and multi-focal inflammation mediated by activated microglia/macrophages. The aim of this study was to test for an association between 18 kDa translocator protein brain positron emission tomography signal, which arises largely from microglial activation, and measures of subsequent disease progression in multiple sclerosis patients. Twenty-one patients with multiple sclerosis (seven with secondary progressive disease and 14 with a relapsing remitting disease course) underwent T 1 - and T 2 -weighted and magnetization transfer magnetic resonance imaging at baseline and after 1 year. Positron emission tomography scanning with the translocator protein radioligand 11 C-PBR28 was performed at baseline. Brain tissue and lesion volumes were segmented from the T 1 - and T 2 -weighted magnetic resonance imaging and relative 11 C-PBR28 uptake in the normal-appearing white matter was estimated as a distribution volume ratio with respect to a caudate pseudo-reference region. Normal-appearing white matter distribution volume ratio at baseline was correlated with enlarging T 2 -hyperintense lesion volumes over the subsequent year (I = 0.59, P = 0.01). A post hoc analysis showed that this association reflected behaviour in the subgroup of relapsing remitting patients (I= 0.74, P = 0.008). By contrast, in the subgroup of secondary progressive patients, microglial activation at baseline was correlated with later progression of brain atrophy (I= 0.86, P = 0.04). A regression model including the baseline normal-appearing white matter distribution volume ratio, T 2 lesion volume and normal-appearing white matter magnetization transfer ratio for all of the patients combined explained over 90% of the variance in enlarging lesion volume over the subsequent 1 year. Glial activation in white matter assessed by translocator protein PET significantly improves predictions of white matter lesion enlargement in relapsing remitting patients and is associated with greater brain atrophy in secondary progressive disease over a period of short term follow-up.", "AuthorKeywords": ["atrophy", "microglia", "multiple sclerosis", "positron emission tomography", "translocator protein"], "IndexKeywords": ["Acetamides", "Adult", "Atrophy", "Brain", "Carbon Radioisotopes", "Female", "Humans", "Image Processing, Computer-Assisted", "Inflammation", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Microglia", "Middle Aged", "Multiple Sclerosis, Chronic Progressive", "Multiple Sclerosis, Relapsing-Remitting", "Organ Size", "Positron-Emission Tomography", "Pyridines", "Receptors, GABA", "White Matter", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85032994290", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"56603851400": {"Name": "Datta G.", "AuthorID": "56603851400", "AffiliationID": "60020416, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "Division of Brain Sciences, Imperial College London, Hammersmith Hospital"}, "55894880600": {"Name": "Colasanti A.", "AuthorID": "55894880600", "AffiliationID": "60100018", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Brighton and Sussex Medical School"}, "7101894687": {"Name": "Gunn R.N.", "AuthorID": "7101894687", "AffiliationID": "60109255", "AffiliationName": "Imanova Ltd"}, "7102619655": {"Name": "Malik O.", "AuthorID": "7102619655", "AffiliationID": "60020416, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "Division of Brain Sciences, Imperial College London, Hammersmith Hospital"}, "15768161200": {"Name": "Nicholas R.", "AuthorID": "15768161200", "AffiliationID": "60020416, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "Division of Brain Sciences, Imperial College London, Hammersmith Hospital"}, "23010235000": {"Name": "Searle G.", "AuthorID": "23010235000", "AffiliationID": "60109255", "AffiliationName": "Imanova Ltd"}, "55369767700": {"Name": "Santos-Ribeiro A.", "AuthorID": "55369767700", "AffiliationID": "60020416, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "Division of Brain Sciences, Imperial College London, Hammersmith Hospital"}, "7202324607": {"Name": "Matthews P.M.", "AuthorID": "7202324607", "AffiliationID": "60015879", "AffiliationName": "UK Dementia Research Institute, Medical Research Council"}, "6701610067": {"Name": "Rabiner E.A.", "AuthorID": "6701610067", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Neuroimaging Sciences, King's College"}, "7003671038": {"Name": "Ciccarelli O.", "AuthorID": "7003671038", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "NIHR University College London Hospitals Biomedical Research Centre"}, "56096752200": {"Name": "Van Vlierberghe E.", "AuthorID": "56096752200", "AffiliationID": "119729368", "AffiliationName": "Icometrix"}, "22952473100": {"Name": "Van Hecke W.", "AuthorID": "22952473100", "AffiliationID": "119729368", "AffiliationName": "Icometrix"}}}
