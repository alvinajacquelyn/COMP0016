Optical microscopy measurements reveal that with the HPT processing increased from 1/4 to 10 revolutions under an applied pressure of 6.0GPa, brittle coarse silicon particles and intermetallic phases were effectively broken into ultrafine-grained particles and redistributed homogeneously into the Al-rich matrix. Open-circuit potential and polarization curves results exhibit that corrosion resistance of the Al-7Si alloy in NaCl solution was significantly enhanced upon high torsion strains, with corrosion rate reduced from 7.41\u03bcmy<sup>-1</sup> for the as-received sample to 1.68\u03bcmy<sup>-1</sup> for the 10-turn processed sample. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy analysis combined with characterization of the corroded samples using scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy indicates that the enhancement in corrosion performance of the Al-7Si alloy is due to the breakage of coarse silicon particles and intermetallic phases, the microstructure homogeneity and the increased HPT-induced active sites. It is demonstrated that microstructure refinement through HPT processing can significantly improve both microhardness and corrosion properties of the Al-7Si alloy.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Al-7Si alloys", "Corrosion resistance", "Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy", "Grain refinement", "High-pressure torsion", "Microhardness"], "IndexKeywords": ["Corrosion performance", "Energy dispersive X ray spectroscopy", "High pressure torsions", "Microstructure homogeneity", "Microstructure refinement", "Open circuit potential", "Optical microscopy measurements", "Si alloys"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84941273660", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Mechanics of Materials", "ENGI", "2211"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"]], "AuthorData": {"37462550300": {"Name": "Wang X.", "AuthorID": "37462550300", "AffiliationID": "60002836", "AffiliationName": "School of Materials Science and Engineering, Hefei University of Technology"}, "8846231600": {"Name": "Gao N.", "AuthorID": "8846231600", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "Materials Research Group, Faculty of Engineering and the Environment, University of Southampton"}, "53880326000": {"Name": "Nie M.", "AuthorID": "53880326000", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "National Centre for Advanced Tribology at Southampton (nCATS), Faculty of Engineering and the Environment, University of Southampton"}, "9036708500": {"Name": "Wang S.", "AuthorID": "9036708500", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "National Centre for Advanced Tribology at Southampton (nCATS), Faculty of Engineering and the Environment, University of Southampton"}, "36783788300": {"Name": "Wang C.", "AuthorID": "36783788300", "AffiliationID": "60010080", "AffiliationName": "School of Mechanical Engineering, Nanjing University of Science and Technology"}}}
