Study design A cohort study of extremely low gestational age newborns. Adverse outcome was defined as early mortality before 72 hours of life, acquired severe periventricular-intraventricular hemorrhage, or severe cystic leukomalacia. Perfusion Index values were obtained from the plethysmographic signal of a pulse oximeter. Perfusion Index signals were separated into low-frequency (trend) and high-frequency (detrend) components. Three features were extracted during four 6-hour epochs: mean of the trend component (mean-trend), SD of the trend component (SD-trend), and SD of the detrend component (SD-detrend). The SD features represent long-term variability (SD-trend) and short-term variability (SD-detrend) of the Perfusion Index. A mixed-effects model was fitted to each feature. Results Ninety-nine infants were included in the analysis. Quadratic-time mixed-effects models provided the best fit for all 3 features. The mean-trend component was lower for the adverse outcome compared with the normal outcome group with a difference of 0.142 Perfusion Index (P = .001). SD-detrend component was also lower for the adverse compared with the normal outcome group, although this difference of 0.031 Perfusion Index/days2 was dependent on time (P < .001). Conclusion Low values and reduced short-term variability of Perfusion Index on day 1 are associated with adverse outcome", "AuthorKeywords": ["circulation", "Infant, premature", "plethysmography"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cohort Studies", "Female", "Gestational Age", "Humans", "Infant", "Infant Mortality", "Infant, Extremely Premature", "Infant, Newborn", "Infant, Premature, Diseases", "Male", "Oximetry", "Plethysmography"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84994128677", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"]], "AuthorData": {"56597956700": {"Name": "Van Laere D.", "AuthorID": "56597956700", "AffiliationID": "60012937", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine and Health Sciences, University of Antwerp"}, "55990713500": {"Name": "Voeten M.", "AuthorID": "55990713500", "AffiliationID": "60012937", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine and Health Sciences, University of Antwerp"}, "15923829700": {"Name": "O'Toole J.", "AuthorID": "15923829700", "AffiliationID": "60113732, 60025160", "AffiliationName": "Irish Centre for Fetal and Neonatal Translational Research, University College Cork"}, "57191850473": {"Name": "McKiernan J.", "AuthorID": "57191850473", "AffiliationID": "60113732, 60025160", "AffiliationName": "Irish Centre for Fetal and Neonatal Translational Research, University College Cork"}, "6602292136": {"Name": "Boylan G.", "AuthorID": "6602292136", "AffiliationID": "60113732, 60025160", "AffiliationName": "Irish Centre for Fetal and Neonatal Translational Research, University College Cork"}, "8592149500": {"Name": "Dempsey E.", "AuthorID": "8592149500", "AffiliationID": "60113732, 60025160", "AffiliationName": "Irish Centre for Fetal and Neonatal Translational Research, University College Cork"}}}
