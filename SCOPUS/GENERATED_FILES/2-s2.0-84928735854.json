Here we assessed processing of one important class of salient signals, looming sounds, in canonical dementia syndromes. We manipulated tones using intensity cues to create percepts of salient approaching (\u201clooming\u201d) or less salient withdrawing sounds. Pupil dilatation responses and behavioral rating responses to these stimuli were compared in patients fulfilling consensus criteria for dementia syndromes (semantic dementia, n = 10; behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia, n = 16, progressive nonfluent aphasia, n = 12; amnestic Alzheimer\u2019s disease, n = 10) and a cohort of 26 healthy age-matched individuals. Approaching sounds were rated as more salient than withdrawing sounds by healthy older individuals but this behavioral response to salience did not differentiate healthy individuals from patients with dementia syndromes. Pupil responses to approaching sounds were greater than responses to withdrawing sounds in healthy older individuals and in patients with semantic dementia: this differential pupil response was reduced in patients with progressive nonfluent aphasia and Alzheimer\u2019s disease relative both to the healthy control and semantic dementia groups, and did not correlate with nonverbal auditory semantic function. Autonomic responses to auditory salience are differentially affected by dementias and may constitute a novel biomarker of these diseases.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alzheimer\u2019s disease", "Auditory looming", "Dementia", "Frontotemporal dementia", "Nonverbal sound", "Pupillometry", "Salience", "Semantic dementia"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84928735854", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuropsychology and Physiological Psychology", "PSYC", "3206"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"], ["Behavioral Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2802"]], "AuthorData": {"54415528500": {"Name": "Fletcher P.D.", "AuthorID": "54415528500", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dementia Research Centre, UCL Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "25630004900": {"Name": "Nicholas J.M.", "AuthorID": "25630004900", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, University of London"}, "55036185800": {"Name": "Shakespeare T.J.", "AuthorID": "55036185800", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dementia Research Centre, UCL Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "55362291000": {"Name": "Downey L.E.", "AuthorID": "55362291000", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dementia Research Centre, UCL Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "55311753700": {"Name": "Golden H.L.", "AuthorID": "55311753700", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dementia Research Centre, UCL Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "55777168800": {"Name": "Agustus J.L.", "AuthorID": "55777168800", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dementia Research Centre, UCL Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "57213539180": {"Name": "Clark C.N.", "AuthorID": "57213539180", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dementia Research Centre, UCL Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "7006655431": {"Name": "Mummery C.J.", "AuthorID": "7006655431", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dementia Research Centre, UCL Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "7103177641": {"Name": "Schott J.M.", "AuthorID": "7103177641", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dementia Research Centre, UCL Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "6602191607": {"Name": "Crutch S.J.", "AuthorID": "6602191607", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dementia Research Centre, UCL Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "35557252600": {"Name": "Warren J.D.", "AuthorID": "35557252600", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dementia Research Centre, UCL Institute of Neurology, University College London"}}}
