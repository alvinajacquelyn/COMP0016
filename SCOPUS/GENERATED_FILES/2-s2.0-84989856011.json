Chromatographic separation was achieved at ambient temperature using a reverse-phase column and a linear gradient elution with two solvents: 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile and 5 mM ammonium formate at pH 3. The mass spectrometer was operated in positive ion mode, using multiple reaction monitoring via positive electro-spray ionization. The method was linear from the limit of quantification (5 ng/ml for all the analytes apart from 15 ng/ml for \u0394-9-tetrahydrocannabinol and metabolites) to 500 ng/ml, and showed good correlation coefficients (r2 = 0.990) for all substances. Analytical recovery of analytes under investigation was always higher than 75% and intra-assay and inter-assay precision and accuracy always better than 15%. Using the validated method, ten DBS samples, collected at the hospital emergency department in cases of acute drug intoxication, were found positive to one or more psychoactive drugs. Our data support the potential of DBS sampling for non invasive monitoring of exposure/intoxication to psychoactive drugs.", "AuthorKeywords": ["DBS", "Dried blood spots", "Psychoactive drugs", "Ultra-high-pressure liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cannabinol", "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid", "Dried Blood Spot Testing", "Humans", "Psychotropic Drugs", "Reproducibility of Results", "Tandem Mass Spectrometry"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84989856011", "SubjectAreas": [["Analytical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1602"], ["Pharmaceutical Science", "PHAR", "3003"], ["Drug Discovery", "PHAR", "3002"], ["Spectroscopy", "CHEM", "1607"], ["Clinical Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1308"]], "AuthorData": {"56644581600": {"Name": "Kyriakou C.", "AuthorID": "56644581600", "AffiliationID": "60032350", "AffiliationName": "Unit of Forensic Toxicology (UoFT), Department of Anatomical, Histological, Forensic and Orthopedic Sciences, Sapienza University of Rome"}, "6506903572": {"Name": "Marchei E.", "AuthorID": "6506903572", "AffiliationID": "60010062", "AffiliationName": "Department of Therapeutic Research and Medicines Evaluation, Istituto Superiore di Sanit\u00e0"}, "23995162800": {"Name": "Graziano S.", "AuthorID": "23995162800", "AffiliationID": "60010062", "AffiliationName": "Department of Therapeutic Research and Medicines Evaluation, Istituto Superiore di Sanit\u00e0"}, "6603317817": {"Name": "Scaravelli G.", "AuthorID": "6603317817", "AffiliationID": "60010062", "AffiliationName": "ART Italian National Register, National Centre for Epidemiology, Surveillance and Health Promotion, National Health Institute, Istituto Superiore di Sanit\u00e0"}, "7003893972": {"Name": "Garc\u00eda-Algar O.", "AuthorID": "7003893972", "AffiliationID": "60023506", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatrics, Hospital del Mar"}, "7003912943": {"Name": "Superv\u00eda A.", "AuthorID": "7003912943", "AffiliationID": "60023506", "AffiliationName": "Emergency Department, Hospital del Mar"}}}
