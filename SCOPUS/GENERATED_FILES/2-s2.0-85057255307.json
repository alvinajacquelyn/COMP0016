Fast payments are desirable in certain scenarios, for instance, when buying in vending machines, fast food restaurants, or withdrawing from an ATM. Despite being quickly propagated through the network, zero-confirmation transactions are not protected against double-spending attacks, since the double-spending protection Bitcoin offers relies on the blockchain and, by definition, such transactions are not yet included in it. In this paper, we propose a double-spending prevention mechanism for Bitcoin zero-confirmation transactions. Our proposal is based on exploiting the flexibility of the Bitcoin scripting language together with a well-known vulnerability of the ECDSA signature scheme to discourage attackers from performing such an attack.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bitcoin", "Blockchain", "Cryptocurrency", "Double-spending", "ECDSA"], "IndexKeywords": ["Bitcoin", "Double spending", "ECDSA", "Fast-food restaurants", "Scripting languages", "Signature Scheme"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85057255307", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Information Systems", "COMP", "1710"], ["Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality", "ENGI", "2213"], ["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"]], "AuthorData": {"45861254600": {"Name": "P\u00e9rez-Sol\u00e0 C.", "AuthorID": "45861254600", "AffiliationID": "121400950", "AffiliationName": "CYBERCAT-Center for Cybersecurity Research of Catalonia"}, "57184364400": {"Name": "Delgado-Segura S.", "AuthorID": "57184364400", "AffiliationID": "121400950", "AffiliationName": "CYBERCAT-Center for Cybersecurity Research of Catalonia"}, "23467377900": {"Name": "Navarro-Arribas G.", "AuthorID": "23467377900", "AffiliationID": "121400950", "AffiliationName": "CYBERCAT-Center for Cybersecurity Research of Catalonia"}, "6507717344": {"Name": "Herrera-Joancomart\u00ed J.", "AuthorID": "6507717344", "AffiliationID": "121400950", "AffiliationName": "CYBERCAT-Center for Cybersecurity Research of Catalonia"}}}
