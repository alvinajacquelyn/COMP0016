Since 2001, education has become a major victim of Afghanistan\u2019s protracted crisis that involves international military interventions, fragile democracy and growing radicalisation. Drawing upon qualitative interviews with educational officials and practitioners in Afghanistan and critically examining the literature in education and conflict, we argue that Afghanistan\u2019s education is caught in the nexus between deteriorating security conditions, weak governance and widespread corruption, resulting in rebel capture of educational spaces for radicalisation and violent extremism. More broadly, we contend that education faces the risk of capture for radicalisation in contexts where state fragility and fundamentalism intersect. Finally, we highlight some critical issues relating to educational programming in conflict-affected contexts.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Afghanistan", "Education and conflict", "political economy", "security and state-building"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85049918817", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"]], "AuthorData": {"36931205600": {"Name": "Pherali T.", "AuthorID": "36931205600", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Education"}, "56339885100": {"Name": "Sahar A.", "AuthorID": "56339885100", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Education"}}}
