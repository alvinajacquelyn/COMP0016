Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.ABSTRACT: This article focuses on the theoretical-methodological question of how to identify reform-induced changes in school mathematics. The issue arose in our project The Evolution of the Discourse of School Mathematics (EDSM), in which we studied transformations in high-stakes examinations taken by students in England at the end of compulsory schooling. We have adopted a conceptualisation that draws on social semiotics and on a communicational approach, according to which school mathematics can be thought of as a discourse. Methods of comparing examinations of different years developed on the basis of this definition enable identification of subtle disparities that are nevertheless significant enough to make an important difference in students\u2019 vision of mathematics, in their performance and, eventually, in their ability to cope with problems that can benefit from the use of mathematics. In this article, we present these methods and argue that they have wider application for comparative studies of school mathematics.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Discourse", "discourse analysis", "examinations"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84979019892", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["Mathematics (all)", "MATH", "2600"]], "AuthorData": {"8875006700": {"Name": "Morgan C.", "AuthorID": "8875006700", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "Department of Curriculum Pedagogy and Assessment, University College London Institute of Education"}, "6508341590": {"Name": "Sfard A.", "AuthorID": "6508341590", "AffiliationID": "60002999", "AffiliationName": "Department of Education, University of Haifa"}}}
