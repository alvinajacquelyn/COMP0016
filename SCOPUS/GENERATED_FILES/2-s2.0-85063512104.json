However, cross-tier interference may be inevitable among these tightly embraced heterogeneous networks. In our paper, we propose a two-stage joint hovering altitude and power control solution for the resource allocation problem. Furthermore, Lagrange dual decomposition and concave-convex procedure (CCP) method are used to solve this problem. Finally, simulation results show the effectiveness of our proposed two-stage joint optimization algorithm in terms of UAV network's total throughput.", "AuthorKeywords": ["cross-tier interference", "heterogeneous networks", "Network association", "power control"], "IndexKeywords": ["Air grounds", "Concave-convex procedure", "Cross-tier interferences", "Joint optimization", "Lagrange dual decompositions", "Network associations", "Resource allocation problem", "Uav networks"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85063512104", "SubjectAreas": [["Information Systems and Management", "DECI", "1802"], ["Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment", "ENER", "2105"], ["Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality", "ENGI", "2213"], ["Signal Processing", "COMP", "1711"], ["Modeling and Simulation", "MATH", "2611"], ["Instrumentation", "PHYS", "3105"], ["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"]], "AuthorData": {"56039489400": {"Name": "Wang J.", "AuthorID": "56039489400", "AffiliationID": "60025278", "AffiliationName": "Tsinghua University"}, "35766580300": {"Name": "Jiang C.", "AuthorID": "35766580300", "AffiliationID": "60025278", "AffiliationName": "Tsinghua University"}, "7403274440": {"Name": "Ren Y.", "AuthorID": "7403274440", "AffiliationID": "60025278", "AffiliationName": "Tsinghua University"}, "57158079100": {"Name": "Wei Z.", "AuthorID": "57158079100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "57195483982": {"Name": "Bai T.", "AuthorID": "57195483982", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "University of Southampton"}, "57189345966": {"Name": "Zhang H.", "AuthorID": "57189345966", "AffiliationID": "60018273", "AffiliationName": "University of Science and Technology Beijing"}}}
