Over the time, the progress of OCT from time domain to spectral (Fourier) domain SD-OCT has led to new approaches in measuring flow and tissue (object) vibration. In the present document, several procedures are presented of what is known today as OCTA, used to visualize tiny vessels in the human retina and replacing the need for injection in angiography. These methods are now extended to measurements of minuscule spatial variations due to action potential, cell division or tissue deformation in elastography.", "AuthorKeywords": ["motion estimation", "multiple imaging", "Optical Coherence Tomography", "optical flow", "speckle variance"], "IndexKeywords": ["Action potentials", "Cell divisions", "Measurements of", "Multiple imaging", "New approaches", "Spatial variations", "Speckle variances", "Tissue deformations"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85052631329", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Biomaterials", "MATE", "2502"], ["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"], ["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"26638425000": {"Name": "Podoleanu A.", "AuthorID": "26638425000", "AffiliationID": "60010818", "AffiliationName": "Applied Optics Group, School of Physical Sciences, University of Kent"}, "57189590592": {"Name": "Caujolle S.", "AuthorID": "57189590592", "AffiliationID": "60010818", "AffiliationName": "Applied Optics Group, School of Physical Sciences, University of Kent"}, "55703571000": {"Name": "Marques M.", "AuthorID": "55703571000", "AffiliationID": "60010818", "AffiliationName": "Applied Optics Group, School of Physical Sciences, University of Kent"}, "6603132505": {"Name": "Cernat R.", "AuthorID": "6603132505", "AffiliationID": "60010818", "AffiliationName": "Applied Optics Group, School of Physical Sciences, University of Kent"}, "12808804200": {"Name": "Bradu A.", "AuthorID": "12808804200", "AffiliationID": "60010818", "AffiliationName": "Applied Optics Group, School of Physical Sciences, University of Kent"}, "8417872600": {"Name": "Rajendram R.", "AuthorID": "8417872600", "AffiliationID": "60016691, 60022148, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital, University College London Institute of Ophthalmology"}}}
