In particular, quantum algorithms applied to the electronic structure problem promise exact, efficient methods for determination of the electronic energy of atoms and molecules. The Bravyi-Kitaev transformation is a method of mapping the occupation state of a fermionic system onto qubits. This transformation maps the Hamiltonian of n interacting fermions to an O(log\u00e2\u00a1n)-local Hamiltonian of n qubits. This is an improvement in locality over the Jordan-Wigner transformation, which results in an O(n)-local qubit Hamiltonian. We present the Bravyi-Kitaev transformation in detail, introducing the sets of qubits which must be acted on to change occupancy and parity of states in the occupation number basis. We give recursive definitions of these sets and of the transformation and inverse transformation matrices, which relate the occupation number basis and the Bravyi-Kitaev basis. We then compare the use of the Jordan-Wigner and Bravyi-Kitaev Hamiltonians for the quantum simulation of methane using the STO-6G basis.", "AuthorKeywords": ["quantum chemistry", "quantum computing", "quantum simulation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Electronic energies", "Interacting fermions", "Inverse transformations", "Jordan-Wigner transformation", "Local hamiltonians", "Quantum Computing", "Quantum simulations", "Recursive definitions"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84939261773", "SubjectAreas": [["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"]], "AuthorData": {"56705332800": {"Name": "Tranter A.", "AuthorID": "56705332800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Computational Science, University College London"}, "6603182591": {"Name": "Mintert F.", "AuthorID": "6603182591", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Imperial College London, South Kensington Campus"}, "7005747590": {"Name": "Coveney P.V.", "AuthorID": "7005747590", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Computational Science, University College London"}, "57188558246": {"Name": "Sofia S.", "AuthorID": "57188558246", "AffiliationID": "60029227", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Haverford College"}, "56417341400": {"Name": "Seeley J.", "AuthorID": "56417341400", "AffiliationID": "60025038", "AffiliationName": "Earth and Planetary Science, University of California, Berkeley, 307 McCone Hall"}, "8903073200": {"Name": "Love P.J.", "AuthorID": "8903073200", "AffiliationID": "60029227", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Haverford College"}, "56705617900": {"Name": "Kaicher M.", "AuthorID": "56705617900", "AffiliationID": "60033241", "AffiliationName": "Theoretical Physics, Saarland University"}, "7103335433": {"Name": "Wilhelm F.", "AuthorID": "7103335433", "AffiliationID": "60033241", "AffiliationName": "Theoretical Physics, Saarland University"}, "55909317000": {"Name": "McClean J.", "AuthorID": "55909317000", "AffiliationID": "60009982", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, Harvard University"}, "55115786500": {"Name": "Babbush R.", "AuthorID": "55115786500", "AffiliationID": "60009982", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, Harvard University"}}}
