The fault diagnosis architecture is designed to automatically manage the possible plug-in of novel subsystems and unplugging of existing ones. The reconfiguration procedure involves only local operations and communication with neighboring subsystems, thus, yielding a distributed and scalable architecture. In particular, the proposed fault diagnosis methodology allows the unplugging of faulty subsystems in order to possibly avoid the propagation of faults in the interconnected large-scale system. Measurement and process uncertainties are characterized in a probabilistic way leading to the computation, at each time-step, of stochastic time-varying detection thresholds with guaranteed false-alarms probability levels. To achieve this goal, we develop a distributed state estimation scheme, using a consensus-like approach for the estimation of variables shared among more than one subsystem; the time-varying consensus weights are designed to allow plug-in and unplugging operations and to minimize the variance of the uncertainty of the fault diagnosis thresholds. Convergence results of the distributed estimation scheme are provided. A novel fault isolation method is then proposed, based on a generalized observer scheme and providing guaranteed error probabilities of the fault exclusion task. Detectability and isolability conditions are provided. Simulation results on a power network model comprising 15 generation areas show the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Fault detection", "Interconnected systems", "Large-scale systems", "Nonlinear systems", "Scalability", "Stochastic systems", "Systems of systems"], "IndexKeywords": ["Distributed state estimation", "Fault detection and isolation", "Interconnected large-scale systems", "Interconnected subsystems", "Large-scale nonlinear systems", "Nonlinear large scale systems", "Stochastic uncertainties", "Uncertainty"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85042864603", "SubjectAreas": [["Control and Systems Engineering", "ENGI", "2207"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"54411982800": {"Name": "Boem F.", "AuthorID": "54411982800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "55161538500": {"Name": "Parisini T.", "AuthorID": "55161538500", "AffiliationID": "60018363", "AffiliationName": "Department of Engineering and Architecture, University of Trieste"}, "55356548000": {"Name": "Riverso S.", "AuthorID": "55356548000", "AffiliationID": "60120577", "AffiliationName": "United Technologies Research Centre Ireland, Ltd."}, "6603923286": {"Name": "Ferrari-Trecate G.", "AuthorID": "6603923286", "AffiliationID": "60028186", "AffiliationName": "Automatic Control Laboratory, \u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne"}}}
