Purpose: To investigate the applicability of subtraction MRI in the ARIA-E detection using an established ARIA-E-rating scale. Methods: We included 75 AD patients receiving bapineuzumab treatment, including 29 ARIA-E cases. Five neuroradiologists rated their brain MRI-scans with and without subtraction images. The accuracy of evaluating the presence of ARIA-E, intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and specific agreement was calculated. Results: Subtraction resulted in higher sensitivity (0.966) and lower specificity (0.970) than native images (0.959, 0.991, respectively). Individual rater detection was excellent. ICC scores ranged from excellent to good, except for gyral swelling (moderate). Excellent negative and good positive specific agreement among all ARIA-E imaging features was reported in both groups. Combining sulcal hyperintensity and gyral swelling significantly increased positive agreement for subtraction images. Conclusion: Subtraction MRI has potential as a visual aid increasing the sensitivity of ARIA-E assessment. However, in order to improve its usefulness isotropic acquisition and enhanced training are required. The ARIA-E rating scale may benefit from combining sulcal hyperintensity and swelling. Key Points: \u2022 Subtraction technique can improve detection amyloid-related imaging-abnormalities with edema/effusion in Alzheimer\u2019s patients. \u2022 The value of ARIA-E detection, classification and monitoring using subtraction was assessed. \u2022 Validation of an established ARIA-E rating scale, recommendations for improvement are reported. \u2022 Complementary statistical methods were employed to measure accuracy, inter-rater-reliability and specific agreement.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alzheimer's disease (AD)", "Amyloid beta (A\u03b2)", "ARIA (amyloid-related imaging abnormalities)", "Immunotherapy", "MRI (magnetic resonance imaging)"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Alzheimer Disease", "Amyloidosis", "Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized", "Brain", "Brain Edema", "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug", "Double-Blind Method", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Humans", "Injections, Intravenous", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Reproducibility of Results", "ROC Curve"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85030118094", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"57193769082": {"Name": "Martens R.", "AuthorID": "57193769082", "AffiliationID": "60001997", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology and Nuclear Medicine, Neuroscience Campus Amsterdam, VU University Medical Center"}, "55838293200": {"Name": "Bechten A.", "AuthorID": "55838293200", "AffiliationID": "60001997", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology and Nuclear Medicine, Neuroscience Campus Amsterdam, VU University Medical Center"}, "57195917424": {"Name": "Ingala S.", "AuthorID": "57195917424", "AffiliationID": "60001997", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology and Nuclear Medicine, Neuroscience Campus Amsterdam, VU University Medical Center"}, "6603788231": {"Name": "van Schijndel R.", "AuthorID": "6603788231", "AffiliationID": "60001997", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology and Nuclear Medicine, Neuroscience Campus Amsterdam, VU University Medical Center"}, "57195922120": {"Name": "Machado V.", "AuthorID": "57195922120", "AffiliationID": "60001997", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology and Nuclear Medicine, Neuroscience Campus Amsterdam, VU University Medical Center"}, "55328807500": {"Name": "de Jong M.", "AuthorID": "55328807500", "AffiliationID": "60001997", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology and Nuclear Medicine, Neuroscience Campus Amsterdam, VU University Medical Center"}, "7403362600": {"Name": "Sanchez E.", "AuthorID": "7403362600", "AffiliationID": "60001997", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology and Nuclear Medicine, Neuroscience Campus Amsterdam, VU University Medical Center"}, "8302719300": {"Name": "Wattjes M.", "AuthorID": "8302719300", "AffiliationID": "60001997", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology and Nuclear Medicine, Neuroscience Campus Amsterdam, VU University Medical Center"}, "7102989379": {"Name": "Barkhof F.", "AuthorID": "7102989379", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institutes of Neurology and Healthcare Engineering, University College London"}, "57130251800": {"Name": "Purcell D.", "AuthorID": "57130251800", "AffiliationID": "60112297", "AffiliationName": "BioClinica Inc"}, "57178029300": {"Name": "Arrighi M.", "AuthorID": "57178029300", "AffiliationID": "112587494", "AffiliationName": "Janssen Alzheimer Immunotherapy Research & Development, LLC"}, "23484451800": {"Name": "Brashear R.", "AuthorID": "23484451800", "AffiliationID": "112587494", "AffiliationName": "Janssen Alzheimer Immunotherapy Research & Development, LLC"}}}
