Materials and methods: Selected opinion leaders in MRE completed a questionnaire that included clinical indications (MREg or MREc), specifics regarding administration of enteral contrast, and how the technique is altered to accommodate GA. Results: Fourteen responded. Only the diagnosis and follow-up of Crohn\u2019s disease were considered by over 80 % as a valid MRE indication. The remaining indications ranged between 35.7 % for diagnosis of caeliac disease and unknown sources of gastrointestinal bleeding to 78.6 % for motility disorders. The majority chose MREg over MREc for all indications (from 100 % for follow-up of caeliac disease to 57.7 % for tumour diagnosis). Fifty per cent of responders had needed to consider MRE under GA. The most commonly recommended procedural change was MRI without enteral distention. Three had experience with intubation under GA (MREc modification). Conclusion: Views were variable. Requests for MRE under GA are not uncommon. Presently most opinion leaders suggest standard abdominal MRI when GA is required. Main messages: \u2022 Experts are using MRE for various indications. \u2022 Requests for MRE under general anaesthesia are not uncommon. \u2022 Some radiologists employ MREc under general anaesthesia; others do not distend the small bowel.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Crohn\u2019s disease", "General anaesthesia", "MRI", "Small bowel"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84930194359", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"6602421665": {"Name": "Torkzad M.R.", "AuthorID": "6602421665", "AffiliationID": "60003858", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Oncology, Radiation Sciences, Uppsala University"}, "6602761237": {"Name": "Masselli G.", "AuthorID": "6602761237", "AffiliationID": "60032350, 60023359", "AffiliationName": "Umberto I Hospital, Radiology Department, Sapienza University"}, "55642708000": {"Name": "Halligan S.", "AuthorID": "55642708000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Center for Medical Imaging, University College London"}, "7006756207": {"Name": "Oto A.", "AuthorID": "7006756207", "AffiliationID": "60029278", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, University of Chicago"}, "8970842800": {"Name": "Neubauer H.", "AuthorID": "8970842800", "AffiliationID": "60032515", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Radiology, University Hospital Wuerzburg"}, "57203543924": {"Name": "Taylor S.", "AuthorID": "57203543924", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Center for Medical Imaging, University College London"}, "55628526667": {"Name": "Gupta A.", "AuthorID": "55628526667", "AffiliationID": "60022734", "AffiliationName": "Intestinal Imaging, St Mark\u2019s Hospital"}, "8699361400": {"Name": "Fr\u00f8kj\u00e6r J.B.", "AuthorID": "8699361400", "AffiliationID": "60015555", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Aalborg University Hospital"}, "57210230084": {"Name": "Lawrance I.C.", "AuthorID": "57210230084", "AffiliationID": "60087991, 60031806, 60189789", "AffiliationName": "School of Medicine and Pharmacology, University of Western Australia and Centre for Inflammatory Bowel Disease, Fremantle Hospital"}, "6603752371": {"Name": "Welman C.J.", "AuthorID": "6603752371", "AffiliationID": "60189789", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Fremantle Hospital"}, "9738169700": {"Name": "Neg\u00e5rd A.", "AuthorID": "9738169700", "AffiliationID": "60068728", "AffiliationName": "Abdominal and Children\u2019s Radiology, Department of Radiology, Akershus University Hospital"}, "24786610900": {"Name": "Ekberg O.", "AuthorID": "24786610900", "AffiliationID": "60029170, 60014077", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Sciences/Medical Radiology, Lund University; Diagnostic Centre of Imaging and Functional Medicine Lund University Sk\u00e5ne University Hospital"}, "6603178309": {"Name": "Patak M.", "AuthorID": "6603178309", "AffiliationID": "115293604", "AffiliationName": "Klinik Hirslanden"}, "7004239557": {"Name": "Lauenstein T.", "AuthorID": "7004239557", "AffiliationID": "60007896", "AffiliationName": "Department of Diagnostic and Interventional Radiology and Neuroradiology, University Hospital Essen"}}}
