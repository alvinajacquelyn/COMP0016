We can isolate the role of the head-stem junction as the predominant source of metal release by investigating non-MOM hips; this can help to identify clinically significant volumes of material loss and corrosion from these surfaces. Methods: In this study we examined a series of 94 retrieved metal-on-polyethylene (MOP) hips for evidence of corrosion and material loss at the taper junction using a well published visual grading method and an established roundness-measuring machine protocol. Hips were retrieved from 74 male and 20 female patients with a median age of 57 years (30 to 76) and a median time to revision of 215 months (2 to 324). The reasons for revision were loosening of both the acetabular component and the stem (n = 29), loosening of the acetabular component (n = 58) and infection (n = 7). No adverse tissue reactions were reported by the revision surgeons. Results: Evidence of corrosion was observed in 55% of hips. The median Goldberg taper corrosion score was 2 (1 to 4) and the annual rate of material loss at the taper was 0.084 mm3/year (0 to 0.239). The median trunnion corrosion score was 1 (1 to 3). Conclusions: We have reported a level of trunnionosis for MOP hips with large-diameter heads that were revised for reasons other than trunnionosis, and therefore may be clinically insignificant.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Corrosion", "Hip", "Metal-on-polyethylene", "Taper", "Wear"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85018382364", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Orthopedics and Sports Medicine", "MEDI", "2732"]], "AuthorData": {"6506962865": {"Name": "Hothi H.S.", "AuthorID": "6506962865", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60024067", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Orthopaedics and Musculoskeletal Science, University College London, Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital"}, "56089319500": {"Name": "Henckel J.", "AuthorID": "56089319500", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60024067", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Orthopaedics and Musculoskeletal Science, University College London, Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital"}, "8281611700": {"Name": "Skinner J.", "AuthorID": "8281611700", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60024067", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Orthopaedics and Musculoskeletal Science, University College London, Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital"}, "24597673100": {"Name": "Hart A.", "AuthorID": "24597673100", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60024067", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Orthopaedics and Musculoskeletal Science, University College London, Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital"}, "6602241410": {"Name": "Kendoff D.", "AuthorID": "6602241410", "AffiliationID": "60084833", "AffiliationName": "Orthopaedic Department, HELIOS, Endo-Klinik Hamburg"}, "55912986800": {"Name": "Lausmann C.", "AuthorID": "55912986800", "AffiliationID": "60084833", "AffiliationName": "Orthopaedic Department, HELIOS, Endo-Klinik Hamburg"}, "14013843900": {"Name": "Gehrke T.", "AuthorID": "14013843900", "AffiliationID": "60084833", "AffiliationName": "Orthopaedic Department, HELIOS, Endo-Klinik Hamburg"}}}
