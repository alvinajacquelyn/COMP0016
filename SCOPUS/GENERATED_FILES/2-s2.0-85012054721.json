Among these non-coding variants, somatic insertions are among the least well characterized due to challenges with interpreting short-read DNA sequences. Here, using a combination of Chip-seq to enrich enhancer DNA and a computational approach with multiple DNA alignment procedures, we identify enhancer-associated small insertion variants. Among the 102 tumour cell genomes we analyse, small insertions are frequently observed in enhancer DNA sequences near known oncogenes. Further study of one insertion, somatically acquired in primary leukaemia tumour genomes, reveals that it nucleates formation of an active enhancer that drives expression of the LMO2 oncogene. The approach described here to identify enhancer-associated small insertion variants provides a foundation for further study of these abnormalities across human cancers.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Base Sequence", "Cell Line, Tumor", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Enhancer Elements, Genetic", "Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic", "Genome, Human", "Humans", "Infant", "Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell", "Mutagenesis, Insertional", "Oncogenes", "Reproducibility of Results", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85012054721", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"55652299900": {"Name": "Abraham B.", "AuthorID": "55652299900", "AffiliationID": "60019356", "AffiliationName": "Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research"}, "35098501100": {"Name": "Hnisz D.", "AuthorID": "35098501100", "AffiliationID": "60019356", "AffiliationName": "Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research"}, "56443640200": {"Name": "Weintraub A.", "AuthorID": "56443640200", "AffiliationID": "60022195", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biology, Massachusetts Institute of Technology"}, "24391037600": {"Name": "Kwiatkowski N.", "AuthorID": "24391037600", "AffiliationID": "60019356", "AffiliationName": "Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research"}, "57158095100": {"Name": "Li C.", "AuthorID": "57158095100", "AffiliationID": "60022195", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biology, Massachusetts Institute of Technology"}, "7501439491": {"Name": "Lee T.", "AuthorID": "7501439491", "AffiliationID": "60019356", "AffiliationName": "Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research"}, "7405926028": {"Name": "Young R.", "AuthorID": "7405926028", "AffiliationID": "60022195", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biology, Massachusetts Institute of Technology"}, "57193255117": {"Name": "Li Z.", "AuthorID": "57193255117", "AffiliationID": "60030521", "AffiliationName": "Division of Hematology/Oncology, Children's Hospital"}, "57015468900": {"Name": "Weichert-Leahey N.", "AuthorID": "57015468900", "AffiliationID": "60030521", "AffiliationName": "Division of Hematology/Oncology, Children's Hospital"}, "14009139800": {"Name": "Etchin J.", "AuthorID": "14009139800", "AffiliationID": "60030521", "AffiliationName": "Division of Hematology/Oncology, Children's Hospital"}, "7102132660": {"Name": "Look A.", "AuthorID": "7102132660", "AffiliationID": "60030521", "AffiliationName": "Division of Hematology/Oncology, Children's Hospital"}, "57193259075": {"Name": "Rahman S.", "AuthorID": "57193259075", "AffiliationID": "60109234, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, UCL Cancer Institute, University College London"}, "16646833400": {"Name": "Mansour M.", "AuthorID": "16646833400", "AffiliationID": "60109234, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, UCL Cancer Institute, University College London"}, "57204321094": {"Name": "Liu Y.", "AuthorID": "57204321094", "AffiliationID": "60019905", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computational Biology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital"}, "56031046000": {"Name": "Zhang J.", "AuthorID": "56031046000", "AffiliationID": "60019905", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computational Biology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital"}, "22941374600": {"Name": "Li B.", "AuthorID": "22941374600", "AffiliationID": "60082819", "AffiliationName": "Pediatric Translational Medicine Institute, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine"}, "14044163700": {"Name": "Shen S.", "AuthorID": "14044163700", "AffiliationID": "60082819", "AffiliationName": "Pediatric Translational Medicine Institute, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine"}}}
