KGaA, Weinheim.The handling of solid components in flow chemical processes is still a significant challenge. Current devices for regulating back pressure in laboratory-scale flow chemistry experiments are vulnerable to blockage by solid particulates. A simple device is presented herein for generating back pressure in continuous flow processes that produce chemical slurries. The prototype was constructed from commercially available components and accommodated the use of superheated reaction conditions generated in an agitating cell reactor used to produce a suspended precipitate product. Current devices for regulating back pressure in continuous chemical synthesis are susceptible to blockage by solid particulates. A simple device is presented for safely generating back pressure in continuous flow processes involving chemical slurries. It is constructed from commercially available components, adaptable, and effective in the flow processing of thick chemical slurries.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Back pressure regulation", "Plug-flow reactor", "Pressure systems", "Slurry-forming reactions"], "IndexKeywords": ["Chemical process", "Continuous flows", "Continuous-flow process", "Plug flow reactor", "Pressure system", "Reaction conditions", "Solid components", "Solid particulates"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84921542461", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"], ["Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering", "ENGI", "2209"]], "AuthorData": {"23388241900": {"Name": "Deadman B.", "AuthorID": "23388241900", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Innovative Technology Centre, Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge"}, "23018311500": {"Name": "Browne D.", "AuthorID": "23018311500", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Innovative Technology Centre, Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge"}, "55540158700": {"Name": "Ley S.", "AuthorID": "55540158700", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Innovative Technology Centre, Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge"}, "6603393950": {"Name": "Baxendale I.", "AuthorID": "6603393950", "AffiliationID": "60022175", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Durham"}}}
