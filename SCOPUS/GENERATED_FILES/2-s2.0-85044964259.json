Understanding geographic variations in disease may guide targeted interventions. OBJECTIVE : To characterise the spatial distribution of drug-resistant TB (DR-TB) in a rural area of KwaZulu- Natal, South Africa, and to test for clustering. DESIGN: This was a cross-sectional analysis of DR-TB patients managed at a rural district hospital from 2011 to 2015.We mapped all patients in hospital data to local areas, and then linked to a population-based demographic surveillance system to map the patients to individual homesteads. We used kernel density estimation to visualise the distribution of disease and tested for clustering using spatial scan statistics. RESULT S : There were 489 patients with DR-TB in the subdistrict; 111 lived in the smaller demographic surveillance area. Spatial clustering analysis identified a high-risk cluster (relative risk of DR-TB inside vs. outside cluster 3.0, P< 0.001) in the south-east, a region characterised by high population density and a high prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus infection. CONCLUS ION: We have demonstrated evidence of a geographic high-risk cluster of DR-TB. This suggests that targeting interventions to spatial areas of highest risk, where transmission may be ongoing, could be effective.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Disease clustering", "Geographic information systems", "HIV infection"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Age Distribution", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Coinfection", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Female", "HIV Infections", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Prevalence", "Rural Population", "Sex Distribution", "South Africa", "Spatial Analysis", "Tuberculosis, Multidrug-Resistant", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85044964259", "SubjectAreas": [["Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine", "MEDI", "2740"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"57212329939": {"Name": "Smith C.M.", "AuthorID": "57212329939", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Public Health Data, Institute of Health Informatics, University College London"}, "57203045192": {"Name": "Lessells R.", "AuthorID": "57203045192", "AffiliationID": "60010499, 60138826", "AffiliationName": "Africa Health Research Institute, School of Nursing and Public Health, University of KwaZulu-Natal"}, "7402445866": {"Name": "Grant A.D.", "AuthorID": "7402445866", "AffiliationID": "60016218", "AffiliationName": "School of Public Health, University of Witwatersrand"}, "26649902300": {"Name": "Herbst K.", "AuthorID": "26649902300", "AffiliationID": "60010499, 60138826", "AffiliationName": "Africa Health Research Institute, School of Nursing and Public Health, University of KwaZulu-Natal"}, "6603089893": {"Name": "Tanser F.", "AuthorID": "6603089893", "AffiliationID": "60094841, 60010499", "AffiliationName": "Centre for AIDS Programme of Research in South Africa, University of KwaZulu-Natal"}}}
