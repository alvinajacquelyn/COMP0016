On the other hand, equation-based models can more easily be used for complex analysis in a much shorter timescale.METHODS & OBJECTIVE: This paper formulates an ordinary differential equations and stochastic differential equations model to capture the behaviour of an existing agent-based model of tumour cell reprogramming and applies it to optimization of possible treatment as well as dosage sensitivity analysis.RESULTS: For certain values of the parameter space a close match between the equation-based and agent-based models is achieved. The need for division of labour between the two approaches is explored.", "AuthorKeywords": ["ABM", "agent-based", "Cancer", "ODE", "optimization.", "SDE"], "IndexKeywords": ["Antineoplastic Agents", "Cellular Reprogramming", "Computer Simulation", "Humans", "Models, Biological", "Neoplasms", "Stochastic Processes"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85052690181", "SubjectAreas": [["Biotechnology", "BIOC", "1305"], ["Pharmaceutical Science", "PHAR", "3003"]], "AuthorData": {"57197847996": {"Name": "Voulgarelis D.", "AuthorID": "57197847996", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics"}, "55248576300": {"Name": "Smith F.", "AuthorID": "55248576300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics"}, "6603811861": {"Name": "Velayudhan A.", "AuthorID": "6603811861", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemical Engineering, Bernard Katz Building"}}}
