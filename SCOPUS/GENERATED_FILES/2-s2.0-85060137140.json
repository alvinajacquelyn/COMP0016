We aimed to examine general, i.e. non-psychiatric, hospitalisation rates, changes since 2008 and factors associated with admission. We also aimed to compare admission rates of people with dementia with age-matched people without dementia. We conducted a cohort study of adults \u2265 65 years, with dementia diagnosed during the 2008\u20132016 study window, derived from a large secondary mental healthcare database in South London, UK. We used national general hospital records to identify emergency and elective hospitalisations. We calculated the cumulative incidence and rate of hospitalisation and examined predictors of hospitalisation using negative binomial regression, with multiple imputation for missing covariate data. We calculated age-standardised admission ratio for people with dementia compared to those without. Of 10,137 people, 50.6% were admitted to hospital in the year following dementia diagnosis and 75.9% were admitted during median 2.5 years follow-up. Annual admission rate was 1.26/person-year of which 0.90/person-year were in emergency. Emergency hospitalisation rate increased throughout the study period. Compared to controls without diagnosed dementia in the catchment area, the age-standardised emergency admission ratio for people with dementia was 2.06 (95% CI 1.95, 2.18). Male, older, white and socio-economically deprived people and those with clinically significant comorbid physical illness, depressed mood, activity of daily living or living condition problems had more hospitalisations. Emergency hospitalisations of people with dementia are higher than those without, and increasing. Many factors associated with admission are social and psychological, and may be targets for future interventions that aim to reduce avoidable admissions.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Dementia", "Geriatrics", "Health services", "Hospitalization", "Prognosis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Dementia", "Electronic Health Records", "England", "Female", "Hospitalization", "Humans", "Male"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85060137140", "SubjectAreas": [["Epidemiology", "MEDI", "2713"]], "AuthorData": {"56107100900": {"Name": "Sommerlad A.", "AuthorID": "56107100900", "AffiliationID": "60161451", "AffiliationName": "Camden and Islington NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7402636448": {"Name": "Lewis G.", "AuthorID": "7402636448", "AffiliationID": "60161451", "AffiliationName": "Camden and Islington NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7006347341": {"Name": "Livingston G.", "AuthorID": "7006347341", "AffiliationID": "60161451", "AffiliationName": "Camden and Islington NHS Foundation Trust"}, "34870305100": {"Name": "Perera G.", "AuthorID": "34870305100", "AffiliationID": "60028884", "AffiliationName": "South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust"}, "16689898100": {"Name": "Mueller C.", "AuthorID": "16689898100", "AffiliationID": "60028884", "AffiliationName": "South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust"}, "35594617600": {"Name": "Stewart R.", "AuthorID": "35594617600", "AffiliationID": "60028884", "AffiliationName": "South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust"}, "9734197200": {"Name": "Singh-Manoux A.", "AuthorID": "9734197200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}}}
