Dolomite dissolution was observed in the presence of undersaturated aqueous fluids. Dissolution produced crystallographically well defined etch pits, consistent with the stoichiometric release of ordered lattice cations. In low to moderately saturated fluids, dolomite growth began by the growth of one or two layers of carbonate (layer height <3 \u00c5) which morphologically reproduced the initial surface features, resembling the template effect as previously described by Astilleros et al. (2003, 2006) and Freij et al. (2004). Further growth was strongly inhibited and did not show any systematic crystallographically orientated growth morphologies. At aqueous fluid saturation states exceeding 500, nucleation and growth was observed on the dolomite surfaces at moderate rates, but these did not exhibit the characteristic dolomite crystallographic orientation after the growth of several layers. Taken together these observations suggest that the direct precipitation of dolomite from aqueous solution is disfavored at temperatures to at least 120 \u00b0C due to the poisoning of the dolomite surface for further growth by the precipitation of one to four Ca\u2013Mg carbonate layers on these surfaces.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Dolomite kinetics", "Hydrothermal atomic force microscopy", "Surface reactivity", "Template effect"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85006789398", "SubjectAreas": [["Geochemistry and Petrology", "EART", "1906"]], "AuthorData": {"56533858200": {"Name": "Berninger U.N.", "AuthorID": "56533858200", "AffiliationID": "60028717", "AffiliationName": "Dept. f\u00fcr Geo- und Umweltwissenschaften, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen"}, "6507453027": {"Name": "Saldi G.D.", "AuthorID": "6507453027", "AffiliationID": "60027245", "AffiliationName": "G\u00e9oscience Environnement Toulouse, CNRS-UPS-OMP"}, "7103177603": {"Name": "Schott J.", "AuthorID": "7103177603", "AffiliationID": "60027245", "AffiliationName": "G\u00e9oscience Environnement Toulouse, CNRS-UPS-OMP"}, "35280527300": {"Name": "Oelkers E.H.", "AuthorID": "35280527300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, UCL"}, "7202856527": {"Name": "Jordan G.", "AuthorID": "7202856527", "AffiliationID": "60028717", "AffiliationName": "Dept. f\u00fcr Geo- und Umweltwissenschaften, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen"}}}
