Even though the 3D scanning of human remains in archaeology has been conducted for over 10 years, it is still frequently considered as a new field. Despite this, the availability of 3D scanning equipment and the number of studies employing these methods are increasing rapidly, and it is arguably damaging to the validity of this field to continue to consider these methods new and therefore not subject to the same standardisations as other researches. This paper considers the current issues regarding the lack of standardisation in the methods, ethics, and ownership of 3D digital data with a focus on human remains research. The aim of this paper is to stimulate further research and discussion, allowing this field to develop, improving the quality and value of future research.", "AuthorKeywords": ["3D digitising", "Ethics", "Geometric morphometric", "Observer error", "Ownership", "Reconstruction", "Standardisation"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85050545093", "SubjectAreas": [["Archeology (arts and humanities)", "ARTS", "1204"]], "AuthorData": {"57201737821": {"Name": "Hirst C.", "AuthorID": "57201737821", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Archaeology, University College London"}, "56155078800": {"Name": "White S.", "AuthorID": "56155078800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Archaeology, University College London"}, "57202717950": {"Name": "Smith S.", "AuthorID": "57202717950", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Security and Crime Science, University College London"}}}
