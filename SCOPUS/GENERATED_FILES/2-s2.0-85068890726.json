Aim: To evaluate the interactive associations of age and body mass index (BMI) with hydration and density of FFM. Methods: Data from subjects aged between 4 and 22 years old from several studies conducted in London, UK were assessed. Hydration (HFFM) and density (DFFM) of FFM obtained from the four-component model in 936 and 905 individuals, respectively, were assessed. BMI was converted in to z-scores, and categorised into five groups using z-score cut-offs (thin, normal weight, overweight, obese, and severely obese). Linear regression models for HFFM and DFFM were developed using age, sex, and BMI group as predictors. Results: Nearly 30% of the variability in HFFM was explained by models including age and BMI groups, showing increasing HFFM values in heavier BMI groups. On the other hand, \u223c40% of variability in DFFM was explained by age, sex, and BMI groups, with DFFM values decreasing in association with higher BMI group. Conclusion: Nutritional status should be considered when assessing body composition using two-component methods, and reference data for HFFM and DFFM is needed for higher BMI groups to avoid bias. Further research is needed to explain intra-individual variability in FFM properties.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Age Factors", "Body Composition", "Body Mass Index", "Body Water", "Body Weight", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Female", "Humans", "London", "Male", "Nutrition Disorders", "Organism Hydration Status", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85068890726", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (miscellaneous)", "MEDI", "2701"], ["Nutrition and Dietetics", "NURS", "2916"]], "AuthorData": {"57206697519": {"Name": "Guti\u00e9rrez-Mar\u00edn D.", "AuthorID": "57206697519", "AffiliationID": "60029812, 60022415", "AffiliationName": "Pediatric Nutrition and Human Development Research Unit, Universitat Rovira i Virgili, IISPV"}, "6506294436": {"Name": "Luque V.", "AuthorID": "6506294436", "AffiliationID": "60029812, 60022415", "AffiliationName": "Pediatric Nutrition and Human Development Research Unit, Universitat Rovira i Virgili, IISPV"}, "7003304999": {"Name": "Ferr\u00e9 N.", "AuthorID": "7003304999", "AffiliationID": "60029812, 60022415", "AffiliationName": "Pediatric Nutrition and Human Development Research Unit, Universitat Rovira i Virgili, IISPV"}, "7004016103": {"Name": "Fewtrell M.S.", "AuthorID": "7004016103", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Childhood Nutrition Research Centre, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "8652540000": {"Name": "Williams J.E.", "AuthorID": "8652540000", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Childhood Nutrition Research Centre, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "55603815000": {"Name": "Wells J.C.K.", "AuthorID": "55603815000", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Childhood Nutrition Research Centre, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}}}
