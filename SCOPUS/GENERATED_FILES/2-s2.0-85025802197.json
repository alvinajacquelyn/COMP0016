Eighty-eight social drinkers were randomly allocated to either an alcohol self-dosing or a sober condition. The study assessed both retrograde facilitation and alcohol induced memory impairment using two independent tasks. In the retrograde task, participants learnt information in their own homes, and then consumed alcohol ad libitum. Participants then undertook an anterograde memory task of alcohol impairment when intoxicated. Both memory tasks were completed again the following day. Mean amount of alcohol consumed was 82.59 grams over the evening. For the retrograde task, as predicted, both conditions exhibited similar performance on the memory task immediately following learning (before intoxication) yet performance was better when tested the morning after encoding in the alcohol condition only. The anterograde task did not reveal significant differences in memory performance post-drinking. Units of alcohol drunk were positively correlated with the amount of retrograde facilitation the following morning. These findings demonstrate the retrograde facilitation effect in a naturalistic setting, and found it to be related to the self-administered grams of alcohol.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Alcohol Drinking", "Alcoholic Intoxication", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Memory", "Set (Psychology)", "Social Environment", "Visual Perception", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85025802197", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"57195148225": {"Name": "Carlyle M.", "AuthorID": "57195148225", "AffiliationID": "60026479", "AffiliationName": "Psychopharmacology and Addiction Research Centre (PARC), University of Exeter"}, "6508277052": {"Name": "Dumay N.", "AuthorID": "6508277052", "AffiliationID": "60111834", "AffiliationName": "BCBL, Basque Center on Cognition, Brain and Language"}, "57195150617": {"Name": "Roberts K.", "AuthorID": "57195150617", "AffiliationID": "60026479", "AffiliationName": "Psychopharmacology and Addiction Research Centre (PARC), University of Exeter"}, "55332655000": {"Name": "McAndrew A.", "AuthorID": "55332655000", "AffiliationID": "60026479", "AffiliationName": "Psychopharmacology and Addiction Research Centre (PARC), University of Exeter"}, "55804860800": {"Name": "Stevens T.", "AuthorID": "55804860800", "AffiliationID": "60026479", "AffiliationName": "Psychopharmacology and Addiction Research Centre (PARC), University of Exeter"}, "56288079700": {"Name": "Lawn W.", "AuthorID": "56288079700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Psychopharmacology Unit, University College London"}, "57204536028": {"Name": "Morgan C.", "AuthorID": "57204536028", "AffiliationID": "60026479", "AffiliationName": "Psychopharmacology and Addiction Research Centre (PARC), University of Exeter"}}}
