We first explain the concept of a generic evolutionary urban unit (\"city\") and its necessary adaptations to the information provided by each national statistical system. Second, the hierarchical structure and the urban growth process are compared at macroscale for the seven countries with reference to Zipf's and Gibrat's model: in agreement with an evolutionary theory of urban systems, large similarities shape the hierarchical structure and growth processes in BRICS countries as well as in Europe and United States, despite their positions at different stages in the urban transition that explain some structural peculiarities. Third, the individual trajectories of some 10,000 cities are mapped at microscale following a cluster analysis of their evolution over the last fifty years. A few common principles extracted from the evolutionary theory of urban systems can explain the diversity of these trajectories, including a specific pattern in their geographical repartition in the Chinese case. We conclude that the observations at macrolevel when summarized as stylised facts can help in designing simulation models of urban systems whereas the urban trajectories identified at microlevel are consistent enough for constituting the basis of plausible future population projections.", "AuthorKeywords": ["BRICS", "Cities trajectories", "Gibrat", "Urban systems", "Zipf"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84928990139", "SubjectAreas": [["Social Sciences (miscellaneous)", "SOCI", "3301"]], "AuthorData": {"7004221991": {"Name": "Pumain D.", "AuthorID": "7004221991", "AffiliationID": "60021260", "AffiliationName": "Universit\u00e9 Paris i"}, "11339648800": {"Name": "Bretagnolle A.", "AuthorID": "11339648800", "AffiliationID": "60021260", "AffiliationName": "Universit\u00e9 Paris i"}, "36651666300": {"Name": "Swerts E.", "AuthorID": "36651666300", "AffiliationID": "60008134", "AffiliationName": "CNRS, UMR G\u00e9ographiecit\u00e9s"}, "54392627400": {"Name": "Cottineau C.", "AuthorID": "54392627400", "AffiliationID": "60008134", "AffiliationName": "CNRS, UMR G\u00e9ographiecit\u00e9s"}, "56625988500": {"Name": "Ignazzi A.", "AuthorID": "56625988500", "AffiliationID": "60008134", "AffiliationName": "CNRS, UMR G\u00e9ographiecit\u00e9s"}, "56624591100": {"Name": "Cura R.", "AuthorID": "56624591100", "AffiliationID": "60008134", "AffiliationName": "CNRS, UMR G\u00e9ographiecit\u00e9s"}, "56625821000": {"Name": "Lizzi L.", "AuthorID": "56625821000", "AffiliationID": "60008134", "AffiliationName": "CNRS, UMR G\u00e9ographiecit\u00e9s"}, "56626166500": {"Name": "Baffi S.", "AuthorID": "56626166500", "AffiliationID": "60008134", "AffiliationName": "CNRS, UMR G\u00e9ographiecit\u00e9s"}, "6507324893": {"Name": "Vacchiani-Marcuzzo C.", "AuthorID": "6507324893", "AffiliationID": "60019394", "AffiliationName": "University of Reims"}, "36468104800": {"Name": "Delisle F.", "AuthorID": "36468104800", "AffiliationID": "60032922", "AffiliationName": "University of Rouen"}}}
