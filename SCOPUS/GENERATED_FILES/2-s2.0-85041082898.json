Despite an initial therapeutic response, Cisplatin treatment often results in the development of chemoresistance. To identify novel approaches to overcome Cisplatin resistance, we tested Cisplatin in combination with K + channel modulators on colorectal cancer (CRC) cells.Methods:The functional expression of Ca 2+ -activated (K Ca 3.1, also known as KCNN4) and voltage-dependent (K v 11.1, also known as KCNH2 or hERG1) K + channels was determined in two CRC cell lines (HCT-116 and HCT-8) by molecular and electrophysiological techniques. Cisplatin and several K + channel modulators were tested in vitro for their action on K + currents, cell vitality, apoptosis, cell cycle, proliferation, intracellular signalling and Platinum uptake. These effects were also analysed in a mouse model mimicking Cisplatin resistance.Results:Cisplatin-resistant CRC cells expressed higher levels of K Ca 3.1 and K v 11.1 channels, compared with Cisplatin-sensitive CRC cells. In resistant cells, K Ca 3.1 activators (SKA-31) and K v 11.1 inhibitors (E4031) had a synergistic action with Cisplatin in triggering apoptosis and inhibiting proliferation. The effect was maximal when K Ca 3.1 activation and K v 11.1 inhibition were combined. In fact, similar results were produced by Riluzole, which is able to both activate K Ca 3.1 and inhibit K v 11.1. Cisplatin uptake into resistant cells depended on K Ca 3.1 channel activity, as it was potentiated by K Ca 3.1 activators. K v 11.1 blockade led to increased K Ca 3.1 expression and thereby stimulated Cisplatin uptake. Finally, the combined administration of a K Ca 3.1 activator and a K v 11.1 inhibitor also overcame Cisplatin resistance in vivo.Conclusions:As Riluzole, an activator of K Ca 3.1 and inhibitor of K v 11.1 channels, is in clinical use, our results suggest that this compound may be useful in the clinic to improve Cisplatin efficacy and overcome Cisplatin resistance in CRC.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Apoptosis", "Benzothiazoles", "Cell Cycle", "Cell Line, Tumor", "Cell Survival", "Cisplatin", "Colorectal Neoplasms", "Drug Resistance, Neoplasm", "Drug Synergism", "ERG1 Potassium Channel", "HCT116 Cells", "HT29 Cells", "Humans", "Inhibitory Concentration 50", "Intermediate-Conductance Calcium-Activated Potassium Channels", "Mice", "Potassium Channel Blockers", "Pyrazoles", "Riluzole"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85041082898", "SubjectAreas": [["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Cancer Research", "BIOC", "1306"]], "AuthorData": {"6506263511": {"Name": "Pillozzi S.", "AuthorID": "6506263511", "AffiliationID": "60021859", "AffiliationName": "Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, Section of Internal Medicine, University of Florence"}, "56770846900": {"Name": "Bartoli G.", "AuthorID": "56770846900", "AffiliationID": "60021859", "AffiliationName": "Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, Section of Internal Medicine, University of Florence"}, "55632515700": {"Name": "Gasparoli L.", "AuthorID": "55632515700", "AffiliationID": "60021859", "AffiliationName": "Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, Section of Internal Medicine, University of Florence"}, "55260079000": {"Name": "Petroni G.", "AuthorID": "55260079000", "AffiliationID": "60021859", "AffiliationName": "Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, Section of Internal Medicine, University of Florence"}, "6602155003": {"Name": "Crociani O.", "AuthorID": "6602155003", "AffiliationID": "60021859", "AffiliationName": "Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, Section of Internal Medicine, University of Florence"}, "57200378624": {"Name": "Guerriero A.", "AuthorID": "57200378624", "AffiliationID": "60021859", "AffiliationName": "Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, Section of Internal Medicine, University of Florence"}, "7006479347": {"Name": "Arcangeli A.", "AuthorID": "7006479347", "AffiliationID": "60021859", "AffiliationName": "Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, Section of Internal Medicine, University of Florence"}, "8530591700": {"Name": "D'Amico M.", "AuthorID": "8530591700", "AffiliationID": "113987066", "AffiliationName": "DIVAL Toscana Srl"}, "55970061900": {"Name": "Marzo T.", "AuthorID": "55970061900", "AffiliationID": "60028868", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry and Industrial Chemistry (DCCI), University of Pisa"}, "7004898334": {"Name": "Messori L.", "AuthorID": "7004898334", "AffiliationID": "60021859", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Metals in Medicine (MetMed), Department of Chemistry, University of Florence"}, "7003468792": {"Name": "Severi M.", "AuthorID": "7003468792", "AffiliationID": "60021859", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Florence"}, "7003745922": {"Name": "Udisti R.", "AuthorID": "7003745922", "AffiliationID": "60021859", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Florence"}, "7102828660": {"Name": "Wulff H.", "AuthorID": "7102828660", "AffiliationID": "60014439", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacology, University of California"}, "7103379279": {"Name": "Chandy K.", "AuthorID": "7103379279", "AffiliationID": "60005510, 60118633", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Molecular Physiology in the Infection and Immunity Theme, Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine, Nanyang Technological University"}, "6701563016": {"Name": "Becchetti A.", "AuthorID": "6701563016", "AffiliationID": "60012306", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biotechnology and Biosciences, University of Milano-Bicocca"}}}
