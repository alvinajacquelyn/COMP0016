The indicator generates a plausible distribution of graduate occupations and explains graduates' wages and job satisfaction better than hitherto existing indicators. Unlike with the traditional classifier, several jobs in major group 3 \"Technicians and Associate Professionals\" require higher education in many countries. Altogether, almost a third of labor is deployed in graduate jobs in the 31 countries, but with large cross-national differences. Industry and establishment-size composition can account for some of the variation. In addition, two indicators of the relative quality of the higher education system also contribute to the variation in the prevalence of graduate jobs across countries.", "AuthorKeywords": ["graduate job", "Graduate labor market", "higher education", "labor demand", "OECD", "skill"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85019417763", "SubjectAreas": [["Industrial Relations", "BUSI", "1410"], ["Economics and Econometrics", "ECON", "2002"], ["Political Science and International Relations", "SOCI", "3320"]], "AuthorData": {"55962784400": {"Name": "Henseke G.", "AuthorID": "55962784400", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Education, University College London"}, "35467454700": {"Name": "Green F.", "AuthorID": "35467454700", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Education, University College London"}}}
