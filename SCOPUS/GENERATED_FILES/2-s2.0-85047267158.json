Due to the exceptional diversity observed at the eastern borders of Europe and the low number of available sequences from Central Eastern European countries, the authors collected and analyzed both recent as well as already submitted sequences comparing them to a large backbone set of available ORF5 sequences representing the full spectrum of PRRSV 1 Subtype 1 diversity to conduct a systematic phylogenetic analysis and reclassification elucidating the diversity of the virus in these countries. Moreover, further analyses of the EUROSTAT data regarding the live pig movement trends revealed their influence of virus diversity and evolution. The results indicate that besides the effect of local, isolated divergent evolution and the use of modified live vaccines, the most important factor influencing a given country's virus diversity is the transboundary movement of live, infected animals.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["DNA, Viral", "Europe, Eastern", "Evolution, Molecular", "Genetic Variation", "Phylogeny", "Phylogeography", "Porcine respiratory and reproductive syndrome virus"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85047267158", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"23059802300": {"Name": "Balka G.", "AuthorID": "23059802300", "AffiliationID": "60005223", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, University of Veterinary Medicine"}, "57202132552": {"Name": "D\u00e9nes L.", "AuthorID": "57202132552", "AffiliationID": "60005223", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, University of Veterinary Medicine"}, "12799152900": {"Name": "Podg\u00f3rska K.", "AuthorID": "12799152900", "AffiliationID": "60072257", "AffiliationName": "National Veterinary Research Institute"}, "44161059200": {"Name": "Brar M.S.", "AuthorID": "44161059200", "AffiliationID": "60006541", "AffiliationName": "University of Hong Kong"}, "55440652300": {"Name": "Leung F.C.C.", "AuthorID": "55440652300", "AffiliationID": "60006541", "AffiliationName": "University of Hong Kong"}, "8308795400": {"Name": "B\u00e1lint \u00c1.", "AuthorID": "8308795400", "AffiliationID": "60105221", "AffiliationName": "National Food Chain Safety Office Veterinary Diagnostic Directorate"}, "57202132926": {"Name": "Szalay D.", "AuthorID": "57202132926", "AffiliationID": "60105221", "AffiliationName": "National Food Chain Safety Office Veterinary Diagnostic Directorate"}, "16424743500": {"Name": "Cadar D.", "AuthorID": "16424743500", "AffiliationID": "60020135", "AffiliationName": "Arbovirology, Bernhard Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine, WHO Collaborating Centre for Arbovirus and Haemorrhagic Fever Reference, Research National Reference Centre for Tropical Infectious Diseases"}, "7003290169": {"Name": "Celer V.", "AuthorID": "7003290169", "AffiliationID": "60020771", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Institute of Infectious Diseases and Microbiology, University of Veterinary and Pharmaceutical Sciences Brno"}, "24773289000": {"Name": "Dirbakova Z.", "AuthorID": "24773289000", "AffiliationID": "113264227", "AffiliationName": "Veterinary Institute Zvolen"}, "57202130528": {"Name": "Jedryczko A.", "AuthorID": "57202130528", "AffiliationID": "115776902", "AffiliationName": "Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory, Ostr\u00f3dzka"}, "15127459800": {"Name": "M\u00e1rton L.", "AuthorID": "15127459800", "AffiliationID": "60105221", "AffiliationName": "National Food Chain Safety Office Animal Health and Animal Welfare Directorate"}, "15763278600": {"Name": "Novosel D.", "AuthorID": "15763278600", "AffiliationID": "60087170, 60008408", "AffiliationName": "University of Zagreb, Faculty of Agriculture, Department of Animal Science"}, "7003451799": {"Name": "Petrovi\u0107 T.", "AuthorID": "7003451799", "AffiliationID": "106595965", "AffiliationName": "Scientific Veterinary Institute Novi Sad"}, "37105082100": {"Name": "Sirakov I.", "AuthorID": "37105082100", "AffiliationID": "60028054", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Microbiology, Faculty of Medicine, Medical University of Sofia"}, "55992040800": {"Name": "Toplak I.", "AuthorID": "55992040800", "AffiliationID": "60031106", "AffiliationName": "University of Ljubljana, Veterinary Faculty, National Veterinary Institute"}, "7004484127": {"Name": "Stadejek T.", "AuthorID": "7004484127", "AffiliationID": "60085173", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology and Veterinary Diagnostics, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Warsaw University of Life Sciences - SGGW"}}}
