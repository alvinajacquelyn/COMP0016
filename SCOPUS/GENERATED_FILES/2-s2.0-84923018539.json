In its simplest form, bone tissue engineering (BTE) combines cells and scaffolds in vitro to replace damaged or lost bone in vivo. Our aim was to develop BTE porous TiAl6V4 constructs with a calcium-phosphate coating without or with mesenchy-mal stem cells (MSCs) seeded throughout the entire porous structure to enhance new bone formation and which could be used for rTHRs. Porous titanium scaffolds made by selective laser sintering were seeded throughout with autologous bone marrow MSCs and cultured in a perfusion bioreactor. Constructs were implanted in the medial femoral condyle of 20 skeletally mature mule sheep with and without a gap of 2.5 mm between the construct and the host bone. After 6 weeks, the addition of MSCs to the scaffolds did not significantly increase osseointegration or implant-bone fixation strength. However, in the defects with a gap, the cellularized constructs showed higher implant-bone contact area and implant-bone fixation strength. BTE can be applied to develop acellular or cellularized constructs with clinical application in rTHRs where a lack of bone stock is problematic.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bone fixation strength", "Bone tissue engineering", "Implant", "In vivo", "Mesenchymal stem cells", "Osseointegration"], "IndexKeywords": ["Bone fixation", "Bone tissue engineering", "In-vivo", "Mesenchymal stem cell", "Osseointegration", "Alloys", "Animals", "Bone Substitutes", "Cells, Cultured", "Female", "Femur", "Mesenchymal Stromal Cells", "Osseointegration", "Porosity", "Sheep", "Tissue Engineering", "Tissue Scaffolds"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84923018539", "SubjectAreas": [["Ceramics and Composites", "MATE", "2503"], ["Biomaterials", "MATE", "2502"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"], ["Metals and Alloys", "MATE", "2506"]], "AuthorData": {"55375422500": {"Name": "Garc\u00eda-Gareta E.", "AuthorID": "55375422500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "John Scales Centre for Biomedical Engineering, Institute of Orthopaedics and Musculoskeletal Science, University College London"}, "20234546200": {"Name": "Hua J.", "AuthorID": "20234546200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "John Scales Centre for Biomedical Engineering, Institute of Orthopaedics and Musculoskeletal Science, University College London"}, "7004735871": {"Name": "Blunn G.", "AuthorID": "7004735871", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "John Scales Centre for Biomedical Engineering, Institute of Orthopaedics and Musculoskeletal Science, University College London"}}}
