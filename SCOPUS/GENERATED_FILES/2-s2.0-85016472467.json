The DesignLAK17 workshop builds on the DesignLAK16 workshop to explore one aspect of this theme, namely the opportunities arising from the use of analytics in scaled assessment design. New paradigms for learning design are exploiting the distinctive characteristics and potentials of analytics, trace data and newer kinds of sensory data usable on digital platforms to transform assessment. But, characteristics of quality assessment design need to be reconsidered, and new metrics for capturing quality are required. This symposium and workshop focuses on what might be appropriate quality metrics and indicators for assessment design in scaled learning. It aims to build a community of interest round the topic, to share perspectives, and to generate design and research ideas.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Assessment", "Feedback", "Learning analytics", "Learning at scale", "Learning design", "Scaled courses"], "IndexKeywords": ["Assessment", "Learning analytics", "Learning at scale", "Learning designs", "Scaled courses"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85016472467", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Human-Computer Interaction", "COMP", "1709"], ["Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition", "COMP", "1707"], ["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"]], "AuthorData": {"57190013070": {"Name": "Ringtved U.", "AuthorID": "57190013070", "AffiliationID": "60022134, 60136268", "AffiliationName": "Aalborg University, University College Northern Denmark"}, "56964823400": {"Name": "Milligan S.", "AuthorID": "56964823400", "AffiliationID": "60026553", "AffiliationName": "University of Melbourne"}, "36678796600": {"Name": "Corrin L.", "AuthorID": "36678796600", "AffiliationID": "60026553", "AffiliationName": "University of Melbourne, Elisabeth Murdoch Building"}, "7005935975": {"Name": "Littlejohn A.", "AuthorID": "7005935975", "AffiliationID": "60012113", "AffiliationName": "Open University, Walton Hall"}, "7005934146": {"Name": "Law N.", "AuthorID": "7005934146", "AffiliationID": "60006541", "AffiliationName": "University of Hong Kong"}}}
