This contextual information is explored at the classifier level in the proposed patient-independent neonatal seizure detection system. The system is based on the combination of a static and a sequential SVM classifier. A Gaussian dynamic time warping based kernel is used in the sequential classifier. The system is validated on a large dataset of EEG recordings from 17 neonates. The obtained results show an increase in the detection rate at very low false detections per hour, particularly achieving a 12% improvement in the detection of short seizure events over the static RBF kernel based system.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Automated neonatal seizure detection", "Fusion", "Gaussian dynamic time warping", "Sequential classifier"], "IndexKeywords": ["Contextual information", "Detection rates", "Dynamic time warping", "False detections", "Neonatal seizure", "nocv1", "Sequential classifier", "SVM classifiers", "Temporal information", "Algorithms", "Computer Simulation", "Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted", "Electrocardiography", "Epilepsy, Benign Neonatal", "Female", "Humans", "Infant, Newborn", "Male", "Models, Statistical", "Pattern Recognition, Automated", "Reproducibility of Results", "Sensitivity and Specificity", "Spatio-Temporal Analysis", "Support Vector Machine"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85011360775", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Health Informatics", "MEDI", "2718"]], "AuthorData": {"57193818940": {"Name": "Ahmed R.", "AuthorID": "57193818940", "AffiliationID": "60025160", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University College Cork"}, "12143283200": {"Name": "Temko A.", "AuthorID": "12143283200", "AffiliationID": "60025160", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University College Cork"}, "36832339300": {"Name": "Marnane W.", "AuthorID": "36832339300", "AffiliationID": "60025160", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University College Cork"}, "6602292136": {"Name": "Boylan G.", "AuthorID": "6602292136", "AffiliationID": "60025160", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatrics and Child Health, University College Cork"}, "7003406304": {"Name": "Lightbody G.", "AuthorID": "7003406304", "AffiliationID": "60025160", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University College Cork"}}}
