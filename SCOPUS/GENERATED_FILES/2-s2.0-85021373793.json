All rights reserved.The study and preservation of cultural heritage is a multidisciplinary field where Materials Science and Corrosion Science have a very significant role to play. This chapter discusses how materials and corrosion scientists can follow a career in cultural heritage. It highlights the particular challenges that these disciplines encounter in the study and preservation of cultural heritage materials and the exciting career paths offered in museums, monuments, and relevant academic and research institutions. The applications for science and engineering skills to cultural materials are diverse, including the reverse engineering necessary to reconstruct ancient technologies used for materials production, the examination and condition assessment of often complex finds and structures, and the development of innovative treatment methods for their protection and conservation for future generations. Within this range of challenges and materials, numerous career paths are available that lead to specialisations within the sub-fields of archaeological science and conservation science.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Ancient technologies", "Condition assessments", "Conservation science", "Corrosion engineers", "Materials production", "Materials scientist", "Research institutions", "Science and engineering"], "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85021373793", "SubjectAreas": [["Engineering (all)", "ENGI", "2200"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"]], "AuthorData": {"56464308300": {"Name": "Golfomitsou S.", "AuthorID": "56464308300", "AffiliationID": "60107608", "AffiliationName": "UCL Qatar"}, "14719256100": {"Name": "Georgakopoulou M.", "AuthorID": "14719256100", "AffiliationID": "60107608", "AffiliationName": "UCL Qatar"}, "57202699283": {"Name": "Rehren T.", "AuthorID": "57202699283", "AffiliationID": "60107608", "AffiliationName": "UCL Qatar"}}}
