Experimental Design: Plasma samples from patients with known tumor mutations who completed at least two courses of investigational targeted therapy were collected monthly, until disease progression. NGS was performed sequentially on the Ion Torrent PGM platform. Results: cfDNA was extracted from 39 patients with various tumor types. Treatments administered targeted mainly the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway (n = 28) or MEK (n = 7). Overall, 159 plasma samples were sequenced with a mean sequencing coverage achieved of 1,685X across experiments. At trial initiation (C1D1), 23 of 39 (59%) patients had at least one mutation identified in cfDNA (mean 2, range 1-5). Out of the 44 mutations identified at C1D1, TP53, PIK3CA and KRAS were the top 3 mutated genes identified, with 18 (41%), 9 (20%), 8 (18%) different mutations, respectively. Out of these 23 patients, 13 received a targeted drug matching their tumor profile. For the 23 patients with cfDNA mutation at C1D1, the monitoring of mutation allele frequency (AF) in consecutive plasma samples during treatment with targeted drugs demonstrated potential treatment associated clonal responses. Longitudinal monitoring of cfDNA samples with multiple mutations indicated the presence of separate clones behaving discordantly. Molecular changes at cfDNA mutation level were associated with time to disease progression by RECIST criteria. Conclusions: Targeted NGS of cfDNA has potential clinical utility to monitor the delivery of targeted therapies.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Biomarkers, Tumor", "Disease Progression", "DNA, Complementary", "DNA, Neoplasm", "Female", "High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Mutation", "Neoplastic Cells, Circulating", "Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases", "Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt", "ras Proteins", "TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84940095522", "SubjectAreas": [["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Cancer Research", "BIOC", "1306"]], "AuthorData": {"24343508800": {"Name": "Frenel J.", "AuthorID": "24343508800", "AffiliationID": "113137085", "AffiliationName": "Institut de Cancerologie de l'Ouest"}, "6602425583": {"Name": "Carreira S.", "AuthorID": "6602425583", "AffiliationID": "60010337, 60027057", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cancer Research, Royal Marsden Hospital"}, "57197581529": {"Name": "Goodall J.", "AuthorID": "57197581529", "AffiliationID": "60010337, 60027057", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cancer Research, Royal Marsden Hospital"}, "24830846100": {"Name": "Roda D.", "AuthorID": "24830846100", "AffiliationID": "60010337, 60027057", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cancer Research, Royal Marsden Hospital"}, "56407039900": {"Name": "Perez-Lopez R.", "AuthorID": "56407039900", "AffiliationID": "60010337, 60027057", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cancer Research, Royal Marsden Hospital"}, "8639840600": {"Name": "Tunariu N.", "AuthorID": "8639840600", "AffiliationID": "60010337, 60027057", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cancer Research, Royal Marsden Hospital"}, "26635975400": {"Name": "Riisnaes R.", "AuthorID": "26635975400", "AffiliationID": "60010337, 60027057", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cancer Research, Royal Marsden Hospital"}, "55141006200": {"Name": "Miranda S.", "AuthorID": "55141006200", "AffiliationID": "60010337, 60027057", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cancer Research, Royal Marsden Hospital"}, "55538443000": {"Name": "Figueiredo I.", "AuthorID": "55538443000", "AffiliationID": "60010337, 60027057", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cancer Research, Royal Marsden Hospital"}, "55939405200": {"Name": "Nava-Rodrigues D.", "AuthorID": "55939405200", "AffiliationID": "60010337, 60027057", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cancer Research, Royal Marsden Hospital"}, "55740333000": {"Name": "Smith A.", "AuthorID": "55740333000", "AffiliationID": "60010337, 60027057", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cancer Research, Royal Marsden Hospital"}, "8608957100": {"Name": "Ferraldeschi R.", "AuthorID": "8608957100", "AffiliationID": "60010337, 60027057", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cancer Research, Royal Marsden Hospital"}, "55944529300": {"Name": "Lorente D.", "AuthorID": "55944529300", "AffiliationID": "60010337, 60027057", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cancer Research, Royal Marsden Hospital"}, "36903103900": {"Name": "Mateo J.", "AuthorID": "36903103900", "AffiliationID": "60010337, 60027057", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cancer Research, Royal Marsden Hospital"}, "55877515900": {"Name": "Ong M.", "AuthorID": "55877515900", "AffiliationID": "60010337, 60027057", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cancer Research, Royal Marsden Hospital"}, "17136556700": {"Name": "Yap T.", "AuthorID": "17136556700", "AffiliationID": "60010337, 60027057", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cancer Research, Royal Marsden Hospital"}, "24072863400": {"Name": "Banerji U.", "AuthorID": "24072863400", "AffiliationID": "60010337, 60027057", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cancer Research, Royal Marsden Hospital"}, "56242730200": {"Name": "Tandefelt D.", "AuthorID": "56242730200", "AffiliationID": "60010337, 60027057", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cancer Research, Royal Marsden Hospital"}, "9740870900": {"Name": "Attard G.", "AuthorID": "9740870900", "AffiliationID": "60010337, 60027057", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cancer Research, Royal Marsden Hospital"}, "7003906526": {"Name": "De Bono J.", "AuthorID": "7003906526", "AffiliationID": "60010337, 60027057", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cancer Research, Royal Marsden Hospital"}, "24175921100": {"Name": "Leux C.", "AuthorID": "24175921100", "AffiliationID": "60028048", "AffiliationName": "D\u00e9partement de Sant\u00e9 Publique, CHU de Nantes"}, "8407992500": {"Name": "Garcia-Murillas I.", "AuthorID": "8407992500", "AffiliationID": "60010337", "AffiliationName": "Breakthrough Breast Cancer Research Centre, Institute of Cancer Research"}, "35331494900": {"Name": "Turner N.", "AuthorID": "35331494900", "AffiliationID": "60010337", "AffiliationName": "Breakthrough Breast Cancer Research Centre, Institute of Cancer Research"}}}
