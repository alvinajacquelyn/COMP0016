In cerebellar slices, KA (3 \u00b5M) increased the amplitude of evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents (eEPSCs) at synapses between axon terminals of parallel fibers (PF) and Purkinje neurons. KA-mediated facilitation was antagonized by NBQX under condition where AMPA receptors were previously antagonized. Inhibition of protein kinase A (PKA) suppressed the effect of KA on glutamate release, which was also obviated by the prior stimulation of adenylyl cyclase (AC). KAR-mediated facilitation of synaptic transmission was prevented by blocking Ca2+ permeant KARs using philanthotoxin. Furthermore, depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores by thapsigargin, or inhibition of Ca2+-induced Ca2+-release by ryanodine, abrogated the synaptic facilitation by KA. Thus, the KA-mediated modulation was conditional on extracellular Ca2+ entry through Ca2+-permeable KARs, as well as and mobilization of Ca2+ from intracellular stores. Finally, KAR-mediated facilitation was sensitive to calmodulin inhibitors, W-7 and calmidazolium, indicating that the increased cytosolic [Ca2+] sustaining KAR-mediated facilitation of synaptic transmission operates through a downstream Ca2+/calmodulin coupling. We conclude that, at cerebellar parallel fiber-Purkinje cell synapses, presynaptic KARs mediate glutamate release facilitation, and thereby enhance synaptic transmission through Ca2+-calmodulin dependent activation of adenylyl cyclase/cAMP/protein kinase A signaling.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Ca2+-calmodulin", "Glutamate", "Kainate receptors", "PKA", "Presynaptic", "Slices"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85049025568", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"]], "AuthorData": {"57202647389": {"Name": "Falc\u00f3n-Moya R.", "AuthorID": "57202647389", "AffiliationID": "60030114", "AffiliationName": "Laboratorio de Neurociencia Celular y Plasticidad, Departamento de Fisiolog\u00eda, Anatom\u00eda y Biolog\u00eda Celular, Universidad Pablo de Olavide"}, "57202683418": {"Name": "Losada-Ruiz P.", "AuthorID": "57202683418", "AffiliationID": "60030114", "AffiliationName": "Laboratorio de Neurociencia Celular y Plasticidad, Departamento de Fisiolog\u00eda, Anatom\u00eda y Biolog\u00eda Celular, Universidad Pablo de Olavide"}, "6602385573": {"Name": "Rodr\u00edguez-Moreno A.", "AuthorID": "6602385573", "AffiliationID": "60030114", "AffiliationName": "Laboratorio de Neurociencia Celular y Plasticidad, Departamento de Fisiolog\u00eda, Anatom\u00eda y Biolog\u00eda Celular, Universidad Pablo de Olavide"}, "7004464898": {"Name": "Sihra T.", "AuthorID": "7004464898", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physiology, Pharmacology and Neuroscience, University College London"}}}
