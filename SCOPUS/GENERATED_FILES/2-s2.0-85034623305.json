The films are highly nanostructured anatase-rutile TiO2 composite films with unique single crystal dendrites. After annealing, carbon was removed, and materials showed improved water splitting activity; with IPCEs above 80% in the UV, photocurrents of \u223c1.2 mA cm\u22122 at 1.23 VRHE at 1 sun irradiance and an extension of photoactivity into the visible range. The annealed material exhibits minimal recombination losses and IPCEs amongst the highest reported in the literature; attributed to the formation of a high surface area nanostructured material and synergetic interactions between the anatase and rutile phases.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Anatase-rutile heterojunctions", "Nanostructured photoelectrodes", "PP-MOCVD", "Solar water splitting", "Titanium dioxide (TiO2)"], "IndexKeywords": ["Annealed materials", "High surface area", "Metal organic chemical vapour depositions", "Photo-electrodes", "Recombination loss", "Solar water splitting", "Synergetic interactions", "Titanium dioxides (TiO2)"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85034623305", "SubjectAreas": [["Catalysis", "CENG", "1503"], ["Environmental Science (all)", "ENVI", "2300"], ["Process Chemistry and Technology", "CENG", "1508"]], "AuthorData": {"56790109900": {"Name": "Gardecka A.", "AuthorID": "56790109900", "AffiliationID": "60020585", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Canterbury"}, "7202946348": {"Name": "Bishop C.", "AuthorID": "7202946348", "AffiliationID": "60020585", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Canterbury"}, "6601976510": {"Name": "Krumdieck S.", "AuthorID": "6601976510", "AffiliationID": "60020585", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Canterbury"}, "55778385900": {"Name": "Lee D.", "AuthorID": "55778385900", "AffiliationID": "113704319", "AffiliationName": "Koti Technologies Limited"}, "56217400400": {"Name": "Parkin I.", "AuthorID": "56217400400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Materials Chemistry Centre, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "57197770394": {"Name": "Corby S.", "AuthorID": "57197770394", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Imperial College London, South Kensington"}, "26039181400": {"Name": "Kafizas A.", "AuthorID": "26039181400", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Imperial College London, South Kensington"}}}
