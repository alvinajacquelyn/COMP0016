Research in this domain is, however, typically conducted with musically trained individuals, and therefore confounded with expertise. Here, we present a rediscovered and updated invention\u2014the E-music box\u2014that we establish as an empirical method to investigate musical production and interaction in everyone. The E-music box transforms rotatory cyclical movements into pre-programmable digital musical output, with tempo varying according to rotation speed. The user\u2019s movements are coded as continuous oscillatory data, which can be analysed using linear or nonlinear analytical tools. We conducted a proof-of-principle experiment to demonstrate that, using this method, pairs of non-musically trained individuals can interact according to conventional musical practices (leader/follower roles and lower-pitch dominance). The results suggest that the E-music box brings \u2018active\u2019 and \u2018interactive\u2019 musical capacities within everyone\u2019s reach. We discuss the potential of this method for exploring the universal predisposition for music making and interaction in developmental and cross-cultural contexts, and for neurologic musical therapy and rehabilitation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Joint action", "Music box", "Music production", "Neurologic music therapy", "Non-musicians", "Universals"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84958078613", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"37056031000": {"Name": "Novembre G.", "AuthorID": "37056031000", "AffiliationID": "60107806, 60017803", "AffiliationName": "The MARCS Institute for Brain, Behaviour and Development, Western Sydney University"}, "36961417300": {"Name": "Varlet M.", "AuthorID": "36961417300", "AffiliationID": "60107806, 60017803", "AffiliationName": "The MARCS Institute for Brain, Behaviour and Development, Western Sydney University"}, "36609020300": {"Name": "Muawiyath S.", "AuthorID": "36609020300", "AffiliationID": "60107806, 60017803", "AffiliationName": "The MARCS Institute for Brain, Behaviour and Development, Western Sydney University"}, "7402089327": {"Name": "Stevens C.J.", "AuthorID": "7402089327", "AffiliationID": "60017803", "AffiliationName": "School of Social Sciences and Psychology, Western Sydney University"}, "7202450257": {"Name": "Keller P.E.", "AuthorID": "7202450257", "AffiliationID": "60107806, 60017803", "AffiliationName": "The MARCS Institute for Brain, Behaviour and Development, Western Sydney University"}}}
