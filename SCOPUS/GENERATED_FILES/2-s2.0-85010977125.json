Methods Four children with marked brain pathology (2 holoprosencephaly, 2 giant interhemispheric cysts with hydrocephalus) underwent pattern reversal and flash VEP recordings from 16 equally distributed electrodes. Voltage maps of the major VEP components were constructed, and their distributions were compared to the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings. Results No reproducible responses were evident in 1 case, and responses were present, but, as expected based on the MRI finding, not over the occipital electrodes in 3 cases. Thus, the standard clinical VEP electrode placement would not have detected responses. The distribution of responses during monocular testing obtained in 2 cases suggested normal decussation of the visual pathways at the chiasm, and voltage mapping indicated which part of the abnormally positioned brain tissue is functional visual cortex. Conclusions In children with markedly abnormal brain anatomy, multichannel VEP recordings can provide quantifiable measures of visual pathway function detected in atypical locations. VEPs provide a quantifiable measure of visual function that could be used to assist in determining visual acuity levels, and offered a baseline for monitoring in the context of raised intracranial pressure. These recordings were also able to identify functional anatomical structures that were not apparent on MRI. In a clinical setting, the use of additional recordings from nonstandard electrode placement based on the MRI findings is suggested.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Central Nervous System Cysts", "Child, Preschool", "Evoked Potentials, Visual", "Female", "Holoprosencephaly", "Humans", "Hydrocephalus", "Intracranial Hypertension", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Visual Acuity", "Visual Cortex", "Visual Pathways"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85010977125", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"]], "AuthorData": {"55553818000": {"Name": "Handley S.E.", "AuthorID": "55553818000", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Clinical and Academic Department of Ophthalmology, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children"}, "56119414900": {"Name": "Liasis A.C.", "AuthorID": "56119414900", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Clinical and Academic Department of Ophthalmology, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children"}}}
