Use of antepartum antiretroviral therapy (ART) for prevention of mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) and to treat maternal infection, if required, is standard practise in this population; lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) is commonly used. The study objective was to examine the use of LPV/r among pregnant women with HIV infection to describe maternal and foetal outcomes. Methods: The NSHPC study collected maternal, perinatal and paediatric data through confidential and voluntary obstetric and paediatric reporting schemes. Pregnancies reported to the NSHPC by June 2013, due to deliver 2003-2012 and with LPV/r exposure were included in this analysis, using pregnancy as the unit of observation. Results: Four thousand eight hundred sixty-four LPV/r-exposed pregnancies resulting in 4702 deliveries in 4118 women were identified. Maternal region of birth was primarily sub-Saharan Africa (77 %) or United Kingdom/Ireland (14 %). Median maternal age at conception was 30 years. LPV/r was initiated preconception in 980 (20 %) and postconception in 3884 (80 %) pregnancies; median duration of antepartum LPV/r exposure was 270 and 107 days, respectively. Viral load close to delivery was <50 copies/mL in 73 % and <1000 copies/mL in 94 % of women. 63 % of deliveries were by caesarean section (elective, 62 %; emergency, 38 %). Among singleton live births, 13 % were <37 weeks of gestation (2.5 % <32 weeks) and 15 % had birth weight <2500 g (2.3 % <1500 g). MTCT rates were 1.1 (2003-2007) and 0.5 % (2008-2012). 134 live born children (2.9 %) had \u22651 congenital abnormality. Conclusions: The results of this analysis using real-world data from a large number of pregnant women with HIV infection in the United Kingdom and Ireland who received LPV/r-containing ART regimens demonstrate that these regimens have a good safety profile and are effective for viral suppression during pregnancy, with associated low rates of MTCT.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Congenital abnormality", "HIV", "Lopinavir/ritonavir", "Pregnancy", "Vertical transmission"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Anti-HIV Agents", "Female", "HIV Infections", "Humans", "Infant, Newborn", "Infectious Disease Transmission, Vertical", "Ireland", "Lopinavir", "Population Surveillance", "Pregnancy", "Pregnancy Complications, Infectious", "Pregnancy Outcome", "Ritonavir", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84959332596", "SubjectAreas": [["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"7003314073": {"Name": "Tookey P.", "AuthorID": "7003314073", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "7101873678": {"Name": "Thorne C.", "AuthorID": "7101873678", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "24480191100": {"Name": "van Wyk J.", "AuthorID": "24480191100", "AffiliationID": "60105169", "AffiliationName": "AbbVie Inc"}, "7201553943": {"Name": "Norton M.", "AuthorID": "7201553943", "AffiliationID": "60105169", "AffiliationName": "AbbVie Inc"}}}
