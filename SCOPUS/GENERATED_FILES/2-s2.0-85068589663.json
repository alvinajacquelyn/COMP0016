They are commonly designed to accurately represent the underlying signal, regardless of the specific task to be performed on the quantized data. In systems working with high-dimensional signals, such as massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, it is beneficial to utilize low-resolution quantizers, due to cost, power, and memory constraints. In this paper, we study quantization of high-dimensional inputs, aiming at improving performance under resolution constraints by accounting for the system task in the quantizers design. We focus on the task of recovering a desired signal statistically related to the high-dimensional input, and analyze two quantization approaches. We, first, consider vector quantization, which is typically computationally infeasible, and characterize the optimal performance achievable with this approach. Next, we focus on practical systems that utilize hardware-limited scalar uniform analog-to-digital converters (ADCs), and design a task-based quantizer under this model. The resulting system accounts for the task by linearly combining the observed signal into a lower dimension prior to quantization. We then apply our proposed technique to channel estimation in massive MIMO networks. Our results demonstrate that a system utilizing low-resolution scalar ADCs can approach the optimal channel estimation performance by properly accounting for the task in the system design.", "AuthorKeywords": ["hybrid receivers", "Massive MIMO", "quantization"], "IndexKeywords": ["Analog to digital converters", "Digital signal processing systems", "Improving performance", "Massive multiple-input- multiple-output system (MIMO)", "Optimal channel estimation", "Optimal performance", "quantization", "Quantization approach"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85068589663", "SubjectAreas": [["Signal Processing", "COMP", "1711"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"56049577600": {"Name": "Shlezinger N.", "AuthorID": "56049577600", "AffiliationID": "60017563", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, Weizmann Institute of Science"}, "35562426100": {"Name": "Eldar Y.C.", "AuthorID": "35562426100", "AffiliationID": "60017563", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, Weizmann Institute of Science"}, "57210526627": {"Name": "Rodrigues M.R.D.", "AuthorID": "57210526627", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}}}
