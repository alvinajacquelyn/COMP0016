Arthritis & Rheumatology published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. on behalf of American College of Rheumatology.Objective: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of belimumab as adjunctive therapy to maintain remission in antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)\u2013associated vasculitis (AAV). Methods: In this multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, patients with AAV (ages \u226518 years) were randomized 1:1 to receive azathioprine (2 mg/kg/day), low-dose oral glucocorticoids (\u226410 mg/day), and either intravenous belimumab (10 mg/kg) or placebo, following remission induction with rituximab or cyclophosphamide along with glucocorticoids. The primary end point was time to first protocol-specified event (PSE), with first PSE defined as a Birmingham Vasculitis Activity Score (BVAS) of \u22656, presence of \u22651 major BVAS item, or receipt of prohibited medications for any reason, resulting in treatment failure (adjusted for ANCA type [proteinase 3 (PR3) or myeloperoxidase (MPO)], disease stage at induction, and induction regimen). Vasculitis relapse was defined as the PSE of either a BVAS activity score of \u22656 or receipt of prohibited medications for vasculitis. Changes in treatment practice led to truncation of the study population from ~300 patients to ~100 patients. Results: The intent-to-treat population totaled 105 patients with AAV, of whom 52 (40 with PR3-ANCAs, 12 with MPO-ANCAs) received placebo and 53 (41 with PR3-ANCAs, 12 with MPO-ANCAs) received belimumab; 27 of the patients were in rituximab-induced disease remission, while 78 were in cyclophosphamide-induced disease remission at baseline. Compared with placebo, treatment with belimumab did not reduce the risk of a PSE (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 1.07, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 0.44\u20132.59; P = 0.884) or vasculitis relapse (adjusted HR 0.88, 95% CI 0.29\u20132.65; P = 0.821). The overall rate of PSEs was low (11 [21.2%] of 52 patients receiving placebo, 10 [18.9%] of 53 patients receiving belimumab). Vasculitis relapse in the placebo group (n = 8) occurred independent of the induction regimen, disease stage, or ANCA type. All vasculitis relapses in the belimumab group (n = 6) occurred in patients who had PR3-ANCA\u2013associated vasculitis with cyclophosphamide-induced disease remission. Adverse events occurred in 49 (92.5%) of 53 patients receiving belimumab and 43 (82.7%) of 52 patients receiving placebo, with no new safety concerns. Conclusion: Belimumab plus azathioprine and glucocorticoids for the maintenance of remission in AAV did not reduce the risk of relapse.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Anti-Neutrophil Cytoplasmic Antibody-Associated Vasculitis", "Antibodies, Antineutrophil Cytoplasmic", "Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized", "Azathioprine", "B-Lymphocytes", "Cyclophosphamide", "Double-Blind Method", "Drug Therapy, Combination", "Female", "Glucocorticoids", "Humans", "Immunoglobulins", "Immunosuppressive Agents", "Infections", "Maintenance Chemotherapy", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Remission Induction", "Rituximab", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85064637721", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Rheumatology", "MEDI", "2745"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"]], "AuthorData": {"7006525072": {"Name": "Jayne D.", "AuthorID": "7006525072", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "University of Cambridge"}, "55981133400": {"Name": "Blockmans D.", "AuthorID": "55981133400", "AffiliationID": "60031069", "AffiliationName": "University Hospital Gasthuisberg"}, "7003619596": {"Name": "Luqmani R.", "AuthorID": "7003619596", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "University of Oxford"}, "7102097492": {"Name": "Moiseev S.", "AuthorID": "7102097492", "AffiliationID": "60010188", "AffiliationName": "Sechenov First Moscow State Medical University"}, "36339817700": {"Name": "Ji B.", "AuthorID": "36339817700", "AffiliationID": "60020649", "AffiliationName": "GlaxoSmithKline"}, "57208386487": {"Name": "Green Y.", "AuthorID": "57208386487", "AffiliationID": "60020649", "AffiliationName": "GlaxoSmithKline"}, "57208390962": {"Name": "Hall L.", "AuthorID": "57208390962", "AffiliationID": "60020649", "AffiliationName": "GlaxoSmithKline"}, "57189509385": {"Name": "Henderson R.", "AuthorID": "57189509385", "AffiliationID": "60020649", "AffiliationName": "GlaxoSmithKline"}, "57193906630": {"Name": "Roth D.", "AuthorID": "57193906630", "AffiliationID": "60097308", "AffiliationName": "GlaxoSmithKline"}, "57209188029": {"Name": "Merkel P.", "AuthorID": "57209188029", "AffiliationID": "60006297", "AffiliationName": "University of Pennsylvania"}}}
