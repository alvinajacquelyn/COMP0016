All rights reserved.This chapter explains how issues of disability should be approached in a society consisting of equal and moral persons. Capabilities are defined in terms of genuine opportunities for secure functioning which are not vulnerable to exceptional risk. It should be done in ways that reduce the negative effects that social structures and the average person's natural and social endowments have on the life prospects of the disabled person. He or she must have genuine opportunities to avail of non-risky functionalities when considered against basic and social institutions. In this way, a person with a disability can function at the same level that an average person without any disability can achieve in similar environmental circumstances. Equal recognition and acceptance of all persons should be promoted. Thus, we can remedy a disability either by relieving a person's impairment or by affording him material resources.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Disability", "Risk", "Social endowments", "Social structures"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84938841354", "SubjectAreas": [["Arts and Humanities (all)", "ARTS", "1200"]], "AuthorData": {"12800099800": {"Name": "Wolff J.", "AuthorID": "12800099800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
