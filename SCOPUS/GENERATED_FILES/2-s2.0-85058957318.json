We tested how information about practitioner gender affected intention to have bowel scope screening in a sample of women disinclined to have the test. Methods: In an online experimental survey, women aged 35\u201354 living in England who did not intend to participate in bowel scope screening (N = 1060) were randomised to one of four experimental conditions: (1) control (practitioner\u2019s gender is unknown), (2) opposite-gender (male practitioner by default), (3) same gender (female practitioner by default), and (4) active choice (the patient could choose the gender of the practitioner). Intention was measured following the interventions. Results: Of 1010 (95.3%) women who completed the survey, most were White-British (83.6%), and working (63.3%). Compared with control, both active choice and same-gender conditions increased intention among disinclined women (9.3% vs. 16.0% and 17.9%; OR: 1.85; 95% CI: 1.07\u20133.20 and OR: 2.07; 95% CI: 1.23\u20133.50). There were no differences in intention between the opposite-gender and control conditions (9.8% vs. 9.3%; OR: 1.06; 95% CI: 0.60\u20131.90) or the active choice and same-gender conditions (16.0% vs. 17.9%: OR: 0.89; 95% CI: 0.55\u20131.46, using same gender as baseline). Conclusions: Offering disinclined women a same-gender practitioner, either by choice or default, increased subsequent intention, while an opposite gender default did not negatively affect intention. Reducing uncertainty about gender of practitioner could positively affect uptake in women, and should be tested in a randomised controlled trial.", "AuthorKeywords": ["attitude change", "cancer screening", "Decision making", "endoscopist gender", "gender preferences", "online experiment"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Endoscopy", "England", "Female", "Humans", "Internet", "Male", "Mass Screening", "Middle Aged", "Patient Acceptance of Health Care", "Patient Participation", "Physician-Patient Relations", "Sex Factors", "Surveys and Questionnaires"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85058957318", "SubjectAreas": [["Health Policy", "MEDI", "2719"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"56136479100": {"Name": "Stoffel S.T.", "AuthorID": "56136479100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Behavioural Science and Health, University College London"}, "57073831200": {"Name": "Hirst Y.", "AuthorID": "57073831200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Behavioural Science and Health, University College London"}, "38361424400": {"Name": "Ghanouni A.", "AuthorID": "38361424400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Behavioural Science and Health, University College London"}, "44361787800": {"Name": "McGregor L.M.", "AuthorID": "44361787800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Behavioural Science and Health, University College London"}, "56513969200": {"Name": "Kerrison R.", "AuthorID": "56513969200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Behavioural Science and Health, University College London"}, "57205182933": {"Name": "Verstraete W.", "AuthorID": "57205182933", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Behavioural Science and Health, University College London"}, "57205182548": {"Name": "Gallagher A.", "AuthorID": "57205182548", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Behavioural Science and Health, University College London"}, "57191898211": {"Name": "Waller J.", "AuthorID": "57191898211", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Behavioural Science and Health, University College London"}, "23029251000": {"Name": "von Wagner C.", "AuthorID": "23029251000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Behavioural Science and Health, University College London"}}}
