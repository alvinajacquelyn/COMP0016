Here we examine the previously undescribed iron(III)-coordinating and cellular iron-mobilizing properties of ELT. We find a high binding constant for iron(III) (log \u03b22535). Clinically achievable concentrations (1 mM) progressively mobilized cellular iron from hepatocyte, cardiomyocyte, and pancreatic cell lines, rapidly decreasing intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and also restoring insulin secretion in pancreatic cells. Decrements in cellular ferritin paralleled total cellular iron removal, particularly in hepatocytes. Iron mobilization from cardiomyocytes exceeded that obtained with deferiprone, desferrioxamine, or deferasirox at similar iron-binding equivalents. When combined with these chelators, ELT enhanced cellular iron mobilization more than additive (synergistic) with deferasirox. Iron-binding speciation plots are consistent with ELT donating iron to deferasirox at clinically relevant concentrations. ELT scavenges iron citrate species faster than deferasirox, but rapidly donates the chelated iron to deferasirox, consistent with a shuttlingmechanism. Shuttling is also suggested by enhanced cellular ironmobilization by ELT when combined with the otherwise ineffective extra cellular hydroxypyridinonechelator, CP40. We conclude that ELT is a powerful iron chelator that decreases cellular iron and further enhances iron mobilization when combined with clinically available chelators.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Benzoates", "Cell Line, Tumor", "Deferoxamine", "Extracellular Space", "Ferritins", "Hepatocytes", "Humans", "Hydrazines", "Insulin", "Insulin-Secreting Cells", "Iron", "Iron Chelating Agents", "Myocytes, Cardiac", "Pyrazoles", "Pyridones", "Rats", "Reactive Oxygen Species"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85032479529", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"], ["Hematology", "MEDI", "2720"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"35759535600": {"Name": "Vlachodimitropoulou E.", "AuthorID": "35759535600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Haematology Department, University College London"}, "36192891700": {"Name": "Garbowski M.", "AuthorID": "36192891700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Haematology Department, University College London"}, "57214922704": {"Name": "Koonyosying P.", "AuthorID": "57214922704", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Haematology Department, University College London"}, "7403427269": {"Name": "Porter J.", "AuthorID": "7403427269", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Haematology Department, University College London"}, "54384786800": {"Name": "Chen Y.L.", "AuthorID": "54384786800", "AffiliationID": "60177635", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Pharmaceutical Science, King's College London"}, "7102451936": {"Name": "Hider R.", "AuthorID": "7102451936", "AffiliationID": "60177635", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Pharmaceutical Science, King's College London"}, "16646943600": {"Name": "Psaila B.", "AuthorID": "16646943600", "AffiliationID": "60001633, 60008323, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "MRC Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, John Radcliffe Hospital, University of Oxford"}, "13805704900": {"Name": "Sola-Visner M.", "AuthorID": "13805704900", "AffiliationID": "60030521", "AffiliationName": "Paediatrics Department, Boston Children's Hospital"}, "7202179837": {"Name": "Cooper N.", "AuthorID": "7202179837", "AffiliationID": "60020416, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "Haematology Department, Hammersmith Hospital, Imperial College London"}}}
