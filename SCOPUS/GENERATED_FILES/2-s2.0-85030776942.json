Overall, incidence proportion of ARIA-E was higher in carriers (active 21.2%; placebo 1.1%) than in noncarriers (pooled active 11.3%; placebo 0.6%), and was more often identified in homozygote APOE \u025b4 carriers than heterozygotes (34.5% versus 16.9%). Incidence rate of ARIA-E increased with increased dose in noncarriers. Frequency of ARIA-E first episodes was highest after the first and second bapineuzumab infusion and declined after repeated infusions. Incidence of total HDs <10 mm (cerebral microhemorrhages) was higher in active groups versus placebo.CONCLUSION: ARIA was detected more often on MRI scans when every scan was reviewed by trained neuroradiologists and results adjudicated. There was increased incidence of ARIA-E in bapineuzumab-treated carriers who had a microhemorrhage at baseline. ARIA-E was a risk factor for incident ARIA-H and late onset ARIA-E was milder radiologically. Age-related white matter changes did not progress during the study.BACKGROUND: Amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA) consist of ARIA-E (with effusion or edema) and ARIA-H (hemosiderin deposits [HDs]).OBJECTIVES: To address accurate ascertainment of ARIA identification, a final magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reading was performed on patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease randomized to bapineuzumab IV or placebo during two Phase III trials (APOE \u025b4 allele carriers or noncarriers).METHODS: Final MRI central review consisted of a systematic sequential locked, adjudicated read in 1,331 APOE \u025b4 noncarriers and 1,121 carriers by independent neuroradiologists. Assessment of ARIA-E, ARIA-H, intracerebral hemorrhages, and age-related white matter changes is described.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alzheimer\u2019s disease", "bapineuzumab", "brain amyloid-related imaging abnormality", "magnetic resonance imaging Registration: NCT00574132 (Bapineuzumab-301)", "NCT00575055 (Bapineuzumab-302)"], "IndexKeywords": ["Alzheimer Disease", "Amyloid", "Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized", "Apolipoprotein E4", "Brain", "Cerebral Hemorrhage", "Disease Progression", "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug", "Heterozygote", "Humans", "Immunologic Factors", "Incidence", "Kaplan-Meier Estimate", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Prevalence", "Risk Factors", "Severity of Illness Index", "White Matter"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85030776942", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Clinical Psychology", "PSYC", "3203"], ["Geriatrics and Gerontology", "MEDI", "2717"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"57194486125": {"Name": "Ketter N.", "AuthorID": "57194486125", "AffiliationID": "60001997", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, VU University Medical Center"}, "55880140400": {"Name": "Brashear H.", "AuthorID": "55880140400", "AffiliationID": "60001997", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, VU University Medical Center"}, "36192663400": {"Name": "Di J.", "AuthorID": "36192663400", "AffiliationID": "60001997", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, VU University Medical Center"}, "55879532700": {"Name": "Arrighi H.", "AuthorID": "55879532700", "AffiliationID": "60001997", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, VU University Medical Center"}, "57189341498": {"Name": "Bogert J.", "AuthorID": "57189341498", "AffiliationID": "60001997", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, VU University Medical Center"}, "7003956509": {"Name": "Miaux Y.", "AuthorID": "7003956509", "AffiliationID": "60001997", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, VU University Medical Center"}, "7006758232": {"Name": "Gass A.", "AuthorID": "7006758232", "AffiliationID": "60001997", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, VU University Medical Center"}, "57130251800": {"Name": "Purcell D.", "AuthorID": "57130251800", "AffiliationID": "60001997", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, VU University Medical Center"}, "7102989379": {"Name": "Barkhof F.", "AuthorID": "7102989379", "AffiliationID": "60001997", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, VU University Medical Center"}}}
