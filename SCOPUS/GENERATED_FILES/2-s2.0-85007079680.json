The current study compared rates of CNS toxicity after overdose between mefenamic acid, ibuprofen, diclofenac and naproxen, as reported in telephone enquiries to the UK National Poisons Information Service (NPIS). Methods: NPIS telephone enquiries related to the four NSAIDs, received between January 2007 and December 2013, were analysed, comparing the frequency of reported CNS toxicity (convulsions, altered conscious level, agitation or aggression, confusion or disorientation) using multivariable logistic regression. Results: Of 22 937 patient-specific telephone enquiries, 10 398 did not involve co-ingestion of other substances (mefenamic acid 461, ibuprofen 8090, diclofenac 1300, naproxen 547). Patients taking mefenamic acid were younger and more commonly female than those using other NSAIDs. Those ingesting mefenamic acid were more likely to experience CNS toxicity than those ingesting the other NSAIDs combined [adjusted odds ratio (OR) 7.77, 95% confidence interval (CI) 5.68, 10.62], especially convulsions (adjusted OR 81.5, 95% CI 27.8, 238.8). Predictors of CNS toxicity included reported dose and age, but not gender. Conclusions: Mefenamic acid overdose is associated with a much larger and dose-related risk of CNS toxicity, especially convulsions, compared with overdose of other NSAIDs. The benefit\u2013risk profile of mefenamic acid should now be re-evaluated in light of effective and less toxic alternatives.", "AuthorKeywords": ["CNS toxicity", "convulsions", "mefenamic acid", "nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug", "overdose", "poisoning"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Age Factors", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Diclofenac", "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug", "Drug Overdose", "Female", "Humans", "Ibuprofen", "Infant", "Infant, Newborn", "Logistic Models", "Male", "Mefenamic Acid", "Middle Aged", "Multivariate Analysis", "Naproxen", "Neurotoxicity Syndromes", "Poison Control Centers", "Sex Factors", "United Kingdom", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85007079680", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"36975506000": {"Name": "Kamour A.", "AuthorID": "36975506000", "AffiliationID": "60001239", "AffiliationName": "National Poisons Information Service, Newcastle Unit, Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "8893545700": {"Name": "Thomas S.H.L.", "AuthorID": "8893545700", "AffiliationID": "60026712, 60006222", "AffiliationName": "Medical Toxicology Centre, Institute of Cellular Medicine, Wolfson Building, Newcastle University"}, "34067584300": {"Name": "Crichton S.", "AuthorID": "34067584300", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Primary Care and Public Health, King's College London"}, "7402356010": {"Name": "Cooper G.", "AuthorID": "7402356010", "AffiliationID": "60032564", "AffiliationName": "National Poisons Information Service, Cardiff Unit, University Hospital Llandough"}, "55545753900": {"Name": "Thompson J.P.", "AuthorID": "55545753900", "AffiliationID": "60032564", "AffiliationName": "National Poisons Information Service, Cardiff Unit, University Hospital Llandough"}, "26659060500": {"Name": "Lupton D.J.", "AuthorID": "26659060500", "AffiliationID": "60002975", "AffiliationName": "National Poisons Information Service, Edinburgh Unit, Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh"}, "56730281300": {"Name": "Eddleston M.", "AuthorID": "56730281300", "AffiliationID": "60110825, 60027272", "AffiliationName": "Pharmacology, Toxicology and Therapeutics, University/BHF Centre for Cardiovascular Science, University of Edinburgh"}, "18041231600": {"Name": "Vale J.A.", "AuthorID": "18041231600", "AffiliationID": "60007419", "AffiliationName": "National Poisons Information Service, Birmingham Unit, City Hospital"}}}
