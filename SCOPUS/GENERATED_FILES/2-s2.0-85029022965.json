Design A cross-sectional study including an analysis of all certificates of vision impairment completed in hospitals in England and Wales each year between 2007/2008 and 2014/2015 and all certificates completed in hospitals in England and Wales in 1999/2000. Participants Certificates for all individuals aged 16 years or less at the time of certification in England and Wales for each financial year between 1 April 2007 and the 31 March 2015 and for individuals aged 15 years or less for the year ending 31 March 2000. We obtained information on the main cause of certifiable sight loss for all children certified in 2014/2015. We estimated crude and sex specific incidence estimates with 95% confidence intervals computed by Byars method. Results In 1999/2000, the estimated incidence (95 % CI) of certification was 8.2 (7.7 to 8.8) per 1 00 000. In 2007/2008, the estimated incidence was statistically significantly higher at 10.1 (9.5 to 10.7). Since then a trend of increasing incidence with time has been observed until 2014/2015 when an estimated incidence of 13.3 (12.6 to 14.0) was observed. Hereditary retinal dystrophies, cerebral visual impairment and nystagmus were the most common single causes of certifiable sight impairment in children in 2014/2015. Conclusion Our findings show that in England and Wales there has been an increase in the number of children newly certified sight impaired by consultant ophthalmologists since 1999/2000. This mirrors our previous findings based on data originating within social service departments.", "AuthorKeywords": ["blindness", "children", "partial sight", "registration", "sight impairment"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Certification", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Disability Evaluation", "England", "Female", "Hospitals", "Humans", "Incidence", "Infant", "Male", "Ophthalmology", "Pediatrics", "Registries", "Vision Disorders", "Wales"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85029022965", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"7005268305": {"Name": "Bunce C.", "AuthorID": "7005268305", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Primary Care and Public Health Sciences, King's College London"}, "56267335500": {"Name": "Zekite A.", "AuthorID": "56267335500", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Department of Research and Development, Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7005485512": {"Name": "Wormald R.", "AuthorID": "7005485512", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Department of Research and Development, Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "12797538000": {"Name": "Bowman R.", "AuthorID": "12797538000", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}}}
