The primary aim of this study is to describe the application of instructional design, an established theory-based approach in course design, to the development of a surgical skills course for ophthalmology residents. The secondary aim of this study is to assess the educational effect of this theory-based course. Design A 1-day skills course was designed according to Gagn\u00e9's events of instruction model, which was employed as a template for the instructional sequence of learning steps. Skills acquisition following the implementation of the model was measured with precourse and postcourse assessments. Setting Moorfields Eye Hospital organized the 1-day annual intermediate surgical skills course, which was hosted at the Royal College of Ophthalmologists' microsurgical skills laboratory. Participants A total of 20 ophthalmology residents of Moorfields Eye Hospital participated in the study. Results A 1-day surgical skills course was formulated according to the instructional design principles outlined. The 4 objectives of the course (corneal suturing, corneal gluing, intravitreal injections, and eyelid suturing) were addressed in a parallel fashion as to allow for multiple objectives to be processed simultaneously, in the context of the instructional design sequence. Assessments demonstrated significant improvement in skills acquisition for the 4 course objectives. Conclusions Instructional design is a valuable tool for planning effective surgical training courses as it is portable, allowing its application to a wide variety of outcomes and settings, and its terminology is simple and understandable to those working in clinical education.", "AuthorKeywords": ["instructional course design theory", "microsurgical skillourse"], "IndexKeywords": ["Clinical Competence", "Curriculum", "Education, Medical, Graduate", "Educational Measurement", "Humans", "Internship and Residency", "Microsurgery", "Models, Educational", "Motor Skills", "Ophthalmology"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84931386177", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Education", "SOCI", "3304"]], "AuthorData": {"24503709800": {"Name": "Koukkoulli A.", "AuthorID": "24503709800", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Department of Education, Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "16038403700": {"Name": "Chandra A.", "AuthorID": "16038403700", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Department of Education, Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "56689610500": {"Name": "Sheth H.", "AuthorID": "56689610500", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Department of Education, Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "6603695884": {"Name": "Okhravi N.", "AuthorID": "6603695884", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Department of Education, Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "7402327828": {"Name": "Verma S.", "AuthorID": "7402327828", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Department of Education, Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "7402033170": {"Name": "Sullivan P.", "AuthorID": "7402033170", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Department of Education, Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "11439021900": {"Name": "Ezra D.G.", "AuthorID": "11439021900", "AffiliationID": "60013148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell Biology, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}}}
