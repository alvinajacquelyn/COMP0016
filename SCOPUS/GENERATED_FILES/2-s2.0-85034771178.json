Given the lengthy rehabilitation process, a blended intervention can be used to compliment face-to-face physiotherapy with a digital exercise intervention. In this study, we used TRAK, a web-based tool that has been developed to support knee rehabilitation, which provides individually tailored exercise programs with videos, instructions and progress logs for each exercise, relevant health information and a contact option that allows a patient to email a physiotherapist for additional support. The aim of this study was to evaluate the acceptability of TRAK-based blended intervention in post ACL reconstruction rehabilitation. Methods: A qualitative research design using semi-structured interviews was used on a convenience sample of participants following an ACL reconstruction, and their treating physiotherapists, in a London NHS hospital. Participants were asked to use TRAK alongside face-to-face physiotherapy for 16 weeks. Interviews were carried out, audio recorded, transcribed verbatim and coded by two researchers independently. Data were analyzed using thematic analysis. Results: Of the 25 individuals that were approached to be part of the study, 24 consented, comprising 8 females and 16 males, mean age 30 years. 17 individuals used TRAK for 16 weeks and were available for interview. Four physiotherapists were also interviewed. The six main themes identified from patients were: the experience of TRAK rehabilitation, personal characteristics for engagement, strengths and weaknesses of the intervention, TRAK in the future and attitudes to digital healthcare. The main themes from the physiotherapist interviews were: potential benefits, availability of resources and service organization to support use of TRAK. Conclusions: TRAK was found to be an acceptable method of delivering ACL rehabilitation alongside face-to-face physiotherapy. Patients reported that TRAK, specifically the videos, increased their confidence and motivation with their rehabilitation. They identified ways in which TRAK could be developed in the future to meet technological expectations and further support rehabilitation. For Physiotherapists time and availability of computers affected acceptability. Organization of care to support integration of digital exercise interventions such as TRAK into a blended approach to rehabilitation is required.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Anterior cruciate ligament", "E-health", "Internet", "Physiotherapy", "Rehabilitation", "Surgery"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Anterior Cruciate Ligament", "Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injuries", "Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction", "Exercise Therapy", "Female", "Humans", "Knee Joint", "Male", "Patient Acceptance of Health Care", "Physical Therapists", "Program Evaluation", "Qualitative Research", "Range of Motion, Articular", "Telerehabilitation", "Time Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85034771178", "SubjectAreas": [["Rheumatology", "MEDI", "2745"], ["Orthopedics and Sports Medicine", "MEDI", "2732"]], "AuthorData": {"57193585361": {"Name": "Dunphy E.", "AuthorID": "57193585361", "AffiliationID": "60005523", "AffiliationName": "Homerton University Hospital NHS Trust"}, "26657997700": {"Name": "Hamilton F.L.", "AuthorID": "26657997700", "AffiliationID": "60029950", "AffiliationName": "E-Health Unit, Research Department of Primary Care and Population Health, UCL Medical School (Royal Free Campus)"}, "8645090100": {"Name": "Spasi\u0107 I.", "AuthorID": "8645090100", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "School of Computer Science and Informatics, Cardiff University, Queens Building"}, "57204259883": {"Name": "Button K.", "AuthorID": "57204259883", "AffiliationID": "60138351", "AffiliationName": "Cardiff and Vale University Health Board"}}}
