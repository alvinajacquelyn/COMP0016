CardioScape, a FP7 funded project initiated by the European Society of Cardiology (ESC), identified where CV research is performed, how it is funded and by whom. It could be transformed into an on-line and up-to-date resource of great relevance for researchers, funding bodies and policymakers and could be a role model for mapping CV research funding in Europe and beyond.Methods Relevant funding bodies in 28 European Union (EU) countries were identified by a multistep process involving and results experts in each country. Projects above a funding threshold of 100 ke during the period 2010\u20132012 were included using a standard questionnaire. Results were classified by experts and an adaptive text analysis software to a CV-research taxonomy, integrating existing schemes from ESC journals and congresses. An on-line query portal was set up to allow different users to interrogate the database according to their specific viewpoints.Conclusion CV-research funding varies strongly between different nations with the EU providing 37% of total available project funding and clear geographical gradients exist. Data allow in depth comparison of funding for different research areas and led to a number of recommendations by the consortium. CardioScape can support CV research by aiding researchers, funding agencies and policy makers in their strategic decisions thus improving research quality if CardioScape strategy and technology becomes the basis of a continuously updated and expanded European wide publicly accessible database.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Funding policy \u2022 Funding agencies \u2022 Database \u2022 Cardiovascular research \u2022 Text mining"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85050621842", "SubjectAreas": [["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"7004297733": {"Name": "Pries A.R.", "AuthorID": "7004297733", "AffiliationID": "60026245", "AffiliationName": "Dean of Charit\u00e9 Universit\u20acatsmedizin Berlin"}, "57203517856": {"Name": "Naoum A.", "AuthorID": "57203517856", "AffiliationID": "121215818", "AffiliationName": "European Society of Cardiology"}, "7004267026": {"Name": "Habazettl H.", "AuthorID": "7004267026", "AffiliationID": "60026245", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Physiology, Charit\u00e9 Universit\u20acatsmedizin Berlin"}, "15759296600": {"Name": "Dunkel M.", "AuthorID": "15759296600", "AffiliationID": "60026245", "AffiliationName": "Charit\u00e9 Universit\u20acatsmedizin Berlin"}, "57193352788": {"Name": "Preissner R.", "AuthorID": "57193352788", "AffiliationID": "60026245", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Physiology, Charit\u00e9 Universit\u20acatsmedizin Berlin"}, "25027144700": {"Name": "Coats C.J.", "AuthorID": "25027144700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College"}, "57203515895": {"Name": "Tornada A.", "AuthorID": "57203515895", "AffiliationID": "113079588", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Hospital de Cascais, Brigadeiro Victor Novais Gon\u00e7alves"}, "14523222700": {"Name": "Orso F.", "AuthorID": "14523222700", "AffiliationID": "60172681", "AffiliationName": "ANMCO Research Center"}, "36048879600": {"Name": "Van de Werf F.", "AuthorID": "36048879600", "AffiliationID": "60025063", "AffiliationName": "Department of Caridovascular Sciences, University of Leuven"}, "57039462400": {"Name": "Wood D.A.", "AuthorID": "57039462400", "AffiliationID": "60010719, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "National Heart and Lung Institute, Imperial College London"}, "null": {"Name": null, "AuthorID": null, "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
