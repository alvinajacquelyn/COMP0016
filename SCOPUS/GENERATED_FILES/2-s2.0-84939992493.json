Cardiovascular disease is the most common cause of death, and left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), seen in two-thirds of children on dialysis, is a significant contributor. The importance of volume control is increasingly recognized by nephrologists and now considered to be as important as urea kinetics, both in the day-to-day management and the long-term outcome of dialysis patients. The results published by Paglialonga et al. (10.1007/s00467-014-3005-2) in this issue of Pediatric Nephrology clearly demonstrate that there is a significant correlation between interdialytic weight gain (IDWG) and LVH in oligoanuric children on chronic HD and that children with an IDWG of >4 % are at high risk of LVH. One common practice to achieve euvolaemia is to prescribe very high ultrafiltration rates. However, both volume overload and aggressive fluid removal can induce circulatory stress and multi-organ injury. In adults, ultrafiltration rates of >1.24 % body weight per hour, even if well tolerated, are associated with a significant increase in mortality. Nephrologists should be aware of the risk of a high ultrafiltration rate, especially if tolerance is obtained by a positive dialysate-to-plasma sodium gradient. Haemodiafiltration, which allows for higher ultrafiltration rates with greater intradialytic haemodynamic stability, or more frequent and longer dialysis sessions allow for safe and effective fluid removal.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Children", "Chronic haemodialysis", "Interdialytic weight gain", "Left ventricular hypertrophy", "Ultrafiltration rate"], "IndexKeywords": ["Anuria", "Female", "Humans", "Kidney Failure, Chronic", "Male", "Oliguria", "Renal Dialysis", "Weight Gain"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84939992493", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Nephrology", "MEDI", "2727"]], "AuthorData": {"7102623870": {"Name": "Fischbach M.", "AuthorID": "7102623870", "AffiliationID": "60010247", "AffiliationName": "Children\u2019s Dialysis Unit, University Hospital Strasbourg"}, "37762414400": {"Name": "Zaloszyc A.", "AuthorID": "37762414400", "AffiliationID": "60010247", "AffiliationName": "Children\u2019s Dialysis Unit, University Hospital Strasbourg"}, "22956754100": {"Name": "Shroff R.", "AuthorID": "22956754100", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Renal Unit, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
