One LES employs the rigid-lid boundary condition at the water surface, while the other uses a highly accurate level-set method (LSM), which allows the water surface to adjust itself freely in response to the flow. The simulation with the LSM is validated with data from complementary physical model tests under analogous geometrical and flow conditions. Streamwise velocity, bed-shear stress and second-order turbulence statistics obtained from both simulations are compared, and it is shown that the turbulence structure of this flow is influenced strongly by the water-surface deformation. While bed-shear stresses and first-order statistics are very similar for both cases, the instantaneous turbulence structure and consequently, the second-order statistics, are distinctly different. The correct prediction of the water-surface deformation of such flows is deemed important for the accuracy of their simulation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Abutment", "Free surface", "Large eddy simulation", "Level set method", "Turbulence modeling"], "IndexKeywords": ["Accurate computations", "First-order statistics", "Free surfaces", "Level Set method", "Second order statistics", "Stream-wise velocities", "Turbulence statistics", "Turbulence structures"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84939169490", "SubjectAreas": [["Civil and Structural Engineering", "ENGI", "2205"], ["Water Science and Technology", "ENVI", "2312"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"]], "AuthorData": {"55427126700": {"Name": "Kara S.", "AuthorID": "55427126700", "AffiliationID": "60019647", "AffiliationName": "School of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology"}, "57193823738": {"Name": "Kara M.", "AuthorID": "57193823738", "AffiliationID": "60019647", "AffiliationName": "School of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology"}, "7006845362": {"Name": "Sturm T.", "AuthorID": "7006845362", "AffiliationID": "60019647", "AffiliationName": "School of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology"}, "6507316700": {"Name": "Stoesser T.", "AuthorID": "6507316700", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering, Cardiff Univ., The Parade"}}}
