All Rights Reserved.Gating pore currents through the voltage-sensing domains (VSDs) of the skeletal muscle voltage-gated sodium channel NaV1.4 underlie hypokalemic periodic paralysis (HypoPP) type 2. Gating modifier toxins target ion channels by modifying the function of the VSDs. We tested the hypothesis that these toxins could function as blockers of the pathogenic gating pore currents. We report that a crab spider toxin Hm-3 from Heriaeus melloteei can inhibit gating pore currents due to mutations affecting the second arginine residue in the S4 helix of VSD-I that we have found in patients with HypoPP and describe here. NMR studies show that Hm-3 partitions into micelles through a hydrophobic cluster formed by aromatic residues and reveal complex formation with VSD-I through electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions with the S3b helix and the S3\u2013S4 extracellular loop. Our data identify VSD-I as a specific binding site for neurotoxins on sodium channels. Gating modifier toxins may constitute useful hits for the treatment of HypoPP.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Channelopathy", "Gating modifier", "Hypokalemic periodic paralysis", "Neurotoxin", "Sodium channel"], "IndexKeywords": ["Amino Acid Substitution", "Animals", "Female", "HEK293 Cells", "Humans", "Ion Channel Gating", "Mutation, Missense", "NAV1.4 Voltage-Gated Sodium Channel", "Neurotoxins", "Paralysis, Hyperkalemic Periodic", "Protein Structure, Secondary", "Spider Venoms", "Xenopus laevis"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85045910164", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"6507769109": {"Name": "M\u00e4nnikk\u00f6 R.", "AuthorID": "6507769109", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Neuromuscular Diseases, Department of Molecular Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "57188992457": {"Name": "Thor M.", "AuthorID": "57188992457", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Neuromuscular Diseases, Department of Molecular Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "57201719158": {"Name": "Casta\u00f1eda M.", "AuthorID": "57201719158", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Neuromuscular Diseases, Department of Molecular Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "57056943500": {"Name": "King L.", "AuthorID": "57056943500", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Neuromuscular Diseases, Department of Molecular Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "57201717842": {"Name": "Wilson E.", "AuthorID": "57201717842", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Neuromuscular Diseases, Department of Molecular Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "15075798500": {"Name": "Hanna M.", "AuthorID": "15075798500", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Neuromuscular Diseases, Department of Molecular Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "7801695075": {"Name": "Shenkarev Z.", "AuthorID": "7801695075", "AffiliationID": "60000308", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biological and Medical Physics, Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology (State University)"}, "55779028500": {"Name": "Berkut A.", "AuthorID": "55779028500", "AffiliationID": "60000308", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biological and Medical Physics, Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology (State University)"}, "56472748500": {"Name": "Myshkin M.", "AuthorID": "56472748500", "AffiliationID": "60000308", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biological and Medical Physics, Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology (State University)"}, "16836948700": {"Name": "Paramonov A.", "AuthorID": "16836948700", "AffiliationID": "60085212, 60021331", "AffiliationName": "Shemyakin\u2013Ovchinnikov Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry, Russian Academy of Sciences"}, "57164821700": {"Name": "Kulbatskii D.", "AuthorID": "57164821700", "AffiliationID": "60007457", "AffiliationName": "Biological Faculty, Lomonosov Moscow State University"}, "6505894442": {"Name": "Lyukmanova E.", "AuthorID": "6505894442", "AffiliationID": "60007457", "AffiliationName": "Biological Faculty, Lomonosov Moscow State University"}, "7005699025": {"Name": "Kirpichnikov M.", "AuthorID": "7005699025", "AffiliationID": "60007457", "AffiliationName": "Biological Faculty, Lomonosov Moscow State University"}, "22952544100": {"Name": "Vassilevski A.", "AuthorID": "22952544100", "AffiliationID": "60000308", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biological and Medical Physics, Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology (State University)"}, "57201751316": {"Name": "Kuzmin D.", "AuthorID": "57201751316", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Experimental Epilepsy, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "6507085620": {"Name": "Schorge S.", "AuthorID": "6507085620", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Experimental Epilepsy, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "7006451604": {"Name": "Kullmann D.", "AuthorID": "7006451604", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Experimental Epilepsy, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "6602442718": {"Name": "Bosmans F.", "AuthorID": "6602442718", "AffiliationID": "60001117", "AffiliationName": "Solomon H.
