In order to achieve robust control of complex process networks, it is necessary to formulate control strategies that specifically accommodate the characteristics of such parallel systems. In this paper, the competitive coupling and competitive constraints in parallel systems are initially defined. A novel robust distributed model predictive control algorithm is then developed for such parallel systems which deals explicitly with competitive couplings, competitive constraints and uncertainties. The Lyapunov Method is used for the theoretical analysis which produces tractable linear matrix inequalities (LMI). Two simulation studies and an experimental trial are provided to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. These consider control of 40 user and 100 user gas boiler heating systems as well as control of two continuous stirred tank reactors (CSTRs) which are connected in parallel.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Competitive constraint", "Competitive coupling", "Linear matrix inequality", "Parallel system", "Robust distributed model predictive control"], "IndexKeywords": ["Competitive constraint", "Continuous stirred tank reactor", "Control strategies", "Distributed Model predictive Control", "Experimental trials", "Parallel structures", "Parallel system", "Simulation studies"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85071150917", "SubjectAreas": [["Control and Systems Engineering", "ENGI", "2207"], ["Modeling and Simulation", "MATH", "2611"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering", "ENGI", "2209"]], "AuthorData": {"57202123052": {"Name": "Zhang S.", "AuthorID": "57202123052", "AffiliationID": "60105111", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Equipment and Control Engineering, College of New Energy, China University of Petroleum (East China)"}, "23112052400": {"Name": "Zhao D.", "AuthorID": "23112052400", "AffiliationID": "60105111", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Equipment and Control Engineering, College of New Energy, China University of Petroleum (East China)"}, "7005642573": {"Name": "Spurgeon S.K.", "AuthorID": "7005642573", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}}}
