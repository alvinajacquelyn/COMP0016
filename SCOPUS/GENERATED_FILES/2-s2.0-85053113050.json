This hypothesis is consistent with butchery marks on extinct lemur bones from ~2400 years B.P. and perhaps with archaeological evidence of human presence from ~4000 years B.P. We report >10,500-year-old human-modified bones for the extinct elephant birds Aepyornis and Mullerornis, which show perimortem chop marks, cut marks, and depression fractures consistent with immobilization and dismemberment. Our evidence for anthropogenic perimortem modification of directly dated bones represents the earliest indication of humans in Madagascar, predating all other archaeological and genetic evidence by >6000 years and changing our understanding of the history of human colonization of Madagascar. This revision of Madagascar\u2019s prehistory suggests prolonged human-faunal coexistence with limited biodiversity loss.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Biodiversity loss", "Early Holocene", "Human colonization", "Madagascar", "Megafauna", "Animals", "Archaeology", "Birds", "Fossils", "History, Ancient", "Humans", "Madagascar"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85053113050", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"55655489200": {"Name": "Hansford J.", "AuthorID": "55655489200", "AffiliationID": "60025225, 60010934", "AffiliationName": "Ocean and Earth Science, National Oceanography Centre Southampton, University of Southampton, Waterfront Campus"}, "8608216100": {"Name": "Turvey S.T.", "AuthorID": "8608216100", "AffiliationID": "60005453, 60009498", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Zoology, Zoological Society of London"}, "57203771692": {"Name": "Wright P.C.", "AuthorID": "57203771692", "AffiliationID": "60120574", "AffiliationName": "Centre ValBio"}, "34571715400": {"Name": "Rasoamiaramanana A.", "AuthorID": "34571715400", "AffiliationID": "60072617", "AffiliationName": "Mention Bassins S\u00e9dimentaires Evolution Conservation, University of Antananarivo"}, "10139238600": {"Name": "P\u00e9rez V.R.", "AuthorID": "10139238600", "AffiliationID": "60014313", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anthropology, University of Massachusetts"}, "7004970740": {"Name": "Godfrey L.R.", "AuthorID": "7004970740", "AffiliationID": "60014313", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anthropology, University of Massachusetts"}, "55661632700": {"Name": "Errickson D.", "AuthorID": "55661632700", "AffiliationID": "60025655", "AffiliationName": "School of Science, Engineering and Design, Tees-side University"}, "7401552868": {"Name": "Thompson T.", "AuthorID": "7401552868", "AffiliationID": "60025655", "AffiliationName": "School of Science, Engineering and Design, Tees-side University"}}}
