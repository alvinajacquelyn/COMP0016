We show that ATG4B contains a C-terminal LC3-interacting region (LIR) motif important for efficient binding to and cleavage of LC3 and GABARAP proteins. We solved the crystal structures of the GABARAPL1-ATG4B C-terminal LIR complex. Analyses of the structures and in vitro binding assays, using specific point mutants, clearly showed that the ATG4B LIR binds via electrostatic-, aromatic HP1 and hydrophobic HP2 pocket interactions. Both these interactions and the catalytic site-substrate interaction contribute to binding between LC3s or GABARAPs and ATG4B. We also reveal an unexpected role for ATG4B in stabilizing the unlipidated forms of GABARAP and GABARAPL1. In mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) atg4b knockout cells, GABARAP and GABARAPL1 were unstable and degraded by the proteasome. Strikingly, the LIR motif of ATG4B was required for stabilization of the unlipidated forms of GABARAP and GABARAPL1 in cells.", "AuthorKeywords": ["ATG4", "autophagy", "GABARAP", "GABARAPL1", "LC3B", "LIR", "peptide arrays", "X-ray structure"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Autophagy", "Autophagy-Related Protein 8 Family", "Autophagy-Related Proteins", "Cells, Cultured", "Cysteine Endopeptidases", "Humans", "Mice", "Microfilament Proteins", "Saccharomyces cerevisiae", "Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins", "Yeasts"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85015049546", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"57193574929": {"Name": "Skytte Rasmussen M.", "AuthorID": "57193574929", "AffiliationID": "60021255", "AffiliationName": "Molecular Cancer Research Group, Department of Medical Biology, University of Troms\u00f8 \u2013The Arctic University of Norway"}, "57193579462": {"Name": "Kumar Shrestha B.", "AuthorID": "57193579462", "AffiliationID": "60021255", "AffiliationName": "Molecular Cancer Research Group, Department of Medical Biology, University of Troms\u00f8 \u2013The Arctic University of Norway"}, "57193577602": {"Name": "Bowitz Larsen K.", "AuthorID": "57193577602", "AffiliationID": "60021255", "AffiliationName": "Molecular Cancer Research Group, Department of Medical Biology, University of Troms\u00f8 \u2013The Arctic University of Norway"}, "57208723543": {"Name": "Abudu Princely Y.", "AuthorID": "57208723543", "AffiliationID": "60021255", "AffiliationName": "Molecular Cancer Research Group, Department of Medical Biology, University of Troms\u00f8 \u2013The Arctic University of Norway"}, "6507746578": {"Name": "Sj\u00f8ttem E.", "AuthorID": "6507746578", "AffiliationID": "60021255", "AffiliationName": "Molecular Cancer Research Group, Department of Medical Biology, University of Troms\u00f8 \u2013The Arctic University of Norway"}, "6602773646": {"Name": "Lamark T.", "AuthorID": "6602773646", "AffiliationID": "60021255", "AffiliationName": "Molecular Cancer Research Group, Department of Medical Biology, University of Troms\u00f8 \u2013The Arctic University of Norway"}, "57217550125": {"Name": "Johansen T.", "AuthorID": "57217550125", "AffiliationID": "60021255", "AffiliationName": "Molecular Cancer Research Group, Department of Medical Biology, University of Troms\u00f8 \u2013The Arctic University of Norway"}, "12791814700": {"Name": "Mouilleron S.", "AuthorID": "12791814700", "AffiliationID": "60107285", "AffiliationName": "Structural Biology, The Francis Crick Institute"}, "57193573654": {"Name": "Lee R.", "AuthorID": "57193573654", "AffiliationID": "60107285", "AffiliationName": "Structural Biology, The Francis Crick Institute"}, "7201423153": {"Name": "Wirth M.", "AuthorID": "7201423153", "AffiliationID": "60107285", "AffiliationName": "Molecular Cell Biology of Autophagy Laboratory, The Francis Crick Institute"}, "7004652751": {"Name": "Tooze S.A.", "AuthorID": "7004652751", "AffiliationID": "60107285", "AffiliationName": "Molecular Cell Biology of Autophagy Laboratory, The Francis Crick Institute"}, "6603906721": {"Name": "O'Reilly N.", "AuthorID": "6603906721", "AffiliationID": "60107285", "AffiliationName": "Peptide Chemistry Science Technology Platform, The Francis Crick Institute"}}}
