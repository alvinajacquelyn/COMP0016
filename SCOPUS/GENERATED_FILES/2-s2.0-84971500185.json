The data were generated using a networked pulsed radar system, namely, NetRAD. This analysis is completed in both the temporal and Doppler domains, and the parameters characterized are compared between multiple bistatic angles and different polarizations. The K-distribution model is used to assess the variation in the clutter amplitude statistics between multiple bistatic data and the corresponding monostatic data. Key characteristics of the Doppler data, such as the spectrum width, center of gravity (CoG), and variance of the spectral width, are evaluated as a function of bistatic angle allowing novel relationships to be defined. The results conclude that the bistatic Doppler data have a lower K-distribution shape parameter in the majority of bistatic angles compared with the simultaneous monostatic data. In addition, novel trends in the relationship between the clutter spectrum CoG and the clutter intensity are presented.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Multistatic radar", "radar clutter", "radar remote sensing"], "IndexKeywords": ["Bistatic angle", "Center of gravity", "Clutter amplitudes", "Doppler spectra", "K distribution", "Key characteristics", "Spectral widths", "Spectrum width"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84971500185", "SubjectAreas": [["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"], ["Earth and Planetary Sciences (all)", "EART", "1900"]], "AuthorData": {"36186273500": {"Name": "Ritchie M.", "AuthorID": "36186273500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "6603516262": {"Name": "Stove A.", "AuthorID": "6603516262", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "7003652416": {"Name": "Woodbridge K.", "AuthorID": "7003652416", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "7202821654": {"Name": "Griffiths H.", "AuthorID": "7202821654", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}}}
