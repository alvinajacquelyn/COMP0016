The methodology consists of introducing a hydrodynamic scaling of the corresponding mean field kinetic equation. The resulting perturbation problem is solved thanks to the concept of generalized collision invariants. It yields a hyperbolic but non-conservative system of equations for the nematic mean direction of the flow and the densities of particles flowing parallel or antiparallel to this mean direction. Diffusive terms are introduced under a weakly non-local interaction assumption and the diffusion coefficient is proven to be positive. An application to the modeling of myxobacteria is outlined.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Diffusion correction", "Generalized collision invariant", "Hydrodynamic limit", "Myxobacteria", "Nematic alignment", "Self-propelled particles", "Weakly non-local interaction"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85016031450", "SubjectAreas": [["Discrete Mathematics and Combinatorics", "MATH", "2607"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"7005668908": {"Name": "Degond P.", "AuthorID": "7005668908", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, Imperial College London, London"}, "57188856699": {"Name": "Manhart A.", "AuthorID": "57188856699", "AffiliationID": "60003261, 60021784", "AffiliationName": "Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, New York University"}, "56201610300": {"Name": "Yu H.", "AuthorID": "56201610300", "AffiliationID": "60016653", "AffiliationName": "Inst. fur Geometrie und Praktische Mathematik, RWTH Aachen University Aachen"}}}
