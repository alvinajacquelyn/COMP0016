This paper presents an assessment of the seismic performance of existing tall buildings and strategies for increased resilience for a case study city, San Francisco, where an archetype tall building is designed based on an inventory of the existing tall building stock. A 40-story moment-resisting frame system is selected as a representative tall building. The archetype building is rectangular in plan and represents the state of design and construction practice from the mid-1970s to the mid-1980s. Nonlinear response history analysis (NLRHA) are conducted with ground motions representative of the design earthquake hazard level defined in current building codes, with explicit consideration of near-fault directivity effects. Mean transient interstory drifts and story accelerations under the 10% in 50-year ground motion hazard range from 0.19 to 1.14% and 0.15 to 0.81 g, respectively. In order to influence decision making, performance is reported as the expected consequences in terms of direct economic losses and downtime. Furthermore, to achieve increased levels of resilience, a number of strategies are proposed including seismic improvements to structural and nonstructural systems as well as mitigation measures to minimize impeding factors. Expected direct economic losses for the archetype building are in the order of 34% of building cost and downtime estimates for functional recovery are 87 weeks. The strategies presented in this paper enable up to a 92% reduction in losses and minimize downtime for functional recovery to 1 day or less.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Downtime assessment", "Earthquake resistant structures", "Loss assessment", "Non-linear analysis", "Resilience", "Seismic analysis", "Seismic effects", "Steel structures", "Structural analysis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Downtime assessment", "Earthquake resistant structures", "Resilience", "Seismic analysis", "Seismic effect"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84978877770", "SubjectAreas": [["Civil and Structural Engineering", "ENGI", "2205"], ["Building and Construction", "ENGI", "2215"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Mechanics of Materials", "ENGI", "2211"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"]], "AuthorData": {"57189032136": {"Name": "Hutt C.", "AuthorID": "57189032136", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dept. of Civil, Environmental, and Geomatic Engineering, Univ.
