Psychophysiology published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. on behalf of Society for Psychophysiological Research.We examined whether monaural prepulses produce more prepulse inhibition (PPI) because they might be more attention capturing (unambiguous to locate) than binaural prepulses. Monaural and binaural PPI was tested under normal and verbal and visuospatial attention manipulation conditions in 55 healthy men, including 29 meditators. Attention manipulations abolished monaural PPI superiority, similarly in meditators and meditation-na\u00efve individuals, and this was most strongly evident for right ear PPI under visuospatial attention manipulation. Meditators performed better than meditation-na\u00efve individuals on attention tasks (verbal: more targets detected; visuospatial: faster reaction time). Spatial attention processes contribute to monaural PPI, particularly with the right ear. Better attentional performance, with similar attentional modulation of PPI, may indicate a stronger attentional capacity in meditators, relative to meditation-na\u00efve individuals.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Attention", "Human sensorimotor gating", "Mindfulness", "Startle"], "IndexKeywords": ["Acoustic Stimulation", "Adult", "Attention", "Auditory Perception", "Humans", "Male", "Meditation", "Middle Aged", "Prepulse Inhibition", "Psychomotor Performance", "Space Perception"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84927697374", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Neuropsychology and Physiological Psychology", "PSYC", "3206"], ["Experimental and Cognitive Psychology", "PSYC", "3205"], ["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Endocrine and Autonomic Systems", "NEUR", "2807"], ["Developmental Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2806"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"], ["Biological Psychiatry", "NEUR", "2803"]], "AuthorData": {"7005573217": {"Name": "Kumari V.", "AuthorID": "7005573217", "AffiliationID": "60028884, 60171762", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre for Mental Health, South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57213318921": {"Name": "Hamid A.", "AuthorID": "57213318921", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience (IoPPN), King's College London"}, "24330503000": {"Name": "Brand A.", "AuthorID": "24330503000", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience (IoPPN), King's College London"}, "57202034423": {"Name": "Antonova E.", "AuthorID": "57202034423", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience (IoPPN), King's College London"}}}
