Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.Primary hyperoxaluria type 1 (PH1) is an inherited metabolic disease that culminates in ESRF. Pre-emptive liver transplantation (pLTx) treats the metabolic defect and avoids the need for kidney transplantation (KTx). An institutional experience of pediatric PH1 LTx is reported and compared to the literature. Between 2004 and 2015, eight children underwent pLTx for PH1. Three underwent pLTx with a median GFR of 40 (30-46) mL/min/1.73 m2 and five underwent sequential combined liver-kidney transplantation (cLKTx); all were on RRT at the time of cLKTx. In one case of pLTx, KTx was required eight and a half yr later. pLTx was performed in older (median 8 vs. 2 yr) and larger children (median 27 vs. 7.75 kg) that had a milder PH1 phenotype. In pediatric PH1, pLTx, ideally, should be performed before renal and extrarenal systemic oxalosis complications have occurred, and pLTx can be used early or late. Early is when renal function is preserved with the aim to avoid renal replacement. However, in late (GFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2), the aim is to stabilize renal function and delay the need for KTx. Ultimately, transplant strategy depends on PH1 phenotype, disease stage, child size, and organ availability.", "AuthorKeywords": ["liver transplantation", "pediatric kidney transplant", "pediatric liver transplantation", "primary hyperoxaluria"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Humans", "Hyperoxaluria, Primary", "Infant", "Kidney Failure, Chronic", "Kidney Transplantation", "Liver Transplantation", "Male", "Retrospective Studies", "Time Factors", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84963830436", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Transplantation", "MEDI", "2747"]], "AuthorData": {"24168803500": {"Name": "Khorsandi S.E.", "AuthorID": "24168803500", "AffiliationID": "60029685", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Liver Studies, King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "8635768200": {"Name": "Samyn M.", "AuthorID": "8635768200", "AffiliationID": "60029685", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Liver Studies, King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "55819767200": {"Name": "Hassan A.", "AuthorID": "55819767200", "AffiliationID": "60029685", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Liver Studies, King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57203661849": {"Name": "Vilca-Melendez H.", "AuthorID": "57203661849", "AffiliationID": "60029685", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Liver Studies, King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7403520151": {"Name": "Baker A.", "AuthorID": "7403520151", "AffiliationID": "60029685", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Liver Studies, King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "24545802400": {"Name": "Dhawan A.", "AuthorID": "24545802400", "AffiliationID": "60029685", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Liver Studies, King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7102942546": {"Name": "Heaton N.", "AuthorID": "7102942546", "AffiliationID": "60029685", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Liver Studies, King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7103038181": {"Name": "Waller S.", "AuthorID": "7103038181", "AffiliationID": "60004111, 60107269", "AffiliationName": "Evelina London Children's Hospital, St Thomas's Hospital"}, "6602086650": {"Name": "Koffman G.", "AuthorID": "6602086650", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "22956754100": {"Name": "Shroff R.", "AuthorID": "22956754100", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "7004098195": {"Name": "Van'T Hoff W.", "AuthorID": "7004098195", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital"}}}
