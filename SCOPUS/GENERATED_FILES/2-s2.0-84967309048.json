Together these techniques build up a comprehensive picture of the dopant chemistry in this system. A range of Sb/Rh ratios have been analysed, and it is shown that the Fermi level can be tuned within the band gap through control of dopant stoichiometry, offering the possibility of designing Z-scheme components with specific band offsets. Spontaneous spatial segregation of dopants is measured using TiO2 (110) single crystals. This is shown to have a direct impact on the electronic structure in the region of the semiconductor surface, creating band bending that is expected to be critical for photocatalytic activity of these materials.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Antimony doping", "Diffuse reflectance spectroscopy", "Direct impact", "Extended x-ray absorption fine structure analysis", "Photocatalytic activities", "Semi-conductor surfaces", "Spatial segregation", "X-ray absorption near-edge structure"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84967309048", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment", "ENER", "2105"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"]], "AuthorData": {"7102491205": {"Name": "Glover E.N.K.", "AuthorID": "7102491205", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Chemistry Department, Christopher Ingold Laboratories"}, "57189260109": {"Name": "Ellington S.G.", "AuthorID": "57189260109", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Chemistry Department, Christopher Ingold Laboratories"}, "7006847733": {"Name": "Sankar G.", "AuthorID": "7006847733", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Chemistry Department, Christopher Ingold Laboratories"}, "8227436900": {"Name": "Palgrave R.G.", "AuthorID": "8227436900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Chemistry Department, Christopher Ingold Laboratories"}}}
