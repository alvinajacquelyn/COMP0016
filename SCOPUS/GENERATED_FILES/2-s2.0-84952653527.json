Therefore, smoking habits can be considered part of the non-motor phenotype, preceding the onset of motor PD by several years. Objective: To explore non-motor symptom (NMS) correlates of smoking habits in de novo PD. Methods: This cross-sectional study included 281 newly diagnosed, drug-n\u00e4ive PD subjects, recruited in Naples (Italy) and in Kassel (Germany). All subjects completed the NMS Questionnaire (NMSQ), and were investigated for smoking status (never, current and former smokers) and intensity (pack-years). Results: 140 PD subjects never smoked, 20 currently smoked, and 121 had quit smoking before PD diagnosis. NMSQ total score did not associate with smoking status, but with smoking intensity (p = 0.028; coefficient = 0.088). A multinomial logistic regression stepwise model presenting never smoking as reference, selected as NMSQ correlates of current smoking: sex difficulties (p = 0.002; OR= 5.254), daytime sleepiness (p = 0.046; OR= 0.085), insomnia (p = 0.025; OR= 0.135), and vivid dreams (p = 0.040; OR= 3.110); and of former smoking: swallowing (p = 0.013; OR= 0.311), nausea (p = 0.027; OR= 7.157), unexplained pains (p = 0.002; OR= 3.409), forgetfulness (p = 0.005; OR= 2.592), sex interest (p = 0.007; OR= 0.221), sex difficulties (p = 0.038; OR= 4.215), and daytime sleepiness (p = 0.05; OR= 0.372). An ordinal logistic regression stepwise model selected as NMSQ correlates of smoking intensity: nocturnal restlessness (p = 0.027; coefficient = 0.974), and leg swelling (p = 0.004; coefficient = 1.305). Conclusions: Certain NMSs are associated with different smoking status and intensity, suggesting a variety of adaptive mechanisms to cigarette smoking.", "AuthorKeywords": ["cigarette", "de novo", "motor", "nicotine", "non-motor", "Parkinson", "smoking"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Female", "Germany", "Habits", "Humans", "Italy", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Parkinson Disease", "Smoking"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84952653527", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"]], "AuthorData": {"36461391900": {"Name": "Moccia M.", "AuthorID": "36461391900", "AffiliationID": "60017293", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurosciences, Reproductive Sciences and Odontostomatology, Federico II University"}, "12243453800": {"Name": "Mollenhauer B.", "AuthorID": "12243453800", "AffiliationID": "60021110", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuropathology, University Medical Center Goettingen"}, "36008087300": {"Name": "Erro R.", "AuthorID": "36008087300", "AffiliationID": "60032256", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurological and Movement Sciences, University of Verona"}, "24172711500": {"Name": "Picillo M.", "AuthorID": "24172711500", "AffiliationID": "60007061", "AffiliationName": "Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (CEMAND), Neuroscience Section, Department of Medicine, University of Salerno"}, "7102266387": {"Name": "Barone P.", "AuthorID": "7102266387", "AffiliationID": "60007061", "AffiliationName": "Center for Neurodegenerative Disease-CEMAND, Neuroscience Section, Department of Medicine, University of Salerno"}, "57215205417": {"Name": "Palladino R.", "AuthorID": "57215205417", "AffiliationID": "60017293", "AffiliationName": "Department of Public Health, Federico II University"}}}
