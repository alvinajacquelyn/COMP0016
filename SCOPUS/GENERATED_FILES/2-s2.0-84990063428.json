Verulamium was the third largest Roman city in the province of Britannia \u2013 covering some 81 ha \u2013 and the largest which is currently available for survey. Approximately 65 ha lies under parkland or pasture. The 30 ha available under the Park was the subject of a magnetometry survey in 2013\u20132014, along with smaller areas of ground penetrating radar (GPR), earth resistance and magnetic susceptibility. These surveys were undertaken as part of a community archaeology project funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC). The surveys have detected a wide variety of features including stone buildings of varying size and complexity, pottery kilns, roads, pits and ditches. The results so far suggest the town can be divided into an area of largely elite housing, an area characterised by smaller structures and industrial features, and a somewhat enigmatic magnetically quiet area. Challenges in the interpretation of the results are discussed, as are potential solutions and planned future work.
