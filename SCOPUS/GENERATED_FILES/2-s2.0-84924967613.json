Karger GmbH, Freiburg.Objective: The present study aimed to validate the English version of the Processes of Change questionnaire in weight management (P-Weight). Methods: Participants were 1,087 UK adults, including people enrolled in a behavioural weight management programme, university students and an opportunistic sample. The mean age of the sample was 34.80 (SD = 13.56) years, and 83% were women. BMI ranged from 18.51 to 55.36 (mean = 25.92, SD = 6.26) kg/m2. Participants completed both the stages and processes questionnaires in weight management (S-Weight and P-Weight), and subscales from the EDI-2 and EAT-40. A refined version of the P-Weight consisting of 32 items was obtained based on the item analysis. Results: The internal structure of the scale fitted a four-factor model, and statistically significant correlations with external measures supported the convergent validity of the scale. Conclusion: The adequate psychometric properties of the P-Weight English version suggest that it could be a useful tool to tailor weight management interventions.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Methodology", "Motivation", "Obesity", "Processes", "Validation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Attitude to Health", "Body Mass Index", "Body Weight", "Female", "Great Britain", "Health Behavior", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Obesity", "Psychometrics", "Questionnaires", "Reproducibility of Results", "Students", "Universities", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84924967613", "SubjectAreas": [["Health (social science)", "SOCI", "3306"], ["Physiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2737"]], "AuthorData": {"7102484072": {"Name": "Andr\u00e9s A.", "AuthorID": "7102484072", "AffiliationID": "60001576", "AffiliationName": "Department of Methodology for the Behavioural Sciences, University of Barcelona"}, "6701808126": {"Name": "Salda\u00f1a C.", "AuthorID": "6701808126", "AffiliationID": "60001576", "AffiliationName": "University of Barcelona, Department of Personality, Assessment and Psychological Treatment, Cognition and Behavior (IR3C)"}, "36196242700": {"Name": "Beeken R.", "AuthorID": "36196242700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Health Behaviour Research Centre, Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}}}
