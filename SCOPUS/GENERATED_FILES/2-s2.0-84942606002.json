An adverse reaction to cobalt ions and cobalt-induced lung injury occurs during environmental exposure and is now strictly controlled. Currently adverse reaction occurs to cobalt nanoparticles during wear and tear of metal-on-metal hip implants of which the underlying mechanism is not fully understood. The putative role of the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) pathway in the mechanism of cobalt nanoparticle (Co-NPs) toxicity was examined using the U937 cell line, human alveolar macrophages and monocyte-derived macrophages. Co-NPs (5-20 g/ml)-induced cytotoxicity (viability ranged from 75% to <20% of control, respectively) and reactive oxygen species (ROS), whereas a comparable concentration of cobalt ions (Co(II); up to 350 M) did not. Co-NPs induced HIF-1\u03b1 stabilization. Addition of ascorbic acid (100 \u03bcM) and glutathione (1 mM) both prevented the increased ROS. However, only treatment with ascorbic acid reduced HIF-1\u03b1 levels and prevented cell death, indicating that a ROS-independent pathway is involved in Co-NPs-induced cytotoxicity. Replenishing intracellular ascorbate, which is crucial in preventing HIF pathway activation, modified Co-induced HIF target gene expression and the inflammatory response, by decreasing interleukin-1 beta (IL-1\u03b2) mRNA and protein expression. Addition of glutathione had no effect on Co-NPs-induced HIF target gene expression or inflammatory response. Thus, Co-NPs induce the HIF pathway by depleting intracellular ascorbate, leading to HIF stabilization and pathway activation. This suggests a strong, ROS-independent role for HIF activation in Co-NPs-induced cytotoxicity and a possible role for HIF in metal-on-metal hip implant pathology.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Ascorbic acid", "cobalt nanoparticles", "cytotoxicity", "hypoxia-inducible factor", "macrophages"], "IndexKeywords": ["Ascorbic Acid", "Cell Death", "Cells, Cultured", "Cobalt", "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug", "Glutathione", "Humans", "Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit", "Inflammation", "Macrophages", "Nanoparticles", "Reactive Oxygen Species", "Signal Transduction"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84942606002", "SubjectAreas": [["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"], ["Toxicology", "PHAR", "3005"]], "AuthorData": {"54393816500": {"Name": "Nyga A.", "AuthorID": "54393816500", "AffiliationID": "60010719, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "National Heart and Lung Institute, Imperial College London"}, "7004188920": {"Name": "Tetley T.D.", "AuthorID": "7004188920", "AffiliationID": "60010719, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "National Heart and Lung Institute, Imperial College London"}, "24597673100": {"Name": "Hart A.", "AuthorID": "24597673100", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60024067", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Orthopaedics and Musculoskeletal Science, Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital, University College London"}}}
