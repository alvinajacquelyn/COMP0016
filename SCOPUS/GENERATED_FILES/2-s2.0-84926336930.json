All rights reserved.Purpose of review Genetic discovery has been extremely rapid over the last year, with many new discoveries illuminating novel mechanisms and pathways. In particular, the application of whole exome and whole genome sequencing has identified many new genetic causes of the epilepsies. As such methods become increasingly available, it will be critical for practicing neurologists to be acquainted with them. This review surveys some important developments over the last year. Recent findings The range of tests available to the clinician is wide, and likely soon to be dominated by whole exome and whole genome sequencing. Both whole exome and whole genome sequencing have usually proven to be more powerful than most existing tests. Many new genes have been implicated in the epilepsies, with emerging evidence of the involvement of particular multigene pathways. Summary For the practicing clinician, it will be important to appreciate progress in the field, and to prepare for the application of novel genetic testing in clinical practice, as genetic data are likely to contribute importantly for many people with epilepsy.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Diagnostic", "Epilepsy", "Genetics", "Sequencing", "Testing"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Epilepsy", "Exome", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Genetic Testing", "Genetic Therapy", "Genetic Variation", "Humans"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84926336930", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"7005111176": {"Name": "Sisodiya S.", "AuthorID": "7005111176", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Experimental Epilepsy, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}}}
