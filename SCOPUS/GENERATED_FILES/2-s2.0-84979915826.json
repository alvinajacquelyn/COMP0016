Application of high pressure is known to promote states with higher atomic coordination, but extensive searches for polyhydrides with unusual stoichiometry have had only limited success in spite of several theoretical predictions. Here we report the first observation of the formation of polyhydrides of Na (NaH 3 and NaH 7) above 40 GPa and 2,000 K. We combine synchrotron X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy in a laser-heated diamond anvil cell and theoretical random structure searching, which both agree on the stable structures and compositions. Our results support the formation of multicenter bonding in a material with unusual stoichiometry. These results are applicable to the design of new energetic solids and high-Temperature superconductors based on hydrogen-rich materials.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84979915826", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"7003446873": {"Name": "Struzhkin V.", "AuthorID": "7003446873", "AffiliationID": "60024613", "AffiliationName": "Geophysical Laboratory, Carnegie Institution of Washington"}, "36604552300": {"Name": "Kim D.", "AuthorID": "36604552300", "AffiliationID": "60110749", "AffiliationName": "Center for High Pressure Science and Technology Advanced Research"}, "15849449700": {"Name": "Stavrou E.", "AuthorID": "15849449700", "AffiliationID": "60026175", "AffiliationName": "Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Material Sciences Division"}, "57213316841": {"Name": "Muramatsu T.", "AuthorID": "57213316841", "AffiliationID": "60024613", "AffiliationName": "Geophysical Laboratory, Carnegie Institution of Washington"}, "57203333869": {"Name": "Mao H.", "AuthorID": "57203333869", "AffiliationID": "60110749", "AffiliationName": "Center for High Pressure Science and Technology Advanced Research"}, "16645382200": {"Name": "Goncharov A.", "AuthorID": "16645382200", "AffiliationID": "60024737, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of Materials Physics, Institute of Solid State Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "7006725779": {"Name": "Pickard C.", "AuthorID": "7006725779", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials Science AndMetallurgy, University of Cambridge"}, "7003406428": {"Name": "Needs R.", "AuthorID": "7003406428", "AffiliationID": "60121115", "AffiliationName": "Theory of Condensed Matter Group, Cavendish Laboratory"}, "57203074228": {"Name": "Prakapenka V.", "AuthorID": "57203074228", "AffiliationID": "60074607, 60029278", "AffiliationName": "Center for Advanced Radiation Sources, University of Chicago"}}}
