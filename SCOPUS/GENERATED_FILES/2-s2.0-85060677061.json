Knowledge is multiform, multi-agent and mirrors environmental complexity. Problems characterizing urban sustainability particularly claim non-expert knowledge, being informal, puzzling, uncertain, incomplete, hard to be handled, formalized, modelled. This study utilizes Fuzzy cognitive maps to explore such complexity and support multiagent decisions. It concerns the scenario-building process of the new plan of Taranto (Italy), a paradigmatic example of decaying industrial area, heavily characterized by social fragmentation and environment degradation. This approach aims at structuring environmental problems, modelling future strategies and contributing to build a multi-agent decision support system for complex urban planning contexts.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Decision support systems", "Environmental complex systems", "Fuzzy Cognitive Maps", "Participatory approach", "Policy Making", "Urban policy"], "IndexKeywords": ["Environmental complexity", "Environmental problems", "Fuzzy cognitive map", "Fuzzy cognitive mappings", "Participatory approach", "Policy making", "Urban policy", "Urban sustainability"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85060677061", "SubjectAreas": [["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"], ["Civil and Structural Engineering", "ENGI", "2205"], ["Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment", "ENER", "2105"], ["Transportation", "SOCI", "3313"]], "AuthorData": {"55872771600": {"Name": "Pluchinotta I.", "AuthorID": "55872771600", "AffiliationID": "60106033, 60021199", "AffiliationName": "Water Research Institute (IRSA) \u2013 National Research Council (CNR)"}, "57021136700": {"Name": "Esposito D.", "AuthorID": "57021136700", "AffiliationID": "60022778", "AffiliationName": "DICATECh, Technical University of Bari"}, "13008459800": {"Name": "Camarda D.", "AuthorID": "13008459800", "AffiliationID": "60022778", "AffiliationName": "DICATECh, Technical University of Bari"}}}
