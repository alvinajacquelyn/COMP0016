This spatial reconsideration mirrors a conceptual move beyond community media labels and normative criteria, towards a privileging of context. To illustrate both points, the article centres around \u2018animation,\u2019 the practice of enlivening social situations. Animation is central to community radio in Abidjan, but \u2018animateurs\u2019 also practise their trade in a multitude of venues and events around the city. Following animation\u2019s movements between on- and off-air provides an understanding of how community radio is assembled as a porous \u2018micro-public\u2019, and insight into the particular kind of sociability that it produces. The article shows that while this sociability is tinged with the quest for status and social capital, it is mostly characterized by indeterminacy, and valued for the unforeseen encounters it can foster.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Abidjan", "African urbanism", "animation", "communicative assemblage", "community media", "C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire", "sociability", "urban encounter"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85040162598", "SubjectAreas": [["Cultural Studies", "SOCI", "3316"]], "AuthorData": {"57189360916": {"Name": "Cante F.", "AuthorID": "57189360916", "AffiliationID": "60003059", "AffiliationName": "London School of Economics and Political Science"}}}
