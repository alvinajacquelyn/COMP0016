Theoretical derivation of the method is presented, and its validity conditions are provided. The object is assumed to be quasihomogeneous, i.e., to feature a ratio between the refractive index and the linear attenuation coefficient that is approximately constant across the field of view. The method is experimentally demonstrated on a plastics phantom and on biological samples using a continuous rotation acquisition scheme achieving scan times of a few minutes. Moreover, we show that such acquisition times can be further reduced with the use of a high-efficiency photon-counting detector. Thanks to its ability to substantially simplify the image-acquisition procedure and greatly reduce collection times, we believe this method represents a very important step towards the application of XPCI to real-world problems.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Biological samples", "Continuous rotation", "Linear attenuation coefficients", "Photon counting detectors", "Real-world problem", "Theoretical derivations", "X ray phase contrast", "X-ray phase-contrast imaging"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85018249178", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"35733519000": {"Name": "Diemoz P.C.", "AuthorID": "35733519000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, UCL"}, "55508570900": {"Name": "Hagen C.K.", "AuthorID": "55508570900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, UCL"}, "35067989100": {"Name": "Endrizzi M.", "AuthorID": "35067989100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, UCL"}, "7004072469": {"Name": "Olivo A.", "AuthorID": "7004072469", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, UCL"}, "6506157206": {"Name": "Minuti M.", "AuthorID": "6506157206", "AffiliationID": "60113665", "AffiliationName": "INFN, Pisa Section"}, "56212778300": {"Name": "Bellazzini R.", "AuthorID": "56212778300", "AffiliationID": "60113665", "AffiliationName": "INFN, Pisa Section"}, "35076756500": {"Name": "Urbani L.", "AuthorID": "35076756500", "AffiliationID": "60018207, 60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL, Institute of Child Health and Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "57203257829": {"Name": "De Coppi P.", "AuthorID": "57203257829", "AffiliationID": "60018207, 60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL, Institute of Child Health and Great Ormond Street Hospital"}}}
