Based on making full use of advantages of Sparse Preserving Projection (SPP) on feature extraction, the discriminant information was introduced into SPP to arrive at a novel supervised feather extraction method that named Uncorrelated Discriminant SPP (UDSPP) algorithm. The obtained projection with the method by sparse preserving intra-class and maximizing distance inter-class can effectively express discriminant information, while preserving local neighbor relationship. Moreover, statistics uncorrelated constraint was also added to decrease redundancy among feature vectors so as to obtain more information as possible with little vectors as possible. The experimental results show that the recognition rate improved compared with SPP. The method is also superior to recognition methods based on Euclidean distance in processing face database in light.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Face recognition", "Feature extraction", "Sparse preserving projection", "Statistical uncorrelated restraint"], "IndexKeywords": ["Discriminant informations", "Euclidean distance", "Extraction method", "Face recognition methods", "Recognition methods", "Sparse preserving projection", "Statistical uncorrelated restraint", "Uncorrelated constraints"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84940880039", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Media Technology", "ENGI", "2214"], ["Hardware and Architecture", "COMP", "1708"], ["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"]], "AuthorData": {"36184386900": {"Name": "Chen Z.", "AuthorID": "36184386900", "AffiliationID": "60088263", "AffiliationName": "School of Computer Science and Technology, Zhoukou Normal University"}, "56818149700": {"Name": "Huang W.", "AuthorID": "56818149700", "AffiliationID": "113050593", "AffiliationName": "School of Computer and Communication Engineering, Light Engineering Institutes of Zhengzhou"}, "55925162500": {"Name": "Lv Z.", "AuthorID": "55925162500", "AffiliationID": "60019499", "AffiliationName": "SIAT, Chinese Academy of Science"}}}
