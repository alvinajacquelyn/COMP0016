The audience did not question that lobectomy could be done safely and as completely by videothoracoscopic techniques provided it was in expert and practiced hands and suitable patients. The question addressed here is whether video-assisted thoracic surgery can replace thoracotomy as a standard of care in patients suitable for either approach. To determine which provides the better outcome in terms of long-term survival with equivalent quality of life, would require direct comparison in pragmatic randomized controlled trials.", "AuthorKeywords": ["lobectomy", "lung cancer", "randomized trials", "thoracic surgery", "videothoracoscopic lobectomy"], "IndexKeywords": ["Humans", "Laparoscopy", "Lung Neoplasms", "Pneumonectomy", "Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic", "Thoracic Surgery, Video-Assisted", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84998679693", "SubjectAreas": [["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Cancer Research", "BIOC", "1306"]], "AuthorData": {"57196678944": {"Name": "Treasure T.", "AuthorID": "57196678944", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Operational Research Unit, University College London"}}}
