Here, we demonstrate in male mice, that at the granule cell (GrC)-molecular layer interneuron (MLI)-Purkinje cell (PC) pathway of the cerebellar cortex, E/I balance is dynamically controlled by short-term dynamics during bursts of stimuli, shaping cerebellar output. Using a combination of electrophysiological recordings, optogenetic stimulation, and modeling, we describe the wide range of bidirectional changes in PC discharge triggered by GrC bursts, from robust excitation to complete inhibition. At high frequency (200 Hz), increasing the number of pulses in a burst (from 3 to 7) can switch a net inhibition of PC to a net excitation. Measurements of EPSCs and IPSCs during bursts and modeling showed that this feature can be explained by the interplay between short-term dynamics of the GrC-MLI-PC pathway and E/I balance impinging on PC. Our findings demonstrate that PC firing rate is highly sensitive to the duration of GrC bursts, which may define a temporal-to-rate code transformation in the cerebellar cortex.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Burst coding", "Excitation", "Feedforward inhibition", "Inhibition balance", "Purkinje cell", "Short-term dynamics"], "IndexKeywords": ["Algorithms", "Animals", "Cerebellar Cortex", "Cerebellum", "Computer Simulation", "Excitatory Postsynaptic Potentials", "Interneurons", "Male", "Mice", "Nerve Net", "Neuronal Plasticity", "Photic Stimulation", "Purkinje Cells", "Signal Transduction"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85050790868", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"]], "AuthorData": {"57197757481": {"Name": "Grangeray-Vilmint A.", "AuthorID": "57197757481", "AffiliationID": "60103368, 60157969, 60008134", "AffiliationName": "Institut des Neurosciences Cellulaires et Int\u00e9gratives, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Universit\u00e9 de Strasbourg"}, "54908741500": {"Name": "Valera A.M.", "AuthorID": "54908741500", "AffiliationID": "60103368, 60157969, 60008134", "AffiliationName": "Institut des Neurosciences Cellulaires et Int\u00e9gratives, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Universit\u00e9 de Strasbourg"}, "6602366495": {"Name": "Isope P.", "AuthorID": "6602366495", "AffiliationID": "60103368, 60157969, 60008134", "AffiliationName": "Institut des Neurosciences Cellulaires et Int\u00e9gratives, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Universit\u00e9 de Strasbourg"}, "36067154300": {"Name": "Kumar A.", "AuthorID": "36067154300", "AffiliationID": "60002014", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computational Science and Technology, School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, KTH Royal Institute of Technology"}}}
