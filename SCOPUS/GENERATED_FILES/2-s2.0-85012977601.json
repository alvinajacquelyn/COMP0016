Using data on advisor\u2013advisee pairs, we find that intergenerational field similarity is more prevalent in larger and successful fields. We then show that researchers who do choose different fields than those of their advisors are more likely to switch to highly demanded fields in the job market. These results are consistent with the equilibrium of a model in which advisors\u2019 have concerns for their advisees\u2019 socialization and production outcomes. We also document a positive relation between field productivity and the median level of co-authorship at the field level, which is consistent with complementaries between socialization and productive efforts.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Advisor\u2013advisee relationships", "Economics fields", "Field productivity in economics", "Intergenerational field mobility"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85012977601", "SubjectAreas": [["Finance", "ECON", "2003"], ["Economics and Econometrics", "ECON", "2002"]], "AuthorData": {"6507259939": {"Name": "Albornoz F.", "AuthorID": "6507259939", "AffiliationID": "118107079", "AffiliationName": "IIEP-CONICET"}, "6602192383": {"Name": "Cabrales A.", "AuthorID": "6602192383", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "6603124912": {"Name": "Hauk E.", "AuthorID": "6603124912", "AffiliationID": "60017553, 60105207", "AffiliationName": "Instituto de An\u00e1lisis Econ\u00f3mico (IAE-CSIC), Move and Barcelona Graduate School of Economics"}, "56413078200": {"Name": "Warnes P.E.", "AuthorID": "56413078200", "AffiliationID": "60030162", "AffiliationName": "Columbia University"}}}
