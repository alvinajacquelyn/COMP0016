However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here we demonstrate that feedback pathways from higher brain areas mediate optimized encoding of naturalistic stimuli via temporal whitening in the weakly electric fish Apteronotus leptorhynchus. While one source of direct feedback uniformly enhances neural responses, a separate source of indirect feedback selectively attenuates responses to low frequencies, thus creating a high-pass neural tuning curve that opposes the decaying spectral power of natural stimuli. Additionally, we recorded from two populations of higher brain neurons responsible for the direct and indirect descending inputs. While one population displayed broadband tuning, the other displayed high-pass tuning and thus performed temporal whitening. Hence, our results demonstrate a novel function for descending input in optimizing neural responses to sensory input through temporal whitening that is likely to be conserved across systems and species.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Brain", "Electric Fish", "Electric Stimulation", "Feedback", "Lateral Line System", "Perception", "Pyramidal Cells", "Sensory Receptor Cells"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85054761293", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Immunology and Microbiology (all)", "IMMU", "2400"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"57189597704": {"Name": "Huang C.", "AuthorID": "57189597704", "AffiliationID": "60002494", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physiology, McGill University"}, "24314699700": {"Name": "Metzen M.", "AuthorID": "24314699700", "AffiliationID": "60002494", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physiology, McGill University"}, "6701543076": {"Name": "Chacron M.", "AuthorID": "6701543076", "AffiliationID": "60002494", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physiology, McGill University"}}}
