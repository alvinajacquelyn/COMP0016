The approximation space is enriched with carefully chosen oscillatory basis functions; these are selected via a study of the high frequency asymptotic behaviour of the solution. We demonstrate via a rigorous error analysis, supported by numerical examples, that to achieve any desired accuracy it is sufficient for the number of degrees of freedom to grow only in proportion to the logarithm of the frequency as the frequency increases, in contrast to the at least linear growth required by conventional methods. This appears to be the first such numerical analysis result for any problem of scattering by a nonconvex obstacle. Our analysis is based on new frequency-explicit bounds on the normal derivative of the solution on the boundary and on its analytic continuation into the complex plane.", "AuthorKeywords": ["65N38", "65R20", "78A45", "78M15", "78M35"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84930759702", "SubjectAreas": [["Computational Mathematics", "MATH", "2605"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"7003398032": {"Name": "Chandler-Wilde S.N.", "AuthorID": "7003398032", "AffiliationID": "60012197", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics and Statistics, University of Reading"}, "36637487000": {"Name": "Hewett D.P.", "AuthorID": "36637487000", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Mathematical Institute, University of Oxford"}, "15520824000": {"Name": "Langdon S.", "AuthorID": "15520824000", "AffiliationID": "60012197", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics and Statistics, University of Reading"}, "56216180400": {"Name": "Twigger A.", "AuthorID": "56216180400", "AffiliationID": "60012197", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics and Statistics, University of Reading"}}}
