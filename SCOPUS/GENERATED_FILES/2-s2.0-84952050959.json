The Biot's equations are formulated in displacements (or u - w) assuming an elastic solid skeleton. The free surface location and its evolution in time are obtained by interpolation of pore water pressures throughout the domain. Shape functions based on the principle of local maximum entropy are chosen for the meshfree approximation schemes. In order to avoid the locking involved in the fluid phase of the porous media, a B-bar based algorithm is devised to compute the average volumetric strain in a patch composed of various integration points. The efficiency of such an implementation for one phase problems is shown through the Benchmark problem, Cook's membrane loaded by a distributive shear load. The proposed methodology is firstly applied to various classical examples in unconfined steady seepage problems through earth dams, then to the dynamic consolidation of a soil column. The results obtained for both problems are quite satisfactory and demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method in solving coupled problems in porous media.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Free surface", "Meshfree", "Seepage", "u - w formulation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Approximation scheme", "Bench-mark problems", "Dynamic consolidation", "Free surfaces", "Meshfree", "Pore-water pressures", "Steady and transient", "Unconfined seepage"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84952050959", "SubjectAreas": [["Computational Mechanics", "ENGI", "2206"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Geotechnical Engineering and Engineering Geology", "EART", "1909"], ["Mechanics of Materials", "ENGI", "2211"]], "AuthorData": {"54389848000": {"Name": "Navas P.", "AuthorID": "54389848000", "AffiliationID": "60000823", "AffiliationName": "School of Civil Engineering, University of Castilla-La Mancha"}, "7401436066": {"Name": "Yu R.C.", "AuthorID": "7401436066", "AffiliationID": "60000823", "AffiliationName": "School of Civil Engineering, University of Castilla-La Mancha"}, "57203544711": {"Name": "L\u00f3pez-Querol S.", "AuthorID": "57203544711", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil, Environmental and Geomatic Engineering, University College London"}, "55271597400": {"Name": "Li B.", "AuthorID": "55271597400", "AffiliationID": "60000305", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, Case Western Reserve University"}}}
