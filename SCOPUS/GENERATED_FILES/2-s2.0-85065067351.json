Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a major cause of chronic liver disease and associated morbidity and mortality worldwide. Short-course, oral, curative, direct-acting antiviral regimens have transformed treatment for HCV infection. Since the 2016 launch of the first global strategy towards elimination of viral hepatitis as a public health threat by 2030, the predominant focus of the global response has been on the treatment of adults, who bear the greatest burden of morbidity and mortality of HCV-related chronic liver disease. Compared with adults, there has been little attention paid to addressing the response to HCV in children and adolescents, in part because of the scarcity of data to inform specific paediatric management practices and policy. In this Series paper, we summarise knowledge on the epidemiology, natural history, and treatment of chronic HCV infection in adolescents and children, and we highlight key differences from infection acquired in adulthood. The estimated global prevalence and burden of HCV infection in children aged 1\u201319 years is 0\u00b715%, corresponding to 3\u00b75 million people (95% CI 3\u00b71\u20133\u00b79 million). HCV infection is usually asymptomatic during childhood, and cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma are rare. Sofosbuvir with ledipasvir and sofosbuvir with ribavirin have received regulatory approval and guidelines recommend their use in adolescents aged 12 years and older with HCV infection. In April, 2019, glecaprevir with pibrentasvir also received regulatory approval for adolescents aged 12\u201317 years. Key actions to address the current policy gaps and achieve treatment scale-up that is comparable to that in adults include: establishment of a campaign on access to testing and treatment that is targeted at children and adolescents; fast-track evaluation of pan-genotypic regimens; and accelerated approval of paediatric formulations. Research gaps that need to be addressed include: age-specific prevalence studies of HCV viraemia in priority countries; further validation of non-invasive tests for staging of liver disease in children; and establishment of paediatric treatment registries and international consortia to promote collaborative research agendas.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Alanine Transaminase", "Antiviral Agents", "Aspartate Aminotransferases", "Child", "Clinical Trials as Topic", "Elasticity Imaging Techniques", "Female", "Harm Reduction", "Hepatitis B", "Hepatitis B Surface Antigens", "Humans", "Infectious Disease Transmission, Vertical", "Liver Cirrhosis", "Practice Guidelines as Topic", "Pregnancy", "Pregnancy Complications, Infectious"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85065067351", "SubjectAreas": [["Hepatology", "MEDI", "2721"], ["Gastroenterology", "MEDI", "2715"]], "AuthorData": {"14008523300": {"Name": "Indolfi G.", "AuthorID": "14008523300", "AffiliationID": "60073284", "AffiliationName": "Paediatric and Liver Unit, Meyer Children's University Hospital of Florence"}, "35313767600": {"Name": "Easterbrook P.", "AuthorID": "35313767600", "AffiliationID": "60027142", "AffiliationName": "Global Hepatitis Programme and HIV Department, World Health Organization"}, "7006690213": {"Name": "Bulterys M.", "AuthorID": "7006690213", "AffiliationID": "60027142", "AffiliationName": "Global Hepatitis Programme and HIV Department, World Health Organization"}, "57192121240": {"Name": "Penazzato M.", "AuthorID": "57192121240", "AffiliationID": "60027142", "AffiliationName": "Global Hepatitis Programme and HIV Department, World Health Organization"}, "7006885162": {"Name": "Dusheiko G.", "AuthorID": "7006885162", "AffiliationID": "60029950", "AffiliationName": "University College London Medical School"}, "7202415889": {"Name": "El-Sayed M.H.", "AuthorID": "7202415889", "AffiliationID": "60015323", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Ain Shams University"}, "13310384300": {"Name": "Jonas M.M.", "AuthorID": "13310384300", "AffiliationID": "60030521", "AffiliationName": "Division of Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition, Boston Children's Hospital"}, "7101873678": {"Name": "Thorne C.", "AuthorID": "7101873678", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "57193359327": {"Name": "Siberry G.", "AuthorID": "57193359327", "AffiliationID": "60020872", "AffiliationName": "Office of the US Global AIDS Coordinator, US Department of State"}, "24069550300": {"Name": "Walsh N.", "AuthorID": "24069550300", "AffiliationID": "60027142, 60014013", "AffiliationName": "Pan American Health Organization, World Health Organization Regional Office for the Americas"}, "7404503779": {"Name": "Chang M.H.", "AuthorID": "7404503779", "AffiliationID": "60073385", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatrics, National Taiwan University Hospital"}, "7004842449": {"Name": "Meyers T.", "AuthorID": "7004842449", "AffiliationID": "60016218", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatrics and Child Health, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of the Witwatersrand"}, "7006585659": {"Name": "Giaquinto C.", "AuthorID": "7006585659", "AffiliationID": "60000481", "AffiliationName": "Department of Women and Child Health, University of Padova"}, "55539918800": {"Name": "Wirth S.", "AuthorID": "55539918800", "AffiliationID": "60022113", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatrics, Helios Medical Centre Wuppertal, Witten-Herdecke University"}, "57191633367": {"Name": "Chan P.L.", "AuthorID": "57191633367", "AffiliationID": "60027142", "AffiliationName": "World Health Organization Regional Office for the Western Pacific"}}}
