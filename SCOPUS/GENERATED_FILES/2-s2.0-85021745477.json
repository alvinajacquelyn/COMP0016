It is thought that some of this so-called \u201curbanicity effect\u201d can be explained by the perceived quality of the living environment. The two studies reported here used online survey methods to explore changes to self-reported psychological mechanisms thought to underpin mental health and well-being before and after participants briefly contemplated urban/rural or desirable/undesirable residential images. Our findings demonstrate that even brief contemplation of places change how we consider our futures and that places deemed relatively undesirable appear to promote a threat-focused anticipatory set. Importantly, these changes were not found to be associated with perceived urbanity but rather with perceived desirability of place. These findings should be considered alongside increasing evidence that urban regeneration and place-making are matters of public health concern.", "AuthorKeywords": ["desirable neighborhoods", "mental health and well-being", "psychological mechanisms", "urban/rural"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85021745477", "SubjectAreas": [["Arts and Humanities (all)", "ARTS", "1200"], ["Social Sciences (all)", "SOCI", "3300"]], "AuthorData": {"7006177424": {"Name": "Corcoran R.", "AuthorID": "7006177424", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "University of Liverpool"}, "57194704583": {"Name": "Mansfield R.", "AuthorID": "57194704583", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "University of Liverpool"}, "57194705351": {"Name": "Giokas T.", "AuthorID": "57194705351", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "University of Liverpool"}, "57194709068": {"Name": "Hawkins A.", "AuthorID": "57194709068", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "University of Liverpool"}, "57194708858": {"Name": "Bamford L.", "AuthorID": "57194708858", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "University of Liverpool"}, "57194590007": {"Name": "Marshall G.", "AuthorID": "57194590007", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Prosocial Place"}}}
