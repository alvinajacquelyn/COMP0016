The constitutive equations of both steels and ice materials should be characterised for numerical computations as the collision impact energy is dissipated by the two colliding and deformable bodies, namely not only ships or offshore platforms but also icebergs. The primary objective of the present study is to examine ice properties and propose a constitutive equation of ice materials which shall be implemented into nonlinear finite element method computations of the structural crashworthiness associated with the collisions. Previous studies are first surveyed in terms of the influencing parameters as the many uncertainties involved make the problem highly complex. The parameters affecting the mechanical properties of ice materials are then discussed. In addition to referencing the existing test database associated with the mechanical properties of ice materials, a new test database is obtained by laboratory testing of the authors\u2019 group. Based on findings from the existing and the new test database, a new constitutive equation used for ice materials is proposed associated with quasi-static and impact responses.", "AuthorKeywords": ["constitutive equation on ice materials", "ice material, structural crashworthiness", "impact", "Johnson\u2013Cook constitutive equation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Ice materials", "impact", "Influencing parameters", "Nonlinear finite element method", "Numerical computations", "Off shore platforms", "Structural crashworthiness", "Structural deformation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84974823922", "SubjectAreas": [["Ocean Engineering", "ENGI", "2212"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"]], "AuthorData": {"56589681700": {"Name": "Ince S.", "AuthorID": "56589681700", "AffiliationID": "60019963", "AffiliationName": "Department of Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering, Yildiz Technical University"}, "57211377704": {"Name": "Kumar A.", "AuthorID": "57211377704", "AffiliationID": "60008783", "AffiliationName": "The Korea Ship and Offshore Research Institute (The Lloyd's Register Foundation Research Centre of Excellence), Pusan National University"}, "35821146600": {"Name": "Paik J.", "AuthorID": "35821146600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}}}
