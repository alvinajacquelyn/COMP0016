Audiol.", "Volume": "29", "Issue": 1, "Art.No": null, "PageStart": 5, "PageEnd": 14, "CitedBy": 6, "DOI": "10.3766/jaaa.15098", "Link": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85040185832&origin=inward", "Abstract": "Background: Despite the well-established relationship between aging and auditory processing decline, identifying the extent to which age effect is the main factor on auditory processing performance remains a great challenge due to the co-occurrence of age-related hearing loss and age-related cognitive decline as potential confounding factors. Purpose: To investigate the effects of age-related hearing loss and working memory on the clinical evaluation of auditory processing of middle-aged and elderly. Research Design: Cross-sectional study. Study Sample: A total of 77 adults between 50 and 70 yr of age were invited to participate in the study. Data Collection and Analysis: The participants were recruited from a larger study that focused on the assessment and management of sensory and cognitive skills in elderly participants. Only participants with normal hearing or mild-to-moderate age-related hearing loss, with no evidence of cognitive, psychological, or neurological conditions were included. Speech-in-noise, dichotic digit, and frequency pattern tests were conducted as well as a working memory test. The hearing loss effect was investigated using an audibility index, calculated from the audiometric threshold. The performance on the digit span test was used to investigate working memory effects. Both hearing loss and working memory effects were investigated via correlation and regression analyses, partialling out age effects. The significance level was set at p, 0.05. Results: The results demonstrated that, while hearing loss was associated to the speech-in-noise performance, working memory was associated to the frequency pattern and dichotic digit performances. Regression analyses confirmed the relative contribution of hearing loss to the variance in speech-in-noise and working memory test to the variance in frequency pattern and dichotic digit test performance. Conclusions: The performance decline of the elderly in auditory processing tests may be partially attributable to the working memory performance and, consequently, to the cognitive decline exhibited by this population. Mild-to-moderate hearing loss seems to affect performance on specific auditory processing tasks, such as speech in noise, reinforcing the idea that auditory processing disorder in the elderly might also be associated to auditory peripheral deficits.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cognition", "Elderly", "Hearing"], "IndexKeywords": ["Age Factors", "Aged", "Aging", "Audiometry", "Auditory Perception", "Auditory Perceptual Disorders", "Brazil", "Cognitive Dysfunction", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Female", "Hearing Loss, Sensorineural", "Hearing Tests", "Humans", "Male", "Memory, Short-Term", "Middle Aged", "Multivariate Analysis", "Prognosis", "Regression Analysis", "Risk Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85040185832", "SubjectAreas": [["Speech and Hearing", "HEAL", "3616"]], "AuthorData": {"22956179200": {"Name": "Murphy C.", "AuthorID": "22956179200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "16639594400": {"Name": "Rabelo C.", "AuthorID": "16639594400", "AffiliationID": "60008088", "AffiliationName": "University of S\u00e3o Paulo"}, "53464212000": {"Name": "Silagi M.", "AuthorID": "53464212000", "AffiliationID": "60008088", "AffiliationName": "University of S\u00e3o Paulo"}, "7005418512": {"Name": "Mansur L.", "AuthorID": "7005418512", "AffiliationID": "60008088", "AffiliationName": "University of S\u00e3o Paulo"}, "6602370646": {"Name": "Schochat E.", "AuthorID": "6602370646", "AffiliationID": "60008088", "AffiliationName": "University of S\u00e3o Paulo"}, "6701719104": {"Name": "Bamiou D.", "AuthorID": "6701719104", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
