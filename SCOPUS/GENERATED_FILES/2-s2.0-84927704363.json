The resulting datasets are conveniently formatted to allow easy alignment of significant hits to genes and genetic features, however; methods that parse significant hits into discreet differentially methylated regions (DMRs) remain a challenge to implement. In this paper we present details of a novel DMR caller, the Probe Lasso: a flexible window based approach that gathers neighbouring significant-signals to define clear DMR boundaries for subsequent in-depth analysis. The method is implemented in the R package ChAMP (Morris et al., 2014) and returns sets of DMRs according to user-tuned levels of probe filtering (e.g., inclusion of sex chromosomes, polymorphisms) and probe-lasso size distribution. Using a sub-sample of colon cancer- and healthy colon-samples from TCGA we show that Probe Lasso shifts DMR calling away from just probe-dense regions, and calls a range of DMR sizes ranging from tens-of-bases to tens-of-kilobases in scale. Moreover, using TCGA data we show that Probe Lasso leverages more information from the array and highlights a potential role of hypomethylated transcription factor binding motifs not discoverable using a basic, fixed-window approach.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Differentially methylated regions", "DNA methylation", "Epigenetics", "EWAS", "Illumina 450K BeadChip"], "IndexKeywords": ["Algorithms", "CpG Islands", "Data Interpretation, Statistical", "Datasets as Topic", "DNA Methylation", "Epigenomics", "Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis", "Software"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84927704363", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"8901700200": {"Name": "Butcher L.", "AuthorID": "8901700200", "AffiliationID": "60109234, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Cancer Institute, University College London"}, "57193033325": {"Name": "Beck S.", "AuthorID": "57193033325", "AffiliationID": "60109234, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Cancer Institute, University College London"}}}
