The framework considers procurement of feedstocks, plantation of energy crops, and different modes for transportation of feedstocks and final products. The mathematical framework allows researches and policy makers to investigate scenarios that promote the development of BioSNG supply chains in a regional and/or national context. The capabilities of the proposed model are illustrated through the implementation of a set of case studies based on the UK. The results revealed that domestic resources in the UK can supply up to 21.4% of the total gas demand projected by the UK National Grid in the scenario \u201cSlow progression\u201d for a planning horizon of 20 years. However, despite the considerable potential for production of BioSNG, the role of the government through subsidisation schemes such as feed-in tariff and Renewable Obligation Certificates (ROCs) is crucial in order to make the development of these resources economically attractive for private sectors.", "AuthorKeywords": ["BioSNG supply chains", "Feed-in tariffs", "Mixed integer linear programming", "Renewable obligation certificates", "Renewable resources"], "IndexKeywords": ["Feed-in tariff", "Mathematical frameworks", "Mixed integer linear programming", "Mixed integer linear programming model", "Renewable obligation certificates", "Renewable resource", "Spatially explicit", "Synthetic natural gas"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85006757651", "SubjectAreas": [["Building and Construction", "ENGI", "2215"], ["Energy (all)", "ENER", "2100"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"], ["Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law", "ENVI", "2308"]], "AuthorData": {"56810581700": {"Name": "Calder\u00f3n A.J.", "AuthorID": "56810581700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "7003608896": {"Name": "Papageorgiou L.G.", "AuthorID": "7003608896", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "15018959900": {"Name": "Agnolucci P.", "AuthorID": "15018959900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Sustainable Resources, University College London"}}}
