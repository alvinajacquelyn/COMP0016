Based on previous studies identifying a causative role for anti-cytokine autoantibodies in patients with opportunistic infections, we explored this possibility in PHN. Methods: Sera from herpes zoster (HZ) patients without and with PHN (N = 115 and 83, respectively) were examined for the presence of autoantibodies against multiple cytokines, and other known autoantigens. In addition, a cohort of patients with complex regional pain syndrome or neuropathic pain was tested for autoantibodies against selected cytokines. Antibody levels against VZV, Epstein Barr virus, and herpes simplex virus-2 were also measured in the HZ and PHN patients. Patient sera with high levels of anti-cytokine autoantibodies were functionally tested for in vitro neutralizing activity. Results: Six PHN subjects demonstrated markedly elevated levels of single, autoantibodies against interferon-a\u03b1, interferon-\u03b3, GM-CSF, or interleukin-6. In contrast, the HZ and the pain control group showed low or no autoantibodies, respectively, against these four cytokines. Further analysis revealed that one PHN patient with high levels of anti-interleukin-6 autoantibodies had a markedly depressed antibody level to VZV, potentially reflecting poor T cell immunity against VZV. In vitro functional testing revealed that three of the five anti-cytokine autoantibody positive PHN subjects had neutralizing autoantibodies against interferon-a\u03b1, GM-CSF or interleukin-6. In contrast, none of the HZ patients without PHN had neutralizing autoantibodies. Conclusions: These results suggest the possibility that sporadic anti-cytokine autoantibodies in some subjects may cause an autoimmune immunodeficiency syndrome leading to uncontrolled VZV reactivation, nerve damage and subsequent PHN.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Anti-cytokine autoantibodies", "Herpes zoster (HZ)", "Opportunistic infection", "Pain", "PHN", "Shingles", "Varicella zoster virus (VZV)"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Autoantibodies", "Cohort Studies", "Complex Regional Pain Syndromes", "Cytokines", "Female", "Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor", "Herpes Zoster", "Herpesvirus 3, Human", "Humans", "Interferon-alpha", "Interferon-gamma", "Interleukin-6", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Neuralgia", "Neuralgia, Postherpetic", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84945183877", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"57191626499": {"Name": "Bayat A.", "AuthorID": "57191626499", "AffiliationID": "60006577", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Center, National Institutes of Health, Department of Perioperative Medicine"}, "6701605107": {"Name": "Mannes A.", "AuthorID": "6701605107", "AffiliationID": "60006577", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Center, National Institutes of Health, Department of Perioperative Medicine"}, "7006175753": {"Name": "Iadarola M.", "AuthorID": "7006175753", "AffiliationID": "60006577", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Center, National Institutes of Health, Department of Perioperative Medicine"}, "7003562773": {"Name": "Burbelo P.", "AuthorID": "7003562773", "AffiliationID": "60023653, 60006577", "AffiliationName": "National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research, National Institutes of Health, Dental Clinical Research Core"}, "36463102100": {"Name": "Browne S.", "AuthorID": "36463102100", "AffiliationID": "60017336, 60006577", "AffiliationName": "National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Laboratory of Clinical Infectious Diseases"}, "56358210000": {"Name": "Martinez B.", "AuthorID": "56358210000", "AffiliationID": "60017336, 60006577", "AffiliationName": "National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Laboratory of Clinical Infectious Diseases"}, "7201492425": {"Name": "Holland S.", "AuthorID": "7201492425", "AffiliationID": "60017336, 60006577", "AffiliationName": "National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Laboratory of Clinical Infectious Diseases"}, "35615105900": {"Name": "Quinlivan M.", "AuthorID": "35615105900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Division of Infection and Immunity"}, "55498702100": {"Name": "Breuer J.", "AuthorID": "55498702100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Division of Infection and Immunity"}, "6602953346": {"Name": "Buvanendran A.", "AuthorID": "6602953346", "AffiliationID": "60018691", "AffiliationName": "Rush University Medical Center, Department of Anesthesiology"}, "7007067003": {"Name": "Kroin J.", "AuthorID": "7007067003", "AffiliationID": "60018691", "AffiliationName": "Rush University Medical Center, Department of Anesthesiology"}, "57202543117": {"Name": "Cohen J.", "AuthorID": "57202543117", "AffiliationID": "60017336, 60006577", "AffiliationName": "National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Laboratory of Infectious Diseases"}}}
