The sample consisted of 417 participants, 387 (29.71% male) healthy participants (control group: M = 35.5 years; SD = 8.40) and 30 (36.66% female) patients (clinical group: M = 35.8 years; SD = 12.94). The internal consistency evaluated through Cronbach' Alpha was 0.95 for the Total Score in both subsamples. The test-retest reliability (two weeks) for Total Score was 0.86 (F = 13.2, p \u2264 .001) for the non-clinical subsample, and 0.95 (F = 36.5, p \u2264 .001) for the clinical subsample. Confirmatory factor analyses supported the initial three-factor model. However, modifications to the initial three-factor model improved the goodness-of-fit indices. Results showed statistically significant differences in the mean scores of the Burns-A between the clinical and control groups. This study supports the Spanish version of the Burns-A as a brief and useful tool for the screening of anxiety symptoms in adult populations. Future studies should investigate measurement invariance across cultures.", "AuthorKeywords": ["anxiety", "burns-a", "psychometric properties", "self-report", "validation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Anxiety", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Psychiatric Status Rating Scales", "Psychometrics", "Reproducibility of Results", "Spain", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84965110680", "SubjectAreas": [["Language and Linguistics", "ARTS", "1203"], ["Psychology (all)", "PSYC", "3200"], ["Linguistics and Language", "SOCI", "3310"]], "AuthorData": {"55936660400": {"Name": "Ortu\u00f1o-Sierra J.", "AuthorID": "55936660400", "AffiliationID": "60012329", "AffiliationName": "Universidad de La Rioja (Spain)"}, "57189099543": {"Name": "Rodr\u00edguez L.", "AuthorID": "57189099543", "AffiliationID": "60012329", "AffiliationName": "Universidad de La Rioja (Spain)"}, "8724552100": {"Name": "Debban\u00e9 M.", "AuthorID": "8724552100", "AffiliationID": "60012329", "AffiliationName": "Universidad de La Rioja (Spain)"}, "17433855700": {"Name": "Fonseca-Pedrero E.", "AuthorID": "17433855700", "AffiliationID": "60012329", "AffiliationName": "Universidad de La Rioja (Spain)"}}}
