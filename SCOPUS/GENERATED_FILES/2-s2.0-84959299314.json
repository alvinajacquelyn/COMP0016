The major ct gene, responsible for spina bifida, corresponds to a hypomorphic allele of grainyhead-like 3 (Grhl3) but the frequency of NTDs is strongly influenced by modifiers in the genetic background. Moreover, exencephaly in the curly tail strain is not prevented by reinstatement of Grhl3 expression. In the current study we found that expression of Mthfd1L, encoding a key component of mitochondrial folate one-carbon metabolism (FOCM), is significantly reduced in ct/ct embryos compared to a partially congenic wild-type strain. This expression change is not attributable to regulation by Grhl3 or the genetic background at the Mthfd1L locus. Mitochondrial FOCM provides one-carbon units as formate for FOCM reactions in the cytosol. We found that maternal supplementation with formate prevented NTDs in curly tail embryos and also resulted in increased litter size. Analysis of the folate profile of neurulation-stage embryos showed that formate supplementation resulted in an increased proportion of formyl-THF and THF but a reduction in proportion of 5-methyl THF. In contrast, THF decreased and 5-methyl THF was relatively more abundant in the liver of supplemented dams than in controls. In embryos cultured through the period of spinal neurulation, incorporation of labelled thymidine and adenine into genomic DNA was suppressed by supplemental formate, suggesting that de novo folate-dependent biosynthesis of nucleotides (thymidylate and purines) was enhanced. We hypothesise that reduced Mthfd1L expression may contribute to susceptibility to NTDs in the curly tail strain and that formate acts as a one-carbon donor to prevent NTDs.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Folate one-carbon metabolism", "Folic acid", "Formate", "Grainyhead-like 3", "mthfd1L", "Neural tube defects"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Disease Models, Animal", "Folic Acid", "Formates", "Mice", "Nucleotides", "Spinal Dysraphism"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84959299314", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"]], "AuthorData": {"57144551900": {"Name": "Sudiwala S.", "AuthorID": "57144551900", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Newlife Birth Defects Research Centre, Developmental Biology and Cancer Programme, Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "16303182000": {"Name": "De Castro S.", "AuthorID": "16303182000", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Newlife Birth Defects Research Centre, Developmental Biology and Cancer Programme, Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "7401860629": {"Name": "Leung K.", "AuthorID": "7401860629", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Newlife Birth Defects Research Centre, Developmental Biology and Cancer Programme, Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "7006634311": {"Name": "Copp A.", "AuthorID": "7006634311", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Newlife Birth Defects Research Centre, Developmental Biology and Cancer Programme, Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "35587452100": {"Name": "Greene N.", "AuthorID": "35587452100", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Newlife Birth Defects Research Centre, Developmental Biology and Cancer Programme, Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "7006234052": {"Name": "Brosnan J.", "AuthorID": "7006234052", "AffiliationID": "60019000", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemistry, Memorial University of Newfoundland"}, "7005806414": {"Name": "Brosnan M.", "AuthorID": "7005806414", "AffiliationID": "60019000", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemistry, Memorial University of Newfoundland"}, "7202875406": {"Name": "Mills K.", "AuthorID": "7202875406", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Genetics and Genomic Medicine Programme, Institute of Child Health, University College London"}}}
