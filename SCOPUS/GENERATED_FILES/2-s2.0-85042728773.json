However, although a suitable starting point for the quantitative analysis of such games exists, namely the Interactive Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (I-POMDP), computational considerations and structural limitations have limited its application, and left unmodelled critical features of behavior in a canonical trust task. Here, we provide the first analysis of two central phenomena: a form of social risk-aversion exhibited by the player who is in control of the interaction in the game; and irritation or anger, potentially exhibited by both players. Irritation arises when partners apparently defect, and it potentially causes a precipitate breakdown in cooperation. Failing to model one\u2019s partner\u2019s propensity for it leads to substantial economic inefficiency. We illustrate these behaviours using evidence drawn from the play of large cohorts of healthy volunteers and patients. We show that for both cohorts, a particular subtype of player is largely responsible for the breakdown of trust, a finding which sheds new light on borderline personality disorder.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Algorithms", "Bayes Theorem", "Borderline Personality Disorder", "Competitive Behavior", "Computer Simulation", "Cooperative Behavior", "Game Theory", "Games, Experimental", "Guilt", "Healthy Volunteers", "Humans", "Interpersonal Relations", "Learning", "Markov Chains", "Models, Economic", "Models, Statistical", "Risk", "Social Behavior", "Temperature", "Trust"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85042728773", "SubjectAreas": [["Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics", "AGRI", "1105"], ["Modeling and Simulation", "MATH", "2611"], ["Ecology", "ENVI", "2303"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"], ["Computational Theory and Mathematics", "COMP", "1703"]], "AuthorData": {"55488751900": {"Name": "Hula A.", "AuthorID": "55488751900", "AffiliationID": "60103936", "AffiliationName": "Austrian Institute of Technology"}, "35319473000": {"Name": "Vilares I.", "AuthorID": "35319473000", "AffiliationID": "60138707", "AffiliationName": "Human Neuroimaging Laboratory, Virginia Tech Carilion Research Institute"}, "7006914663": {"Name": "Dayan P.", "AuthorID": "7006914663", "AffiliationID": "60084280, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Gatsby Computational Unit, University College London"}, "7004572764": {"Name": "Montague P.R.", "AuthorID": "7004572764", "AffiliationID": "60027090", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University"}, "6506984553": {"Name": "Lohrenz T.", "AuthorID": "6506984553", "AffiliationID": "60138707", "AffiliationName": "Human Neuroimaging Laboratory, Virginia Tech Carilion Research Institute"}}}
