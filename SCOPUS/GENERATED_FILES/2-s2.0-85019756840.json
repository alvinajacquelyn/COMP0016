Published in the U.S.A.Mutations in the gene encoding valosin-containing protein (VCP) lead to multisystem proteinopathies including frontotemporal dementia. We have previously shown that patientderived VCP mutant fibroblasts exhibit lower mitochondrial membrane potential, uncoupled respiration, and reduced ATP levels. This study addresses the underlying basis for mitochondrial uncoupling using VCP knockdown neuroblastoma cell lines, induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), and iPSC-derived cortical neurons from patients with pathogenic mutations in VCP. Using fluorescent live cell imaging and respiration analysis we demonstrate a VCP mutation/knockdown-induced dysregulation in the adenine nucleotide translocase, which results in a slower rate of ADP or ATP translocation across the mitochondrial membranes. This deregulation can explain the mitochondrial uncoupling and lowerATPlevels inVCPmutation-bearing neurons via reduced ADP availability for ATP synthesis. This study provides evidence for a role of adenine nucleotide translocase in the mechanism underlying altered mitochondrial function in VCP-related degeneration, and this new insight may inform efforts to better understand and manage neurodegenerative disease and other proteinopathies.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adenine nucleotide translocase", "Frontotemporal dementias", "Induced pluripotent stem cells", "Mitochondrial function", "Mitochondrial membrane potential", "Mitochondrial membranes", "Neuroblastoma cell lines", "Pathogenic mutation", "Adenosine Diphosphate", "Adenosine Triphosphatases", "Adenosine Triphosphate", "Biological Transport, Active", "Cell Cycle Proteins", "Cell Line, Tumor", "Humans", "Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells", "Mitochondrial ADP, ATP Translocases", "Mitochondrial Membranes", "Mutation", "Neurodegenerative Diseases", "Neurons", "Proteostasis Deficiencies"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85019756840", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"36482996900": {"Name": "Ludtmann M.H.R.", "AuthorID": "36482996900", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "53163080800": {"Name": "Arber C.", "AuthorID": "53163080800", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "55326683600": {"Name": "Preza E.", "AuthorID": "55326683600", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "19934657400": {"Name": "Wray S.", "AuthorID": "19934657400", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "7102348938": {"Name": "Abramov A.Y.", "AuthorID": "7102348938", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "19533335500": {"Name": "Bartolome F.", "AuthorID": "19533335500", "AffiliationID": "60085102", "AffiliationName": "Biomedical Research Networking Center on Neurodegenerative Diseases (CIBERNED)"}, "57194330713": {"Name": "De Vicente M.", "AuthorID": "57194330713", "AffiliationID": "60085102", "AffiliationName": "Biomedical Research Networking Center on Neurodegenerative Diseases (CIBERNED)"}, "6701532690": {"Name": "Carro E.", "AuthorID": "6701532690", "AffiliationID": "60085102", "AffiliationName": "Biomedical Research Networking Center on Neurodegenerative Diseases (CIBERNED)"}, "7003363686": {"Name": "Houlden H.", "AuthorID": "7003363686", "AffiliationID": "60015879, 60019953", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neurology, MRC Centre for Neuromuscular Diseases"}, "9739583500": {"Name": "Gandhi S.", "AuthorID": "9739583500", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Sobell Department of Motor Neuroscience and Movement Disorders, UCL Institute of Neurology"}}}
