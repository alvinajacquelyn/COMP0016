KGaA.Most of the high efficiency kesterite solar cells are fabricated by vacuum or hydrazine-based solution methods which have drawbacks, such as high cost, high toxicity or explosivity. In our contribution, an alternative non-vacuum and environmental friendly deposition technology called electrostatic spray assisted vapour deposition (ESAVD) has been used for the cost-effective growth of Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) thin films with well controlled structure and composition. CZTS films have been characterized using a combination of XRD, XPS, SEM-EDX, AFM, and Raman spectroscopy. The results demonstrated that adherent, uniform and homogeneous CZTS films without apparent secondary phases have been produced by ESAVD. The atomic ratios measured by EDX are Cu/( Zn + Sn) = 0.88 and Zn/Sn = 1.17, which are very close with the reported high ef ficiency solar cells and can be finely tuned by formulating the precursor. CZTS films exhibited a typical optical band gap of 1.53 eV from UV-Vis analysis. Cu2ZnSnS4 produced by the ESAVD are being optimized towards the fabrication of high efficiency photovoltaic devices.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cu2ZnSnS4", "Kesterites", "Solar cells", "Thin films", "Vapour deposition"], "IndexKeywords": ["Controlled structures", "Deposition technology", "Electrostatic spray", "Environmental-friendly", "Fabrication and characterizations", "Kesterites", "Photovoltaic devices", "Vapour deposition"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84920821615", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Surfaces and Interfaces", "PHYS", "3110"], ["Surfaces, Coatings and Films", "MATE", "2508"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"], ["Materials Chemistry", "MATE", "2505"]], "AuthorData": {"57209189776": {"Name": "Liu J.", "AuthorID": "57209189776", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Centre for Materials Discovery, University College London"}, "57203183054": {"Name": "Choy K.", "AuthorID": "57203183054", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Centre for Materials Discovery, University College London"}, "23474529000": {"Name": "Placidi M.", "AuthorID": "23474529000", "AffiliationID": "60104006", "AffiliationName": "IREC-Catalonia Institute for Energy Research"}, "55768959200": {"Name": "L\u00f3pez-Garc\u00eda J.", "AuthorID": "55768959200", "AffiliationID": "60104006", "AffiliationName": "IREC-Catalonia Institute for Energy Research"}, "14020672400": {"Name": "Saucedo E.", "AuthorID": "14020672400", "AffiliationID": "60104006", "AffiliationName": "IREC-Catalonia Institute for Energy Research"}, "36918121000": {"Name": "Colombara D.", "AuthorID": "36918121000", "AffiliationID": "60072562", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory for Energy Materials, Universit\u00e9 du Luxembourg"}, "55954977600": {"Name": "Robert E.", "AuthorID": "55954977600", "AffiliationID": "60072562", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory for Energy Materials, Universit\u00e9 du Luxembourg"}}}
