These cells express neuropilin (Nrp1 and Nrp2) receptors which mediate their response to the chemorepulsive class 3 semaphorin (Sema) ligands. We show here that semaphorins Sema3A and Sema3F are expressed in layers adjacent to cortical interneuron migratory streams as well as in the striatum, suggesting they may have a role in guiding these cells throughout their journey. Analysis of Sema3A\u2212/\u2212 and Sema3F\u2212/\u2212 mice during corticogenesis showed that absence of Sema3A, but not Sema3F, leads to aberrant migration of cortical interneurons through the striatum. Reduced number of cortical interneurons was found in the cortex of Sema3A\u2212/\u2212, Nrp1\u2212/\u2212 and Nrp2\u2212/\u2212 mice, as well as altered distribution in Sema3F\u2212/\u2212, Nrp1\u2212/\u2212, Nrp2\u2212/\u2212 animals and especially in neuropilin double mutants. The observed decrease in interneurons in Sema3A\u2212/\u2212 and Nrp1\u2212/\u2212 mice was due to altered proliferative activity of their progenitors highlighted by changes in their mitotic spindle positioning and angle of cleavage plane during cell division. These findings point to a novel role for Sema3A\u2013Nrp1 signalling in progenitor cell dynamics and in the generation of interneurons in the ventral telencephalon.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Interneurons", "Neuronal migration", "Neuropilin", "Proliferation", "Semaphorin"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Cell Movement", "Interneurons", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Mice, Transgenic", "Nerve Tissue Proteins", "Neurogenesis", "Neurons", "Neuropilin-1", "Semaphorin-3A", "Signal Transduction", "Stem Cells"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84995810411", "SubjectAreas": [["Anatomy", "MEDI", "2702"], ["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Histology", "MEDI", "2722"]], "AuthorData": {"35197934600": {"Name": "Andrews W.", "AuthorID": "35197934600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University College London"}, "7202252013": {"Name": "Barber M.", "AuthorID": "7202252013", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University College London"}, "57191997298": {"Name": "Nemitz M.", "AuthorID": "57191997298", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University College London"}, "46461656000": {"Name": "Memi F.", "AuthorID": "46461656000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University College London"}, "7006265542": {"Name": "Parnavelas J.", "AuthorID": "7006265542", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University College London"}}}
