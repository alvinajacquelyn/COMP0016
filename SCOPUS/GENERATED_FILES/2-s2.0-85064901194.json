Studies have shown the mechanisms underpinning this tissue fractionation process; however, the question of how HIFU exposure conditions affect lesion formation still remains unclear. In the present work, a high-speed camera and a passive cavitation detection (PCD) system were used to investigate the dynamics of bubbles induced and the corresponding mechanical damage generated in optically transparent tissue-mimicking phantoms with two different boiling histotripsy exposure conditions (1. P+ = 85.4 MPa, P- = - 15.6 MPa; 2. P+ = 71.5 MPa, P- = - 13.4 MPa at focus). Our results clearly showed that there is a positive relationship between the size of a boiling bubble and the lesion dimension. At P+ = 85.4 MPa and P- = - 15.6 MPa, a relatively larger boiling bubble was, for instance, produced at the focus in the gel phantom followed by the presence of a wider cavitation cluster progressing toward the HIFU transducer, resulting in the formation of a larger lesion compared to that with P+ = 71.5 MPa and P- = - 13.4 MPa.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Exposure conditions", "Fractionation process", "HIFU transducers", "High intensity focused ultrasound", "Lesion formation", "Mechanical damages", "Passive cavitation detection", "Transparent tissue"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85064901194", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"56502142300": {"Name": "Pahk K.", "AuthorID": "56502142300", "AffiliationID": "60025960", "AffiliationName": "Center for Bionics, Biomedical Research Institute, Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST)"}, "57072753200": {"Name": "Kim H.", "AuthorID": "57072753200", "AffiliationID": "60025960", "AffiliationName": "Center for Bionics, Biomedical Research Institute, Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST)"}, "57205543777": {"Name": "De Andrade M.", "AuthorID": "57205543777", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "6603625764": {"Name": "Saffari N.", "AuthorID": "6603625764", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}}}
