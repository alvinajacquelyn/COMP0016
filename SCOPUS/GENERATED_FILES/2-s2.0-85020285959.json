Biopsy pathology is typically dystrophic, sometimes characterized by frequent lobulated fibres. More recently calpain mutations have been shown in association with eosinophilic myositis, suggesting that calpain mutations may render muscle susceptible to inflammatory change. We present the case of a 33-year old female with mild proximal muscle weakness and high CK levels (6698 IU/L at presentation). Muscle biopsy showed clusters of fibre necrosis associated with very dense macrophage infiltrates and small numbers of lymphocytes, raising the possibility of an inflammatory myopathy. No eosinophils were observed. Immunosuppressive treatment was started without clinical improvement. MRI demonstrated bilateral fatty replacement in posterior thigh and calf muscles. Western blot results prompted Sanger sequencing of the calpain-3 gene revealing compound heterozygous mutations c.643_663del and c.1746-20C>G. Our case widens the myopathological spectrum of calpainopathies to include focal macrophage rich inflammatory change.", "AuthorKeywords": ["inflammatory dystrophy", "inflammatory myopathy", "Limb girdle muscular dystrophy", "muscle MRI"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Calpain", "Female", "Humans", "Immunosuppression", "Macrophages", "Muscle Proteins", "Muscle, Skeletal", "Muscular Dystrophies, Limb-Girdle", "Mutation", "Necrosis"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85020285959", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Genetics (clinical)", "MEDI", "2716"]], "AuthorData": {"24577970200": {"Name": "Schutz P.W.", "AuthorID": "24577970200", "AffiliationID": "60027009", "AffiliationName": "Division of Neuropathology, Vancouver General Hospital"}, "55343433000": {"Name": "Scalco R.S.", "AuthorID": "55343433000", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Division of Neuropathology, UCL Institute of Neurology, Queen Square"}, "7101772051": {"Name": "Holton J.L.", "AuthorID": "7101772051", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60019953, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Neuromuscular Diseases, UCL Institute of Neurology and National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, Queen Square"}, "7004130497": {"Name": "Barresi R.", "AuthorID": "7004130497", "AffiliationID": "60026712, 60006222", "AffiliationName": "The John Walton Muscular Dystrophy Research Centre and MRC Centre for Neuromuscular Diseases, Institute of Genetic Medicine, Newcastle University"}, "7003363686": {"Name": "Houlden H.", "AuthorID": "7003363686", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60019953, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Neuromuscular Diseases, UCL Institute of Neurology and National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, Queen Square"}, "6604086603": {"Name": "Parton M.", "AuthorID": "6604086603", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60019953, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Neuromuscular Diseases, UCL Institute of Neurology and National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, Queen Square"}}}
