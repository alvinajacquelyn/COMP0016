As some education systems move towards more decentralized decision-making where multiple actors have an active role in steering and governing schools, the tasks and responsibilities of Inspectorates of Education must also change. This paper reflects on these changes and suggests \u2018polycentric\u2019 inspection models that fit such a decentralized context. Examples of inspection frameworks and methods from Northern Ireland, England and the Netherlands are provided, as well as a brief discussion of the potential impact of such \u2018polycentric\u2019 models.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Improvement", "Polycentric systems", "School inspections", "School networks"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85018496467", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"]], "AuthorData": {"8283638900": {"Name": "Ehren M.C.M.", "AuthorID": "8283638900", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Education"}, "57208172560": {"Name": "Janssens F.J.G.", "AuthorID": "57208172560", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Education"}, "57191052688": {"Name": "Brown M.", "AuthorID": "57191052688", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Education"}, "36799437900": {"Name": "McNamara G.", "AuthorID": "36799437900", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Education"}, "25032020100": {"Name": "O\u2019Hara J.", "AuthorID": "25032020100", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Education"}, "57194060544": {"Name": "Shevlin P.", "AuthorID": "57194060544", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Education"}}}
