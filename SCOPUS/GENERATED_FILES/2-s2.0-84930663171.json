The summed-up van der Waals series of Perdew et al. 2012 works well and is asymptotically correct at large separation between two atoms. However, as with the Hamaker 1937 expression, it has a strong singularity at short non-zero separation, where the two atoms touch. In this work we remove that singularity (and most of the short-range contribution) by evaluating the summed-up series at an effective distance between the atom centers. Only one fitting parameter is introduced for this short-range cut-off. The parameter in our model is optimized for each system, and a system-averaged value is used to make the final binding energy curves. This method is applied to different noble gas dimers such as Ar-Ar, Kr-Kr, Ar-Kr, Ar-Xe, Kr-Xe, Xe-Xe, Ne-Ne, He-He, and also to the Be<inf>2</inf> dimer. When this correction is added to the binding energy curve from the semilocal density functional meta-GGA-MS2, we get a vdW-corrected binding energy curve. These curves are compared with the results of other vdW-corrected methods such as PBE-D2 and vdW-DF2, and found to be typically better. Binding energy curves are in reasonable agreement with those from experiment.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Binding Energy Curves", "Density Functional", "Rare-Gas Dimers", "Summation Of Asymptotic Series", "Van Der Waals"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84930663171", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"]], "AuthorData": {"56673630300": {"Name": "Patra A.", "AuthorID": "56673630300", "AffiliationID": "60030398", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Temple University"}, "7003854511": {"Name": "Perdew J.", "AuthorID": "7003854511", "AffiliationID": "60030398", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Temple University"}, "55856717100": {"Name": "Xiao B.", "AuthorID": "55856717100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, University College London"}}}
