In this study, we investigated Koenigs-Knorr and phase transfer glycosylation on novobiocin. While the former only gave a 4\u2032-OH product, the later produced mainly a kinetic controlled 5-OH product, but still achieved the 4\u2032-OH modification and novoise-glycosylated products (with stronger base), as well as a diglycosylated compound. Investigation on the antibacterial activity indicate that the presence of galactose moiety helps to improve activity possibly via enhanced cellular uptake.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Antibacterial activity", "Glycosylation", "Novobiocin", "Phase transfer reaction"], "IndexKeywords": ["Anti-bacterial activity", "Antimicrobial drug", "Cellular uptake", "Galactose moieties", "Glycosylated products", "Kinetic controlled", "Novobiocin", "Phase-transfer reaction", "Anti-Bacterial Agents", "Galactose", "Glycosylation", "Molecular Structure", "Novobiocin", "Stereoisomerism"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85032288841", "SubjectAreas": [["Analytical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1602"], ["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Organic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1605"]], "AuthorData": {"57193335241": {"Name": "Sun G.", "AuthorID": "57193335241", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "The School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "39061364200": {"Name": "de Resende P.E.", "AuthorID": "39061364200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "The School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "57189666030": {"Name": "Stapleton P.", "AuthorID": "57189666030", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "The School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "56974102900": {"Name": "Kuta M.", "AuthorID": "56974102900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "The School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "57196221455": {"Name": "Haider S.", "AuthorID": "57196221455", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "The School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "55682381100": {"Name": "Yang M.", "AuthorID": "55682381100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "The School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "35072124900": {"Name": "Wang X.", "AuthorID": "35072124900", "AffiliationID": "60123633, 60122781", "AffiliationName": "The Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Peking Union Medical College"}}}
