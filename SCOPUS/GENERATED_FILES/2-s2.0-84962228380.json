In this work we show that Bdnf promoters are repressed by Polycomb Complex 2 in mature hippocampal neurons, and basal expression is guaranteed by the coexistence with activating histone marks. Neuronal stimulation triggered by N-methyl-D-aspartate application induces the transcription of these promoters by H3K27Me3 demethylation and H3K27Me3 phosphorylation at Serine 28 leading to displacement of EZH2, the catalytic subunit of Polycomb Repressor Complex 2. Our data show that the fast transient expression of Bdnf promoters II and VI after neuronal stimulation is dependent on acetylation of histone H3K27 by CREB-p/CBP. Thus, regulatory mechanisms established during development seem to remain after differentiation controlling genes induced by different stimuli, as would be the case of early memory genes in mature neurons.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Acetylation", "Animals", "Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor", "Cell Differentiation", "CREB-Binding Protein", "Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein", "Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 Protein", "Epigenesis, Genetic", "Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental", "Hippocampus", "Histones", "Jumonji Domain-Containing Histone Demethylases", "Long-Term Synaptic Depression", "Lysine", "Methylation", "Models, Biological", "N-Methylaspartate", "Neurons", "Phosphorylation", "Polycomb Repressive Complex 2", "Polycomb-Group Proteins", "Promoter Regions, Genetic", "Rats, Wistar"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84962228380", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"36718147100": {"Name": "Palomer E.", "AuthorID": "36718147100", "AffiliationID": "60018505, 60073905", "AffiliationName": "Departamento de Neurobiolog\u00eda Molecular, Centro Biolog\u00eda Molecular Severo Ochoa CSIC-UAM"}, "57188686921": {"Name": "Carretero J.", "AuthorID": "57188686921", "AffiliationID": "60018505, 60073905", "AffiliationName": "Departamento de Neurobiolog\u00eda Molecular, Centro Biolog\u00eda Molecular Severo Ochoa CSIC-UAM"}, "26967494900": {"Name": "Benvegn\u00f9 S.", "AuthorID": "26967494900", "AffiliationID": "60018505, 60073905", "AffiliationName": "Departamento de Neurobiolog\u00eda Molecular, Centro Biolog\u00eda Molecular Severo Ochoa CSIC-UAM"}, "57207498146": {"Name": "Dotti C.G.", "AuthorID": "57207498146", "AffiliationID": "60018505, 60073905", "AffiliationName": "Departamento de Neurobiolog\u00eda Molecular, Centro Biolog\u00eda Molecular Severo Ochoa CSIC-UAM"}, "55482096800": {"Name": "Martin M.G.", "AuthorID": "55482096800", "AffiliationID": "60017374, 60000658, 60004518", "AffiliationName": "Laboratorio de Neurobiolog\u00eda, Instituto de Investigaciones M\u00e9dicas Mercedes y Mart\u00edn Ferreyra (INIMEC-CONICET-UNC), Universidad Nacional de C\u00f3rdoba"}}}
