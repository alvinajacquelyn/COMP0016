Thus, understanding demographic and behavior patterns of food consumption is a topic that several researchers in public health have long pursued. In this paper, we study how per-ceived food tastes, which are known to affect palatability of foods, are related to the dynamics and nature of population-wide dietary preferences and patterns over demographics, time, and location. In contrast to previous studies that have been clinical in nature based on small samples of par-Ticipants via treatment data, our study offers a more \\big data\"-style approach by leveraging a massive collection of food items and entries from the MyFitnessPal user base. Despite its differences from traditional research, our find-ings actually validate some previous studies that correlate food taste with certain population groups or public health patterns. In addition, we are able to extend research into previously unexploited directions.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Big Data", "BMI", "Food Taste", "MyFitnessPal", "Obesity"], "IndexKeywords": ["Balanced diet", "Behavior patterns", "Food consumption", "Food taste", "MyFitnessPal", "Obesity", "Small samples"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84966692223", "SubjectAreas": [["Health Information Management", "HEAL", "3605"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Health Informatics", "MEDI", "2718"]], "AuthorData": {"57189241248": {"Name": "Howell P.D.", "AuthorID": "57189241248", "AffiliationID": "119077128", "AffiliationName": "Phowell"}, "57189244661": {"Name": "Martin L.D.", "AuthorID": "57189244661", "AffiliationID": "119077117", "AffiliationName": "Lmartin"}, "53164873500": {"Name": "Salehian H.", "AuthorID": "53164873500", "AffiliationID": "119077186", "AffiliationName": "Hsalehian"}, "57189232032": {"Name": "Lee C.", "AuthorID": "57189232032", "AffiliationID": "105361388", "AffiliationName": "Clee"}, "57189246855": {"Name": "Eastman K.M.", "AuthorID": "57189246855", "AffiliationID": "119077162", "AffiliationName": "Keastman"}, "57189238987": {"Name": "Kim J.", "AuthorID": "57189238987", "AffiliationID": "116662176", "AffiliationName": "Jkim, Under Armour, Connected Fitness"}}}
