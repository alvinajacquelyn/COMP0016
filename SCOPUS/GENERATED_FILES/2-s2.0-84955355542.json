Methods: The international randomized controlled IMAGINE study included 2553 consecutive patients with a left ventricular ejection fraction of >40% who underwent isolated CABG. Median follow-up was 32 months (IQR 17-42 months). The composite endpoint comprised of death, myocardial infarction (MI), cerebrovascular event, angina, revascularization and congestive heart failure. Cox regression analysis was used to examine sex differences in outcome post-CABG. Results: Of the 2553 patients, 2229 were men and 324 (13%) were women. Women were older and more often reported diabetes and hypertension. Smoking and impaired renal function were more prevalent in men. Women experienced a higher event rate during follow-up (composite endpoint 18% vs 12%; P = 0.007). Cox regression showed an increased risk of the composite endpoint in women after adjustment for age (HR 1.48 (95% CI: 1.11-1.97)) which was non-significant after additional adjustment for other confounders (HR 1.26 (95% CI: 0.92-1.72)). Conclusion: Women have a worse long-term outcome after CABG than men in univariate analysis. However, after adjusting for potential confounders female sex became a non-significant predictor for prognosis, possibly due to the small sample size of women. Definite answers regarding sex-differences in long-term outcome after CABG should come from future pooling of studies comprising a larger number of women.", "AuthorKeywords": ["CABG", "Long-term outcome", "Major adverse cardiac event", "Sex"], "IndexKeywords": ["Age Factors", "Aged", "Chi-Square Distribution", "Comorbidity", "Coronary Artery Bypass", "Coronary Artery Disease", "Disease Progression", "Disease-Free Survival", "Female", "Health Status Disparities", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Multivariate Analysis", "Prevalence", "Proportional Hazards Models", "Risk Factors", "Sex Factors", "Time Factors", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84955355542", "SubjectAreas": [["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"14071039800": {"Name": "den Ruijter H.", "AuthorID": "14071039800", "AffiliationID": "60032724", "AffiliationName": "Experimental Cardiology Laboratory, Division of Heart and Lungs, University Medical Center Utrecht"}, "56326976300": {"Name": "Haitjema S.", "AuthorID": "56326976300", "AffiliationID": "60032724", "AffiliationName": "Experimental Cardiology Laboratory, Division of Heart and Lungs, University Medical Center Utrecht"}, "55968288500": {"Name": "van der Meer M.", "AuthorID": "55968288500", "AffiliationID": "60032724", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Division of Heart and Lungs, University Medical Center Utrecht"}, "7006736234": {"Name": "Asselbergs F.", "AuthorID": "7006736234", "AffiliationID": "60002794", "AffiliationName": "Durrer Center for Cardiogenetic Research, Interuniversity Cardiology Institute Netherlands-Netherlands Heart Institute"}, "6602378288": {"Name": "van der Harst P.", "AuthorID": "6602378288", "AffiliationID": "60002794", "AffiliationName": "Durrer Center for Cardiogenetic Research, Interuniversity Cardiology Institute Netherlands-Netherlands Heart Institute"}, "7103238396": {"Name": "van Gilst W.", "AuthorID": "7103238396", "AffiliationID": "60006027", "AffiliationName": "Experimental Cardiology Laboratory, University Medical Center Groningen"}, "7102610398": {"Name": "Rouleau J.", "AuthorID": "7102610398", "AffiliationID": "60009507, 60028706", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Circulatory and Respiratory Health, Canadian Institutes of Health Research, University of Montreal"}, "null": {"Name": null, "AuthorID": null, "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
