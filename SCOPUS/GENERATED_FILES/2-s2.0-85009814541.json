Importantly, about 25% of the global multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) cases are reported in the European Region, representing one of the greatest challenges to TB control; these are reported particularly in the countries of the Former Soviet Union. Over a quarter of TB cases in the European Union and European Economic Area (EU/EEA) are reported among foreign-born individuals. In line with the recent increase of migration flows towards Europe, TB among migrant populations is also on the rise, emphasizing the need for a better understanding of the TB trends at the regional and sub-regional levels, and of the existing policies on migrants and refugees. The present article is aimed at describing the policies and practices of European countries with a low and intermediate TB incidence with regard to the detection and management of TB and latent TB infection (LTBI) among refugees in Europe.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Europe Region", "LTBI", "Refugees", "Screening practices", "Survey", "TB"], "IndexKeywords": ["Coinfection", "Ethnic Groups", "Europe", "Health Policy", "Humans", "Incidence", "Population Surveillance", "Refugees", "Socioeconomic Factors", "Transients and Migrants", "Tuberculosis", "Tuberculosis, Multidrug-Resistant", "World Health Organization"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85009814541", "SubjectAreas": [["Microbiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2726"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"56582629500": {"Name": "D'Ambrosio L.", "AuthorID": "56582629500", "AffiliationID": "115748855", "AffiliationName": "Public Health Consulting Group"}, "6506479049": {"Name": "Centis R.", "AuthorID": "6506479049", "AffiliationID": "60027142, 60018722", "AffiliationName": "World Health Organization Collaborating Centre for Tuberculosis and Lung Diseases, Maugeri Institute, IRCCS"}, "7005608870": {"Name": "Migliori G.B.", "AuthorID": "7005608870", "AffiliationID": "60027142, 60018722", "AffiliationName": "World Health Organization Collaborating Centre for Tuberculosis and Lung Diseases, Maugeri Institute, IRCCS"}, "8654071000": {"Name": "Dara M.", "AuthorID": "8654071000", "AffiliationID": "60027142", "AffiliationName": "World Health Organization Regional Office for Europe"}, "6602229543": {"Name": "Solovic I.", "AuthorID": "6602229543", "AffiliationID": "60091385", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for TB, Lung Diseases and Thoracic Surgery, Catholic University Ruzomberok"}, "6507327565": {"Name": "Sulis G.", "AuthorID": "6507327565", "AffiliationID": "60015300", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infectious and Tropical Diseases, WHO Collaborating Centre for TB/HIV and TB Elimination, University of Brescia"}, "7006170723": {"Name": "Zumla A.", "AuthorID": "7006170723", "AffiliationID": "60024544, 60176023", "AffiliationName": "Center for Clinical Microbiology, Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London and NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, UCL Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
