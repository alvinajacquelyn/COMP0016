We found that shared leadership stimulated team learning behaviors in a manner consistent with previous research at the early stages of teams\u2019 work together, but not at the middle and later stages of the task. We also found that teams that engaged in more learning behaviors early in the task were more likely to keep their leadership network structure stable. This stability was positively associated with team learning behaviors at the midpoint and end of the task. We use these findings to elaborate theory on how leadership and learning in self-managed teams develop, change, and influence each other over time.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Network churn", "Self-managed teams", "Shared leadership", "Team learning behaviors", "Time"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85018705384", "SubjectAreas": [["Social Psychology", "PSYC", "3207"], ["Applied Psychology", "PSYC", "3202"]], "AuthorData": {"56151298000": {"Name": "Wang L.", "AuthorID": "56151298000", "AffiliationID": "60116524, 60019674", "AffiliationName": "Boston University, Questrom School of Business"}, "57199890797": {"Name": "Han J.", "AuthorID": "57199890797", "AffiliationID": "60028843", "AffiliationName": "China Europe International Business School, The Centre on China Innovation"}, "57126726900": {"Name": "Fisher C.M.", "AuthorID": "57126726900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "57194096156": {"Name": "Pan Y.", "AuthorID": "57194096156", "AffiliationID": "60028843", "AffiliationName": "China Europe International Business School"}}}
