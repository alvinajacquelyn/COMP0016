Such studies also include analyses of the effectiveness of escape ways, shelter or temporary refuge areas, and evacuation procedures. Two types of methodologies are relevant to risk-based safety studies, namely qualitative and quantitative approaches. The effects of the geometric and material nonlinearities of structural systems along with non-Gaussian aspects, multiple physical processes, multiple scales, and multiple criteria are precisely accounted for by quantitative approaches. Using qualitative approaches in safety studies does not provide sufficient accuracy. Therefore, quantitative approaches are much more appropriate for conducting advanced safety studies of structures and infrastructures. As such, this book focuses on quantitative approaches.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85070718873", "SubjectAreas": [["Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality", "ENGI", "2213"]], "AuthorData": {"35821146600": {"Name": "Paik J.", "AuthorID": "35821146600", "AffiliationID": "60008783", "AffiliationName": "The Korea Ship and Offshore Research Institute (Lloyd\u2019s Register Foundation Research Centre of Excellence), Pusan National University"}}}
