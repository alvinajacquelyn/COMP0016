SUMMARY ANSWER: The 13th retrospective collection represents valuable data on PGD/PGS cycles, pregnancies and children: the main trend observed is the decrease in the routine implementation of PGS. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Since 1999, the PGD Consortium has collected, analysed and published 12 data sets and an overview of the first 10 years of data collections. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: Data were collected from each participating centre using a FileMaker Pro database (versions 5-11). Separate predesigned FileMaker Pro files were used for the cycles, pregnancies and baby records. The study documented cycles performed during the calendar year 2010 and follow-up of the pregnancies and babies born which resulted from these cycles (until October 2011). PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Data were submitted by 62 centres (full PGD Consortium members). The submitted data were thoroughly analysed to identify incomplete data entries and corrections were requested from the participating centres. Records remaining with incomplete or inconsistent data were excluded from the calculations. Corrections, calculations and tables were made by expert co-authors. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: For data collection XIII, 62 centres reported data for 5780 cycles with oocyte retrieval (OR), along with details of the follow-up on 1503 pregnancies and 1152 babies born. A total of 1071 OR were reported for chromosomal abnormalities, 108 OR for sexing for X-linked diseases, 1574 OR for monogenic diseases, 2979 OR for preimplantation genetic screening and 48 OR for social sexing. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: The findings apply to the 62 participating centres and may not represent worldwide trends in PGD. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: The annual data collections provide an important resource for data mining and for following trends in PGD practice.
