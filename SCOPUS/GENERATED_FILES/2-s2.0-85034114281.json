Objectives: To examine the effects of improvisational music therapy (IMT) on social affect and responsiveness of children with ASD. Design: International, multicentre, three-arm, single-masked randomised controlled trial, including a National Institute for Health Research (NIHR)-funded centre that recruited in London and the east of England. Randomisation was via a remote service using permuted blocks, stratified by study site. Setting: Schools and private, voluntary and state-funded health-care services. Participants: Children aged between 4 and 7 years with a confirmed diagnosis of ASD and a parent or guardian who provided written informed consent. We excluded children with serious sensory disorder and those who had received music therapy within the past 12 months. Interventions: All parents and children received enhanced standard care (ESC), which involved three 60-minute sessions of advice and support in addition to treatment as usual. In addition, they were randomised to either one (low-frequency) or three (high-frequency) sessions of IMT per week, or to ESC alone, over 5 months in a ratio of 1: 1: 2. Main outcome measures: The primary outcome was measured using the social affect score derived from the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) at 5 months: higher scores indicated greater impairment. Secondary outcomes included social affect at 12 months and parent-rated social responsiveness at 5 and 12 months (higher scores indicated greater impairment). Results: A total of 364 participants were randomised between 2011 and 2015. A total of 182 children were allocated to IMT (90 to high-frequency sessions and 92 to low-frequency sessions), and 182 were allocated to ESC alone. A total of 314 (86.3%) of the total sample were followed up at 5 months [165 (90.7%) in the intervention group and 149 (81.9%) in the control group]. Among those randomised to IMT, 171 (94.0%) received it. From baseline to 5 months, mean scores of ADOS social affect decreased from 14.1 to 13.3 in music therapy and from 13.5 to 12.4 in standard care [mean difference: music therapy vs. standard care = 0.06, 95% confidence interval (CI)-0.70 to 0.81], with no significant difference in improvement. There were also no differences in the parent-rated social responsiveness score, which decreased from 96.0 to 89.2 in the music therapy group and from 96.1 to 93.3 in the standard care group over this period (mean difference: music therapy vs. standard care =-3.32, 95% CI-7.56 to 0.91). There were seven admissions to hospital that were unrelated to the study interventions in the two IMT arms compared with 10 unrelated admissions in the ESC group. Conclusions: Adding IMT to the treatment received by children with ASD did not improve social affect or parent-assessed social responsiveness.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Autism Spectrum Disorder", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Humans", "Internationality", "Music Therapy", "Social Skills", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85034114281", "SubjectAreas": [["Health Policy", "MEDI", "2719"]], "AuthorData": {"57203219698": {"Name": "Crawford M.J.", "AuthorID": "57203219698", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Psychiatry, Imperial College London"}, "8258999100": {"Name": "Thana L.", "AuthorID": "8258999100", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Psychiatry, Imperial College London"}, "57197710570": {"Name": "Claringbold A.", "AuthorID": "57197710570", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Psychiatry, Imperial College London"}, "7005500586": {"Name": "Ramchandani P.", "AuthorID": "7005500586", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Psychiatry, Imperial College London"}, "8062083300": {"Name": "Gold C.", "AuthorID": "8062083300", "AffiliationID": "60083053", "AffiliationName": "The Grieg Academy Music Therapy Research Centre, Uni Research Health"}, "6603357832": {"Name": "Assmus J.", "AuthorID": "6603357832", "AffiliationID": "60083053", "AffiliationName": "The Grieg Academy Music Therapy Research Centre, Uni Research Health"}, "36677020600": {"Name": "Bieleninik \u0141.", "AuthorID": "36677020600", "AffiliationID": "60083053", "AffiliationName": "The Grieg Academy Music Therapy Research Centre, Uni Research Health"}, "54882309500": {"Name": "Geretsegger M.", "AuthorID": "54882309500", "AffiliationID": "60083053", "AffiliationName": "The Grieg Academy Music Therapy Research Centre, Uni Research Health"}, "6506778346": {"Name": "M\u00f6ssler K.A.", "AuthorID": "6506778346", "AffiliationID": "60083053", "AffiliationName": "The Grieg Academy Music Therapy Research Centre, Uni Research Health"}, "11939327200": {"Name": "Odell-Miller H.", "AuthorID": "11939327200", "AffiliationID": "60000913", "AffiliationName": "Music for Health Research Centre, Anglia Ruskin University"}, "57211443594": {"Name": "Faber S.", "AuthorID": "57211443594", "AffiliationID": "60000913", "AffiliationName": "Music for Health Research Centre, Anglia Ruskin University"}, "57197707009": {"Name": "Grant C.", "AuthorID": "57197707009", "AffiliationID": "60162114", "AffiliationName": "Central and North West London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "24067268400": {"Name": "Maratos A.", "AuthorID": "24067268400", "AffiliationID": "60162114", "AffiliationName": "Central and North West London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57193768248": {"Name": "Sandford S.", "AuthorID": "57193768248", "AffiliationID": "60032993", "AffiliationName": "Chelsea and Westminster Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57204259162": {"Name": "McConachie H.", "AuthorID": "57204259162", "AffiliationID": "60026712, 60006222", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Health and Society, Newcastle University"}, "55332751300": {"Name": "Maskey M.", "AuthorID": "55332751300", "AffiliationID": "60006222", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neuroscience, Newcastle University"}, "6701753786": {"Name": "Hassiotis A.", "AuthorID": "6701753786", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, University College London"}, "null": {"Name": null, "AuthorID": null, "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
