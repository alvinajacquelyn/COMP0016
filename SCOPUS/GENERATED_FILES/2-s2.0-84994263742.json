Shallow water theory shows that the latter travels faster than the former, leading to an interaction, whose description is the issue addressed in this paper, using model equations of the Korteweg\u2013de Vries type. First, we re-examine the undular bore solutions of the Korteweg\u2013de Vries equation which describe how an initial depression wave deforms into a depression rarefaction wave followed by an undular bore of large elevation waves riding on this depression. Then we develop a new extended Korteweg\u2013de Vries equation some of whose solutions can be used to describe the interaction of an elevation wave chasing a depression wave. These show that the two waves coincide at a given position and time producing a maximum elevation. Typically this amplitude is larger than the initial displacement magnitude by a factor which can be as large as two, which may explain anomalous elevations of tsunamis at particular positions along their trajectories. It is physically significant that for these small amplitude waves, no wave breaking occurs and there is no excess dissipation. Then, following the transition, the elevation wave moves ahead of the depression wave and the distance between them increases either linearly or logarithmically with time. The implications for how these down-up tsunami waves reach the shoreline are considered.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Depression waves", "Elevation waves", "Initial displacements", "Model equations", "Positive elevation", "Rarefaction waves", "Shallow water theory", "Smooth transitions"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84994263742", "SubjectAreas": [["Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment", "ENER", "2105"], ["Water Science and Technology", "ENVI", "2312"], ["Energy Engineering and Power Technology", "ENER", "2102"], ["Ocean Engineering", "ENGI", "2212"]], "AuthorData": {"35462748600": {"Name": "Grimshaw R.", "AuthorID": "35462748600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University College London"}, "7402692536": {"Name": "Hunt J.", "AuthorID": "7402692536", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University College London"}, "13605209900": {"Name": "Chow K.", "AuthorID": "13605209900", "AffiliationID": "60006541", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Hong Kong"}}}
