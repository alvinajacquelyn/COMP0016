We compared ten worldwide leading assays (6 for non-transferrinbound iron and 4 for labile plasma iron) as part of an international interlaboratory study. Serum samples from 60 patients with four different iron-overload disorders in various treatment phases were coded and sent in duplicate for analysis to five different laboratories worldwide. Some laboratories provided multiple assays. Overall, highest assay levels were observed for patients with untreated hereditary hemochromatosis and \u03b2-thalassemia intermedia, patients with transfusion-dependent myelodysplastic syndromes and patients with transfusion-dependent and chelated \u03b2-thalassemia major. Absolute levels differed considerably between assays and were lower for labile plasma iron than for non-transferrin-bound iron. Four assays also reported negative values. Assays were reproducible with high between-sample and low withinsample variation. Assays correlated and correlations were highest within the group of non-transferrin-bound iron assays and within that of labile plasma iron assays. Increased transferrin saturation, but not ferritin, was a good indicator of the presence of forms of circulating nontransferrin- bound iron. The possibility of using non-transferrin-bound iron and labile plasma iron measures as clinical indicators of overt iron overload and/or of treatment efficacy would largely depend on the rigorous validation and standardization of assays.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "beta-Thalassemia", "Blood Transfusion", "Female", "Hemochromatosis", "Humans", "Iron", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Myelodysplastic Syndromes", "Transferrin"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84952945274", "SubjectAreas": [["Hematology", "MEDI", "2720"]], "AuthorData": {"56044089000": {"Name": "de Swart L.", "AuthorID": "56044089000", "AffiliationID": "60002573", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Hematology, Radboud University Medical Center"}, "7103046308": {"Name": "Mackenzie M.A.", "AuthorID": "7103046308", "AffiliationID": "60002573", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Hematology, Radboud University Medical Center"}, "7101998868": {"Name": "Hendriks J.C.M.", "AuthorID": "7101998868", "AffiliationID": "60002573", "AffiliationName": "Health Evidence, Radboud University Medical Center"}, "57204075701": {"Name": "van der Vorm L.N.", "AuthorID": "57204075701", "AffiliationID": "60002573", "AffiliationName": "Department of Laboratory Medicine, Radboud University Medical Center"}, "21934685100": {"Name": "Swinkels D.W.", "AuthorID": "21934685100", "AffiliationID": "60002573", "AffiliationName": "Department of Laboratory Medicine, Radboud University Medical Center"}, "7005762304": {"Name": "Cabantchik Z.I.", "AuthorID": "7005762304", "AffiliationID": "60007903", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemical Chemistry, Hebrew University of Jerusalem"}, "35453535900": {"Name": "Evans P.J.", "AuthorID": "35453535900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, University College"}, "7403427269": {"Name": "Porter J.B.", "AuthorID": "7403427269", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, University College"}, "6506100416": {"Name": "Hod E.A.", "AuthorID": "6506100416", "AffiliationID": "60027565, 60002388", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Medical Center"}, "6603892420": {"Name": "Wojczyk B.", "AuthorID": "6603892420", "AffiliationID": "60027565, 60002388", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Medical Center"}, "7005583587": {"Name": "Brittenham G.M.", "AuthorID": "7005583587", "AffiliationID": "60027565", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Medical Center"}, "57035140800": {"Name": "Furman Y.", "AuthorID": "57035140800", "AffiliationID": "116189531", "AffiliationName": "Aferrix Ltd."}, "7202771350": {"Name": "Janssen M.C.H.", "AuthorID": "7202771350", "AffiliationID": "60002573", "AffiliationName": "Department of Internal Medicine, Radboud University Medical Center"}, "6602159580": {"Name": "Mattijssen V.E.J.M.", "AuthorID": "6602159580", "AffiliationID": "60014983", "AffiliationName": "Department of Hematology, Rijnstate Hospital"}, "57191086563": {"Name": "Biemond B.J.", "AuthorID": "57191086563", "AffiliationID": "60001157", "AffiliationName": "Department of Hematology, Academic Medical Center"}, "23009790400": {"Name": "Origa R.", "AuthorID": "23009790400", "AffiliationID": "60032259", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomedical Science and Biotechnology, Regional Microcythemia Hospital, University of Cagliari"}, "7004292185": {"Name": "Galanello R.", "AuthorID": "7004292185", "AffiliationID": "60032259", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomedical Science and Biotechnology, Regional Microcythemia Hospital, University of Cagliari"}, "7102451936": {"Name": "Hider R.C.", "AuthorID": "7102451936", "AffiliationID": "60177635", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Pharmaceutical Science, King\u2019s College"}}}
