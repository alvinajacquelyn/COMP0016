All pupils had either an Education Health and Care Plan (EHCP) or a Statement, and attended in mainstream secondary school in England. Pupils involved in the SEN in Secondary Education study were shadowed for several days over a school week. Researchers prepared pupil-level case studies on the basis of data from qualitative observations and semi-structured interviews with pupils and key school staff involved in their learning and development. The case studies were subjected to a thematic analysis. Results are presented in terms of two inter-related themes\u2013(i) teaching and support; and (ii) differentiation\u2013which address approaches to, and expressions of, inclusive practice; the roles of teachers and teaching assistants; and the defining features of teaching and support for SEND. The results are considered in view of the inclusiveness, appropriateness and effectiveness of provision on offer to pupils with high-level SEND. We conclude there has been a systemic and long-standing failure to fully address the educational needs of such pupils, and suggest what schools could do to provide higher quality experiences.", "AuthorKeywords": ["differentiation", "Inclusion", "pupil voice", "teaching assistants"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85045038750", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["Health Professions (miscellaneous)", "HEAL", "3601"], ["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"]], "AuthorData": {"56948271000": {"Name": "Webster R.", "AuthorID": "56948271000", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Inclusive Education, UCL Institute of Education"}, "7003974553": {"Name": "Blatchford P.", "AuthorID": "7003974553", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology and Human Development, UCL Institute of Education"}}}
