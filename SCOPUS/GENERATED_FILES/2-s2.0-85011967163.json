The American Astronomical Society. All rights reserved..We present spatial correlations of galaxies and IGM neutral hydrogen H i in the COSMOS/UltraVISTA 1.62 deg2 field. Our data consist of 13,415 photo-z galaxies at z \u223c 2-3 with and the Ly\u03b1 forest absorption lines in the background quasar spectra selected from SDSS data with no signature of damped Ly\u03b1 system contamination. We estimate a galaxy overdensity \u03b4 gal in an impact parameter of 2.5 (proper) Mpc, and calculate the Ly\u03b1 forest fluctuations whose negative values correspond to the strong Ly\u03b1 forest absorption lines. We identify weak evidence of an anti-correlation between \u03b4 gal and with a Spearman's rank correlation coefficient of -0.39 suggesting that the galaxy overdensities and the Ly\u03b1 forest absorption lines positively correlate in space at the \u223c90% confidence level. This positive correlation indicates that high-z galaxies exist around an excess of H i gas in the Ly\u03b1 forest. We find four cosmic volumes, dubbed A obs, B obs, C obs, and D obs, that have extremely large (small) values of \u03b4 gal \u2243 0.8 (-1) and , three of which, B obs-D obs, significantly depart from the \u03b4 gal- correlation, and weaken the correlation signal. We perform cosmological hydrodynamical simulations and compare with our observational results. Our simulations reproduce the \u03b4 gal- correlation, agreeing with the observational results. Moreover, our simulations have model counterparts of A obs-D obs, and suggest that the observations pinpoint, by chance, a galaxy overdensity like a proto-cluster, gas filaments lying on the quasar sightline, a large void, and orthogonal low-density filaments. Our simulations indicate that the significant departures of B obs-D obs are produced by the filamentary large-scale structures and the observation sightline effects.", "AuthorKeywords": ["galaxies: formation", "intergalactic medium", "large-scale structure of universe", "quasars: absorption lines"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85011967163", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"57193238654": {"Name": "Mukae S.", "AuthorID": "57193238654", "AffiliationID": "60025272", "AffiliationName": "Department of Astronomy, Graduate School of Science, University of Tokyo"}, "7005342883": {"Name": "Ouchi M.", "AuthorID": "7005342883", "AffiliationID": "60025272", "AffiliationName": "Kavli Institute for the Physics and Mathematics of the Universe (Kavli IPMU, WPI), University of Tokyo"}, "55741730100": {"Name": "Ono Y.", "AuthorID": "55741730100", "AffiliationID": "60025272", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Cosmic Ray Research, University of Tokyo"}, "33068184500": {"Name": "Shibuya T.", "AuthorID": "33068184500", "AffiliationID": "60025272", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Cosmic Ray Research, University of Tokyo"}, "7404604065": {"Name": "Suzuki N.", "AuthorID": "7404604065", "AffiliationID": "60025272", "AffiliationName": "Kavli Institute for the Physics and Mathematics of the Universe (Kavli IPMU, WPI), University of Tokyo"}, "55413049700": {"Name": "Kakiichi K.", "AuthorID": "55413049700", "AffiliationID": "60023091", "AffiliationName": "Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics"}, "44561031200": {"Name": "Cai Z.", "AuthorID": "44561031200", "AffiliationID": "60024941", "AffiliationName": "UCO/Lick Observatory, University of California"}, "7402897995": {"Name": "Inoue A.", "AuthorID": "7402897995", "AffiliationID": "60024188", "AffiliationName": "College of General Education, Osaka Sangyo University"}, "55956833200": {"Name": "Chiang Y.", "AuthorID": "55956833200", "AffiliationID": "60013372", "AffiliationName": "Department of Astronomy, University of Texas at Austin"}, "35393395200": {"Name": "Matsuda Y.", "AuthorID": "35393395200", "AffiliationID": "60021523", "AffiliationName": "Graduate University for Advanced Studies (SOKENDAI)"}}}
