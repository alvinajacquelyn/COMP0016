Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.Improving the environmental performance of non-domestic buildings is a complex and \u2018wicked\u2019 problem due to conflicting interests and incentives. This is particularly challenging in tenanted spaces, where landlord and tenant interactions are regulated through leases that traditionally ignore environmental considerations. \u2018Green leasing\u2019 is conceptualized as a form of \u2018middle-out\u2019 inter-organizational environmental governance that operates between organizations, alongside other drivers. This paper investigates how leases are evolving to become \u2018greener\u2019 in the UK and Australia, providing evidence from five varied sources on: (1) UK office and retail leases, (2) UK retail sector energy management, (3) a major UK retailer case study; (4) office leasing in Sydney, and (5) expert interviews on Australian retail leases. With some exceptions, the evidence reveals an increasing trend towards green leases in prime offices in both countries, but not in retail or sub-prime offices. Generally introduced by landlords, adopted green leases contain a variety of ambitions and levels of enforcement. As an evolving form of private\u2013private environmental governance, green leases form a valuable framework for further tenant\u2013landlord cooperation within properties and across portfolios. This increased cohesion could create new opportunities for polycentric governance, particularly at the interface of cities and the property industry.", "AuthorKeywords": ["energy performance", "governance", "green leases", "landlord", "management strategies", "non-domestic buildings", "offices", "retail", "tenants"], "IndexKeywords": ["Energy performance", "governance", "green leases", "landlord", "Management strategies", "Non-domestic buildings", "offices", "retail", "tenants"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84962508066", "SubjectAreas": [["Civil and Structural Engineering", "ENGI", "2205"], ["Building and Construction", "ENGI", "2215"]], "AuthorData": {"7103164495": {"Name": "Janda K.B.", "AuthorID": "7103164495", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Environmental Change Institute, University of Oxford"}, "57188729013": {"Name": "Patrick J.", "AuthorID": "57188729013", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Environmental Change Institute, University of Oxford"}, "25227592000": {"Name": "Bright S.", "AuthorID": "25227592000", "AffiliationID": "60023861, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Law Faculty, New College, University of Oxford"}, "10439402600": {"Name": "Wilkinson S.", "AuthorID": "10439402600", "AffiliationID": "60023932", "AffiliationName": "School of the Built Environment, University of Technology"}, "7101998515": {"Name": "Dixon T.J.", "AuthorID": "7101998515", "AffiliationID": "60012197", "AffiliationName": "School of the Built Environment, University of Reading"}}}
