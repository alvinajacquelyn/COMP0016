Here, a direct correlation between the initial oxidation of graphene-oxide precursors and final supercapacitor performance is demonstrated. Building on this significant understanding, the optimized three-dimensional graphene frameworks achieve a superior gravimetric capacitance of 330 F g\u22121 in an aqueous electrolyte. This extraordinary performance is also validated in various electrolytes at a device level. In a commercially used organic electrolyte, an excellent volumetric energy density of 51 Wh L\u22121 can be delivered, which significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art commercial carbon-based devices. Furthermore, solid-state supercapacitor with a gel electrolyte shows an impressive capacitance of 285 F g\u22121 with a rate capability of 79% at 20 A g\u22121 and capacitance retention of 93% after 20,000 cycles.
