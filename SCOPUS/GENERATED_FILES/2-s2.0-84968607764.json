This value-modulated oculomotor capture effect may reflect biased competition in the oculomotor system, such that the relationship between a stimulus feature and reward enhances that feature\u2019s representation on an internal priority map. However, it is also possible that this effect is a result of reward reducing the threshold for a saccade to be made to salient items. Here, we demonstrate value-modulated oculomotor capture when two reward-associated distractor stimuli are presented simultaneously in the same search display. The influence of reward on oculomotor capture is found to be most prominent at the shortest saccade latencies. We conclude that the value-modulated oculomotor capture effect is a consequence of biased competition on the saccade priority map and cannot be explained by a general reduction in saccadic threshold.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Attention in learning", "Attentional capture", "Eye movements and visual attention"], "IndexKeywords": ["Attention", "Eye Movements", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Reaction Time", "Reward", "Saccades", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84968607764", "SubjectAreas": [["Language and Linguistics", "ARTS", "1203"], ["Experimental and Cognitive Psychology", "PSYC", "3205"], ["Sensory Systems", "NEUR", "2809"], ["Linguistics and Language", "SOCI", "3310"]], "AuthorData": {"56402562600": {"Name": "Pearson D.", "AuthorID": "56402562600", "AffiliationID": "60028333", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, UNSW Australia"}, "57189298733": {"Name": "Osborn R.", "AuthorID": "57189298733", "AffiliationID": "60028333", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, UNSW Australia"}, "57203530357": {"Name": "Whitford T.J.", "AuthorID": "57203530357", "AffiliationID": "60028333", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, UNSW Australia"}, "6603589906": {"Name": "Le Pelley M.E.", "AuthorID": "6603589906", "AffiliationID": "60028333", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, UNSW Australia"}, "56184242100": {"Name": "Failing M.", "AuthorID": "56184242100", "AffiliationID": "60008734", "AffiliationName": "Department of Experimental and Applied Psychology, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam"}, "7006932399": {"Name": "Theeuwes J.", "AuthorID": "7006932399", "AffiliationID": "60008734", "AffiliationName": "Department of Experimental and Applied Psychology, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam"}}}
