This association of LHON and MS (LMS) raises an important question about whether there could be a common pathophysiological mechanism involving mitochondrial dysfunction. Objective The primary aim was to define MRI features of LMS and LHON, and to assess the proportions of individuals displaying features typical of MS. Secondarily, we investigated the effect of gender on the risk of developing white matter lesions in the context of LHON. Methods A blinded standardised review of conventional brain MRIs of 30 patients with MS, 31 patients with LHON and 11 patients with LMS was conducted by three independent experts in the field. MS-like MRI features were assessed. Results All patients with LMS and 26% of patients with LHON had white matter lesions. Of these, all patients with LMS and 25% with LHON were found to have an MRI appearance typical of MS. Female patients with LHON had a signi ficantly greater risk of having white matter lesions consistent with MS compared with male patients (relative risk 8.3). Conclusions A blinded review of conventional brain MRIs shows that patients with LMS have a scan appearance indistinguishable from MS. Mitochondrial dysfunction could be a common pathophysiological pathway in the formation of white matter lesions. There appears to be a strong female in fluence on the radiological appearance as well as clinical development of MS in patients with LHON.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Female", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Multiple Sclerosis, Relapsing-Remitting", "Neuroimaging", "Optic Atrophy, Hereditary, Leber", "Sex Factors", "Single-Blind Method", "White Matter", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84927589540", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"24512589900": {"Name": "Matthews L.", "AuthorID": "24512589900", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Nuffield Department of Clinical Neurosciences, Oxford University"}, "35514635900": {"Name": "K\u00fcker W.", "AuthorID": "35514635900", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Nuffield Department of Clinical Neurosciences, Oxford University"}, "56351917800": {"Name": "Palace J.", "AuthorID": "56351917800", "AffiliationID": "60170323, 60002634", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Nuffield Department of Clinical Neurosciences, Oxford University Hospitals NHS Trust"}, "6602781849": {"Name": "Enzinger C.", "AuthorID": "6602781849", "AffiliationID": "60006224", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Division of Neuroradiology, Medical University of Graz"}, "7102945505": {"Name": "Fazekas F.", "AuthorID": "7102945505", "AffiliationID": "60006224", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Medical University of Graz"}, "7102462625": {"Name": "Rovira A.", "AuthorID": "7102462625", "AffiliationID": "60012486", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Hospital Vall d'Hebron"}, "7003671038": {"Name": "Ciccarelli O.", "AuthorID": "7003671038", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "6602459234": {"Name": "Toosy A.", "AuthorID": "6602459234", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "7006486284": {"Name": "Yousry T.", "AuthorID": "7006486284", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "7005407021": {"Name": "Dotti M.T.", "AuthorID": "7005407021", "AffiliationID": "60002838", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurological and Behavioural Sciences, University of Siena"}, "35315596700": {"Name": "Giorgio A.", "AuthorID": "35315596700", "AffiliationID": "60002838", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurological and Behavioural Sciences, University of Siena"}, "7006800085": {"Name": "De Stefano N.", "AuthorID": "7006800085", "AffiliationID": "60002838", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurological and Behavioural Sciences, University of Siena"}, "7202268530": {"Name": "Filippi M.", "AuthorID": "7202268530", "AffiliationID": "60009622, 60082964", "AffiliationName": "Neuroimaging Research Unit and Department of Neurology, San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Vita-Salute San Raffaele University"}, "34973365100": {"Name": "Rocca M.A.", "AuthorID": "34973365100", "AffiliationID": "60009622, 60082964", "AffiliationName": "Neuroimaging Research Unit and Department of Neurology, San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Vita-Salute San Raffaele University"}, "7102315536": {"Name": "Frederiksen J.L.", "AuthorID": "7102315536", "AffiliationID": "60030840, 60004829", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Glostrup Hospital, University of Copenhagen"}, "57220182401": {"Name": "Lukas C.", "AuthorID": "57220182401", "AffiliationID": "60108391", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, St. Josef Hospital Ruhr-University"}}}
