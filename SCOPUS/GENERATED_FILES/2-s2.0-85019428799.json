The investigated compounds are represented as [Py8PzH2], the unmetalated octakis(2-pyridyl)porphyrazine, and the metal complexes [Py8PzM], where M is MgII(H2O), CuII, ZnII, or CoII. The spectroscopic properties and the electrochemical behavior of these compounds were examined in solution of polar (pyridine, dimethyl sulfoxide, and dimethylformamide) and nondonor solvents (CHCl3, CH2Cl2), and the data were compared with those obtained from earlier studies on the related tetrapyrazinoporphyrazines, [Py8TPyzPzM], and the tetraquinoxalinoporphyrazines, [Py8QxPzM], also bearing externally 2-pyridyl rings, and characterized by a more extended central \u03c0-conjugated macrocyclic framework. The newly synthesized porphyrazines possess good solubility and are present in their monomeric form in all the examined solvents as shown by UV-visible spectra. The unmetalated species and metal derivatives undergo multiple one-electron reductions within the potential range of the nonaqueous examined solvents. The derivatives with nonredox active metal centers could accept four electrons on the conjugated macrocycle, while the CoII complex was characterized by a single one-electron oxidation and five reductions in DMSO. The photosensitizer activity for the generation of singlet oxygen was also examined for the MgII(H2O) and ZnII complexes in DMF, with measured \u03c6\u0394 values being, respectively, 0.42 and 0.64, this latter value indicating the ZnII species as being a promising material for use as anticancer agent in photodynamic therapy.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85019428799", "SubjectAreas": [["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"], ["Inorganic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1604"]], "AuthorData": {"56010326800": {"Name": "Sciscione F.", "AuthorID": "56010326800", "AffiliationID": "60032350", "AffiliationName": "Dipartimento di Chimica, Universit\u00e0 di Roma Sapienza"}, "6603312893": {"Name": "Donzello M.", "AuthorID": "6603312893", "AffiliationID": "60032350", "AffiliationName": "Dipartimento di Chimica, Universit\u00e0 di Roma Sapienza"}, "24169967700": {"Name": "Viola E.", "AuthorID": "24169967700", "AffiliationID": "60032350", "AffiliationName": "Dipartimento di Chimica, Universit\u00e0 di Roma Sapienza"}, "6603856755": {"Name": "Ercolani C.", "AuthorID": "6603856755", "AffiliationID": "60032350", "AffiliationName": "Dipartimento di Chimica, Universit\u00e0 di Roma Sapienza"}, "57194239080": {"Name": "Cong L.", "AuthorID": "57194239080", "AffiliationID": "60005837", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Houston"}, "7004463259": {"Name": "Kadish K.", "AuthorID": "7004463259", "AffiliationID": "60005837", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Houston"}}}
