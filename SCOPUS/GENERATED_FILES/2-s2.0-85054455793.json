The (nonlinear) flux at the boundary aims at describing the interactions with the hard walls and is motivated by some recent literature in physics. The singular character of the drift part allows for a large class of maximal monotone operators, generalizing the usual double-well potentials. One of the main novelties of the paper is the absence of any growth condition on the drift term of the evolution, neither on the domain nor on the boundary. A well-posedness result for variational solutions of the system is presented using a priori estimates as well as monotonicity and compactness techniques. A vanishing viscosity argument for the dynamic on the boundary is also presented.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Allen\u2013Cahn equation", "Asymptotic estimates", "Dynamic boundary conditions", "Singular potentials", "Well-posedness"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85054455793", "SubjectAreas": [["Analysis", "MATH", "2603"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"56626062600": {"Name": "Orrieri C.", "AuthorID": "56626062600", "AffiliationID": "60032350", "AffiliationName": "Dipartimento di Matematica, Sapienza Universit\u00e0 di Roma"}, "57056210800": {"Name": "Scarpa L.", "AuthorID": "57056210800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University College London"}}}
