Published by Oxford University Press.Despite similar behavioral effects, attention and expectation influence evoked responses differently: Attention typically enhances event-related responses, whereas expectation reduces them. This dissociation has been reconciled under predictive coding, where prediction errors areweighted by precision associated with attentional modulation. Here,we tested the predictive coding account of attention and expectation using magnetoencephalography and modeling. Temporal attention and sensory expectationwere orthogonally manipulated in an auditory mismatch paradigm, revealing opposing effects on evoked response amplitude. Mismatch negativity (MMN) was enhanced by attention, speaking against its supposedly pre-attentive nature. This interaction effectwas modeled in a canonical microcircuit using dynamic causal modeling, comparing models with modulation of extrinsic and intrinsic connectivity at different levels of the auditory hierarchy. While MMN was explained by recursive interplay of sensory predictions and prediction errors, attention was linked to the gain of inhibitory interneurons, consistent with its modulation of sensory precision.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Attention", "Dynamic causal modeling", "Expectation", "Magnetoencephalography", "Predictive coding"], "IndexKeywords": ["Acoustic Stimulation", "Adult", "Attention", "Auditory Cortex", "Auditory Perception", "Contingent Negative Variation", "Electroencephalography", "Evoked Potentials, Auditory", "Female", "Healthy Volunteers", "Humans", "Magnetoencephalography", "Male", "Neural Networks (Computer)", "Nonlinear Dynamics", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84930910818", "SubjectAreas": [["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"]], "AuthorData": {"37761031800": {"Name": "Auksztulewicz R.", "AuthorID": "37761031800", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60084279, 60022148, 60022106", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Trust, Centre for Neuroimaging, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "36080215500": {"Name": "Friston K.", "AuthorID": "36080215500", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60084279, 60022148, 60022106", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Trust, Centre for Neuroimaging, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}}}
