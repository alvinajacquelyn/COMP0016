A retrospective analysis of hypertensive patients attending specialist tertiary care centers was conducted in 2 European countries (United Kingdom and Czech Republic). Nonadherence to antihypertensive treatment was diagnosed using biochemical analysis of urine (United Kingdom) or serum (Czech Republic). These results were subsequently discussed with each patient, and data on follow-up clinic blood pressure (BP) measurements were collected from clinical files. Of 238 UK patients who underwent biochemical urine analysis, 73 were nonadherent to antihypertensive treatment. Their initial urinary adherence ratio (the ratio of detected to prescribed antihypertensive medications) increased from 0.33 (0-0.67) to 1 (0.67-1) between the first and the last clinic appointments. The observed increase in the urinary adherence ratio in initially nonadherent UK patients was associated with the improved BP control; by the last clinic appointment, systolic and diastolic BPs were \u224819.5 and 7.5 mm Hg lower than at baseline (P=0.001 and 0.009, respectively). These findings were further corroborated in 93 nonadherent hypertensive patients from Czech Republic - their average systolic and diastolic BPs dropped by \u224832.6 and 17.4 mm Hg, respectively (P<0.001), on appointments after the biochemical analysis. Our data show that nonadherent hypertensive patients respond to liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry-based biochemical analysis with improved adherence and significant BP drop. Such repeated biochemical analyses should be considered as a therapeutic approach in nonadherent hypertensive patients.", "AuthorKeywords": ["adherence", "antihypertensive agents", "blood pressure", "chromatography, liquid", "hypertension"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Antihypertensive Agents", "Biomarkers", "Blood Pressure", "Blood Pressure Determination", "Chromatography, Liquid", "Czech Republic", "Female", "Humans", "Hypertension", "Male", "Medication Adherence", "Medication Therapy Management", "Middle Aged", "Outcome and Process Assessment (Health Care)", "Quality Improvement", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85031807726", "SubjectAreas": [["Internal Medicine", "MEDI", "2724"]], "AuthorData": {"56669990000": {"Name": "Gupta P.", "AuthorID": "56669990000", "AffiliationID": "60172345", "AffiliationName": "Division of Cardiovascular Sciences, Faculty of Biology Medicine, and Health, University of Manchester, AV Hill Bldg"}, "56232747100": {"Name": "Patel P.", "AuthorID": "56232747100", "AffiliationID": "60172638", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health Research Leicester Cardiovascular Biomedical Research Unit"}, "56554162300": {"Name": "Gulsin G.S.", "AuthorID": "56554162300", "AffiliationID": "60033125", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiovascular Sciences, University of Leicester"}, "57077442000": {"Name": "Smith P.R.", "AuthorID": "57077442000", "AffiliationID": "60028485", "AffiliationName": "Department of Metabolic Medicine and Chemical Pathology, University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust"}, "57189903929": {"Name": "Lai F.Y.", "AuthorID": "57189903929", "AffiliationID": "60172638", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health Research Leicester Cardiovascular Biomedical Research Unit"}, "7004345054": {"Name": "Samani N.J.", "AuthorID": "7004345054", "AffiliationID": "60172638", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health Research Leicester Cardiovascular Biomedical Research Unit"}, "23003515300": {"Name": "Akbarov A.", "AuthorID": "23003515300", "AffiliationID": "60039507, 60016605", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Forensic Medicine and Toxicology, General University Hospital, Charles University"}, "6603968927": {"Name": "Keavney B.", "AuthorID": "6603968927", "AffiliationID": "60120605, 60111801", "AffiliationName": "Division of Medicine, Central Manchester NHS Foundation Trust, Manchester Academic Health Science Centre"}, "7102134134": {"Name": "Heagerty A.", "AuthorID": "7102134134", "AffiliationID": "60120605, 60111801", "AffiliationName": "Division of Medicine, Central Manchester NHS Foundation Trust, Manchester Academic Health Science Centre"}, "7006672694": {"Name": "Tomaszewski M.", "AuthorID": "7006672694", "AffiliationID": "60120605, 60111801", "AffiliationName": "Division of Medicine, Central Manchester NHS Foundation Trust, Manchester Academic Health Science Centre"}, "7003340468": {"Name": "Mare\u0161ov\u00e1 V.", "AuthorID": "7003340468", "AffiliationID": "119692951", "AffiliationName": "3rd Department of Medicine, Department of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Hypertension Centre"}, "7005993143": {"Name": "\u0160trauch B.", "AuthorID": "7005993143", "AffiliationID": "60039507, 60016605", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Forensic Medicine and Toxicology, General University Hospital, Charles University"}, "57196023138": {"Name": "Widimsk\u00fd J.", "AuthorID": "57196023138", "AffiliationID": "60039507, 60016605", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Forensic Medicine and Toxicology, General University Hospital, Charles University"}, "57191521113": {"Name": "Beech A.", "AuthorID": "57191521113", "AffiliationID": "60033125", "AffiliationName": "University of Leicester"}, "7004751688": {"Name": "Topham P.S.", "AuthorID": "7004751688", "AffiliationID": "60028485", "AffiliationName": "University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust"}, "7102173100": {"Name": "Stanley A.", "AuthorID": "7102173100", "AffiliationID": "60028485", "AffiliationName": "University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust"}, "7006542519": {"Name": "Thurston H.", "AuthorID": "7006542519", "AffiliationID": "60028485", "AffiliationName": "University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust"}, "23012144600": {"Name": "Horne R.", "AuthorID": "23012144600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Health Psychology, University College of London"}, "7404503273": {"Name": "Williams B.", "AuthorID": "7404503273", "AffiliationID": "60024544, 60172638", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health Research, University College London Hospitals Biomedical Research Centre"}}}
