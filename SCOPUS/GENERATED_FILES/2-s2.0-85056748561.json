Here, the authors report on 10 CS patients with dysraphic anomalies who had undergone a combined neurosurgical and general surgical approach to repair the dysraphic anomalies and resect the presacral mass in a single operation. They discuss the spectrum of spinal dysraphism that may coexist in CS in the context of its developmental etiology. METHODS Children with a confirmed CS diagnosis who had undergone the combined operative approach were identified from a departmental database. Presenting features were recorded and preoperative imaging was analyzed to record features of the presacral mass and the dysraphic anomalies. The histopathological nature of the resected presacral mass and the outcomes postoperatively and at the last follow-up were reviewed. RESULTS Between 2008 and 2015, 10 patients presented with CS, 9 with constipation. Median age at the time of surgery was 1.3 years. Six of the 10 patients had anorectal malformation consisting of anal stenosis, rectal stenosis, or imperforate anus. Spinal anomalies included anterior meningocele (5 cases), low-lying conus (8), terminal syrinx (4), fatty filum (5), caudal lipoma (3), and intraspinal cyst (1). In all cases, the lumbosacral spinal canal was accessed via a midline approach with laminoplasty, allowing spinal cord untethering and repair of the dysraphic anomalies. Following dural closure, the incision was extended inferiorly to incorporate a posterior sagittal approach to resect the presacral mass. The histopathological nature of the mass was mature teratoma (8 cases), complex hamartomatous malformation (1), or neurenteric cyst (1). There were no new instances of neurological deterioration, with most instances of persisting morbidity related to constipation (6 cases) or neurogenic bladder dysfunction (8). There were no infective complications, no instances of cerebrospinal fluid fistula, no recurrences of the presacral mass, and no cases of retethering of the spinal cord. CONCLUSIONS Although not part of the original triad, spinal dysraphic anomalies are common in CS and in keeping with a disorder of secondary neurulation. Lumbosacral MRI is an essential investigation when CS is suspected. Children are at risk of sphincter impairment due to the anorectal malformation; however, both spinal cord tethering and compression from the presacral mass may further compromise long-term continence. A combined operative approach to repair the dysraphic anomalies and resect the presacral mass is described with good postoperative and long-term outcomes.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Anorectal malformation", "Anterior meningocele", "Currarino syndrome", "Spinal dysraphism", "Spine", "Teratoma", "Tethered spinal cord"], "IndexKeywords": ["Anal Canal", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Digestive System Abnormalities", "Female", "Humans", "Infant", "Infant, Newborn", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Neurosurgical Procedures", "Rectum", "Sacrum", "Spinal Dysraphism", "Syringomyelia", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85056748561", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"57212668191": {"Name": "Cearns M.D.", "AuthorID": "57212668191", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Neurosurgery"}, "26666893600": {"Name": "Hettige S.", "AuthorID": "26666893600", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Neurosurgery"}, "57216295405": {"Name": "Thompson D.N.P.", "AuthorID": "57216295405", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Neurosurgery"}, "57203257829": {"Name": "De Coppi P.", "AuthorID": "57203257829", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Specialist Neonatal and Paediatric Surgery, Great Ormond Street Hospital"}}}
