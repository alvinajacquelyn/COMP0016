Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the International Epidemiological Association.Background: Telomere length is a putative biomarker of ageing, morbidity and mortality. Its application is hampered by lack of widely applicable reference ranges and uncertainty regarding the present limits of measurement reproducibility within and between laboratories. Methods: We instigated an international collaborative study of telomere length assessment: 10 different laboratories, employing 3 different techniques [Southern blotting, single telomere length analysis (STELA) and real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR)] performed two rounds of fully blinded measurements on 10 human DNA samples per round to enable unbiased assessment of intra- and inter-batch variation between laboratories and techniques. Results: Absolute results from different laboratories differed widely and could thus not be compared directly, but rankings of relative telomere lengths were highly correlated (correlation coefficients of 0.63-0.99). Intra-technique correlations were similar for Southern blotting and qPCR and were stronger than inter-technique ones. However, inter-laboratory coefficients of variation (CVs) averaged about 10% for Southern blotting and STELA and more than 20% for qPCR. This difference was compensated for by a higher dynamic range for the qPCR method as shown by equal variance after z-scoring. Technical variation per laboratory, measured as median of intra- and inter-batch CVs, ranged from 1.4% to 9.5%, with differences between laboratories only marginally significant (P = 0.06). Gel-based and PCR-based techniques were not different in accuracy. Conclusions: Intra- and inter-laboratory technical variation severely limits the usefulness of data pooling and excludes sharing of reference ranges between laboratories. We propose to establish a common set of physical telomere length standards to improve comparability of telomere length estimates between laboratories.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Ageing", "Biomarker", "Human", "Telomeres", "Variation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aging", "Biomarkers", "Blotting, Southern", "DNA", "Humans", "International Cooperation", "Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction", "Reproducibility of Results", "Telomere"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84930230940", "SubjectAreas": [["Epidemiology", "MEDI", "2713"]], "AuthorData": {"6701718262": {"Name": "Martin-Ruiz C.M.", "AuthorID": "6701718262", "AffiliationID": "60026712, 60006222", "AffiliationName": "Newcastle University Institute for Ageing, Newcastle University"}, "57220472198": {"Name": "Kingston A.", "AuthorID": "57220472198", "AffiliationID": "60026712, 60006222", "AffiliationName": "Newcastle University Institute for Ageing, Newcastle University"}, "7006735617": {"Name": "von Zglinicki T.", "AuthorID": "7006735617", "AffiliationID": "60026712, 60006222", "AffiliationName": "Newcastle University Institute for Ageing, Newcastle University"}, "7202709726": {"Name": "Baird D.", "AuthorID": "7202709726", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cancer and Genetics, Cardiff University"}, "8160993000": {"Name": "Roger L.", "AuthorID": "8160993000", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cancer and Genetics, Cardiff University"}, "7006652249": {"Name": "Boukamp P.", "AuthorID": "7006652249", "AffiliationID": "60017059", "AffiliationName": "Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrum (DKFZ)"}, "16637503000": {"Name": "Krunic D.", "AuthorID": "16637503000", "AffiliationID": "60017059", "AffiliationName": "Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrum (DKFZ)"}, "6701628608": {"Name": "Cawthon R.", "AuthorID": "6701628608", "AffiliationID": "60025488", "AffiliationName": "Department of Human Genetics, University of Utah"}, "55767710400": {"Name": "Dokter M.M.", "AuthorID": "55767710400", "AffiliationID": "60010023", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, University of Groningen"}, "6602378288": {"Name": "Van der Harst P.", "AuthorID": "6602378288", "AffiliationID": "60010023", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, University of Groningen"}, "56370185500": {"Name": "Bekaert S.", "AuthorID": "56370185500", "AffiliationID": "60068590", "AffiliationName": "Bimetra, Clinical Research Center, Ghent University Hospital"}, "23003898800": {"Name": "De Meyer T.", "AuthorID": "23003898800", "AffiliationID": "60033316", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematical Modelling, Statistics and Bioinformatics, Ghent University"}, "7101919223": {"Name": "Roos G.", "AuthorID": "7101919223", "AffiliationID": "60031040", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Biosciences, Ume\u00e5 University"}, "57212401500": {"Name": "Svenson U.", "AuthorID": "57212401500", "AffiliationID": "60031040", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Biosciences, Ume\u00e5 University"}, "57209341986": {"Name": "Codd V.", "AuthorID": "57209341986", "AffiliationID": "60033125", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiovascular Sciences, University of Leicester"}, "7004345054": {"Name": "Samani N.J.", "AuthorID": "7004345054", "AffiliationID": "60033125", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiovascular Sciences, University of Leicester"}, "8986648400": {"Name": "McGlynn L.", "AuthorID": "8986648400", "AffiliationID": "60001490", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cancer Sciences, University of Glasgow"}, "6603960035": {"Name": "Shiels P.G.", "AuthorID": "6603960035", "AffiliationID": "60001490", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cancer Sciences, University of Glasgow"}, "57215490248": {"Name": "Pooley K.A.", "AuthorID": "57215490248", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Public Health and Primary Care, Centre for Cancer Genetic Epidemiology, University of Cambridge"}, "57203070588": {"Name": "Dunning A.M.", "AuthorID": "57203070588", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Oncology, Centre for Cancer Genetic Epidemiology, University of Cambridge"}, "35354537000": {"Name": "Cooper R.", "AuthorID": "35354537000", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Unit for Lifelong Health and Ageing, UCL"}, "57205235639": {"Name": "Wong A.", "AuthorID": "57205235639", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Unit for Lifelong Health and Ageing, UCL"}}}
