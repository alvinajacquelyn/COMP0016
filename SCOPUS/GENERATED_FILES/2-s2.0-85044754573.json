Perovskite oxides have emerged as potential candidates to replace the less economically attractive Pt and IrO2 water splitting catalysts. In this work, excellent electrical conductivity (980 S cm-1) was found for the double perovskite of composition GdBa0.6Sr0.4Co2O6-\u03b4 which is consistent with a better oxygen evolution reaction activity with the onset polarisation of 1.51 V with respect to a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). GdBa1-xSrxCo2O6-\u03b4 with increasing Sr content was found to crystallise in the higher symmetry tetragonal P4/mmm space group in comparison with the undoped GdBaCo2O6-\u03b4 which is orthorhombic (Pmmm), and yields higher oxygen uptake, accompanied by higher Co oxidation states. This outstanding electrochemical performance is explained by the wider carrier bandwidth, which is a function of Co-O-Co buckling angles and Co-O bond lengths. Furthermore the higher oxygen evolution activity was observed despite the formation of non-lattice oxides (mainly hydroxide species) and enrichment of alkaline earth ions on the surface.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Alkaline-earth ions", "Electrical conductivity", "Electrochemical performance", "Oxygen evolution activity", "Oxygen evolution reaction", "Reversible hydrogen electrodes", "Surface characteristics", "Sustainable energy systems"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85044754573", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment", "ENER", "2105"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"]], "AuthorData": {"16310770500": {"Name": "Pramana S.S.", "AuthorID": "16310770500", "AffiliationID": "60006222", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering, Newcastle University"}, "8049052800": {"Name": "Cavallaro A.", "AuthorID": "8049052800", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials, Imperial College London"}, "55976810000": {"Name": "Li C.", "AuthorID": "55976810000", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials, Imperial College London"}, "57207420981": {"Name": "Walker R.J.", "AuthorID": "57207420981", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials, Imperial College London"}, "54882406000": {"Name": "Regoutz A.", "AuthorID": "54882406000", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials, Imperial College London"}, "56785104500": {"Name": "Payne D.J.", "AuthorID": "56785104500", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials, Imperial College London"}, "36987883500": {"Name": "Kilner J.A.", "AuthorID": "36987883500", "AffiliationID": "60011047", "AffiliationName": "International Institute for Carbon Neutral Energy Research (WPI-I2CNER), Kyushu University"}, "7403184422": {"Name": "Ryan M.P.", "AuthorID": "7403184422", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials, Imperial College London"}, "57191513962": {"Name": "Skinner S.J.", "AuthorID": "57191513962", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials, Imperial College London"}, "36130335200": {"Name": "Handoko A.D.", "AuthorID": "36130335200", "AffiliationID": "60030743, 60025710", "AffiliationName": "Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A-STAR), Institute of Materials Research and Engineering"}, "57020378100": {"Name": "Chan K.W.", "AuthorID": "57020378100", "AffiliationID": "60017161", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Science, National University of Singapore"}, "35099678500": {"Name": "Yeo B.S.", "AuthorID": "35099678500", "AffiliationID": "60017161", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Science, National University of Singapore"}, "24511969000": {"Name": "Herrin J.S.", "AuthorID": "24511969000", "AffiliationID": "60005510", "AffiliationName": "Facility for Analysis, Characterization, Nanyang Technological University"}}}
