All rights reserved.Research into memory and epilepsy has focused on measuring problems and exploring causes with limited attention directed at the role of neuropsychological rehabilitation in alleviating post-operative memory difficulties. Objectives: To assess the effects of a memory rehabilitation program in patients with left temporal lobe epilepsy following surgery. Methods: Twenty-four patients agreed to participate and 18 completed the study; nine received memory rehabilitation while nine had no input and were designated as controls. Verbal learning efficiency, naming abilities, memory subjective ratings, ecological activity measures and a language fMRI paradigm were used as outcome measures. Results: Improved verbal learning and naming test performance, increase in memory strategy use and improved self-perception were observed following the rehabilitation. Changes in fMRI activation patterns were seen in the rehabilitation group over the long term. Conclusion: The findings support the potential role of a cognitive rehabilitation program following left temporal lobe surgery.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Anterior temporal lobectomy", "Epilepsy", "Memory", "Neurologic rehabilitation", "Temporal lobe"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Anterior Temporal Lobectomy", "Brain Mapping", "Cognition Disorders", "Cognitive Therapy", "Educational Status", "Epilepsy, Temporal Lobe", "Female", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Neuropsychological Tests", "Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85021198130", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Biological Psychiatry", "NEUR", "2803"]], "AuthorData": {"57194612442": {"Name": "de Vasconcelos Geraldi C.", "AuthorID": "57194612442", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Neurology, Department of Clinical and Experimental Epilepsy"}, "12770131900": {"Name": "Escorsi-Rosset S.", "AuthorID": "12770131900", "AffiliationID": "60008088", "AffiliationName": "Universidade de S\u00e3o Paulo, Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeir\u00e3o Preto, Departamento de Neuroci\u00eancias e Ci\u00eancias do Comportamento"}, "57194612588": {"Name": "Silva A.C.G.", "AuthorID": "57194612588", "AffiliationID": "60008088", "AffiliationName": "Universidade de S\u00e3o Paulo, Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeir\u00e3o Preto, Departamento de Neuroci\u00eancias e Ci\u00eancias do Comportamento"}, "7201515956": {"Name": "Sakamoto A.C.", "AuthorID": "7201515956", "AffiliationID": "60008088", "AffiliationName": "Universidade de S\u00e3o Paulo, Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeir\u00e3o Preto, Departamento de Neuroci\u00eancias e Ci\u00eancias do Comportamento"}, "57203018933": {"Name": "Thompson P.", "AuthorID": "57203018933", "AffiliationID": "60030943", "AffiliationName": "Epilepsy Society Research Centre"}}}
