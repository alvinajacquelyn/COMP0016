Users of a natural sign language encode different sentence meanings through their choice of signs and by altering the sequence and inflections of these signs. Grammatical information is expressed through movement and configurational changes of the hands and face. The visual modality thus influences how grammatical morphology and syntax are instantiated. How would language impairment impact on the acquisition of these types of linguistic devices in child signers? We investigated sentence repetition skills in a group of 11 deaf children who display SLI in British Sign Language (BSL) and 11 deaf controls with no language impairment who were matched for age and years of BSL exposure. The SLI group was significantly less accurate on an overall accuracy score, and they repeated lexical items, overall sentence meaning, sign order, facial expressions, and verb morphological structures significantly less accurately than controls. This pattern of language deficits is consistent with the characterization of SLI in spoken languages even though expression is in a different modality. We conclude that explanations of SLI, and of poor sentence repetition by children with this disorder, must be able to account for both the spoken and signed modalities.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84929024904", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["Language and Linguistics", "ARTS", "1203"], ["Linguistics and Language", "SOCI", "3310"]], "AuthorData": {"7201903216": {"Name": "Marshall C.", "AuthorID": "7201903216", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology and Human Development, Institute of Education, University of London"}, "36019381100": {"Name": "Mason K.", "AuthorID": "36019381100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Deafness, Cognition and Language Research Centre, University College London"}, "36019617900": {"Name": "Rowley K.", "AuthorID": "36019617900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Deafness, Cognition and Language Research Centre, University College London"}, "7402665252": {"Name": "Atkinson J.", "AuthorID": "7402665252", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Deafness, Cognition and Language Research Centre, University College London"}, "7004344871": {"Name": "Woll B.", "AuthorID": "7004344871", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Deafness, Cognition and Language Research Centre, University College London"}, "14819412400": {"Name": "Herman R.", "AuthorID": "14819412400", "AffiliationID": "60025704", "AffiliationName": "Department of Language and Communication Science, City University London"}, "14621764900": {"Name": "Morgan G.", "AuthorID": "14621764900", "AffiliationID": "60025704", "AffiliationName": "Department of Language and Communication Science, City University London"}}}
