The catalyst was prepared by co-impregnation with a Au-Pd weight ratio of 1:19. Experiments were performed at 80-120 \u00b0C, oxygen concentration 0-100% and total pressure 4 bara. Principal products observed were cinnamaldehyde, 3-phenyl-1-propanol and trans-\u03b2-methylstyrene. Although the same catalyst was shown to possess good stability in the oxidation of benzyl alcohol, it deactivated during the oxidation of cinnamyl alcohol, particularly at elevated reaction temperatures. Higher concentration of oxygen used for the reaction led to improved cinnamaldehyde selectivity but lower conversion and higher deactivation rates. Treatment with hydrogen recovered only a fraction of the activity. Deactivation was attributed to Pd leaching and a complex effect of oxygen.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["3 phenyl 1 propanols", "Cinnamyl alcohols", "Complex effects", "Continuous flows", "Deactivation rate", "Elevated reactions", "Oxygen concentrations", "Packed bed microreactors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84976878487", "SubjectAreas": [["Catalysis", "CENG", "1503"]], "AuthorData": {"55073511800": {"Name": "Wu G.", "AuthorID": "55073511800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "9241458400": {"Name": "Cao E.", "AuthorID": "9241458400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "35558454600": {"Name": "Constantinou A.", "AuthorID": "35558454600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "7003522751": {"Name": "Gavriilidis A.", "AuthorID": "7003522751", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "26967586100": {"Name": "Brett G.", "AuthorID": "26967586100", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, Cardiff University"}, "35502091400": {"Name": "Hutchings G.", "AuthorID": "35502091400", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, Cardiff University"}, "35334000300": {"Name": "Ellis P.", "AuthorID": "35334000300", "AffiliationID": "60027782", "AffiliationName": "Johnson Matthey Technology Centre, Blounts Court Sonning Common"}, "19638904700": {"Name": "Kuhn S.", "AuthorID": "19638904700", "AffiliationID": "60025063", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, KU Leuven"}, "23069722500": {"Name": "Bethell D.", "AuthorID": "23069722500", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Liverpool"}}}
