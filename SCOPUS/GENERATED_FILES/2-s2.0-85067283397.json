While ascending nociceptive pathways are normal in cervical dystonia, it is unknown whether descending inhibitory pain pathways are also normal. Methods: We applied a conditioned pain modulation protocol and concomitantly recorded laser evoked potentials in patients with cervical dystonia (n = 15), blepharospasm (n = 15) and healthy volunteers (n = 15). Results: During the application of a heterotopic noxious conditioning stimulation, patients with cervical dystonia, but not with blepharospasm, lacked the physiological reduction of the perceived intensity of a painful test stimulus as well as of the related evoked potential. This was observed in cervical dystonia patients regardless of the presence of clinical pain. Conclusions: Our results suggest that pain in CD is not simply muscular in origin but it also possibly reflects a dysfunction of the descending pain inhibitory control, thus providing a novel venue to explore the pathophysiology of pain in CD.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Diffuse noxious inhibitory control", "Dystonia", "Laser evoked potentials"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Electroencephalography", "Female", "Humans", "Inhibition, Psychological", "Laser-Evoked Potentials", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Neck Pain", "Neural Pathways", "Nociception", "Torticollis"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85067283397", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Geriatrics and Gerontology", "MEDI", "2717"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"7003968661": {"Name": "Tinazzi M.", "AuthorID": "7003968661", "AffiliationID": "60032256", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Biomedicine and Movement Science, University of Verona"}, "18435343700": {"Name": "Squintani G.M.", "AuthorID": "18435343700", "AffiliationID": "119667080", "AffiliationName": "Neurology Unit, Department of Neuroscience, AOUI Verona"}, "57200447455": {"Name": "Segatti A.", "AuthorID": "57200447455", "AffiliationID": "119667080", "AffiliationName": "Neurology Unit, Department of Neuroscience, AOUI Verona"}, "25958636400": {"Name": "Bhatia K.P.", "AuthorID": "25958636400", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Movement Neurosciences, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "57200078012": {"Name": "Donato F.", "AuthorID": "57200078012", "AffiliationID": "106543705", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, SS Giovanni e Paolo Hospital"}, "7006184222": {"Name": "Valeriani M.", "AuthorID": "7006184222", "AffiliationID": "60017905", "AffiliationName": "Neurology Unit, Ospedale Pediatrico Bambino Ges\u00fa"}, "36008087300": {"Name": "Erro R.", "AuthorID": "36008087300", "AffiliationID": "60007061", "AffiliationName": "Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (CEMAND), Department of Medicine, Surgery and Dentistry \u201cScuola Medica Salernitana\u201d, Universit\u00e1 di Salerno"}}}
