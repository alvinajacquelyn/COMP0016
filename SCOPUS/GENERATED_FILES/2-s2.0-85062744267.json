OBJECTIVE: To compare the accuracy and precision between observed resections and preoperative estimates of neurosurgeons and a resection probability map (RPM). We hypothesize that the RPM estimates is as good as senior neurosurgeons. METHODS: A total of 234 consecutive patients were included from 2 centers, who had resective surgery with functional mapping between 2006 and 2012 for a supra-tentorial nonenhancing glioma. Extent of resection (EOR) and residual tumor volume (RTV) were segmented and an RPM was constructed in standard brain space. Three junior and three senior neurosurgeons estimated EOR and RTV, blinded for postoperative results. We determined the agreement between the estimates and calculated the diagnostic accuracy of the neurosurgeons and the RPM to predict the observed resections. RESULTS: Preoperative estimates of resection results by junior and senior neurosurgeons were significantly biased towards overestimation of EOR (4.2% and 11.2%) and underestimation of RTV (4.3 and 9.0 mL), whereas estimates of the RPM were unbiased (-2.6% and -.2 mL, respectively). The limits of agreement were wide for neurosurgeons and for the RPM. The RPM was significantly more accurate in identifying patients in whom an EOR >40% was observed than neurosurgeons. CONCLUSION: Neurosurgeons estimate preoperative resectability before surgery of a nonenhancing glioma rather accurate-with a small bias-and imprecise-with wide limits of agreement. An RPM provides unbiased resectability estimates, which can be useful for surgical decision-making, planning, and education.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Extent of resection", "Glioma", "Neurosurgery", "Resection probability map", "Residual tumor volume"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Brain Mapping", "Brain Neoplasms", "Clinical Competence", "Female", "Glioma", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Neoplasm, Residual", "Neurosurgical Procedures", "Tumor Burden"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85062744267", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"55879340900": {"Name": "Hendriks E.J.", "AuthorID": "55879340900", "AffiliationID": "60001997", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology and Nuclear Medicine, VU University Medical Center"}, "7102989379": {"Name": "Barkhof F.", "AuthorID": "7102989379", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institutes of Neurology and Healthcare Engineering, UCL"}, "6602566797": {"Name": "De Witt Hamer P.C.", "AuthorID": "6602566797", "AffiliationID": "60001997, 60001157", "AffiliationName": "Neurosurgical Center Amsterdam, VU University Medical Center, Academic Medical Center"}, "56022857900": {"Name": "Idema S.", "AuthorID": "56022857900", "AffiliationID": "60001997, 60001157", "AffiliationName": "Neurosurgical Center Amsterdam, VU University Medical Center, Academic Medical Center"}, "57204810550": {"Name": "Vandertop W.P.", "AuthorID": "57204810550", "AffiliationID": "60001997, 60001157", "AffiliationName": "Neurosurgical Center Amsterdam, VU University Medical Center, Academic Medical Center"}, "35757643000": {"Name": "Hervey-Jumper S.L.", "AuthorID": "35757643000", "AffiliationID": "60023691", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurological Surgery, University of California"}, "7404268112": {"Name": "Berger M.S.", "AuthorID": "7404268112", "AffiliationID": "60023691", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurological Surgery, University of California"}, "56496614500": {"Name": "Bernat A.L.", "AuthorID": "56496614500", "AffiliationID": "60015622", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurosurgery, H\u00f4pital de la Piti\u00e9-Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re"}, "14325514400": {"Name": "Mandonnet E.", "AuthorID": "14325514400", "AffiliationID": "60015622", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurosurgery, H\u00f4pital de la Piti\u00e9-Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re"}, "55660206600": {"Name": "Zwinderman A.H.", "AuthorID": "55660206600", "AffiliationID": "60001157", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Academic Medical Center"}, "7005756764": {"Name": "Duffau H.", "AuthorID": "7005756764", "AffiliationID": "60033500, 60031773", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurosurgery, H\u00f4pital Gui de Chauliac, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Montpellier"}}}
