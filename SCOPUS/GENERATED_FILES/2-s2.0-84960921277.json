We compare the achievable performance gain of phase conjugated twin wave applied in two polarization states and time segments with mid-link optical phase conjugation and digital back propagation. For multicarrier transmission scheme such as orthogonal frequency division multiplexing, two recently proposed schemes, namely phase-conjugated pilots and phase-conjugated subcarrier coding are reviewed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["coherent detection", "coherent optical transmission", "Nonlinearity mitigation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Achievable performance", "Coherent detection", "Coherent optical transmissions", "Fiber nonlinearities", "Multicarrier transmission schemes", "Non-linearity compensation", "Nonlinearity mitigation", "Optical-fiber links"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84960921277", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"36160408500": {"Name": "Le S.T.", "AuthorID": "36160408500", "AffiliationID": "60014551", "AffiliationName": "Aston Institute of Photonic Technologies, School of Engineering and Applied Science, Aston University"}, "15128713300": {"Name": "McCarthy M.E.", "AuthorID": "15128713300", "AffiliationID": "60014551", "AffiliationName": "Aston Institute of Photonic Technologies, School of Engineering and Applied Science, Aston University"}, "56783820900": {"Name": "Turitsyn S.K.", "AuthorID": "56783820900", "AffiliationID": "60014551", "AffiliationName": "Aston Institute of Photonic Technologies, School of Engineering and Applied Science, Aston University"}, "7202138906": {"Name": "Phillips I.", "AuthorID": "7202138906", "AffiliationID": "60014551", "AffiliationName": "Aston Institute of Photonic Technologies, School of Engineering and Applied Science, Aston University"}, "7201547136": {"Name": "Ellis A.D.", "AuthorID": "7201547136", "AffiliationID": "60014551", "AffiliationName": "Aston Institute of Photonic Technologies, School of Engineering and Applied Science, Aston University"}, "57110068500": {"Name": "Lavery D.", "AuthorID": "57110068500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Optical Networks Group, University College London"}, "7401627190": {"Name": "Xu T.", "AuthorID": "7401627190", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Optical Networks Group, University College London"}, "7005053644": {"Name": "Bayvel P.", "AuthorID": "7005053644", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Optical Networks Group, University College London"}}}
