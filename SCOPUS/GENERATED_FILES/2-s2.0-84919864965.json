Study Design: Multicenter, retrospective, cohort study. Animals: Dogs (n=240; 261 PCA). Methods: Medical records (2000-2012) from 12 UK orthopedic centers were reviewed for dogs that had PCA to document signalment, diagnosis, arthrodesis method, and complication rates. Follow-up data were used to compare outcome (lameness evaluation and radiographic healing) after use of HDCP and CLP plates. Results: PCA was performed with HDCP in 125 cases, CLP in 105, and by other techniques in 31. Carpal hyperextension injury was the most common diagnosis in HDCP and CLP groups. Surgical site infection (18.3%) was the most common postoperative complication. There was no difference in intra- (11% HDCP, 21% CLP) or postoperative (34% HDCP, 41% CLP) complication rates. Use of external coaptation did not affect postoperative complication rates or outcome. External coaptation related complications occurred in 32% HDCP and 18% CLP (P=.02). At median follow-up, most dogs were classified as having no or mild lameness (73% HDCP, 83% CLP) and there was radiographic healing in 40% HDCP and 46% CLP (P=.8) cases. Conclusions: CLP and HDCP may both be used successfully to achieve pancarpal arthrodesis. Adjunctive external coaptation does not appear to have a measurable clinical benefit but is associated with morbidity.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Arthrodesis", "Bone Plates", "Carpus, Animal", "Cohort Studies", "Dogs", "England", "Female", "Gait", "Male", "Postoperative Period", "Questionnaires", "Retrospective Studies", "Surgical Wound Infection", "Wound Healing"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84919864965", "SubjectAreas": [["Veterinary (all)", "VETE", "3400"]], "AuthorData": {"56091803000": {"Name": "Bristow P.C.", "AuthorID": "56091803000", "AffiliationID": "60170523, 60026530", "AffiliationName": "Queen Mother Hospital for Animals, Royal Veterinary College"}, "26429775100": {"Name": "Meeson R.L.", "AuthorID": "26429775100", "AffiliationID": "60170523, 60026530", "AffiliationName": "Queen Mother Hospital for Animals, Royal Veterinary College"}, "37032576300": {"Name": "Arthurs G.I.", "AuthorID": "37032576300", "AffiliationID": "60170523, 60026530", "AffiliationName": "Queen Mother Hospital for Animals, Royal Veterinary College"}, "56091912400": {"Name": "Thorne R.M.", "AuthorID": "56091912400", "AffiliationID": "60172312", "AffiliationName": "Davies Veterinary Specialists Limited"}, "7005927931": {"Name": "Butterworth S.J.", "AuthorID": "7005927931", "AffiliationID": "100495279", "AffiliationName": "Weighbridge Referral Centre"}, "57202252807": {"Name": "Rutherford S.", "AuthorID": "57202252807", "AffiliationID": "114851904", "AffiliationName": "Croft Referrals"}, "36452481500": {"Name": "Renwick A.I.C.", "AuthorID": "36452481500", "AffiliationID": "100829814", "AffiliationName": "East Neuk Veterinary Clinic"}, "48663162100": {"Name": "Wustefeld-Janssens B.", "AuthorID": "48663162100", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "University of Liverpool Small Animal Teaching Hospital"}, "36167447700": {"Name": "Witte P.G.K.", "AuthorID": "36167447700", "AffiliationID": "60159388", "AffiliationName": "Southern Counties Veterinary Specialists"}, "26533684400": {"Name": "Woods S.", "AuthorID": "26533684400", "AffiliationID": "60021301", "AffiliationName": "The Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies"}, "15071038400": {"Name": "Parsons K.J.", "AuthorID": "15071038400", "AffiliationID": "60020650, 60115486", "AffiliationName": "Bristol Veterinary School"}, "24436999300": {"Name": "Keeley B.J.", "AuthorID": "24436999300", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "North West Surgeons"}, "7402497292": {"Name": "Owen M.R.", "AuthorID": "7402497292", "AffiliationID": "60113745", "AffiliationName": "Dick White Referrals Limited"}, "56091975800": {"Name": "Li A.", "AuthorID": "56091975800", "AffiliationID": "105592679", "AffiliationName": "Chiltern Referral Services"}}}
