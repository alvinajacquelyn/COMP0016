In the EA type A group, 3/28 (11 %; 95 % CI 3.7\u201327.2 %) had malrotation, significantly higher than the reported incidence of malrotation in the general population (p = 0.0008). All three patients in this group were symptomatic with one patient found to have a volvulus at emergency surgery. In the type C group, 6/196 (3 %, 95 % CI 1.4\u20136.5 %) had malrotation, significantly higher than the incidence reported for the general population (p = 0.0033) but not significantly different to that of the type A group (p = 0.0878). There were no patients with malrotation identified in any other EA/TEF type. In total, 9/235 (3.8 %; 95 % CI 2.0\u20137.2 %) patients with EA had malrotation, significantly higher than the 5/1,050 (0.48 %) reported for the general population (p = 0.0002).Introduction: Esophageal atresia/tracheo-esophageal fistula (EA/TEF) has an incidence of approximately 1:3,500. The incidence of malrotation is thought to be 1:200\u2013500. We attempted to define the incidence of a combination and discuss the implications.Methods: This was a retrospective review of all patients admitted to a single institution with a diagnosis of EA or EA/TEF or TEF between April 1981 and January 2013. Patients were included if the position of the duodeno-jejunal flexure (DJF) was determined by upper GI contrast study (UGIS), surgery or post-mortem.Conclusion: There is a high incidence of malrotation in patients with pure EA. In the type A group an attempt to identify the DJF position at gastrostomy siting and/or performance of UGIS in the neonatal period should be undertaken. There should also be a low threshold for UGIS in all EA/TEF patients.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Esophageal atresia", "Malrotation", "Trachea-esophageal fistula", "Volvulus"], "IndexKeywords": ["Esophageal Atresia", "Humans", "Infant", "Intestinal Diseases", "Retrospective Studies", "Rotation", "Torsion Abnormality", "Tracheoesophageal Fistula"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84922104665", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"]], "AuthorData": {"23490082100": {"Name": "Pachl M.", "AuthorID": "23490082100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Surgery, Institute of Child Health and Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "7102181886": {"Name": "Eaton S.", "AuthorID": "7102181886", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Surgery, Institute of Child Health and Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "55128533900": {"Name": "Kiely E.M.", "AuthorID": "55128533900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Surgery, Institute of Child Health and Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "7102454110": {"Name": "Drake D.", "AuthorID": "7102454110", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Surgery, Institute of Child Health and Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "42560973700": {"Name": "Cross K.", "AuthorID": "42560973700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Surgery, Institute of Child Health and Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "57198123285": {"Name": "Curry J.I.", "AuthorID": "57198123285", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Surgery, Institute of Child Health and Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "7007034902": {"Name": "Pierro A.", "AuthorID": "7007034902", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Surgery, Institute of Child Health and Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "55875146300": {"Name": "DeCoppi P.", "AuthorID": "55875146300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Surgery, Institute of Child Health and Great Ormond Street Hospital"}}}
