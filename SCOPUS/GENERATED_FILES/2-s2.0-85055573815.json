In the proposed design, a bank of Phase Sensitive Amplification (PSA) subsystems is introduced for processing offset QAM signals, while sub-channel extraction is achieved via waveform splitting and coherent subtraction. Numerical studies have been carried out to validate functional performance, when processing high-order regular and offset based QAM signals.", "AuthorKeywords": ["add-drop multiplexing", "coherent detection", "OFDM super-channels", "QAM signals"], "IndexKeywords": ["Add-drop-multiplexing", "Coherent detection", "Functional performance", "Performance evaluations", "Phase-sensitive amplifications", "QAM signals", "Reconfigurable optical add-drop multiplexer", "Superchannel"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85055573815", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"], ["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"]], "AuthorData": {"56235152700": {"Name": "Vlachos K.", "AuthorID": "56235152700", "AffiliationID": "60031155", "AffiliationName": "Computer Engineering and Informatics Dept, University of Patras"}, "34881593800": {"Name": "Ferreira F.", "AuthorID": "34881593800", "AffiliationID": "60014551", "AffiliationName": "Aston Institute of Photonic Technologies, Aston University"}, "55372527400": {"Name": "Sygletos S.", "AuthorID": "55372527400", "AffiliationID": "60014551", "AffiliationName": "Aston Institute of Photonic Technologies, Aston University"}}}
