It was observed that the dominant crystalline modification of poly(p-xylylene) in the studied films is \u03b1-form, which is in contrast to thick poly(p-xylylene) films deposited at liquid nitrogen temperature where \u03b2-form prevails. The films exhibit planar texture that can be further enhanced on annealing. The optical properties of the films were studied by UV-vis and IR-spectroscopy. It was found that the samples display surface plasmon resonance, with the peak wavelength in the range of 435-445 nm. The peak positions undergo a redshift upon a long-term storage under ambient conditions. The IR-spectroscopy reveals the bands, which can be assigned to the vibrations of oxygen-containing groups, with intensity increasing with silver content.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Metal-polymer nanocomposites", "Poly(p-xylylene)", "Surface plasmon resonance"], "IndexKeywords": ["Crystalline modifications", "Grazing incidence X-ray diffraction", "Liquid nitrogen temperature", "Metal polymer nanocomposites", "Oxygen containing groups", "Poly(p xylylene)", "Semicrystalline structures", "Vapor deposition polymerization"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84936952825", "SubjectAreas": [["Organic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1605"], ["Polymers and Plastics", "MATE", "2507"], ["Materials Chemistry", "MATE", "2505"]], "AuthorData": {"55365973400": {"Name": "Streltsov D.R.", "AuthorID": "55365973400", "AffiliationID": "60096190, 60021331", "AffiliationName": "Enikolopov Institute of Synthetic Polymer Materials, Russian Academy of Sciences"}, "7007011596": {"Name": "Chvalun S.N.", "AuthorID": "7007011596", "AffiliationID": "60020943", "AffiliationName": "National Research Centre Kurchatov Institute"}, "8968566300": {"Name": "Mailyan K.A.", "AuthorID": "8968566300", "AffiliationID": "60110435, 60021331", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Theoretical and Applied Electromagnetics, Russian Academy of Sciences"}, "55365651800": {"Name": "Gusev A.V.", "AuthorID": "55365651800", "AffiliationID": "60110435, 60021331", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Theoretical and Applied Electromagnetics, Russian Academy of Sciences"}, "6602780638": {"Name": "Ryzhikov I.A.", "AuthorID": "6602780638", "AffiliationID": "60110435, 60021331", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Theoretical and Applied Electromagnetics, Russian Academy of Sciences"}, "57195141504": {"Name": "Kiryukhin Y.I.", "AuthorID": "57195141504", "AffiliationID": "60020943", "AffiliationName": "National Research Centre Kurchatov Institute"}, "14070575500": {"Name": "Orekhov A.S.", "AuthorID": "14070575500", "AffiliationID": "60020943", "AffiliationName": "National Research Centre Kurchatov Institute"}, "7101778872": {"Name": "Vasiliev A.L.", "AuthorID": "7101778872", "AffiliationID": "60020943", "AffiliationName": "National Research Centre Kurchatov Institute"}, "6701648815": {"Name": "Erina N.A.", "AuthorID": "6701648815", "AffiliationID": "60092492", "AffiliationName": "Bruker Nano Inc."}, "8968566200": {"Name": "Pebalk A.V.", "AuthorID": "8968566200", "AffiliationID": "60021340", "AffiliationName": "Karpov Institute of Physical Chemistry"}, "55211283400": {"Name": "Odarchenko Y.I.", "AuthorID": "55211283400", "AffiliationID": "60008134, 60104405", "AffiliationName": "Institut de Sciences des Mat\u00e9riaux de Mulhouse (IS2M), CNRS, UMR 7361"}, "7202335053": {"Name": "Ivanov D.A.", "AuthorID": "7202335053", "AffiliationID": "60007457", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Fundamental Physical and Chemical Engineering, Moscow State University"}}}
