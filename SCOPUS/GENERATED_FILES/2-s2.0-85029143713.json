On the basis of the literature, this paper presents a conceptual framework for managing the risk of extreme events under climate change, and accordingly summarizes the recent developments with a focus on several key topics. In terms of risk determinants, the impacts of climate variability on the frequency of extreme events are addressed, and the various meanings and measurements of specific vulnerability are compared. As for the process of risk management, the dynamic assessment approach regarding future climate condition is emphasized. Besides, in view of decision making the available means to enhance the effectiveness of adaptation and mitigation strategies are highlighted. Finally, uncertainty is discussed with respect to its sources and solution.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Adaptation", "Climate change", "Extreme events", "Risk management", "Uncertainty"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adaptation", "Climate change adaptation", "Climate variability", "Conceptual frameworks", "Dynamic assessment", "Extreme events", "Mitigation strategy", "Uncertainty"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85029143713", "SubjectAreas": [["Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment", "ENER", "2105"], ["Environmental Science (all)", "ENVI", "2300"], ["Strategy and Management", "BUSI", "1408"], ["Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering", "ENGI", "2209"]], "AuthorData": {"55438199300": {"Name": "Yuan X.", "AuthorID": "55438199300", "AffiliationID": "60016835", "AffiliationName": "Center for Energy and Environmental Policy Research, Beijing Institute of Technology"}, "13005705700": {"Name": "Wei Y.", "AuthorID": "13005705700", "AffiliationID": "60016835", "AffiliationName": "School of Management and Economics, Beijing Institute of Technology"}, "55710778700": {"Name": "Wang B.", "AuthorID": "55710778700", "AffiliationID": "60108755", "AffiliationName": "School of Resources and Safety Engineering, China University of Mining and Technology (Beijing)"}, "55272317400": {"Name": "Mi Z.", "AuthorID": "55272317400", "AffiliationID": "60000112, 60122652", "AffiliationName": "Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research, School of International Development, University of East Anglia"}}}
