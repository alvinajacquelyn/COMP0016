A nine-valent vaccine (Gardasil 9\u00ae) received the European market authorization in 2015 to protect, with only 2 doses, against around 90% of all HPV positive cancers, over 80% of high-grade precancerous lesions and 90% of genital warts caused by HPV types 6/11. Methods: A dynamic transmission model simulating the natural history of HPV-infections was calibrated to the Italian setting and used to estimate costs and QALYs associated with vaccination strategies. The analyses compared two strategies with the nine-valent vaccine (cervical cancer screening and vaccination in girls only or vaccination in boys and girls) to four alternative strategies (cervical cancer screening and vaccination with quadrialent vaccine in girls only, in both boys and girls, with bivalent vaccine in girls and screening strategy only). The National Health Service perspective was considered. Conclusion: The switch to the nine-valent vaccine in Italy can further reduce the burden associated to cervical cancer and HPV-related diseases and is highly cost-effective. Results: Compared to the current vaccination program with quadrivalent vaccine, the nine-valent vaccine in a programme including girls and boys shows further reductions of 17% in the incidence of cervical cancer, 35 and 14% in anal cancer for males and females, as well as over a million cases of genital warts avoided after 100 years. The new technology is associated with an ICER of 10,463\u20ac per QALY gained in universal vaccination, decreasing to 4483\u20ac when considering the vaccine switch for girls-only.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cervical cancer", "Cost-effectiveness", "HPV", "Italy", "Vaccination"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85022084286", "SubjectAreas": [["Health Policy", "MEDI", "2719"]], "AuthorData": {"8585704200": {"Name": "Mennini F.", "AuthorID": "8585704200", "AffiliationID": "60033359", "AffiliationName": "Kingston University, Institute for Leadership and Management in Health"}, "15839014200": {"Name": "Bonanni P.", "AuthorID": "15839014200", "AffiliationID": "60021859", "AffiliationName": "University of Florence, Dept. of Health Sciences"}, "38860948500": {"Name": "Bianic F.", "AuthorID": "38860948500", "AffiliationID": "116266524", "AffiliationName": "Mapi"}, "16645716300": {"Name": "Waure C.", "AuthorID": "16645716300", "AffiliationID": "60031984", "AffiliationName": "Catholic University of the Sacred Heart, Institute of Public Health, Section of Hygiene"}, "6603354734": {"Name": "Baio G.", "AuthorID": "6603354734", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "56560086000": {"Name": "Plazzotta G.", "AuthorID": "56560086000", "AffiliationID": "115757475", "AffiliationName": "Mapi"}, "53464367200": {"Name": "Uhart M.", "AuthorID": "53464367200", "AffiliationID": "60065719", "AffiliationName": "Sanofi Pasteur MSD"}, "23477795300": {"Name": "Largeron N.", "AuthorID": "23477795300", "AffiliationID": "60065719", "AffiliationName": "Sanofi Pasteur MSD"}, "57194775991": {"Name": "Rinaldi A.", "AuthorID": "57194775991", "AffiliationID": "100831509", "AffiliationName": "Sanofi Pasteur MSD"}}}
