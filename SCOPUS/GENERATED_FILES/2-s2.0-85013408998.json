The performance of TMDs can be tailored by integration with low dimensional nanostructures which possess quantum size effects and large specific surface areas. In this review, we give a brief description of integrated structures, their synthesis methods, and highlight the applications in hydrogen production, lithium batteries, sensors and detectors.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Electrical and optical properties", "Integrated structure", "Large specific surface areas", "Layered transition metal dichalcogenides", "Low dimensional nanostructures", "Quantum size effects", "Synthesis method", "Transition metal dichalcogenides"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85013408998", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"]], "AuthorData": {"57193393458": {"Name": "Liu D.S.", "AuthorID": "57193393458", "AffiliationID": "60005465", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Electronic Thin Film and Integrated Devices, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China"}, "55472940100": {"Name": "Ji H.", "AuthorID": "55472940100", "AffiliationID": "60005465", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Electronic Thin Film and Integrated Devices, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China"}, "55355756000": {"Name": "Gao L.", "AuthorID": "55355756000", "AffiliationID": "60005465", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Electronic Thin Film and Integrated Devices, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China"}, "10141185300": {"Name": "Wu J.", "AuthorID": "10141185300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "55656088800": {"Name": "Wang Y.", "AuthorID": "55656088800", "AffiliationID": "60005465", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Fundamental and Frontier Science, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China"}, "57218145377": {"Name": "Tong X.", "AuthorID": "57218145377", "AffiliationID": "60005465", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Fundamental and Frontier Science, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China"}, "56844860100": {"Name": "Usman M.", "AuthorID": "56844860100", "AffiliationID": "60005465", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Fundamental and Frontier Science, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China"}, "57197204655": {"Name": "Yu P.", "AuthorID": "57197204655", "AffiliationID": "60005465", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Fundamental and Frontier Science, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China"}, "54780880800": {"Name": "Wang Z.", "AuthorID": "54780880800", "AffiliationID": "60005465", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Fundamental and Frontier Science, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China"}}}
