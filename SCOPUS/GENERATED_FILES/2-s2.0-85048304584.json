Estimating effects of maternal distress over time is difficult due to potential influences of child mental health problems on maternal distress and time-varying confounding by family circumstances.Methods We analysed the UK Millennium Cohort Study, a nationally representative sample with data collected throughout childhood. Adopting a marginal structural modelling framework, we investigated effects of exposure to medium/high levels of maternal psychological distress (Kessler-6 score 8+) on child mental health problems (Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire borderline/abnormal behaviour cut-off) using maternal and child mental health data at 3, 5, 7 and 11 years, accounting for the influence of child mental health on subsequent maternal distress, and baseline and time-varying confounding.Results Prior and concurrent exposures to maternal distress were associated with higher levels of child mental health problems at ages 3, 5, 7 and 11 years. For example, elevated risks of child mental health problems at 11 years were associated with exposure to maternal distress from 3 years [risk ratio (RR) 1.27 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.08-1.49)] to 11 years [RR 2.15 (95% CI 1.89-2.45)]. Prolonged exposure to maternal distress at ages 3, 5, 7 and 11 resulted in an almost fivefold increased risk of child mental health problems.Conclusions Prior, concurrent and, particularly, prolonged exposure to maternal distress raises risks for child mental health problems. Greater support for mothers experiencing distress is likely to benefit the mental health of their children.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Child development", "epidemiology", "life course", "maternal factors"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Age Factors", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Female", "Humans", "Longitudinal Studies", "Male", "Mental Disorders", "Mothers", "Psychiatric Status Rating Scales", "Psychological Distress", "Risk Factors", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "Time Factors", "United Kingdom", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85048304584", "SubjectAreas": [["Applied Psychology", "PSYC", "3202"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"7005279868": {"Name": "Hope S.", "AuthorID": "7005279868", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "23397901800": {"Name": "Pearce A.", "AuthorID": "23397901800", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "16031429800": {"Name": "Micali N.", "AuthorID": "16031429800", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "57203073817": {"Name": "Law C.", "AuthorID": "57203073817", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "6602479846": {"Name": "Chittleborough C.", "AuthorID": "6602479846", "AffiliationID": "60009512", "AffiliationName": "School of Public Health, University of Adelaide"}, "35848848200": {"Name": "Mittinty M.", "AuthorID": "35848848200", "AffiliationID": "60009512", "AffiliationName": "School of Public Health, University of Adelaide"}, "7403674871": {"Name": "Lynch J.", "AuthorID": "7403674871", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "School of Social and Community Medicine, University of Bristol"}, "41861122100": {"Name": "Deighton J.", "AuthorID": "41861122100", "AffiliationID": "60170329, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL and Anna Freud National Centre for Children and Families"}, "55820887400": {"Name": "Maika A.", "AuthorID": "55820887400", "AffiliationID": "60069380", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Social and Political Science, Gadjah Mada University"}}}
