By focusing on families from the same nationality, we show how different practices of mobility differentiate between these middle-class fractions. Building on Andreotti\u2019s framework for \u2018global mindedness\u2019 we suggest that orientations to cosmopolitanism also differentiate between these groups\u2013from tourism (moored middle class), to empathy (immigrant middle class), to visiting (global middle class). By drawing on this conceptualisation, it is possible to understand why, despite the considerable uncertainty that constant mobility generates for children\u2019s education and futures, global middle-class parents appear to assuredly navigate processes of securing and transmitting advantage.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Beck", "cosmopolitanism", "Global middle class", "global mindedness", "mobility"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85060641259", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["Social Sciences (miscellaneous)", "SOCI", "3301"], ["Linguistics and Language", "SOCI", "3310"]], "AuthorData": {"13613645600": {"Name": "Maxwell C.", "AuthorID": "13613645600", "AffiliationID": "60030840", "AffiliationName": "Department of Sociology, University of Copenhagen"}, "8667142200": {"Name": "Yemini M.", "AuthorID": "8667142200", "AffiliationID": "60005681", "AffiliationName": "School of Education, Tel Aviv University"}}}
