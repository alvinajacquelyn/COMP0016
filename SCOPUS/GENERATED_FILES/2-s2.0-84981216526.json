In our surgical experience, this type of defect accounted for almost three-quarters of our practice. To date, patch closure has been considered the gold standard for surgical treatment of these lesions. Our objectives are to evaluate the indications and examine the outcomes of surgery for doubly committed VSDs. METHODS Between October 2013, when our service of paediatric cardiac surgery was opened, and December 2014, 24 patients were referred for surgical closure of VSDs. Among them, 17 patients (71%), with the median age of 6 years, ranging from 2 to 9 years, and with a median body weight of 19 kg, ranging from 11 to 56 kg, underwent surgical repair for doubly committed defects. In terms of size, the defect was considered moderate in 4 and large in 13. Aortic valvular regurgitation (AoVR) was present in 11 patients (65%) preoperatively, with associated malformations found in 14 (82%), with 5 patients (29%) having two or more associated defects. RESULTS After surgery, there was trivial residual shunting in 2 patients (12%). AoVR persisted in 6 (35%), reducing to trivial in 5 (29%) and mild in 1 (6%). Mean stays in the intensive care unit and hospital were 2.6 \u00b1 1.2 days, ranging from 2 to 7 days, and 6.8 \u00b1 0.8 days, ranging from 6 to 9 days, respectively. The mean follow-up was 14 \u00b1 4 months, ranging from 6 to 20 months, with no early or late deaths and without clinical deterioration. CONCLUSIONS The incidence of doubly committed lesions is high in our experience, frequently associated with AoVR and other associated malformation. Early detection is crucial to prevent further progression of the disease. Patch closure remains the gold standard in management, not least since it allows simultaneous repair of associated intracardiac defects.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Aortic valvular regurgitation", "Device closure", "Doubly committed and juxta-arterial ventricular septal defect", "Surgery", "Ventricular septal defect"], "IndexKeywords": ["Abnormalities, Multiple", "Adolescent", "Aortic Valve Insufficiency", "Cardiac Surgical Procedures", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Female", "Heart Septal Defects, Ventricular", "Humans", "Male", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84981216526", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine", "MEDI", "2740"], ["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"57190571171": {"Name": "Shamsuddin A.M.", "AuthorID": "57190571171", "AffiliationID": "60002512, 60032354", "AffiliationName": "Pediatric and Congenital Cardiac Surgery Unit, Department of Surgery, School of Medical Sciences, Health Campus, University of Sains Malaysia"}, "57190573242": {"Name": "Chen Y.C.", "AuthorID": "57190573242", "AffiliationID": "60002512, 60032354", "AffiliationName": "Pediatric and Congenital Cardiac Surgery Unit, Department of Surgery, School of Medical Sciences, Health Campus, University of Sains Malaysia"}, "49764072100": {"Name": "Wong A.R.", "AuthorID": "49764072100", "AffiliationID": "114971380", "AffiliationName": "Pediatric Cardiology Unit, Department of Pediatrics, Hospital Raja Perempuan Zainab II"}, "7202708868": {"Name": "Le T.P.", "AuthorID": "7202708868", "AffiliationID": "101350819", "AffiliationName": "Department for Structural and Congenital Heart Disease, Heart Center Bremen, Klinikum Links der Weser"}, "55574190847": {"Name": "Anderson R.H.", "AuthorID": "55574190847", "AffiliationID": "60026712, 60006222, 60006924", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Genetic Medicine, Newcastle University, International Centre for Life"}, "7006784699": {"Name": "Corno A.F.", "AuthorID": "7006784699", "AffiliationID": "60009171", "AffiliationName": "Pediatric and Congenital Cardiac Surgery, East Midlands Congenital Heart Centre, Glenfield Hospital"}}}
