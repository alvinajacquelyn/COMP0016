It is a common feature of both spoken and signed languages, and recent evidence shows that iconic forms confer an advantage during word learning. We explored whether iconic forms conferred a processing advantage for 13 individuals with aphasia following left-hemisphere stroke. Iconic and control words were compared in four different tasks: repetition, reading aloud, auditory lexical decision and visual lexical decision. An advantage for iconic words was seen for some individuals in all tasks, with consistent group effects emerging in reading aloud and auditory lexical decision. Both these tasks rely on mapping between semantics and phonology. We conclude that iconicity aids spoken word processing for individuals with aphasia. This advantage is due to a stronger connection between semantic information and phonological forms.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Aphasia", "Iconicity", "Phonology", "Semantics", "Sound-symbolism"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Aphasia", "Decision Making", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Reading", "Recognition (Psychology)", "Semantics", "Stroke", "Verbal Behavior"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84925686854", "SubjectAreas": [["Experimental and Cognitive Psychology", "PSYC", "3205"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"], ["Behavioral Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2802"]], "AuthorData": {"22935028100": {"Name": "Meteyard L.", "AuthorID": "22935028100", "AffiliationID": "60012197", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Language Sciences, University of Reading"}, "56515325700": {"Name": "Stoppard E.", "AuthorID": "56515325700", "AffiliationID": "60012197", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Language Sciences, University of Reading"}, "56515243800": {"Name": "Snudden D.", "AuthorID": "56515243800", "AffiliationID": "60012197", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Language Sciences, University of Reading"}, "7005836132": {"Name": "Cappa S.", "AuthorID": "7005836132", "AffiliationID": "60105475, 60082964", "AffiliationName": "IUSS Pavia and Division of Neuroscience, San Raffaele Scientific Institute"}, "55919485500": {"Name": "Vigliocco G.", "AuthorID": "55919485500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Experimental Psychology, University College London"}}}
