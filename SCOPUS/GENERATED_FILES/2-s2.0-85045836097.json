Recent advances in nanoscience allow these tiny machines to be designed and made with unprecedented sophistication and complexity, showing promise in novel applications, including molecular assemblers, self-propelling nanocarriers and in vivo molecular computation. This Feature Article overviews and compares major types of nanoscale machines, including molecular machines, self-assembled nanomachines and hybrid inorganic nanomachines, to reveal common structural features and operating principles across different length scales and material systems. We will focus on systems with feature size between 1 and 100 nm, where classical laws of physics meet those of quantum mechanics, giving rise to a spectrum of exotic physiochemical properties. Concepts of nanomachines will be illustrated by selected seminal work along with state-of-the-art progress, including our own contribution, across the fields. The Article will conclude with a brief outlook of this exciting research area.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85045836097", "SubjectAreas": [["Catalysis", "CENG", "1503"], ["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Ceramics and Composites", "MATE", "2503"], ["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Surfaces, Coatings and Films", "MATE", "2508"], ["Metals and Alloys", "MATE", "2506"], ["Materials Chemistry", "MATE", "2505"]], "AuthorData": {"56013769900": {"Name": "Ellis E.", "AuthorID": "56013769900", "AffiliationID": "60030743, 60025710", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Materials Research and Engineering (IMRE), Agency for Science Technology and Research (ASTAR)"}, "56459762000": {"Name": "Moorthy S.", "AuthorID": "56459762000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Materials Discovery, University College London (UCL)"}, "57201698169": {"Name": "Chio W.I.K.", "AuthorID": "57201698169", "AffiliationID": "60095069, 60025710", "AffiliationName": "Singapore Bioimaging Consortium (SBIC), Agency for Science Technology and Research (ASTAR)"}, "35119311000": {"Name": "Lee T.C.", "AuthorID": "35119311000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Materials Discovery, University College London (UCL)"}}}
