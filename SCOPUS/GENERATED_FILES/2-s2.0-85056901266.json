We calculated cumulative neighborhood SES score weighted by residential time in each address over 6 years for non-movers (n = 7704) and movers (n = 8818) using national grid database. Increase in average neighborhood SES was associated with higher adherence to dietary recommendations in both groups. Among the movers, an upward trajectory from low to high neighborhood SES was also associated with better adherence. Our findings suggest high SES areas might offer healthier food environments than low SES areas.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Dietary habits", "Dietary recommendations", "Neighborhood socioeconomic status"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Feeding Behavior", "Female", "Finland", "Follow-Up Studies", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Residence Characteristics", "Retrospective Studies", "Socioeconomic Factors", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "Time Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85056901266", "SubjectAreas": [["Health (social science)", "SOCI", "3306"], ["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"], ["Life-span and Life-course Studies", "SOCI", "3319"]], "AuthorData": {"6701761338": {"Name": "Lagstr\u00f6m H.", "AuthorID": "6701761338", "AffiliationID": "60025765", "AffiliationName": "Turku University Hospital"}, "16308130100": {"Name": "Stenholm S.", "AuthorID": "16308130100", "AffiliationID": "60025765", "AffiliationName": "Turku University Hospital"}, "7003843149": {"Name": "Pentti J.", "AuthorID": "7003843149", "AffiliationID": "60025765", "AffiliationName": "Turku University Hospital"}, "7003565265": {"Name": "Suominen S.", "AuthorID": "7003565265", "AffiliationID": "60025765", "AffiliationName": "Turku University Hospital"}, "7003922524": {"Name": "Vahtera J.", "AuthorID": "7003922524", "AffiliationID": "60025765", "AffiliationName": "Turku University Hospital"}, "24465136300": {"Name": "Halonen J.I.", "AuthorID": "24465136300", "AffiliationID": "60010493", "AffiliationName": "Finnish Institute of Occupational Health"}, "7103096477": {"Name": "Kawachi I.", "AuthorID": "7103096477", "AffiliationID": "60032499", "AffiliationName": "Department of Social and Behavioral Sciences, Harvard T.
