Nevertheless, gas extraction from tight shale formations is only possible after horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing, which generally demand large amounts of water. Part of the ejected fracturing fluid returns to the surface as flowback water, containing a variety of pollutants. For this reason, water reuse and water recycling technologies have received further interest for enhancing overall shale gas process efficiency and sustainability. Water pretreatment systems (WPSs) can play an important role for achieving this goal. This paper introduces a new optimization model for WPS simultaneous synthesis, especially developed for flowback water from shale gas production. A multistage superstructure is proposed for the optimal WPS design, including several water pretreatment alternatives. The mathematical model is formulated via generalized disjunctive programming (GDP) and solved by re-formulation as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem, to minimize the total annualized cost. Hence, the superstructure allows identifying the optimal pretreatment sequence with minimum cost, according to inlet water composition and wastewater-desired destination (i.e., water reuse as fracking fluid or recycling). Three case studies are performed to illustrate the applicability of the proposed approach under specific composition constraints. Thus, four distinct flowback water compositions are evaluated for the different target conditions. The results highlight the ability of the developed model for the cost-effective WPS synthesis, by reaching the required water compositions for each specified destination.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Generalized disjunctive programming", "Global energy market", "Mixed integer non-linear programming problems", "Optimization modeling", "Potential resources", "Pretreatment systems", "Simultaneous synthesis", "Water recycling technology"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85020041643", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"], ["Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering", "ENGI", "2209"]], "AuthorData": {"57191916647": {"Name": "Carrero-Parre\u00f1o A.", "AuthorID": "57191916647", "AffiliationID": "60010844", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Chemical Process Engineering, University of Alicante"}, "55757455100": {"Name": "Onishi V.", "AuthorID": "55757455100", "AffiliationID": "60010844", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Chemical Process Engineering, University of Alicante"}, "15045675300": {"Name": "Salcedo-D\u00edaz R.", "AuthorID": "15045675300", "AffiliationID": "60010844", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University of Alicante"}, "8960517100": {"Name": "Ruiz-Femenia R.", "AuthorID": "8960517100", "AffiliationID": "60010844", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University of Alicante"}, "35551514300": {"Name": "Caballero J.", "AuthorID": "35551514300", "AffiliationID": "60010844", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University of Alicante"}, "6603433581": {"Name": "Reyes-Labarta J.", "AuthorID": "6603433581", "AffiliationID": "60010844", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University of Alicante"}, "7006429775": {"Name": "Fraga E.", "AuthorID": "7006429775", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Process Systems Engineering, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}}}
