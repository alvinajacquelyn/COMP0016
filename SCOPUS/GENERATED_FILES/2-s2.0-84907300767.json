However, there is a variety of approaches and definitions, which causes ambiguity, redundancy and discourages the real-world applications of simulation in the construction SC.This study aims to analyse simulation applications for construction SC. The method is a systematic literature review of 86 sources and is based on statistical content analysis. We analysed the application of modelling and simulation in construction SC by underlining the traits of both SC research and simulation. The study revealed a gap in the use of different simulation approaches for the construction SC research. There was a mismatch between the scope of SC research for construction and the level of complexity in the modeled system.We provide a framework for the evaluation of simulations and we propose a guideline for SC simulation studies. \u00a9 2015 Taylor & Francis Group.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Construction supply chain", "Content analysis", "Modelling and simulations", "Research tools", "Simulation applications", "Simulation approach", "Simulation studies", "Systematic literature review"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84907300767", "SubjectAreas": [["Modeling and Simulation", "MATH", "2611"]], "AuthorData": {"56367767700": {"Name": "Papadonikolaki E.", "AuthorID": "56367767700", "AffiliationID": "60118232, 60006288", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Architecture and the Built Environment, Technical University of Delft"}, "6603698259": {"Name": "Verbraeck A.", "AuthorID": "6603698259", "AffiliationID": "60006288", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Technology Policy and Management, Technical University of Delft"}}}
