Therefore it has become vital to deliver the commitments made in the Youth Contract to provide careers advice through Jobcentre Plus advisers. At the same time, other policy changes have put Jobcentre Plus advisers increasingly in the role of benefit enforcers. This paper explores how these two roles interact with each other and influence the experience of young people trying to access careers advice. We propose a framework that would encourage the development of a Jobcentre Plus fit for the purpose of the Youth Contract.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Careers education", "Jobcentre advisers", "Policy implementation"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84994851071", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"]], "AuthorData": {"55824597900": {"Name": "Cagliesi G.", "AuthorID": "55824597900", "AffiliationID": "60021889", "AffiliationName": "University of Greenwich"}, "7006092102": {"Name": "Hawkes D.", "AuthorID": "7006092102", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Education, University College London"}}}
