The macular abnormality is present from birth and is usually nonprogressive, but rarely, visual loss may occur as a result of choroidal neovascularisation. Although there have been considerable advances made in recent years in our understanding of the clinical phenotypes, natural history and molecular genetics of these developmental disorders, many of the causative genes have yet to be identified. It is anticipated that new genetic technologies, such as next-generation sequencing, will soon lead to discovery of such genes; this new information will result in improved understanding of the biology of macular development and will be the first step in developing new therapies. North Carolina macular dystrophy is the most common of these rare developmental macular disorders, and although the phenotype is well described, the molecular genetic basis remains unknown.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Developmental", "Dystrophy", "Genetics", "Macular", "North Carolina"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84978253174", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"7101991490": {"Name": "Michaelides M.", "AuthorID": "7101991490", "AffiliationID": "60013148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genetics, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "56573251100": {"Name": "Moore A.", "AuthorID": "56573251100", "AffiliationID": "60031970", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, University of California School of Medicine"}}}
