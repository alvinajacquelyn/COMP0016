We included 783 patients (mean age 67.6 \u00b1 8.5, 46% female) with available 3T diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI). ACMIs were defined as supratentorial DWI hyperintensities <5 mm with a corresponding hypo/isointense apparent diffusion coefficient signal and iso/hyperintense T2-weighted signal.ResultsA total of 23 ACMIs were found in 16 of the 783 patients (2.0%). Patients with ACMIs did not differ in vascular risk or cognitive profile, but were more often diagnosed with vascular dementia (odds ratio [OR] 5.1; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.4-18.9, p = 0.014). ACMI presence was associated with lower levels of \u03b2-amyloid (p < 0.004) and with vascular imaging markers (lacunar infarcts: OR 3.5, CI 1.3-9.6, p = 0.015; nonlacunar infarcts: OR 4.1, CI 1.4-12.5, p = 0.012; severe white matter hyperintensities: OR 4.8, CI 1.7-13.8, p = 0.004; microbleeds: OR 18.9, CI 2.5-144.0, p = 0.0001). After a median follow-up of 2.1 years, the risk of poor clinical outcome (composite of marked cognitive decline, major vascular event, death, and institutionalization) was increased among patients with ACMIs (hazard ratio 3.0; 1.4-6.0, p = 0.005).ConclusionIn patients with possible VCI, ACMI presence was associated with a high burden of cerebrovascular disease of both small and large vessel etiology and poor clinical outcome. ACMIs may thus be a novel marker of active vascular brain injury in these patients.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Acute Disease", "Aged", "Cerebral Infarction", "Cognitive Dysfunction", "Dementia, Vascular", "Female", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Neuropsychological Tests", "Proportional Hazards Models", "Stroke, Lacunar"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85064227702", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"57189577858": {"Name": "Ferro D.A.", "AuthorID": "57189577858", "AffiliationID": "60032724, 60007989, 60001157", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Brain Center UMC Utrecht, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht University"}, "57204442104": {"Name": "Van Den Brink H.", "AuthorID": "57204442104", "AffiliationID": "60032724, 60007989, 60001157", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Brain Center UMC Utrecht, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht University"}, "26658986600": {"Name": "Exalto L.G.", "AuthorID": "26658986600", "AffiliationID": "60032724, 60007989, 60001157", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Brain Center UMC Utrecht, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht University"}, "57207767283": {"Name": "Boomsma J.M.F.", "AuthorID": "57207767283", "AffiliationID": "60008734, 60022969", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Onze Lieve Vrouwe Gasthuis (OLVG) West, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam"}, "7003443929": {"Name": "Biessels G.J.", "AuthorID": "7003443929", "AffiliationID": "60032724, 60007989, 60001157", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Brain Center UMC Utrecht, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht University"}, "7102989379": {"Name": "Barkhof F.", "AuthorID": "7102989379", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institutes of Neurology and Healthcare Engineering, University College"}, "7004063054": {"Name": "Prins N.D.", "AuthorID": "7004063054", "AffiliationID": "60008734, 60013779", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Alzheimer Center Amsterdam, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam"}, "57204743974": {"Name": "Van Der Flier W.M.", "AuthorID": "57204743974", "AffiliationID": "60008734", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Amsterdam Neuroscience, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam"}}}
