Its genetic variant D76N causes a very rare form of familial systemic amyloidosis. These two types of amyloidoses differ significantly in terms of the tissue localization of deposits and for major pathological features. Considering how the amyloidogenesis of the \u03b2<inf>2</inf>-microglobulin mechanism has been scrutinized in depth for the last three decades, the comparative analysis of molecular and pathological properties of wild type \u03b2<inf>2</inf>-microglobulin and of the D76N variant offers a unique opportunity to critically reconsider the current understanding of the relation between the protein's structural properties and its pathologic behavior.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Amyloidogenesis", "Beta-2-microglobulin", "Comparative analysis", "Genetic variants", "Systemic amyloidosis", "Tissue localization", "Wild types", "Amyloid", "Amyloidosis", "beta 2-Microglobulin", "Doxycycline", "Humans", "Models, Molecular", "Mutation", "Protein Aggregation, Pathological", "Protein Conformation", "Renal Dialysis", "Single-Chain Antibodies"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84927920363", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"6603825748": {"Name": "Stoppini M.", "AuthorID": "6603825748", "AffiliationID": "60015197", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Medicine, Institute of Biochemistry, University of Pavia"}, "7006438238": {"Name": "Bellotti V.", "AuthorID": "7006438238", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Wolfson Drug Discovery Unit, Centre for Amyloidosis and Acute Phase Proteins, Division of Medicine"}}}
