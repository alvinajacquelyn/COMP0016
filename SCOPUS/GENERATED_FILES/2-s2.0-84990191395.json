All Rights Reserved.Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) enters mice via olfactory epithelial cells and then colonizes the trigeminal ganglia (TG). Most TG nerve endings are subepithelial, so this colonization implies subepithelial viral spread, where myeloid cells provide an important line of defense. The outcome of infection of myeloid cells by HSV-1 in vitro depends on their differentiation state; the outcome in vivo is unknown. Epithelial HSV-1 commonly infected myeloid cells, and Cre-Lox virus marking showed nose and lung infections passing through LysM-positive (LysM+) and CD11c+ cells. In contrast, subcapsular sinus macrophages (SSMs) exposed to lymph-borne HSV-1 were permissive only when type I interferon (IFN-I) signaling was blocked; normally, their infection was suppressed. Thus, the outcome of myeloid cell infection helped to determine the HSV-1 distribution: subepithelial myeloid cells provided a route of spread from the olfactory epithelium to TG neurons, while SSMs blocked systemic spread.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Cells, Cultured", "Herpesvirus 1, Human", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Myeloid Cells", "Viral Tropism"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84990191395", "SubjectAreas": [["Microbiology", "IMMU", "2404"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"], ["Insect Science", "AGRI", "1109"], ["Virology", "IMMU", "2406"]], "AuthorData": {"55893002400": {"Name": "Shivkumar M.", "AuthorID": "55893002400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London"}, "26027953400": {"Name": "Milho R.", "AuthorID": "26027953400", "AffiliationID": "60116960", "AffiliationName": "Costello Medical Consulting"}, "7102757923": {"Name": "Stevenson P.", "AuthorID": "7102757923", "AffiliationID": "60022632, 60031004", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry and Molecular Biosciences, University of Queensland and Royal Children's Hospital"}, "56583968600": {"Name": "Lawler C.", "AuthorID": "56583968600", "AffiliationID": "60022632, 60031004", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry and Molecular Biosciences, University of Queensland and Royal Children's Hospital"}}}
