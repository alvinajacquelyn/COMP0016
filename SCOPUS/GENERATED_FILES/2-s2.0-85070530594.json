The primary outcome measure was incidence of hypotony, and secondary outcome measures included comparison of mean IOP and other early complications. Materials and methods: Ours was a retrospective case review of consecutive patients who underwent 350 mm2 Baerveldt implantation in two units over a 2-year period. Data including IOP and complications were collected at 1 day, 1 week, and 1 month following surgery from patients\u2019 notes. Statistical analysis between groups was determined using the unpaired 2-tailed t-test for continuous variables and chi-squared test for categorical variables. Statistical significance was defined at the 0.05 level. Results: A total of 58 eyes of 58 patients were included in this study. Preoperative mean IOP in the 25G group was significantly higher (26.4 \u00b1 6.8 mm Hg) when compared with the 23G group (21.6 \u00b1 4.0 mm Hg) (p = 0.002). The mean postoperative IOP remained significantly higher in the 25G group at day 1 (p=0.004), week 1 (p = 0.008), but not at month 1 (p = 0.744). Four patients in the 23G group had hypotony within 1 month postsurgery compared with no cases in the 25G group (chi-squared test p = 0.038). Conclusion: There was a significantly higher risk of early hypotony and lower IOP in the larger 23G group at days 1 and 7, although the IOP was similar in both groups by 1 month. Clinical significance: After all glaucoma drainage device (GDD) tube implantation, regardless of which needle is used to create the tract, the entry site should always be checked with 2% fluorescein drop and 10.0 nylon suture is used with or without autologous Tenon\u2019s tissue to close any leakage.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Baerveldt", "Drainage device", "Glaucoma", "Leak", "Needle entry"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85070530594", "SubjectAreas": [["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"]], "AuthorData": {"8708548400": {"Name": "Lim K.S.", "AuthorID": "8708548400", "AffiliationID": "60005518", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, Guys & St Thomas\u2019 NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57183584100": {"Name": "Garg A.", "AuthorID": "57183584100", "AffiliationID": "60004111", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, Glaucoma Service, St Thomas\u2019 Hospital"}, "55386842800": {"Name": "Cheng J.", "AuthorID": "55386842800", "AffiliationID": "60004111", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, Glaucoma Service, St Thomas\u2019 Hospital"}, "36622206100": {"Name": "Beltran-Agullo L.", "AuthorID": "36622206100", "AffiliationID": "60004111", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, Glaucoma Service, St Thomas\u2019 Hospital"}, "57204281189": {"Name": "Muthusamy K.", "AuthorID": "57204281189", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "7007041047": {"Name": "Barton K.", "AuthorID": "7007041047", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, Moorfields Eye Hospital"}}}
