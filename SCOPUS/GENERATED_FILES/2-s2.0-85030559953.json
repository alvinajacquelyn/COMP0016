This paper explores the possibilities and limitations offered by a multi-length scale lab-based approach to study a lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide electrode for lithium ion battery applications. The porosity, tortuosity and particle size distribution are extracted from micro- and nano-CT datasets and discussed in terms of the resolution available for the measurement. This work sets the basis for a range of studies to understand how different manufacturing routes affect the microstructure of the electrode and how this in turn affects battery performance.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Battery materials", "Battery performance", "Length scale", "Lithium ions", "Lithium-ion cathode", "Manganese-cobalt oxides", "Nano-CT", "X-ray computed tomography"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85030559953", "SubjectAreas": [["Engineering (all)", "ENGI", "2200"]], "AuthorData": {"57191666829": {"Name": "Daemi S.", "AuthorID": "57191666829", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "13805905800": {"Name": "Brett D.", "AuthorID": "13805905800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "24178516700": {"Name": "Shearing P.", "AuthorID": "24178516700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}}}
