This article traces a specific episode in the history of Novi Sad\u2019s Youth Tribune, when the city\u2019s New Art Practices crossed into political engagement and provocation. I follow the increased bureaucratisation of the Youth Tribune -the resistance to it, and the coercive consequences -along with the ultimate dilution of radical practices in Novi Sad, that forced its key players to appeal to an \u2018Invisible Art\u2019. Though Yugoslavia is frequently characterised as a country which encouraged public debate, the unique and important case of Novi Sad reveals the consequences of a direct confrontation with the city\u2019s cultural apparatus, at a moment marked by oppressive change and political turmoil.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Conceptual art in Yugoslavia", "Group K\u00d4D", "Institutional critique", "Marko Ili\u0107", "Miroslav Mandi\u0107", "New art practice", "Novi Sad", "Slavko Bogdanovi\u0107", "Slobodan Ti\u0161ma", "Socialist self-management", "\u010cedomir Dr\u010da"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85058057876", "SubjectAreas": [["Cultural Studies", "SOCI", "3316"], ["Visual Arts and Performing Arts", "ARTS", "1213"]], "AuthorData": {"57204943508": {"Name": "Ili\u0107 M.", "AuthorID": "57204943508", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL SSEES"}}}
