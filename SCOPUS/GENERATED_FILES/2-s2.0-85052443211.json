Methods: Twenty-four acute SCI patients and 23 healthy controls underwent a high-resolution T1-weighted protocol. Eighteen of those patients and 20 of controls additionally underwent a multi-parameter mapping (MPM) MRI protocol sensitive to the content of tissue structure, including myelin and iron. Patients were examined clinically at baseline, 2, 6, 12, and 24 months post-SCI. We assessed volume and microstructural changes in the spinal cord and brain using T1-weighted MRI, magnetization transfer (MT), longitudinal relaxation rate (R1), and effective transverse relaxation rate (R2*) maps. Regression analysis determined associations between acute qMRI parameters and recovery. Results: At baseline, cord area and its anterior-posterior width were decreased in patients, whereas MT, R1, and R2* parameters remained unchanged in the cord. Within the cerebellum, volume decrease was paralleled by increases of MT and R2* parameters. Early grey matter changes were observed within the primary motor cortex and limbic system. Importantly, early volume and microstructural changes of the cord and cerebellum predicted functional recovery following injury. Conclusions: Neurodegenerative changes rostral to the level of lesion occur early in SCI, with varying temporal and spatial dynamics. Early qMRI markers of spinal cord and cerebellum are predictive of functional recovery. These neuroimaging biomarkers may supplement clinical assessments and provide insights into the potential of therapeutic interventions to enhance neural plasticity.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Acute micro-structural changes", "Brain and spinal cord atrophy", "Quantitative neuroimaging", "Spinal cord injury", "Voxel-based morphometry and quantification"], "IndexKeywords": ["Acute Disease", "Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Brain", "Cervical Vertebrae", "Female", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Predictive Value of Tests", "Recovery of Function", "Spinal Cord Injuries", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85052443211", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"], ["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"]], "AuthorData": {"57203617248": {"Name": "Seif M.", "AuthorID": "57203617248", "AffiliationID": "60025323", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurophysics, Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences"}, "7006759480": {"Name": "Curt A.", "AuthorID": "7006759480", "AffiliationID": "60012614, 60000869", "AffiliationName": "Spinal Cord Injury Center Balgrist, University of Zurich"}, "55240033700": {"Name": "Grabher P.", "AuthorID": "55240033700", "AffiliationID": "60012614, 60000869", "AffiliationName": "Spinal Cord Injury Center Balgrist, University of Zurich"}, "14037413900": {"Name": "Freund P.", "AuthorID": "14037413900", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60084279", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "6602786222": {"Name": "Weiskopf N.", "AuthorID": "6602786222", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60084279", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "7404597283": {"Name": "Thompson A.", "AuthorID": "7404597283", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Brain Repair and Rehabilitation, UCL Institute of Neurology"}}}
