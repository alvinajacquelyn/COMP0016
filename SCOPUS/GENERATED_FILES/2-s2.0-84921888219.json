All rights reserved.The high prevalence of co-morbidities in older people gives rise to an increasing number of prescribed medicine increasing the complexity of medicine management.Multi-compartment compliance aids and dispensing systems have the potential to organize the daily life of an older person. Various features of currently available compliance aids (such as multi-compartment design or an automated reminder function) have proved successful in assisting older patients to take their medication.
