American Geophysical Union. All Rights Reserved.Formation of deep water in the high-latitude North Atlantic is important for the global meridional ocean circulation, and its variability in the past may have played an important role in regional and global climate change. Here we study ocean circulation associated with the last (de)glacial period, using water-column radiocarbon age reconstructions in the Faroe-Shetland Channel, southeastern Norwegian Sea, and from the Iceland Basin, central North Atlantic. The presence of tephra layer Faroe Marine Ash Zone II, dated to ~26.7 ka, enables us to determine that the middepth (1179 m water depth) and shallow subsurface reservoir ages were ~1500 and 1100 14C years, respectively, older during the late glacial period compared to modern, suggesting substantial suppression of the overturning circulation in the Nordic Seas. During the late Last Glacial Maximum and the onset of deglaciation (~20\u201318 ka), Nordic Seas overflow was weak but active. During the early deglaciation (~17.5\u201314.5 ka), our data reveal large differences between 14C ventilation ages that are derived from dating different benthic foraminiferal species: Pyrgo and other miliolid species yield ventilation ages >6000 14C years, while all other species reveal ventilation ages <2000 14C years. These data either suggest subcentennial, regional, circulation changes or that miliolid-based 14C ages are biased due to taphonomic or vital processes. Implications of each interpretation are discussed. Regardless of this \u201cenigma,\u201d the onset of the B\u00f8lling-Aller\u00f8d interstadial (14.5 ka) is clearly marked by an increase in middepth Nordic Seas ventilation and the renewal of a stronger overflow.", "AuthorKeywords": ["deglaciation", "last glacial", "Nordic Seas", "ocean ventilation", "radiocarbon"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85013382096", "SubjectAreas": [["Oceanography", "EART", "1910"], ["Paleontology", "EART", "1911"]], "AuthorData": {"56300680800": {"Name": "Ezat M.M.", "AuthorID": "56300680800", "AffiliationID": "60007948", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geology, Faculty of Science, Beni-Suef University"}, "7103159189": {"Name": "Rasmussen T.L.", "AuthorID": "7103159189", "AffiliationID": "60021255", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Arctic Gas Hydrate, Environment and Climate, Department of Geosciences, UiT, The Arctic University of Norway"}, "6504504125": {"Name": "Thornalley D.J.R.", "AuthorID": "6504504125", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography, University College London"}, "57207820931": {"Name": "Olsen J.", "AuthorID": "57207820931", "AffiliationID": "60029616", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, Aarhus University"}, "7006275882": {"Name": "Skinner L.C.", "AuthorID": "7006275882", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Godwin Laboratory for Palaeoclimate Research, Department of Earth Sciences, University of Cambridge"}, "6603263815": {"Name": "H\u00f6nisch B.", "AuthorID": "6603263815", "AffiliationID": "60033011, 60030162", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences, Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, Columbia University"}, "23987483000": {"Name": "Groeneveld J.", "AuthorID": "23987483000", "AffiliationID": "60008293", "AffiliationName": "Center for Marine Environmental Sciences (MARUM), University of Bremen"}}}
