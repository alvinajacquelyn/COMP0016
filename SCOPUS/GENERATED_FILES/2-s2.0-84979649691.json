Over the past few decades new zoonotic infectious diseases of humans caused by pathogens arising from animal reservoirs have included West Nile virus, Yellow fever virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus, Lassa Fever virus, Hanta virus, Dengue fever virus, Rift Valley fever virus, Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus, and Zika virus. The recent Ebola Virus Disease epidemic in West Africa and the ongoing Zika Virus outbreak in South America highlight the urgent need for local, regional and international public health systems to be be more coordinated and better prepared. The One Health concept focuses on the relationship and interconnectedness between Humans, Animals and the Environment, and recognizes that the health and wellbeing of humans is intimately connected to the health of animals and their environment (and vice versa). Critical to the establishment of a One Health platform is the creation of a multidisciplinary team with a range of expertise including public health officers, physicians, veterinarians, animal husbandry specialists, agriculturalists, ecologists, vector biologists, viral phylogeneticists, and researchers to co-operate, collaborate to learn more about zoonotic spread between animals, humans and the environment and to monitor, respond to and prevent major outbreaks. We discuss the unique opportunities for Middle Eastern and African stakeholders to take leadership in building equitable and effective partnerships with all stakeholders involved in human and health systems to take forward a \u2018One Health\u2019 approach to control such zoonotic pathogens with epidemic potential.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Camels", "Epidemic", "MERS-CoV", "One Health", "Zoonoses"], "IndexKeywords": ["Africa, Western", "Animals", "Communicable Diseases", "Coronavirus Infections", "Ebolavirus", "Epidemics", "Female", "Global Health", "Hemorrhagic Fever Virus, Crimean-Congo", "Hemorrhagic Fever, Ebola", "Humans", "Male", "Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus", "SARS Virus", "South America", "Zika Virus", "Zika Virus Infection", "Zoonoses"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84979649691", "SubjectAreas": [["Microbiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2726"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"7006170723": {"Name": "Zumla A.", "AuthorID": "7006170723", "AffiliationID": "60024544, 60176023", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London, NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, UCL Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "32867537600": {"Name": "Dar O.", "AuthorID": "32867537600", "AffiliationID": "60111140, 60020875", "AffiliationName": "Public Health England, Chatham House Centre on Global Health Security, Royal Institute of International Affairs"}, "57202637161": {"Name": "Kock R.", "AuthorID": "57202637161", "AffiliationID": "60026530", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology and Pathogen Biology, The Royal Veterinary College"}, "57190392873": {"Name": "Muturi M.", "AuthorID": "57190392873", "AffiliationID": "115548256", "AffiliationName": "Kenya Zoonotic Diseases Unit"}, "7004125689": {"Name": "Ntoumi F.", "AuthorID": "7004125689", "AffiliationID": "60017246", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Tropical Medicine, University of T\u00fcbingen"}, "16211587900": {"Name": "Kaleebu P.", "AuthorID": "16211587900", "AffiliationID": "60071671", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council/Uganda Virus Research Institute Research Unit on AIDS"}, "57190392483": {"Name": "Eusebio M.", "AuthorID": "57190392483", "AffiliationID": "60072684", "AffiliationName": "Centro de Investiga\u00e7\u00e3o em Saude de Manhi\u00e7a, National Directorate of Public Health, Ministry of Health"}, "6603198848": {"Name": "Mfinanga S.", "AuthorID": "6603198848", "AffiliationID": "60071565", "AffiliationName": "Muhimbili Medical Research Centre, National Institute for Medical Research"}, "20336943700": {"Name": "Bates M.", "AuthorID": "20336943700", "AffiliationID": "60072805, 60072796", "AffiliationName": "UNZA-UCLMS Project, University Teaching Hospital"}, "56744548100": {"Name": "Mwaba P.", "AuthorID": "56744548100", "AffiliationID": "60072805, 60072796", "AffiliationName": "UNZA-UCLMS Project, University Teaching Hospital"}, "36599955100": {"Name": "Ansumana R.", "AuthorID": "36599955100", "AffiliationID": "110110451", "AffiliationName": "Mercy Hospital Research Laboratory"}, "54888950600": {"Name": "Khan M.", "AuthorID": "54888950600", "AffiliationID": "60017161", "AffiliationName": "Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, National University of Singapore"}, "37096779300": {"Name": "Alagaili A.N.", "AuthorID": "37096779300", "AffiliationID": "60013183", "AffiliationName": "KSU Mammals Research Chair, Zoology Department, College of Science, King Saud University"}, "7005126445": {"Name": "Cotten M.", "AuthorID": "7005126445", "AffiliationID": "60005517", "AffiliationName": "The Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute"}, "23090055800": {"Name": "Azhar E.I.", "AuthorID": "23090055800", "AffiliationID": "60004582", "AffiliationName": "Special Infectious Agents Unit, King Fahd Medical Research Centre, Medical Laboratory Technology Department, Faculty of Applied Medical Sciences, King Abdulaziz University"}, "7004422039": {"Name": "Maeurer M.", "AuthorID": "7004422039", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Division of Therapeutic Immunology, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Karolinska Institutet"}, "7102706668": {"Name": "Ippolito G.", "AuthorID": "7102706668", "AffiliationID": "60072494", "AffiliationName": "\u201cLazzaro Spallanzani\u201d National Institute for Infectious Diseases \u2013 IRCCS"}, "7202854790": {"Name": "Petersen E.", "AuthorID": "7202854790", "AffiliationID": "60071784", "AffiliationName": "The Royal Hospital"}}}
