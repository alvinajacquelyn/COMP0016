One view is that ipsilateral activity suppresses contralateral motor cortex and, accordingly, that inhibiting ipsilateral regions can improve motor learning. Alternatively, the ipsilateral motor cortex may play an active role in the control and/or learning of unilateral hand movements. We approached this question by applying double-blind bihemispheric transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) over both contralateral and ipsilateral motor cortex in a between-group design during 4 d of unimanual explicit sequence training in human participants. Independently of whether the anode was placed over contralateral or ipsilateral motor cortex, bihemispheric stimulation yielded substantial performance gains relative to unihemispheric or sham stimulation. This performance advantage appeared to be supported by plastic changes in both hemispheres. First, we found that behavioral advantages generalized strongly to the untrained hand, suggesting that tDCS strengthened effector-independent representations. Second, functional imaging during speed-matched execution of trained sequences conducted 48 h after training revealed sustained, polarity-independent increases in activity in both motor cortices relative to the sham group. These results suggest a cooperative rather than competitive interaction of the two motor cortices during skill learning and suggest that bihemispheric brain stimulation during unimanual skill learning may be beneficial because it harnesses plasticity in the ipsilateral hemisphere.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Interhemispheric communication", "Neurostimulation", "Plasticity"], "IndexKeywords": ["Brain Mapping", "Double-Blind Method", "Female", "Functional Laterality", "Humans", "Learning", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Motor Activity", "Motor Cortex", "Motor Skills", "Neural Inhibition", "Neuronal Plasticity", "Psychomotor Performance", "Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85026861776", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"]], "AuthorData": {"57192368789": {"Name": "Waters S.", "AuthorID": "57192368789", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Sobell Department for Motor Neuroscience and Motor Disorders, University College London"}, "36139154500": {"Name": "Wiestler T.", "AuthorID": "36139154500", "AffiliationID": "60109771, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, University College London"}, "7004095280": {"Name": "Diedrichsen J.", "AuthorID": "7004095280", "AffiliationID": "60010884", "AffiliationName": "Brain and Mind Institute, Western University"}}}
