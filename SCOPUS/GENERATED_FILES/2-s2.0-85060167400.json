Using lead-lead collisions at sNN=5.02TeV, the ATLAS detector has performed measurements of exclusive dimuon production, light-by-light scattering (via exclusive diphoton production), and photo-nuclear dijet production. These are all important examples of ultraperipheral collisions, where the nuclei do not interact hadronically. A recent study of the opening angles of dimuons produced in hadronic heavy-ion collisions, after subtracting heavy-flavor backgrounds, demonstrates that the dimuons carry information correlated with the overlap geometry, potentially about the density of charges in the QGP itself.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85060167400", "SubjectAreas": [["Nuclear and High Energy Physics", "PHYS", "3106"]], "AuthorData": {"9841272700": {"Name": "Steinberg P.", "AuthorID": "9841272700", "AffiliationID": "60006221", "AffiliationName": "Brookhaven National Laboratory"}, "null": {"Name": null, "AuthorID": null, "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
