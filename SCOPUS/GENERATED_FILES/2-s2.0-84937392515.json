We directly compared 2 arterial spin-labeling techniques in healthy elderly controls and individuals with mild cognitive impairment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective study was approved by the local ethics committee and included 198 consecutive healthy controls (mean age, 73.65\u00b14.02 years) and 43 subjects with mild cognitive impairment (mean age, 73.38\u00b15.85 years). Two pulsed arterial spin-labeling sequences were performed at 3T: proximal inversion with a control for off-resonance effects (PICORE) and flow-sensitive alternating inversion recovery technique (FAIR). Relative cerebral blood flow maps were calculated by using commercial software and standard parameters. Data analysis included spatial normalization of gray matter- corrected relative CBF maps, whole-brain average, and voxelwise comparison of both arterial spin-labeling sequences. RESULTS: Overall, FAIR yielded higher relative CBF values compared with PICORE (controls, 32.7\u00b17.1 versus 30.0\u00b113.1 mL/min/100 g, P= .05; mild cognitive impairment, 29.8\u00b15.4 versus 26.2\u00b18.6 mL/min/100 g, P<.05; all, 32.2\u00b16.8 versus 29.3\u00b112.3 mL/min/100 g, P<.05). FAIR had lower variability (controls, 36.2% versus 68.8%, P < .00001; mild cognitive impairment, 18.9% versus 22.9%, P < .0001; all, 34.4% versus 64.9% P < .00001). The detailed voxelwise analysis revealed a higher signal for FAIR, notably in both convexities, while PICORE had higher signal predominantly in deep cerebral regions. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, FAIR had higher estimated relative CBF and lower interindividual variability than PICORE. In more detail, there were regional differences between both arterial spin-labeling sequences. In summary, these results highlight the need to calibrate arterial spin-labeling sequences.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Aging", "Brain", "Cerebrovascular Circulation", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Mild Cognitive Impairment", "Prospective Studies", "Spin Labels"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84937392515", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"7006209353": {"Name": "L\u00f6vblad K.", "AuthorID": "7006209353", "AffiliationID": "60009963", "AffiliationName": "Division of Diagnostic and Interventional Neuroradiology, Service Neuro-Diagnostique et Neuro-Interventionnel DISIM, University Hospitals of Geneva"}, "6603230213": {"Name": "Montandon M.", "AuthorID": "6603230213", "AffiliationID": "60009963", "AffiliationName": "Division of Diagnostic and Interventional Neuroradiology, Service Neuro-Diagnostique et Neuro-Interventionnel DISIM, University Hospitals of Geneva"}, "23101376000": {"Name": "Viallon M.", "AuthorID": "23101376000", "AffiliationID": "60062760, 60006736, 60102126", "AffiliationName": "CREATIS, Universit\u00e9 de Lyon, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Saint Etienne"}, "9736309600": {"Name": "Haller S.", "AuthorID": "9736309600", "AffiliationID": "60009963", "AffiliationName": "Division of Diagnostic and Interventional Neuroradiology, Service Neuro-Diagnostique et Neuro-Interventionnel DISIM, University Hospitals of Geneva"}, "36698263500": {"Name": "Rodriguez C.", "AuthorID": "36698263500", "AffiliationID": "60009963", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, Geneva University Hospitals"}, "55830166400": {"Name": "Toma S.", "AuthorID": "55830166400", "AffiliationID": "60009963", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, Geneva University Hospitals"}, "25937290200": {"Name": "Giannakopoulos P.", "AuthorID": "25937290200", "AffiliationID": "60009963", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, Geneva University Hospitals"}, "7004309393": {"Name": "Golay X.", "AuthorID": "7004309393", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neurology, University College London"}}}
