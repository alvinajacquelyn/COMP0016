The IDM combines psychological biases on frame-of-reference effects with sociological foci on ability stratification. This combination is hypothesized to lead to working-class children having more positive math self-beliefs and values than equally able salariat children. We further suggest that the same conditions that give rise to the working-class benefit in self-beliefs and values are associated with signaling effects that suppress educational aspirations and attainment. These hypotheses are tested in 1 cross-sectional multinational and 1 longitudinal study. The results in favor of the IDM challenge cultural models of social class differences and have implications for rational action theory.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Academic self-beliefs", "Academic values", "Assimilation versus contrast", "Educational aspirations and attainment", "Social class"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85027969123", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"]], "AuthorData": {"23470098500": {"Name": "Parker P.D.", "AuthorID": "23470098500", "AffiliationID": "60010679", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Positive Psychology and Education, Australian Catholic University"}, "7201585638": {"Name": "Marsh H.W.", "AuthorID": "7201585638", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Education, University of Oxford"}, "56479534900": {"Name": "Guo J.", "AuthorID": "56479534900", "AffiliationID": "60010679", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Positive Psychology and Education, Australian Catholic University"}, "56007931200": {"Name": "Dicke T.", "AuthorID": "56007931200", "AffiliationID": "60010679", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Positive Psychology and Education, Australian Catholic University"}, "56960008800": {"Name": "Anders J.", "AuthorID": "56960008800", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Education, University College London"}, "57195424413": {"Name": "Shure N.", "AuthorID": "57195424413", "AffiliationID": "60007893", "AffiliationName": "IZA Institute of Labor Economics"}}}
