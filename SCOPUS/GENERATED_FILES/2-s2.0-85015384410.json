In this network, the soft fractional frequency reuse (S-FFR) is employed to mitigate the inter-tier interference. We develop a tractable analytical approach to evaluate the throughput and EE of the entire network, which can well predict the impacts of the key system parameters such as number of macrocell BS antennas, RRH density, and S-FFR factor, etc. Our results demonstrate that massive MIMO is still a powerful tool for improving the throughput of the heterogeneous C-RAN while RRHs are capable of achieving higher EE. The impact of S-FFR on the network throughput is dependent on the density of RRHs. Furthermore, more radio resources allocated to the RRHs can greatly improve the EE of the network.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Analytical approach", "Fractional Frequency Reuse", "High throughput", "KeY systems", "Network throughput", "Radio access networks", "Radio resources", "Remote radio heads"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85015384410", "SubjectAreas": [["Computational Theory and Mathematics", "COMP", "1703"], ["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"], ["Hardware and Architecture", "COMP", "1708"], ["Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality", "ENGI", "2213"]], "AuthorData": {"56767610700": {"Name": "He A.", "AuthorID": "56767610700", "AffiliationID": "60022109", "AffiliationName": "School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science, Queen Mary University of London"}, "7601438779": {"Name": "Chen Y.", "AuthorID": "7601438779", "AffiliationID": "60022109", "AffiliationName": "School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science, Queen Mary University of London"}, "6602911293": {"Name": "Elkashlan M.", "AuthorID": "6602911293", "AffiliationID": "60022109", "AffiliationName": "School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science, Queen Mary University of London"}, "56072896600": {"Name": "Wang L.", "AuthorID": "56072896600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "7404759940": {"Name": "Wong K.", "AuthorID": "7404759940", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}}}
