A total of 779 patients (62.5% males, median age 63 years) with IC were included. The median rate of candidaemia was 9 per 1000 admissions. In 10.8% the infection was already present at the time of admission to ICU. Candida albicans accounted for 54% of the isolates, followed by Candida parapsilosis 18.5%, Candida glabrata 13.8%, Candida tropicalis 6%, Candida krusei 2.5%, and other species 5.3%. Infections due to C.krusei (57.9%) and C.glabrata (43.6%) had the highest crude mortality rate. The most common preceding surgery was abdominal (51.5%), followed by thoracic (20%) and neurosurgery (8.2%). Candida glabrata was more often isolated after abdominal surgery in patients \u226560 years, and C.parapsilosis was more often isolated in neurosurgery and multiple trauma patients as well as children \u22641 year of age. The most common first-line treatment was fluconazole (60%), followed by caspofungin (18.7%), liposomal amphotericin B (13%), voriconazole (4.8%) and other drugs (3.5%). Mortality in surgical patients with IC in ICU was 38.8%. Multivariate analysis showed that factors independently associated with mortality were: patient age \u226560 years (hazard ratio (HR) 1.9, p 0.001), central venous catheter (HR 1.8, p 0.05), corticosteroids (HR 1.5, p 0.03), not receiving systemic antifungal treatment for IC (HR 2.8, p <0.0001), and not removing intravascular lines (HR 1.6, p 0.02).", "AuthorKeywords": ["Candida", "Candidaemia", "Epidemiology", "Invasive candidosis", "Surgical intensive care"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Antibiotic Prophylaxis", "Antifungal Agents", "Candida", "Candidiasis, Invasive", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Female", "Humans", "Infant", "Infant, Newborn", "Intensive Care Units", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Prospective Studies", "Surgical Procedures, Operative", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84926312990", "SubjectAreas": [["Microbiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2726"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"6603383349": {"Name": "Klingspor L.", "AuthorID": "6603383349", "AffiliationID": "60019295, 60012311", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Microbiology, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital"}, "7003670629": {"Name": "Tortorano A.M.", "AuthorID": "7003670629", "AffiliationID": "60030318", "AffiliationName": "Dipartimento Scienze Biomediche per la Salute, Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Milano"}, "7003468500": {"Name": "Peman J.", "AuthorID": "7003468500", "AffiliationID": "60032451", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Microbiology, La Fe University Hospital"}, "56078906300": {"Name": "Willinger B.", "AuthorID": "56078906300", "AffiliationID": "60011394", "AffiliationName": "Division of Clinical Microbiology, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Medical University of Vienna"}, "6602209179": {"Name": "Hamal P.", "AuthorID": "6602209179", "AffiliationID": "60003367", "AffiliationName": "Department of Microbiology, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, Palacky University"}, "55908491900": {"Name": "Sendid B.", "AuthorID": "55908491900", "AffiliationID": "60017724, 60107862, 60104665", "AffiliationName": "D\u00e9partement de Parasitologie-Mycologie, Inserm U995, Centre Hospitalier R\u00e9gional Universitaire de Lille, Universit\u00e9 Lille Nord de France"}, "7003600591": {"Name": "Velegraki A.", "AuthorID": "7003600591", "AffiliationID": "60067083, 60028900", "AffiliationName": "Mycology Research Laboratory, Department of Microbiology Medical School, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens"}, "7005677568": {"Name": "Kibbler C.", "AuthorID": "7005677568", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60032819", "AffiliationName": "Centre of Clinical Microbiology, University College London and Department of Medical Microbiology, Royal Free Hospital"}, "55941779900": {"Name": "Meis J.F.", "AuthorID": "55941779900", "AffiliationID": "60002573", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Microbiology, Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre"}, "35796067600": {"Name": "Sabino R.", "AuthorID": "35796067600", "AffiliationID": "60009230", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infectious Diseases, URSZ-Mycology, National Institute of Health Dr Ricardo Jorge"}, "7006977057": {"Name": "Ruhnke M.", "AuthorID": "7006977057", "AffiliationID": "60026245", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Charit\u00e9 Universit\u00e4tsmedizin Berlin"}, "7005156385": {"Name": "Arikan-Akdagli S.", "AuthorID": "7005156385", "AffiliationID": "60011512", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Microbiology, Hacettepe University Medical School"}, "7202734732": {"Name": "Salonen J.", "AuthorID": "7202734732", "AffiliationID": "60023781", "AffiliationName": "Dept. of Medicine P\u00e4ij\u00e4t-H\u00e4me Central Hospital"}, "7801457664": {"Name": "D\u00f3czi I.", "AuthorID": "7801457664", "AffiliationID": "60027332", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Microbiology, University of Szeged"}}}
