The aim of this study was to investigate any association between iron deficiency and febrile seizures (FS) in European children aged 6-60 months. Design Prospective, case-control study. Setting Greek population in Thessaloniki. Patients 50 patients with febrile seizures (cases) and 50 controls (children presenting with fever, without seizures). Interventions None. Main outcome measures Haematologic parameters (haemoglobin concentration, haematocrit, mean corpuscular volume, red cell distribution width), plasma iron, total iron-binding capacity, plasma ferritin, transferrin saturation and soluble transferrin receptors were compared in cases and controls. Results Plasma ferritin was lower (median [range]: 42.8 (3-285.7) vs 58.3 (21.4-195.3 ng/ml; p = 0.02) and Total Iron Binding Capacity (TIBC) higher (mean [Standard Deviation] 267 [58.9] vs 243 [58.45] \u03bcg/dl, p = 0.04) in cases than in controls. Results were similar for 12 complex FS cases (ferritin 30 (3-121 vs 89 (41.8-141.5 ng/lL; TIBC 292.92 [68.0] vs 232.08 [36.27] \u03bcg/dL). Iron deficiency, defined as ferritin <30 ng/ml, was more frequent in cases (24%) than controls (4%; p = 0.004). Ferritin was lower and TIBC higher in 18 with previous seizures than in 32 with a first seizure although haemoglobin and mean cell haemoglobin concentration were higher. Conclusions European children with febrile seizures have lower Ferritin than those with fever alone, and iron deficiency, but not anaemia, is associated with recurrence. Iron status screening should be considered as routine for children presenting with or at high risk for febrile seizures.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Anaemia", "Febrile seizures", "Iron deficiency"], "IndexKeywords": ["Case-Control Studies", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Female", "Ferritins", "Greece", "Humans", "Infant", "Iron", "Male", "Prospective Studies", "Recurrence", "Seizures, Febrile"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84938739369", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"56689630000": {"Name": "Papageorgiou V.", "AuthorID": "56689630000", "AffiliationID": "60015331, 60003720", "AffiliationName": "1st Department of Pediatrics, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Hippokratio General Hospital"}, "6506811588": {"Name": "Vargiami E.", "AuthorID": "6506811588", "AffiliationID": "60015331, 60003720", "AffiliationName": "1st Department of Pediatrics, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Hippokratio General Hospital"}, "35610420500": {"Name": "Kontopoulos E.", "AuthorID": "35610420500", "AffiliationID": "60015331, 60003720", "AffiliationName": "1st Department of Pediatrics, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Hippokratio General Hospital"}, "7005542657": {"Name": "Economou M.", "AuthorID": "7005542657", "AffiliationID": "60015331, 60003720", "AffiliationName": "1st Department of Pediatrics, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Hippokratio General Hospital"}, "56108948600": {"Name": "Athanassiou-Mataxa M.", "AuthorID": "56108948600", "AffiliationID": "60015331, 60003720", "AffiliationName": "1st Department of Pediatrics, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Hippokratio General Hospital"}, "7004578105": {"Name": "Zafeiriou D.I.", "AuthorID": "7004578105", "AffiliationID": "60015331, 60003720", "AffiliationName": "1st Department of Pediatrics, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Hippokratio General Hospital"}, "6507383005": {"Name": "Kardaras P.", "AuthorID": "6507383005", "AffiliationID": "60015331, 60003720", "AffiliationName": "3rd Department of Pediatrics, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Hippokratio General Hospital"}, "26643012600": {"Name": "Kirkham F.", "AuthorID": "26643012600", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Neurosciences Unit, UCL Institute of Child Health"}}}
