Surgical biopsy of these tumours is technically challenging and has historically been associated with considerable risk. To this end, robot-assisted surgery theoretically allows for increased accuracy and precision. In this study we report our experience using the Neuromate robot (Renishaw, Gloucestershire, UK) to perform robot-assisted stereotactic biopsy in children with tumours located within the brainstem. An uncontrolled prospective cohort study was performed (phase II) according to the IDEAL model for safe surgical innovation. All cases were recorded on a prospectively maintained database. The database was searched over a 2-year period between the 1st December 2015 and the 31st November 2017 to identify all children with brainstem tumours that underwent robot-assisted stereotactic brain biopsy. When accessible, the post-operative MRI scans and pre-operative plans were compared to assess the target point localisation error (TPLE). Adverse events were recorded prospectively according to whether they resulted in increased hospital stay, caused neurological injury, or lead to death. In all, 11 consecutive children were identified with brain tumours located within the brainstem. In 10/11 cases specimens were diagnostic; in the remaining case a further biopsy was successful. The most frequent pathology was DIPG (7/15). Seven patients underwent an early post-operative volumetric MRI; the calculated median TPLE was 2.7 mm (range 0.5\u20134.2 mm). There were no surgical complications noted. Robot-assisted stereotactic biopsy in children appears to be feasible and safe. Research databases and comparative studies are warranted to further assess the technique.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Diffuse intrinsic brainstem glioma", "DIPG", "Robotics", "Stereotaxy", "Surgery"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Biopsy", "Brain Stem", "Brain Stem Neoplasms", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Female", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Neuroimaging", "Prospective Studies", "Robotic Surgical Procedures", "Stereotaxic Techniques", "Tomography, X-Ray Computed"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85058195542", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Health Informatics", "MEDI", "2718"]], "AuthorData": {"36643444100": {"Name": "Dawes W.", "AuthorID": "36643444100", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurosurgery, Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "16643089500": {"Name": "Marcus H.J.", "AuthorID": "16643089500", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60020649", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome EPSRC Centre for Interventional and Surgical Sciences, University College London"}, "16242763100": {"Name": "Tisdall M.", "AuthorID": "16242763100", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurosurgery, Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "56255711900": {"Name": "Aquilina K.", "AuthorID": "56255711900", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurosurgery, Great Ormond Street Hospital"}}}
