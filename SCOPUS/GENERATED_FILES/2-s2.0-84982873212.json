Our aim was to assess whether RIPostC is protective following cerebral hypoxia-ischemia in a piglet model of neonatal encephalopathy (NE) using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) biomarkers and immunohistochemistry. After hypoxia-ischemia (HI), 16 Large White female newborn piglets were randomized to: (i) no intervention (n = 8); (ii) RIPostC - with four, 10-min cycles of bilateral lower limb ischemia/reperfusion immediately after HI (n = 8). RIPostC reduced the hypoxic-ischemic-induced increase in white matter proton MRS lactate/N acetyl aspartate (p = 0.005) and increased whole brain phosphorus-31 MRS ATP (p = 0.039) over the 48 h after HI. Cell death was reduced with RIPostC in the periventricular white matter (p = 0.03), internal capsule (p = 0.002) and corpus callosum (p = 0.021); there was reduced microglial activation in corpus callosum (p = 0.001) and more surviving oligodendrocytes in corpus callosum (p = 0.029) and periventricular white matter (p = 0.001). Changes in gene expression were detected in the white matter at 48 h, including K ATP channel and endothelin A receptor. Immediate RIPostC is a potentially safe and promising brain protective therapy for babies with NE with protection in white but not grey matter.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Birth asphyxia", "hypoxia-ischemia", "neonatal encephalopathy", "neuroprotection", "remote ischemic postconditioning"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adenosine Triphosphate", "Animals", "Animals, Newborn", "Aspartic Acid", "Biomarkers", "Brain Mapping", "Disease Models, Animal", "Electroencephalography", "Gene Expression", "Gray Matter", "Hypoxia-Ischemia, Brain", "Immunohistochemistry", "Ischemic Postconditioning", "KATP Channels", "Lactic Acid", "Lower Extremity", "Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy", "Receptor, Endothelin A", "Swine", "White Matter"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84982873212", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"55812285300": {"Name": "Ezzati M.", "AuthorID": "55812285300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Women's Health, University College London"}, "7003578598": {"Name": "Broad K.D.", "AuthorID": "7003578598", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Women's Health, University College London"}, "56123701700": {"Name": "Kawano G.", "AuthorID": "56123701700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Women's Health, University College London"}, "56321283200": {"Name": "Oliver-Taylor A.", "AuthorID": "56321283200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Women's Health, University College London"}, "55110477100": {"Name": "Rocha-Ferreira E.", "AuthorID": "55110477100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Women's Health, University College London"}, "35085901300": {"Name": "Alonso-Alconada D.", "AuthorID": "35085901300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Women's Health, University College London"}, "55318034900": {"Name": "Fierens I.", "AuthorID": "55318034900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Women's Health, University College London"}, "56125026900": {"Name": "Rostami J.", "AuthorID": "56125026900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Women's Health, University College London"}, "57190754324": {"Name": "Jane Hassell K.", "AuthorID": "57190754324", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Women's Health, University College London"}, "22937760400": {"Name": "Hristova M.", "AuthorID": "22937760400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Women's Health, University College London"}, "57210546602": {"Name": "Bennett K.", "AuthorID": "57210546602", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Women's Health, University College London"}, "7102941268": {"Name": "Robertson N.J.", "AuthorID": "7102941268", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Women's Health, University College London"}, "8576309800": {"Name": "Bainbridge A.", "AuthorID": "8576309800", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Physics and Bioengineering, University College London NHS Trust"}, "6507301690": {"Name": "Tachtsidis I.", "AuthorID": "6507301690", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "57203054731": {"Name": "Gressens P.", "AuthorID": "57203054731", "AffiliationID": "109627090", "AffiliationName": "PremUP"}, "35784226800": {"Name": "Fleiss B.", "AuthorID": "35784226800", "AffiliationID": "109627090", "AffiliationName": "PremUP"}, "6602419070": {"Name": "Lebon S.", "AuthorID": "6602419070", "AffiliationID": "109627090", "AffiliationName": "PremUP"}, "7103223278": {"Name": "Yellon D.", "AuthorID": "7103223278", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Hatter Cardiovascular Institute, University College London"}, "6602976997": {"Name": "Hausenloy D.J.", "AuthorID": "6602976997", "AffiliationID": "60004409", "AffiliationName": "National Heart Centre Singapore"}, "7004309393": {"Name": "Golay X.", "AuthorID": "7004309393", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neurology, University College London"}}}
