Published by Elsevier Ltd.It is not unreasonable to imagine that the future may herald higher energy prices and greater regulation of shipping's Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions. With the introduction of the Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI) into MARPOL Annex VI, tools are needed to assist Naval Architects and Marine Engineers to select the best solutions to meet evolving requirements for reduced fuel consumption and associated carbon dioxide emissions. To that end, a concept design tool, the Ship Impact Model (SIM), has been developed for quickly calculating the technical performance of a vessel with one or more Carbon dioxide Reducing Technologies (CRTs) at an early design stage. The underlying basis for this model is the calculation of changes from known 'baseline ships'. The Ship Impact Model has been used in two projects to assess which selection (individual or combination) of Carbon dioxide Reducing Technologies (CRTs) have the most potential, in terms of cost-effectiveness and under other technical, operational and regulatory influences.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Abatement measures", "Carbon dioxide reducing measure", "Carbon dioxide reducing technology", "Decision support", "Greenhouse gas", "Ship design"], "IndexKeywords": ["Carbon dioxide emissions", "Decision supports", "Early design stages", "Energy efficiency design indices (EEDI)", "Naval architects", "Ship designs", "Technical assessment", "Technical performance"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84922367366", "SubjectAreas": [["Environmental Engineering", "ENVI", "2305"], ["Ocean Engineering", "ENGI", "2212"]], "AuthorData": {"55332708600": {"Name": "Calleya J.", "AuthorID": "55332708600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Marine Research Group, Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "25634765900": {"Name": "Pawling R.", "AuthorID": "25634765900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Marine Research Group, Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "7005214688": {"Name": "Greig A.", "AuthorID": "7005214688", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Marine Research Group, Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}}}
