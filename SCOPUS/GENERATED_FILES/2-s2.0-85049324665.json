In this study, in situ synchrotron X-ray tomography is used to determine the temperature dependence of ice-cream's microstructural evolution, together with the underlying physical mechanisms that control microstructural stability. A new tomographic data processing method was developed, enabling the features to be segmented and quantified. The time-resolved results revealed that the melting-recrystallization mechanism is responsible for the evolution of ice crystal size and morphology during thermal cycling between \u221215 and \u22125 \u00b0C, while coalescence of air cells is the dominant coarsening mechanism controlling air bubble size and interconnectivity. This work also revealed other interesting phenomena, including the role of the unfrozen matrix in maintaining the ice cream's microstructural stability and the complex interactions between ice crystals and air structures, e.g. the melting and recrystallization of ice crystals significantly affect the air cell's morphology and the behavior of the unfrozen matrix. The results provide crucial information enhancing the understanding of microstructural evolution in multi-phase multi-state complex foodstuffs and other soft solids.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Coarsening", "Ice cream", "Ice crystals", "Microstructure", "Soft solid", "Tomography"], "IndexKeywords": ["Ice creams", "Ice crystals", "Microstructural stability", "Processing parameters", "Recrystallization mechanisms", "Soft-solid", "Synchrotron X-ray tomography", "Temperature dependence"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85049324665", "SubjectAreas": [["Food Science", "AGRI", "1106"]], "AuthorData": {"54915253600": {"Name": "Guo E.", "AuthorID": "54915253600", "AffiliationID": "60023254", "AffiliationName": "Research Complex at Harwell, RAL"}, "57202777094": {"Name": "Mo J.", "AuthorID": "57202777094", "AffiliationID": "60023254", "AffiliationName": "Research Complex at Harwell, RAL"}, "57203258355": {"Name": "Rockett P.", "AuthorID": "57203258355", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "8504683300": {"Name": "Lee P.D.", "AuthorID": "8504683300", "AffiliationID": "60023254", "AffiliationName": "Research Complex at Harwell, RAL"}, "57202624222": {"Name": "Kazantsev D.", "AuthorID": "57202624222", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "The Manchester X-Ray Imaging Facility, School of Materials, The University of Manchester"}, "7004950219": {"Name": "Bent J.", "AuthorID": "7004950219", "AffiliationID": "60029850", "AffiliationName": "Unilever R&D"}, "6603020581": {"Name": "Van Dalen G.", "AuthorID": "6603020581", "AffiliationID": "60029850", "AffiliationName": "Unilever R&D"}, "6602192495": {"Name": "Schuetz P.", "AuthorID": "6602192495", "AffiliationID": "60029850", "AffiliationName": "Unilever R&D"}, "7003797293": {"Name": "StJohn D.", "AuthorID": "7003797293", "AffiliationID": "60031004", "AffiliationName": "School of Mechanical and Mining Engineering, The University of Queensland"}}}
