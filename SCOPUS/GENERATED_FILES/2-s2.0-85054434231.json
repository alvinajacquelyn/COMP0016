No randomized clinical trials have addressed this question in children. Design: We undertook an open, parallel-group randomized trial in three pediatric hospitals. Subjects: Children with impaired immunity and acute respiratory failure defined as tachypnoea (> 90th centile); a new requirement for supplemental oxygen; and new chest radiograph infiltrates. Interventions: Children were randomly assigned to early PICU admission for continuous positive airways pressure (early continuous positive airways pressure) or to standard care. The primary outcome was endotracheal intubation by 30 days. Measurements and Main Results: One-hundred fourteen children met inclusion criteria of whom 42 were randomized between January 2013 and January 2016. There was no significant difference in endotracheal intubation by 30 days with early continuous positive airways pressure (10/21; 48%) compared with standard care (5/21; 24%), odds ratio 2.9 (0.8-10.9), p value equals to 0.11. However, 30-day mortality was significantly higher with early continuous positive airways pressure (7/21; 33%) compared with standard care (1/21; 5%), odds ratio 10.0 (1.1-90.6), p value equals to 0.041. Mortality at 90 days was early continuous positive airways pressure (11/21; 52%) versus standard care (4/21; 19%), odds ratio 4.7 (1.2-18.6), p value equals to 0.029, whereas mortality at 1 year was similar early continuous positive airways pressure (13/21; 61.9%) versus standard care (9/21; 42.7%), odds ratio 2.2 (0.6-7.4), p value equals to 0.22. There were two serious adverse events: early continuous positive airways pressure (pneumothorax) and standard care (hemothorax). Conclusions: This study provided no evidence to support early PICU admission for continuous positive airways pressure in children with acute respiratory failure and impaired immunity. There was a trend toward increased endotracheal intubation and a higher early mortality in the early continuous positive airways pressure group.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Acute respiratory distress syndrome", "Immunodeficiency continuous positive airways pressure", "Noninvasive ventilation", "Pediatric intensive care unit respiratory failure"], "IndexKeywords": ["Continuous Positive Airway Pressure", "Female", "Humans", "Immunocompetence", "Infant", "Infant, Newborn", "Intensive Care Units, Pediatric", "Length of Stay", "Male", "Organ Dysfunction Scores", "Respiratory Insufficiency"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85054434231", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Critical Care and Intensive Care Medicine", "MEDI", "2706"]], "AuthorData": {"7402415882": {"Name": "Peters M.J.", "AuthorID": "7402415882", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Paediatric and Neonatal Intensive Care Units, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Trust"}, "56801266700": {"Name": "Ray S.", "AuthorID": "56801266700", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Paediatric and Neonatal Intensive Care Units, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Trust"}, "57217664903": {"Name": "Jones A.", "AuthorID": "57217664903", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Paediatric and Neonatal Intensive Care Units, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Trust"}, "6508224721": {"Name": "Agbeko R.", "AuthorID": "6508224721", "AffiliationID": "60026712, 60006222", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cellular Medicine, Newcastle University"}, "57204098150": {"Name": "Mackerness C.", "AuthorID": "57204098150", "AffiliationID": "60024240", "AffiliationName": "Paediatric Intensive Care Unit, Great North Children's Hospital, Royal Victoria Infirmary"}, "7403510089": {"Name": "Davis P.", "AuthorID": "7403510089", "AffiliationID": "60015756", "AffiliationName": "Paediatric Intensive Care Unit, Bristol Royal Hospital for Children"}, "57213788514": {"Name": "George S.", "AuthorID": "57213788514", "AffiliationID": "60015756", "AffiliationName": "Paediatric Intensive Care Unit, Bristol Royal Hospital for Children"}, "7201775981": {"Name": "Klein N.", "AuthorID": "7201775981", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Infectious Disease and Microbiology Unit, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "57203568773": {"Name": "Zenasni Z.", "AuthorID": "57203568773", "AffiliationID": "120826253", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Trials Unit, Intensive Care National Audit and Research Centre"}, "12795667000": {"Name": "Mouncey P.R.", "AuthorID": "12795667000", "AffiliationID": "120826253", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Trials Unit, Intensive Care National Audit and Research Centre"}, "35279884900": {"Name": "Harrison D.A.", "AuthorID": "35279884900", "AffiliationID": "120826253", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Trials Unit, Intensive Care National Audit and Research Centre"}, "57209236959": {"Name": "Rowan", "AuthorID": "57209236959", "AffiliationID": "120826253", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Trials Unit, Intensive Care National Audit and Research Centre"}, "57203102921": {"Name": "Veys P.", "AuthorID": "57203102921", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Immunology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "null": {"Name": null, "AuthorID": null, "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
