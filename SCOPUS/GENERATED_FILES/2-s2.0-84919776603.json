We examined the effect of a short exposure to AA at different stages of 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation. AA caused the upregulation of fatty acid binding protein 4 (FABP4/aP2) following 24 h of differentiation. This was mediated by the prostaglandin F 2\u03b1 (PGF 2\u03b1 ), as inhibition of cyclooxygenases or PGF 2\u03b1 receptor signaling counteracted the AA-mediated aP2 induction. In addition, calcium, protein kinase C, and ERK are all key elements of the pathway through which AA induces the expression of aP2. We also show that treatment with AA during the fi rst 24 h of differentiation upregulates the expression of the transcription factor Fos-related antigen 1 (Fra-1) via the same pathway. Finally, treatment with AA for 24 h at the beginning of the adipocyte differentiation is suffi cient to inhibit the late stages of adipogenesis through a Fra-1-dependent pathway, as Fra-1 knockdown rescued adipogenesis. Our data show that AA is able to program the differentiation potential of preadipocytes by regulating gene expression at the early stages of adipogenesis.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Adipogenesis", "Cell signaling", "Metabolism", "Prostaglandins"], "IndexKeywords": ["3T3-L1 Cells", "Adipocytes, White", "Adipogenesis", "Animals", "Arachidonic Acid", "Calcium Signaling", "Dinoprost", "Down-Regulation", "Fatty Acid-Binding Proteins", "Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental", "Kinetics", "MAP Kinase Signaling System", "Mice", "Protein Kinase C", "Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos", "Receptors, Prostaglandin", "RNA Interference", "RNA, Small Interfering", "Signal Transduction", "Up-Regulation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84919776603", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Endocrinology", "BIOC", "1310"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"36167171100": {"Name": "Nikolopoulou E.", "AuthorID": "36167171100", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Reproductive and Developmental Biology, Department of Surgery and Cancer, Imperial College London"}, "10440551400": {"Name": "Jean-Alphonse F.", "AuthorID": "10440551400", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Reproductive and Developmental Biology, Department of Surgery and Cancer, Imperial College London"}, "54391012100": {"Name": "Grimaldi G.", "AuthorID": "54391012100", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Reproductive and Developmental Biology, Department of Surgery and Cancer, Imperial College London"}, "57209814225": {"Name": "Parker M.", "AuthorID": "57209814225", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Reproductive and Developmental Biology, Department of Surgery and Cancer, Imperial College London"}, "6603356967": {"Name": "Hanyaloglu A.", "AuthorID": "6603356967", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Reproductive and Developmental Biology, Department of Surgery and Cancer, Imperial College London"}, "25030678600": {"Name": "Papacleovoulou G.", "AuthorID": "25030678600", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Division of Women's Health, King's College London"}, "7102667594": {"Name": "Christian M.", "AuthorID": "7102667594", "AffiliationID": "60000064, 60022020", "AffiliationName": "Division of Metabolic and Vascular Health, Warwick Medical School, University of Warwick"}}}
