We estimate the model on Brazilian labor force survey data. In equilibrium, firms of equal productivity locate in different sectors, a fact observed in the data. Wages are characterized by compensating differentials. We show that tightening enforcement does not increase unemployment and increases wages, total output, and welfare by enabling better allocation of workers to higher productivity jobs and improving competition in the formal labor market.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84925708512", "SubjectAreas": [["Economics and Econometrics", "ECON", "2002"]], "AuthorData": {"6601965693": {"Name": "Meghir C.", "AuthorID": "6601965693", "AffiliationID": "60005455", "AffiliationName": "Department of Economics, Yale University"}, "56573824700": {"Name": "Narita R.", "AuthorID": "56573824700", "AffiliationID": "60008088", "AffiliationName": "Department of Economics, University of Sao Paulo"}, "7102560741": {"Name": "Robin J.M.", "AuthorID": "7102560741", "AffiliationID": "60083821", "AffiliationName": "Sciences Po, Office E410"}}}
