We examine the macroeconomic consequences of these variations in a model with incomplete markets, liquid and illiquid assets, and a nominal rigidity. Heightened uncertainty depresses aggregate demand as households respond by hoarding liquid \u201cpaper\u201d assets for precautionary motives, thereby reducing both illiquid physical investment and consumption demand. We document the empirical response of portfolio liquidity and aggregate activity to surprise changes in idiosyncratic income uncertainty and find both to be quantitatively in line with our model. The welfare consequences of uncertainty shocks and of the policy response thereto depend crucially on a household's asset position.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Incomplete markets", "nominal rigidities", "uncertainty shocks"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85060935442", "SubjectAreas": [["Economics and Econometrics", "ECON", "2002"]], "AuthorData": {"22933864300": {"Name": "Bayer C.", "AuthorID": "22933864300", "AffiliationID": "60007493", "AffiliationName": "Dept. of Economics, Universit\u00e4t Bonn"}, "57204958805": {"Name": "Luetticke R.", "AuthorID": "57204958805", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dept. of Economics, University College London"}, "57205638442": {"Name": "Pham-Dao L.", "AuthorID": "57205638442", "AffiliationID": "60102529", "AffiliationName": "Research Data and Service Centre, Deutsche Bundesbank"}, "56037213200": {"Name": "Tjaden V.", "AuthorID": "56037213200", "AffiliationID": "60116667", "AffiliationName": "Blue Yonder GmbH"}}}
