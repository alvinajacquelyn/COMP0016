Central to TBIs devastation is a delayed secondary injury that occurs in 30-40% of TBI patients each year, while they are in the hospital Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Secondary injuries reduce survival rate after TBI and usually occur within 7 days post-injury. State-of-art monitoring of secondary brain injuries benefits from the acquisition of high-quality and time-aligned electrical data i.e., ElectroCorticoGraphy (ECoG) recorded by means of strip electrodes placed on the brains surface, and neurochemical data obtained via rapid sampling microdialysis and microfluidics-based biosensors measuring brain tissue levels of glucose, lactate and potassium. This article progresses the field of multi-modal monitoring of the injured human brain by presenting the design and realization of a new, compact, medical-grade amperometry, potentiometry and ECoG recording bioinstrumentation. Our combined TBI instrument enables the high-precision, real-time neuroelectrochemical monitoring of TBI patients, who have undergone craniotomy neurosurgery and are treated sedated in the ICU. Electrical and neurochemical test measurements are presented, confirming the high-performance of the reported TBI bioinstrumentation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Analog-to-digital conversion", "Bioinstrumentation", "Biosensors", "Microdialysis", "Microfluidics", "Traumatic brain injury"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84973338620", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuropsychology and Physiological Psychology", "PSYC", "3206"], ["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"], ["Biological Psychiatry", "NEUR", "2803"], ["Behavioral Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2802"]], "AuthorData": {"55357565700": {"Name": "Papadimitriou K.", "AuthorID": "55357565700", "AffiliationID": "116758782", "AffiliationName": "Bioinspired VLSI Circuits and Systems Group"}, "57192598081": {"Name": "Wang C.", "AuthorID": "57192598081", "AffiliationID": "116759371", "AffiliationName": "Biomedical Sensors Group"}, "36946364000": {"Name": "Rogers M.", "AuthorID": "36946364000", "AffiliationID": "116759371", "AffiliationName": "Biomedical Sensors Group"}, "25638189300": {"Name": "Gowers S.", "AuthorID": "25638189300", "AffiliationID": "116759371", "AffiliationName": "Biomedical Sensors Group"}, "41661549300": {"Name": "Leong C.", "AuthorID": "41661549300", "AffiliationID": "116759371", "AffiliationName": "Biomedical Sensors Group"}, "7004188643": {"Name": "Boutelle M.", "AuthorID": "7004188643", "AffiliationID": "116759371", "AffiliationName": "Biomedical Sensors Group"}, "35566095900": {"Name": "Drakakis E.", "AuthorID": "35566095900", "AffiliationID": "116758782", "AffiliationName": "Bioinspired VLSI Circuits and Systems Group"}}}
