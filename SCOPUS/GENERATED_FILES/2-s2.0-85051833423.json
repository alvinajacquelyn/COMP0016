However, little is known about what type of content functions well when using augmented reality (AR) in outdoor contexts. This research investigates how different types of AR content\u2013such as text or image \u2013 can affect the flow experience as well as other user affective and behavioural responses. We ran an experimental study with 85 participants at a university campus, where three groups used different apps\u2013AR app with overlaid textual information, AR app with overlaid both textual information and images and an app with audio guide \u2013 to explore the area's historic and cultural background. The results show that overlaying images in addition to the text was clearly the most successful way of attracting attention and providing stronger flow in comparison to the apps that overlaid only text or delivered audio. However, we also discovered that users occasionally interpreted the overlaid imagery to be cues for something else other than what they were designed to represent. Finally, we discuss how AR content can enlarge otherwise invisible details, depict historic elements and unveil interiors of buildings.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Augmented reality", "flow", "in situ study", "knowledge retention", "outdoor exploration"], "IndexKeywords": ["Augmented reality content", "Cultural backgrounds", "flow", "Flow experience", "Knowledge retention", "Situ studies", "Textual information", "University campus"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85051833423", "SubjectAreas": [["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"], ["Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)", "ARTS", "1201"], ["Social Sciences (all)", "SOCI", "3300"], ["Human-Computer Interaction", "COMP", "1709"]], "AuthorData": {"55545446500": {"Name": "Javornik A.", "AuthorID": "55545446500", "AffiliationID": "60108190", "AffiliationName": "Newcastle University Business School"}, "55841280000": {"Name": "Kostopoulou E.", "AuthorID": "55841280000", "AffiliationID": "60085003, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Bartlett School of Architecture, University College London"}, "55841045800": {"Name": "Fatah gen Schieck A.", "AuthorID": "55841045800", "AffiliationID": "60085003, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Bartlett School of Architecture, University College London"}, "57142570700": {"Name": "Koutsolampros P.", "AuthorID": "57142570700", "AffiliationID": "60085003, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Bartlett School of Architecture, University College London"}, "57205031486": {"Name": "Maria Moutinho A.", "AuthorID": "57205031486", "AffiliationID": "60085003, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Bartlett School of Architecture, University College London"}, "7003925319": {"Name": "Rogers Y.", "AuthorID": "7003925319", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London Interaction Centre"}, "7003972937": {"Name": "Julier S.", "AuthorID": "7003972937", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}}}
