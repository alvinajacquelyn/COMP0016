To tackle these challenges, the West African Power Pool was established to build regional power plants and interconnected transmission infrastructures between the countries. In this study, we develop a multi-region economic dispatch model with hourly simulations to evaluate the impact of increased integration of solar PV on the interconnected West Africa electricity network. Our results show the high integration of solar PV plants reduces the supply-demand gap and load shedding in the region. All countries in the region potentially benefit from avoided generation cost and decrease in unserved electricity demand. Our study presents a sustainable strategy to diversify from hydro and gas regional projects and invest in solar PV in order to improve electricity supply and reduce the high electricity prices in the region.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cross-border electricity trade", "Economic dispatch", "Interconnected electricity network", "Power system modelling", "Solar photovoltaic", "West African Power Pool"], "IndexKeywords": ["Economic Dispatch", "Electricity networks", "Electricity trade", "Power pools", "Power system modelling", "Solar photovoltaics"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85048299796", "SubjectAreas": [["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"], ["Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment", "ENER", "2105"], ["Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law", "ENVI", "2308"]], "AuthorData": {"57202418682": {"Name": "Adeoye O.", "AuthorID": "57202418682", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Energy Institute, University College London"}, "26039534700": {"Name": "Spataru C.", "AuthorID": "26039534700", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Energy Institute, University College London"}}}
