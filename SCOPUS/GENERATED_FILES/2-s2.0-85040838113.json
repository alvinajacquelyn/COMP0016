Its spatial transformation has been marked by large-scale landmark architectural projects such as the \u00d4resund Bridge linking the two cities and the mixed-use redevelopment of the Vastra Hamnen (Western Harbour) district in Malm\u00f4 in which the Turning Torso residential skyscraper sits. This paper examines two screen representations of the Turning Torso that have emerged from its construction to its current status as a go-to landmark used to denote the region. The spatial changes of Malm\u00f4 have been documented by Fredrik Gertten, whose film Sossen, arkitekten och det skruvade huset (The Socialist, the Architect, and the Twisted Tower, 2005) maps the web of human and socio-political relationships surrounding the construction of the skyscraper. In the popular crime fction television series Bron/Broen (The Bridge, 2011-), the gleaming fa\u00e7ade of the Turning Torso stands in stark visual contrast to the fragmented and broken welfare state society in which the drama takes place. By examining the socio-political context of the Turning Torso's development and its manifestation in the cultural sphere via screen media, this paper argues that these audiovisual texts articulate and critique the tensions between modern Scan-dinavian welfare state ideology and neoliberal trajectories represented by the Turning Torso.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85040838113", "SubjectAreas": [["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"], ["Urban Studies", "SOCI", "3322"]], "AuthorData": {"57200326380": {"Name": "Chow P.", "AuthorID": "57200326380", "AffiliationID": "120109908", "AffiliationName": "Danish cinema"}}}
