It compares the English state-funded apprenticeship programme for young people with the Finnish and the French programmes with a specific focus on access to learning through the programmes. These three countries represent three types of Western and Northern European education and training systems. The paper argues that there are country-specific meanings of apprenticeship that influence how access to learning along the expansive\u2013restrictive continuum is typically characterised. These country-specific meanings of apprenticeship arise from their context in differing education and training systems. The paper concludes that the English conceptualisation of apprenticeship as training lends itself to more restrictive approaches to apprenticeship than the Finnish and the French programmes in terms of access to learning.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Apprenticeships", "comparative education systems", "comparative VET", "education policy", "vocational education"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84956756656", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"]], "AuthorData": {"55878216100": {"Name": "Mazenod A.", "AuthorID": "55878216100", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Education, University of London"}}}
