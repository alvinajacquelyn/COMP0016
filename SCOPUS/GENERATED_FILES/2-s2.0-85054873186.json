The aim of this study was to examine the multidisciplinary team's perspective on the role of psychology within the acute psychiatric inpatient setting. Design: A qualitative approach was taken utilizing semi-structured interviews for data collection. Methods: Interviews were undertaken with 12 multidisciplinary team members (occupational therapists, psychiatric nurses, psychiatrists, and clinical managers) examining their perspectives on the role of psychology within the acute psychiatric inpatient setting. Thematic analysis was used to analyse data. Results: The analysis identified two key themes \u2018psychological treatments\u2019, which describes the perceived function of psychology on the ward, and \u2018integrated psychological working\u2019 outlining key issues that psychologists should consider when working in multidisciplinary teams. Conclusions: Psychology is seen by multidisciplinary team members as an integral, but not first line, treatment option in the psychiatric inpatient setting. Both direct work and indirect work were valued by multidisciplinary staff participants. The multidisciplinary team do not have a clear understanding of the role of psychology. Education dialogue about the role are required. Practitioner points: The role of psychology in the psychiatric inpatient setting is valued by the multidisciplinary team. Psychology was not viewed as a first-line treatment option in the psychiatric inpatient setting but an \u2018add-on\u2019 to medical treatment. Psychology was a valued source of support for skilling-up and offering reflective space to the multidisciplinary team. Psychologists need to better promote their role and their skills to the multidisciplinary team.", "AuthorKeywords": ["psychiatric hospital", "psychiatric inpatient", "psychological therapy", "psychosis", "qualitative", "semi-structured interviews", "thematic analysis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adaptation, Psychological", "Adult", "Attitude of Health Personnel", "England", "Female", "Hospitals, Psychiatric", "Humans", "Interpersonal Relations", "Interviews as Topic", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Organizational Culture", "Patient Care Team", "Psychology, Clinical", "Qualitative Research"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85054873186", "SubjectAreas": [["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"], ["Clinical Psychology", "PSYC", "3203"], ["Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)", "ARTS", "1201"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"7202513618": {"Name": "Wood L.", "AuthorID": "7202513618", "AffiliationID": "60001359", "AffiliationName": "School of Health and Social Care, University of Essex"}, "57190061236": {"Name": "Billings J.", "AuthorID": "57190061236", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, University College London"}, "7406331085": {"Name": "Johnson S.", "AuthorID": "7406331085", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, University College London"}, "57204051806": {"Name": "Williams C.", "AuthorID": "57204051806", "AffiliationID": "60107401", "AffiliationName": "Acute and Rehabilitation Directorate, North East London Foundation Trust, Goodmayes Hospital"}}}
