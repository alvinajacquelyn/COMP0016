Knowledge of the anatomy of this area and potential complications is very important. The rich vascular supply to the scrotum means that any surgical procedure must involve meticulous haemostasis. The scrotum obtains its blood supply from two different directions: transversely and longitudinally. This means that the scrotal wall is usually a very forgiving structure with good healing following both trauma and surgery. The midline raphe incision is utilised in most procedures as it is associated with the best cosmesis. In surgery on or near the epididymis it\u2019s important to be aware of the location of the rete testis with its terminal blood supply to the testis. The rete testis is also the only connection between the testis and the epididymis. This means that epididymal surgery may result in compromise of the blood supply to the testis and epididymis as well as cause epididymal obstruction.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85042588138", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"26026621500": {"Name": "Kalejaiye O.", "AuthorID": "26026621500", "AffiliationID": "60010294", "AffiliationName": "Department of Andrology, Cairo University"}, "35094435700": {"Name": "Raheem A.A.", "AuthorID": "35094435700", "AffiliationID": "60010294", "AffiliationName": "Department of Andrology, Cairo University"}, "55781298300": {"Name": "Ralph D.", "AuthorID": "55781298300", "AffiliationID": "60010294", "AffiliationName": "Department of Andrology, Cairo University"}}}
