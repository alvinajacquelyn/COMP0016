As urban areas house highly diverse people with differing vulnerabilities, intensifying climate change is likely to shift the focus of discussions from a general urban perspective to who in cities will be affected by climate change, and how. This brings the urban equity question to the forefront. Here we assess how climate change events may amplify urban inequity. We find that heatwaves, but also flooding, landslides, and even mitigation and adaptation measures, affect specific population groups more than others. As underlying sensitivity factors we consistently identify socioeconomic status and gender. We synthesize the findings with regard to equity types \u2013 meaning outcome-based, process-oriented and context-related equity \u2013 and suggest solutions for avoiding increased equity and justice concerns as a result of climate change impacts, adaptation and mitigation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["adaptation", "assessment", "climate change", "environmental justice", "equality", "equity", "gender", "impacts", "low-income", "mitigation", "poverty", "socioeconomic", "women"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85019035377", "SubjectAreas": [["Environmental Science (miscellaneous)", "ENVI", "2301"], ["Urban Studies", "SOCI", "3322"]], "AuthorData": {"16246118700": {"Name": "Reckien D.", "AuthorID": "16246118700", "AffiliationID": "60017915, 60020599", "AffiliationName": "University of Twente, Department of Urban and Regional Planning and Geo-Information Management, Faculty of Geo-Information Science and Earth Observation (ITC)"}, "23995215600": {"Name": "Creutzig F.", "AuthorID": "23995215600", "AffiliationID": "60011604", "AffiliationName": "Department of the Economics of Climate Change at Technische Universit\u00e4t Berlin"}, "56296611400": {"Name": "Fernandez B.", "AuthorID": "56296611400", "AffiliationID": "60159447", "AffiliationName": "Mercator Research Institute on Global Commons and Climate Change in Berlin"}, "25623779800": {"Name": "Lwasa S.", "AuthorID": "25623779800", "AffiliationID": "60071676", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography, Makerere University"}, "55971725300": {"Name": "Tovar-Restrepo M.", "AuthorID": "55971725300", "AffiliationID": "60030162", "AffiliationName": "Graduate School of Architecture, Planning, and Preservation, Columbia University"}, "7003602195": {"Name": "Mcevoy D.", "AuthorID": "7003602195", "AffiliationID": "60011362", "AffiliationName": "RMIT University"}, "6701599059": {"Name": "Satterthwaite D.", "AuthorID": "6701599059", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
