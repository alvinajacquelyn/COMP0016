Massive anthropogenic landscape transformation from the later Neolithic into the early Dynastic periods, especially in the Chinese Loess Plateau, increased sedimentation in the Yellow River requiring intensive investment in flood control features to protect an ever-growing population. As the Yellow River channel aggraded, channel gradients became increasingly steep, and avulsions occurred with greater frequency and consequence. Flooding reached an apogee in the first decades of the Common Era when a massive avulsion of the Yellow River ca. 14\u201317 CE caused the river to shift to the south and east of its former channel. This avulsion and the catastrophic flooding that followed triggered the collapse of the Western Han dynasty. The Yellow River \u2013 known as \u2018China\u2019s Tribulation\u2019 \u2013 has been seen as a natural scourge that afflicts the inhabitants of the fertile North China Plain. However, when viewed in an Anthropocene perspective, it is evident that China\u2019s Tribulation largely is the result of human manipulation of the environment.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Anthropocene", "China", "environmental archaeology", "Sanyangzhuang", "Taosi", "Yellow River", "Yiluo Valley"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84941902375", "SubjectAreas": [["Global and Planetary Change", "ENVI", "2306"], ["Archeology (arts and humanities)", "ARTS", "1204"], ["Ecology", "ENVI", "2303"], ["Earth-Surface Processes", "EART", "1904"], ["Paleontology", "EART", "1911"]], "AuthorData": {"6701827843": {"Name": "Kidder T.R.", "AuthorID": "6701827843", "AffiliationID": "60010261", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anthropology, Washington University in St. Louis"}, "55618106900": {"Name": "Zhuang Y.", "AuthorID": "55618106900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Archaeology, University College London"}}}
