Calorimetric measurements, solubility experiments, and lattice energy calculations revealed that form V is the thermodynamically stable polymorph from absolute zero to at least 90 \u00b0C. At higher temperatures, form II, and then form I, becomes the most stable DDS solid form. The computed 0 K stability order (lattice energy calculations) was confirmed with calorimetric measurements as follows, V (most stable) > III > Hydehy > II > I > IV (least stable). The discovery of form V was complicated by the fact that the metastable but kinetically stabilized form III shows a higher nucleation and growth rate. By combining laboratory powder X-ray diffraction data and ab initio calculations, the crystal structure of form V (P21/c, Z\u2032 = 4) was solved, with a high energy DDS conformation allowing a denser packing and more stable intermolecular interactions, rationalizing the formation of a high Z\u2032 structure. The structures of the forms I and IV, only observed from the melt and showing distinct packing features compared to the forms II, III, and V, were derived from the computed crystal energy landscapes. Dehydration modeling of the DDS hydrate led to the Hydehy structure. This study expands our understanding about the complex crystallization behavior of pharmaceuticals and highlights the big challenge in solid form screening, especially that there is no clear end point.", "AuthorKeywords": ["crystal structure prediction", "dapsone", "kinetic and thermodynamic stability", "lattice energy", "polymorph", "solution calorimetry", "thermal analysis", "transformation", "X-ray diffraction"], "IndexKeywords": ["Absorption, Physicochemical", "Calorimetry, Differential Scanning", "Chemistry, Pharmaceutical", "Computational Chemistry", "Crystallization", "Dapsone", "Drug Stability", "Entropy", "Hydrogen Bonding", "Kinetics", "Molecular Conformation", "Solubility", "Transition Temperature", "Water", "X-Ray Diffraction"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85066991740", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Medicine", "BIOC", "1313"], ["Pharmaceutical Science", "PHAR", "3003"], ["Drug Discovery", "PHAR", "3002"]], "AuthorData": {"15724659800": {"Name": "Braun D.E.", "AuthorID": "15724659800", "AffiliationID": "60009999", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Pharmacy, University of Innsbruck"}, "26642895900": {"Name": "Griesser U.J.", "AuthorID": "26642895900", "AffiliationID": "60009999", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Pharmacy, University of Innsbruck"}, "36893205700": {"Name": "Vickers M.", "AuthorID": "36893205700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}}}
