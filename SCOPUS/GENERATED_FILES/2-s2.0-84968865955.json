Here a theoretical model was used to examine cases where the game reserve management allocated the amount of land devoted to hunting (trophy hunting) and tourism, based on three scenarios: (1) hunting is separated from tourism but wildlife is shared; (2) hunting and tourism co-exist; and (3) hunting and tourism are separated by a fence. The consumptive and non-consumptive uses are not mutually exclusive; careful planning is needed to ensure that multiple management objectives can be met. Further, the analysis indicates that the two uses may be undertaken in the same area. Whether they are spatially, or temporally separated depends on the magnitude of the consumptive use. When consumptive use is not dominant, the two are compatible in the same shared area, provided the wildlife population is sufficiently large.", "AuthorKeywords": ["hunting", "land management", "land use", "South Africa", "tourism", "wildlife economics"], "IndexKeywords": ["hunting", "Land managements", "Management objectives", "Reserve management", "South Africa", "Theoretical modeling", "tourism", "Wildlife populations"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84968865955", "SubjectAreas": [["Water Science and Technology", "ENVI", "2312"], ["Pollution", "ENVI", "2310"], ["Nature and Landscape Conservation", "ENVI", "2309"], ["Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law", "ENVI", "2308"], ["Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis", "ENVI", "2307"]], "AuthorData": {"15729888000": {"Name": "Mwakiwa E.", "AuthorID": "15729888000", "AffiliationID": "60004156", "AffiliationName": "Resource Ecology Group, Wageningen University"}, "7202844050": {"Name": "De Boer W.F.", "AuthorID": "7202844050", "AffiliationID": "60004156", "AffiliationName": "Resource Ecology Group, Wageningen University"}, "6701790743": {"Name": "Van Langevelde F.", "AuthorID": "6701790743", "AffiliationID": "60004156", "AffiliationName": "Resource Ecology Group, Wageningen University"}, "7103333259": {"Name": "Prins H.H.T.", "AuthorID": "7103333259", "AffiliationID": "60004156", "AffiliationName": "Resource Ecology Group, Wageningen University"}, "7004743942": {"Name": "Hearne J.W.", "AuthorID": "7004743942", "AffiliationID": "60011362", "AffiliationName": "School of Mathematical and Geospatial Sciences, RMIT University"}, "6701352071": {"Name": "Stigter J.D.", "AuthorID": "6701352071", "AffiliationID": "60004156", "AffiliationName": "Biometris, Wageningen University"}, "36186730000": {"Name": "Henley M.", "AuthorID": "36186730000", "AffiliationID": "60002397", "AffiliationName": "Applied Behavioural Ecology and Ecosystem Research Unit, School of Environmental Sciences, University of South Africa"}, "7004596566": {"Name": "Slotow R.", "AuthorID": "7004596566", "AffiliationID": "60010499", "AffiliationName": "School of Biological and Conservation Sciences, University of KwaZulu-Natal, Howard College Campus"}, "7005573786": {"Name": "Peel M.", "AuthorID": "7005573786", "AffiliationID": "60000993", "AffiliationName": "Agricultural Research Council, Range and Forage Institute"}, "7402511379": {"Name": "Grant C.C.", "AuthorID": "7402511379", "AffiliationID": "60009183, 60016298", "AffiliationName": "Scientific Services, Kruger National Park"}}}
