This article traces the use of an ancient symbol of the power of metropolitan archbishops, the woollen pallium, between 1533 and 1603. The later Henrician Church saw this garment as a sign of royal supremacy. Under Mary, however, Archbishop Pole made extravagant claims which led the Elizabethan Church to reject earlier Tudor notions of this symbol. Set against the backdrop of the source of episcopal jurisdiction, this article traces the use of the pallium in England in a Church moving from Roman obedience to a Protestant settlement.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85011846516", "SubjectAreas": [["History", "ARTS", "1202"], ["Religious Studies", "ARTS", "1212"]], "AuthorData": {"22233574500": {"Name": "AYRIS P.", "AuthorID": "22233574500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": null}}}
