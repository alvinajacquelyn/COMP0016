HAXPES systems are predominantly located at synchrotron sources due to low photoionization cross sections necessitating high X-ray intensities, which limits the technique\u2019s availability to a wide range of users and potential applications. Here, a new laboratory-based instrument capable of delivering monochromated X-rays with an energy of 9.25 keV and a microfocused 30 \u00d7 45 \u03bcm2 X-ray spot is introduced. The system gives an excellent energy resolution of below 500 meV coupled with good X-ray intensity. It allows stable measurements under grazing incidence conditions to maximise signal intensities. This article outlines the instrument behavior, showcases applications including bulk and multilayer measurements, and describes the overall performance of the spectrometer. This system presents an alternative to synchrotron-based experimental end stations and will help expand the number and range of HAXPES experiments performed in the future.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Continuous development", "Energy resolutions", "Grazing incidence", "Hard X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy", "Photoionization cross section", "Signal intensities", "Stable measurements", "Synchrotron source"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85049839075", "SubjectAreas": [["Instrumentation", "PHYS", "3105"]], "AuthorData": {"54882406000": {"Name": "Regoutz A.", "AuthorID": "54882406000", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials, Imperial College London"}, "36680382600": {"Name": "Mascheck M.", "AuthorID": "36680382600", "AffiliationID": "119770755", "AffiliationName": "Scienta Omicron GmbH"}, "57221293700": {"Name": "Wiell T.", "AuthorID": "57221293700", "AffiliationID": "108121564", "AffiliationName": "Scienta Omicron AB"}, "41561290400": {"Name": "Eriksson S.K.", "AuthorID": "41561290400", "AffiliationID": "108121564", "AffiliationName": "Scienta Omicron AB"}, "57202924736": {"Name": "Liljenberg C.", "AuthorID": "57202924736", "AffiliationID": "108121564", "AffiliationName": "Scienta Omicron AB"}, "57202921930": {"Name": "Palmgren P.", "AuthorID": "57202921930", "AffiliationID": "108121564", "AffiliationName": "Scienta Omicron AB"}, "25930643500": {"Name": "Tetzner K.", "AuthorID": "25930643500", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Imperial College London"}, "56924712400": {"Name": "Williamson B.A.D.", "AuthorID": "56924712400", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175885", "AffiliationName": "Thomas Young Centre, University College London"}, "16647397400": {"Name": "Scanlon D.O.", "AuthorID": "16647397400", "AffiliationID": "60104663", "AffiliationName": "Diamond Light Source Ltd., Diamond House, Harwell Science and Innovation Campus"}}}
