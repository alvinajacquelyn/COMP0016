In this paper, a typical cache-enabled small cell network under heterogeneous file and network settings is considered using maximum distance separable (MDS) codes for content restructuring. Unlike those in the literature considering online settings with the assumption of perfect user request information, we estimate the joint user requests using the file popularity information and aim to minimize the long-term average backhaul load for fetching content from external storage subject to the overall cache capacity constraint by optimizing the content placement in all the cells jointly. Both multicast-aware caching and cooperative caching schemes with optimal content placement are proposed. In order to combine the advantages of multicast content delivery and cooperative content sharing, a compound caching technique, which is referred to as multicast-aware cooperative caching, is then developed. For this technique, a greedy approach and a multicast-aware in-cluster cooperative approach are proposed for the small-scale networks and large-scale networks, respectively. Mathematical analysis and simulation results are presented to illustrate the advantages of MDS codes, multicast, and cooperation in terms of reducing the backhaul requirements for cache-enabled small cell networks.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Caching", "cooperation", "heterogeneous networks"], "IndexKeywords": ["Caching", "cooperation", "Cooperative caching", "Micro cell", "Resource management"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85028954933", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"57145890000": {"Name": "Liao J.", "AuthorID": "57145890000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "7404759940": {"Name": "Wong K.", "AuthorID": "7404759940", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "56532695100": {"Name": "Zhang Y.", "AuthorID": "56532695100", "AffiliationID": "110150143", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Meta-RF Electromagnetic Modulation Technology, Kuang-Chi Institute of Advanced Technology"}, "57189902299": {"Name": "Zheng Z.", "AuthorID": "57189902299", "AffiliationID": "117991180", "AffiliationName": "East China Institute of Telecommunications, China Academy of Information and Communications Technology"}, "35214178400": {"Name": "Yang K.", "AuthorID": "35214178400", "AffiliationID": "60005465", "AffiliationName": "School of Communication Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China"}}}
