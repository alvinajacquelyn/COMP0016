Specifically, we consider the evolution of an initially balanced density front subject to an imposed viscosity and diffusivity as a simple analogue for small-scale turbulence. At late times, the dominant balance is found to be the quasisteady turbulent thermal wind balance with time evolution due to an advection-diffusion balance in the buoyancy equation. We use the leading-order balance to determine analytical similarity solutions for the spreading of a front and find that the spreading rate is maximum for an intermediate value of the Ekman number, with the spreading resulting from shear dispersion associated with the cross-front flow and vertical diffusion of density. In response to shear dispersion, the front evolves towards a density profile that is nearly linear in the cross-front coordinate. At the edges of the frontal zone, the density field develops large curvature, and these regions are associated with narrow bands of intense vertical velocity.", "AuthorKeywords": ["geophysical and geological flows", "ocean processes", "rotating flows"], "IndexKeywords": ["Advection - Diffusion", "Buoyancy equations", "Geophysical and geological flows", "Ocean process", "Rotating flow", "Similarity solution", "Small scale turbulence", "Vertical diffusion", "Diffusion balance"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85049403942", "SubjectAreas": [["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Mechanics of Materials", "ENGI", "2211"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"]], "AuthorData": {"57202803294": {"Name": "Crowe M.", "AuthorID": "57202803294", "AffiliationID": "60119937, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics, University of Cambridge, Centre for Mathematical Sciences"}, "55741154500": {"Name": "Taylor J.", "AuthorID": "55741154500", "AffiliationID": "60119937, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics, University of Cambridge, Centre for Mathematical Sciences"}}}
