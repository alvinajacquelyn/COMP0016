While ASPs require complex change of key behaviours on individual, team organization and policy levels, evidence from the behavioural sciences is underutilized in antibiotic stewardship studies across the world, including high-income countries (HICs). A consensus procedure was performed to propose research priority areas for optimizing effective implementation of ASPs in hospital settings using a behavioural perspective. Methods: A workgroup for behavioural approaches to ASPs was convened in response to the fourth call for leading expert network proposals by the Joint Programming Initiative on Antimicrobial Resistance (JPIAMR). Eighteen clinical and academic specialists in antibiotic stewardship, implementation science and behaviour change from four HICs with publicly funded healthcare systems (e.g. Canada, Germany, Norway and the UK) met face-to-face to agree on broad research priority areas using a structured consensus method. Question addressed and recommendations: The consensus process assessing the ten identified research priority areas resulted in recommendations that need urgent scientific interest and funding to optimize effective implementation of ASPs for hospital inpatients in HICs with publicly funded healthcare systems. We suggest and detail behavioural science evidence\u2013guided research efforts in the following areas: (a) comprehensively identifying barriers and facilitators to implementing ASPs and clinical recommendations intended to optimize antibiotic prescribing; (b) identifying actors (\u2018who\u2019) and actions (\u2018what needs to be done\u2019) of ASPs and clinical teams; (c) synthesizing available evidence to support future research and planning for ASPs; (d) specifying the activities in current ASPs with the purpose of defining a control group for comparison with new initiatives; (e) defining a balanced set of outcomes and measures to evaluate the effects of interventions focused on reducing unnecessary exposure to antibiotics; (f) conducting robust evaluations of ASPs with built-in process evaluations and fidelity assessments; (g) defining and designing ASPs; (h) establishing the evidence base for impact of ASPs on resistance; (i) investigating the role and impact of government and policy contexts on ASPs; and (j) understanding what matters to patients in ASPs in hospitals. Conclusions: Assessment, revisions and updates of our priority-setting exercise should be considered at intervals of 2 years. To propose research priority areas in low- and middle-income countries, the methodology reported here could be applied.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Antimicrobial stewardship", "Behavioural approach", "Multidisciplinary approach", "Nominal group technique", "Research priorities"], "IndexKeywords": ["Anti-Bacterial Agents", "Antimicrobial Stewardship", "Consensus", "Hospitals", "Humans", "Infection Control", "Practice Patterns, Physicians'", "Research Design"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85055044289", "SubjectAreas": [["Microbiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2726"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"56964939100": {"Name": "Rzewuska M.", "AuthorID": "56964939100", "AffiliationID": "60022300, 60015875", "AffiliationName": "Health Services Research Unit, University of Aberdeen"}, "55334087900": {"Name": "Duncan E.M.", "AuthorID": "55334087900", "AffiliationID": "60022300, 60015875", "AffiliationName": "Health Services Research Unit, University of Aberdeen"}, "55326798500": {"Name": "Gillies K.", "AuthorID": "55326798500", "AffiliationID": "60022300, 60015875", "AffiliationName": "Health Services Research Unit, University of Aberdeen"}, "7005242161": {"Name": "Ramsay C.R.", "AuthorID": "7005242161", "AffiliationID": "60022300, 60015875", "AffiliationName": "Health Services Research Unit, University of Aberdeen"}, "57208140595": {"Name": "Charani E.", "AuthorID": "57208140595", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Health Protection Research Unit in Healthcare Associated Infections and Antimicrobial Resistance, Imperial College London"}, "35824881800": {"Name": "Clarkson J.E.", "AuthorID": "35824881800", "AffiliationID": "60008877", "AffiliationName": "Schools of Dentistry, University of Dundee"}, "7103281485": {"Name": "Davey P.G.", "AuthorID": "7103281485", "AffiliationID": "60008877", "AffiliationName": "Division of Population Health Sciences, Medical School, University of Dundee"}, "19640314500": {"Name": "Marwick C.A.", "AuthorID": "19640314500", "AffiliationID": "60008877", "AffiliationName": "Division of Population Health Sciences, Medical School, University of Dundee"}, "24438010700": {"Name": "Francis J.J.", "AuthorID": "24438010700", "AffiliationID": "60025704", "AffiliationName": "School of Health Sciences, City University of London"}, "34769948000": {"Name": "Grimshaw J.M.", "AuthorID": "34769948000", "AffiliationID": "60002173, 60028897", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Epidemiology Program, Ottawa Hospital Research Institute and Department of Medicine, University of Ottawa"}, "7202792384": {"Name": "Kern W.V.", "AuthorID": "7202792384", "AffiliationID": "60025641", "AffiliationName": "University of Freiburg Medical Center and Faculty of Medicine, Division of Infectious Diseases"}, "55361024100": {"Name": "Lorencatto F.", "AuthorID": "55361024100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Behaviour Change, University College London"}, "56678362400": {"Name": "McEwen J.", "AuthorID": "56678362400", "AffiliationID": "60031792", "AffiliationName": "Ninewells Hospital"}, "26431519800": {"Name": "M\u00f6hler R.", "AuthorID": "26431519800", "AffiliationID": "60025641", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Evidence in Medicine (for Cochrane Germany Foundation), Medical Center and Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg"}, "56420323200": {"Name": "Morris A.M.", "AuthorID": "56420323200", "AffiliationID": "60016849, 60014468", "AffiliationName": "Sinai Health System, University Health Network and University of Toronto"}, "57213304435": {"Name": "Rogers Van Katwyk S.", "AuthorID": "57213304435", "AffiliationID": "60028897", "AffiliationName": "School of Epidemiology and Public Health, University of Ottawa"}, "55212260400": {"Name": "Skodvin B.", "AuthorID": "55212260400", "AffiliationID": "60030280", "AffiliationName": "Norwegian Advisory Unit for Antibiotic Use in Hospitals, Haukeland University Hospital"}, "56754282900": {"Name": "Smith I.", "AuthorID": "56754282900", "AffiliationID": "60027142", "AffiliationName": "Department of Essential Medicines and Health Products, World Health Organization"}, "7202645021": {"Name": "Suh K.N.", "AuthorID": "7202645021", "AffiliationID": "60002173, 60028897", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, University of Ottawa and the Ottawa Hospital Research Institute"}, "null": {"Name": null, "AuthorID": null, "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
