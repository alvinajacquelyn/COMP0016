Infants with mild HIE, representing 50% of those with HIE, are perceived as low risk and are currently not eligible for TH [1]. This review examines the available evidence of outcome in term infants with mild HIE. Methods: Medline, Embase and Cochrane Clinical Trials databases were searched in March 2017. Studies with well-defined HIE grading at birth and standardised neurodevelopmental assessment at \u226518 months were included. Abnormal outcome was defined as death, cerebral palsy or standardised neurodevelopmental test score more than 1 standard deviation below the mean. Result: Twenty studies were included. Abnormal outcome was reported in 86/341 (25%) of infants. There was insufficient evidence to examine the effect of TH on outcome. Conclusion: A significant proportion of infants with mild HIE have abnormal outcome at follow up.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy (HIE)", "Neurodevelopmental outcome", "Therapeutic hypothermia (TH)"], "IndexKeywords": ["Brain Diseases", "Developmental Disabilities", "Humans", "Hypothermia, Induced", "Hypoxia-Ischemia, Brain", "Infant, Newborn", "Infant, Newborn, Diseases", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85042563141", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Obstetrics and Gynecology", "MEDI", "2729"]], "AuthorData": {"57200880986": {"Name": "Conway J.", "AuthorID": "57200880986", "AffiliationID": "60113732, 60010410, 60025160", "AffiliationName": "Irish Central for Fetal and Neonatal Translational Research-INFANT Centre, Department of Pediatrics and Child Health, University College Cork, Cork University Hospital"}, "6602292136": {"Name": "Boylan G.", "AuthorID": "6602292136", "AffiliationID": "60113732, 60010410, 60025160", "AffiliationName": "Irish Central for Fetal and Neonatal Translational Research-INFANT Centre, Department of Pediatrics and Child Health, University College Cork, Cork University Hospital"}, "14058615200": {"Name": "Murray D.", "AuthorID": "14058615200", "AffiliationID": "60113732, 60010410, 60025160", "AffiliationName": "Irish Central for Fetal and Neonatal Translational Research-INFANT Centre, Department of Pediatrics and Child Health, University College Cork, Cork University Hospital"}, "36969568200": {"Name": "Walsh B.", "AuthorID": "36969568200", "AffiliationID": "60016782", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatric Newborn Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital"}}}
