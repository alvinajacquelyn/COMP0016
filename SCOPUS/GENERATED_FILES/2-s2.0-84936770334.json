Recent results suggest that the use of spectral constraints can significantly improve image quality. We present a combined reconstruction-classification method for estimating the spectra of individual tissues, whilst simultaneously reconstructing the conductivity. The advantage of this method is that a priori knowledge of the spectra is not required to be exact in that the constraints are updated at each step of the reconstruction. In this paper, we investigate the robustness of the proposed method to errors in the initial guess of the tissue spectra, and look at the effect of introducing spatial smoothing. We formalize and validate a frequency-difference variant of reconstruction-classification, and compare the use of absolute and frequency-difference data in the case of a phantom experiment.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Electrical impedance tomography", "electrophysical imaging", "image reconstruction-iterative", "inverse methods", "machine learning"], "IndexKeywords": ["Biological tissues", "Classification methods", "Conductivity spectra", "Electrical impedance tomography", "Frequency differences", "Inverse methods", "Phantom experiment", "Spectral constraints"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84936770334", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Radiological and Ultrasound Technology", "HEAL", "3614"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"56038057300": {"Name": "Malone E.", "AuthorID": "56038057300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "56037206400": {"Name": "Dos Santos G.", "AuthorID": "56037206400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "57205935474": {"Name": "Holder D.", "AuthorID": "57205935474", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "7005759823": {"Name": "Arridge S.", "AuthorID": "7005759823", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}}}
