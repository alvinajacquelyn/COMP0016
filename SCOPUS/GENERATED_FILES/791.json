When using coherent receivers, received signals can be post-processed digitally to mitigate the specific impairments found in access networks and, additionally, relax the optical complexity requirements of the coherent receiver. However, the digital signal processing must itself be low complexity in order to minimize the overall complexity and power consumption of the optical network unit (ONU). This paper focuses on the impact of reduced complexity equalization algorithms on receiver sensitivity in a LR-PON. It is found that a cascade of linear filters can be combined into a single, truncated, linear, adaptive filter with negligible impact on receiver sensitivity. Additionally, by utilizing a multiplier-free tap weight update algorithm, the overall complexity of a digital coherent receiver can be significantly reduced, making it attractive for use in an ONU. Matched filtering, chromatic dispersion compensation, and polarization tracking are all performed by the adaptive equalizer. The performance of this low-complexity, multiplier-free equalizer is experimentally verified for 3 GBd polarization division multiplexed quadrature phase shift keying (12 Gbit/s) in both a back-to-back configuration and transmission over 100 km standard single-mode fiber.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Backreflections", "Digital coherent receiver", "Nyquist pulse shaping", "Passive optical networks", "Receiver sensitivity"], "IndexKeywords": ["Back reflection", "Coherent receivers", "Equalization algorithms", "Long-reach passive optical networks", "Nyquist pulse", "Optical network units", "Receiver sensitivity", "Standard single mode fibers"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84922376282", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"]], "AuthorData": {"57110068500": {"Name": "Lavery D.", "AuthorID": "57110068500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, Optical Networks Group, University College London"}, "7006614570": {"Name": "Thomsen B.C.", "AuthorID": "7006614570", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, Optical Networks Group, University College London"}, "7005053644": {"Name": "Bayvel P.", "AuthorID": "7005053644", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, Optical Networks Group, University College London"}, "13608129100": {"Name": "Savory S.J.", "AuthorID": "13608129100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, Optical Networks Group, University College London"}}}
