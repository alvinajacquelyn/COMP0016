We focus on the first step towards this goal. Our aim is to understand the largely under-researched field of online tutoring, to identify success factors in this context and to model best practice in online teaching. We report our research into best practice in online maths teaching and describe and discuss our design and evaluation iterations towards annotation software that can mark up human-to-human online teaching interactions with successful teaching interaction signifiers.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Annotation software", "Best practice modeling", "Online tutoring"], "IndexKeywords": ["Best practices", "Design and evaluations", "Industrial designers", "Interaction analysis", "Online teaching", "Online tutoring", "Success factors", "Third spaces"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85022195536", "SubjectAreas": [["Theoretical Computer Science", "MATH", "2614"], ["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"]], "AuthorData": {"56904209900": {"Name": "Cukurova M.", "AuthorID": "56904209900", "AffiliationID": "60117699, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Knowledge Lab, University College London"}, "25651815200": {"Name": "Mavrikis M.", "AuthorID": "25651815200", "AffiliationID": "60117699, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Knowledge Lab, University College London"}, "35608174500": {"Name": "Luckin R.", "AuthorID": "35608174500", "AffiliationID": "60117699, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Knowledge Lab, University College London"}, "57194784676": {"Name": "Clark J.", "AuthorID": "57194784676", "AffiliationID": "118788286", "AffiliationName": "Third Space Learning"}, "57194786291": {"Name": "Crawford C.", "AuthorID": "57194786291", "AffiliationID": "118788286", "AffiliationName": "Third Space Learning"}}}
