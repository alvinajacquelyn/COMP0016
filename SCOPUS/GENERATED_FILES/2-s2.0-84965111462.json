The threshold voltage of the MoS2 FET shifted towards more negative values (from -20 to -70 V) on treating with 100% hydrazine solution with the channel current increasing from 0.5 to 25 \u03bcA at zero gate bias. The inverse subthreshold slope decreased sharply on doping, while the ON/OFF ratio increased by a factor of 100. Gate-channel coupling improved with doping, which facilitates the reduction of channel length between the source and drain electrodes without compromising on the transistor performance, making the MoS2-based FET easily scalable.", "AuthorKeywords": ["dichalcogenides", "doping", "field-effect transistor", "MoS2", "transition metal"], "IndexKeywords": ["Channel currents", "Dichalcogenides", "Electrical characteristic", "Inverse subthreshold slopes", "Molybdenum disulphide", "Negative values", "Source and drain electrodes", "Transistor performance"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84965111462", "SubjectAreas": [["Bioengineering", "CENG", "1502"], ["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Mechanics of Materials", "ENGI", "2211"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"56591421400": {"Name": "Lim D.", "AuthorID": "56591421400", "AffiliationID": "60007511", "AffiliationName": "School of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, Sungkyunkwan Advanced Institute of Nanotechnology (SAINT), Sungkyunkwan University"}, "35327155100": {"Name": "Lee I.", "AuthorID": "35327155100", "AffiliationID": "60007511", "AffiliationName": "School of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, Sungkyunkwan Advanced Institute of Nanotechnology (SAINT), Sungkyunkwan University"}, "36838604200": {"Name": "Rathi S.", "AuthorID": "36838604200", "AffiliationID": "60007511", "AffiliationName": "School of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, Sungkyunkwan Advanced Institute of Nanotechnology (SAINT), Sungkyunkwan University"}, "56591829700": {"Name": "Li L.", "AuthorID": "56591829700", "AffiliationID": "60007511", "AffiliationName": "School of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, Sungkyunkwan Advanced Institute of Nanotechnology (SAINT), Sungkyunkwan University"}, "57157643900": {"Name": "Lee Y.", "AuthorID": "57157643900", "AffiliationID": "60007511", "AffiliationName": "School of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, Sungkyunkwan Advanced Institute of Nanotechnology (SAINT), Sungkyunkwan University"}, "56590942800": {"Name": "Khan M.A.", "AuthorID": "56590942800", "AffiliationID": "60007511", "AffiliationName": "School of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, Sungkyunkwan Advanced Institute of Nanotechnology (SAINT), Sungkyunkwan University"}, "56591208300": {"Name": "Kang M.", "AuthorID": "56591208300", "AffiliationID": "60003780", "AffiliationName": "Manufacturing Engineering Team, Memory Division, Samsung Electronics Co"}, "35462113800": {"Name": "Park J.", "AuthorID": "35462113800", "AffiliationID": "60007511", "AffiliationName": "School of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, Sungkyunkwan Advanced Institute of Nanotechnology (SAINT), Sungkyunkwan University"}, "56499702500": {"Name": "Kim G.H.", "AuthorID": "56499702500", "AffiliationID": "60007511", "AffiliationName": "School of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, Sungkyunkwan Advanced Institute of Nanotechnology (SAINT), Sungkyunkwan University"}, "56736279100": {"Name": "Kannan E.S.", "AuthorID": "56736279100", "AffiliationID": "60000414", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, BITS-PILANI, K.
