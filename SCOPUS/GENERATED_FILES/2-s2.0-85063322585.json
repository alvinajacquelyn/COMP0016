We compared liver waitlist mortality or removal according to model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score vs ACLF category. We also studied factors associated with reduced odds of survival for 1 year after liver transplantation in patients with ACLF-3. Methods: We analyzed data from the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) from 2005 through 2016. We identified patients who were on the waitlist (100,594) and those who received liver transplants (50,552). Patients with ACLF were identified based on the European Association for the Study of the Liver-chronic liver failure criteria. Outcomes were evaluated with competing risks regression, Kaplan-Meier analysis, and Cox proportional hazards regression. Results: Patients with ACLF-3 were more likely to die or be removed from the waitlist, regardless of MELD-sodium (MELD-Na) score, compared with the other ACLF groups; the proportion was greatest for patients with an ACLF-3 score and MELD-Na score below 25 (43.8% at 28 days). Mechanical ventilation at liver transplantation (hazard ratio [HR] 1.49; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.22\u20131.84), donor risk index above 1.7 (HR 1.22; 95% CI 1.09\u20131.35), and liver transplantation within 30 days of listing (HR 0.89; 95% CI 0.81\u20130.98) were independently associated with survival for 1 year after liver transplantation Conclusions: In an analysis of data from the UNOS registry, we found high mortality among patients with ACLF-3 on the liver transplant waitlist, even among those with lower MELD-Na scores. So, certain patients with ACLF-3 have poor outcomes regardless of MELD-Na score. Liver transplantation increases odds of survival for these patients, particularly if performed within 30 days of placement on the waitlist. Mechanical ventilation at liver transplantation and use of marginal organs were associated with increased risk of death.", "AuthorKeywords": ["DRI Renal Failure", "MELD Score", "UNOS Database"], "IndexKeywords": ["Acute-On-Chronic Liver Failure", "Adult", "Clinical Decision-Making", "Databases, Factual", "Decision Support Techniques", "Female", "Frailty", "Health Status", "Humans", "Karnofsky Performance Status", "Liver Transplantation", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Patient Selection", "Predictive Value of Tests", "Registries", "Retrospective Studies", "Risk Assessment", "Risk Factors", "Severity of Illness Index", "Time Factors", "Treatment Outcome", "Waiting Lists"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85063322585", "SubjectAreas": [["Hepatology", "MEDI", "2721"], ["Gastroenterology", "MEDI", "2715"]], "AuthorData": {"56187283400": {"Name": "Sundaram V.", "AuthorID": "56187283400", "AffiliationID": "60016173", "AffiliationName": "Division of Gastroenterology and Comprehensive Transplant Center, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center"}, "7005505892": {"Name": "Jalan R.", "AuthorID": "7005505892", "AffiliationID": "60029950", "AffiliationName": "Liver Failure Group, Institute for Liver and Digestive Health, UCL Medical School"}, "57200134761": {"Name": "Wu T.", "AuthorID": "57200134761", "AffiliationID": "60016173", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center"}, "57203081976": {"Name": "Volk M.", "AuthorID": "57203081976", "AffiliationID": "60113483", "AffiliationName": "Division of Gastroenterology and Transplantation Institute, Loma Linda University"}, "35104261000": {"Name": "Asrani S.", "AuthorID": "35104261000", "AffiliationID": "60031742", "AffiliationName": "Hepatology, Baylor University Medical Center"}, "7402143399": {"Name": "Klein A.", "AuthorID": "7402143399", "AffiliationID": "60016173", "AffiliationName": "Comprehensive Transplant Center, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center"}, "31067578100": {"Name": "Wong R.", "AuthorID": "31067578100", "AffiliationID": "60024076", "AffiliationName": "Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Alameda Health System, Highland Hospital"}}}
