The study included statistical analysis of data on safeguarding referrals and the take up of personal budgets and qualitative interviews with managers, social workers, other staff working on safeguarding and with service users. The paper reports the findings from 16 interviews with managers and social workers, highlighting their perspectives and experiences. Findings: Five main themes emerged from our analysis: contexts and risk factors; views about risks associated with Direct Payments, approaches to minimising risk; balancing risk and choice; and weaving safeguarding and personalisation practice. Social workers identified similar ranges and kinds of risks to those identified in the national evaluation of Individual Budgets. They described a tension between policy objectives and their exercise of discretion to assess and manage risks. For example, some described how they would discourage certain people from taking their personal budget as a Direct Payment or suggest they take only part of a personal budget as a Direct Payment. Application: This exploratory study supports the continued need for skilled social workers to deliver outcomes related to both safeguarding and personalisation policies. Implementing these policies may entail a new form of \u2018care and control\u2019, which may require specific approaches in supervision in order to ensure good practice is fostered and positive outcomes attained.", "AuthorKeywords": ["direct payments", "personal budgets", "personalisation", "safeguarding", "Social work"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85038417747", "SubjectAreas": [["Health (social science)", "SOCI", "3306"], ["Social Sciences (miscellaneous)", "SOCI", "3301"]], "AuthorData": {"57202192581": {"Name": "Stevens M.", "AuthorID": "57202192581", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Social Care Workforce Research Unit, King\u2019s College London"}, "6505593773": {"Name": "Woolham J.", "AuthorID": "6505593773", "AffiliationID": "60017326", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Health and Life Sciences, Coventry University"}, "7006601649": {"Name": "Manthorpe J.", "AuthorID": "7006601649", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Social Care Workforce Research Unit, King\u2019s College London"}, "10341450300": {"Name": "Hussein S.", "AuthorID": "10341450300", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Social Care Workforce Research Unit, King\u2019s College London"}, "24779032000": {"Name": "Samsi K.", "AuthorID": "24779032000", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Social Care Workforce Research Unit, King\u2019s College London"}, "57199833801": {"Name": "Aspinall F.", "AuthorID": "57199833801", "AffiliationID": "60016418", "AffiliationName": "Social Policy Research Unit, University of York"}, "57207587111": {"Name": "Baxter K.", "AuthorID": "57207587111", "AffiliationID": "60016418", "AffiliationName": "Social Policy Research Unit, University of York"}, "56943560400": {"Name": "Ismail M.", "AuthorID": "56943560400", "AffiliationID": "119928846", "AffiliationName": "Analytical Research Limited"}}}
