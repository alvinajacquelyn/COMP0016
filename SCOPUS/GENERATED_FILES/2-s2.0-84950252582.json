All rights reserved.Massive open online courses (MOOCs) require individual learners to be able to self-regulate their learning, determining when and how they engage. However, MOOCs attract a diverse range of learners, each with different motivations and prior experience. This study investigates the self-regulated learning (SRL) learners apply in a MOOC, in particular focusing on how learners' motivations for taking a MOOC influence their behaviour and employment of SRL strategies. Following a quantitative investigation of the learning behaviours of 788 MOOC participants, follow-up interviews were conducted with 32 learners. The study compares the narrative descriptions of behaviour between learners with self-reported high and low SRL scores. Substantial differences were detected between the self-described learning behaviours of these two groups in five of the sub-processes examined. Learners' motivations and goals were found to shape how they conceptualised the purpose of the MOOC, which in turn affected their perception of the learning process.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Higher education", "Massive open online courses", "Professional learning", "Self-regulated learning"], "IndexKeywords": ["Diverse range", "Higher education", "Learning process", "Massive open online course", "Prior experience", "Professional learning", "Quantitative investigation", "Self-regulated learning"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84950252582", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"]], "AuthorData": {"7005935975": {"Name": "Littlejohn A.", "AuthorID": "7005935975", "AffiliationID": "60012113", "AffiliationName": "Open University"}, "56943204000": {"Name": "Hood N.", "AuthorID": "56943204000", "AffiliationID": "60012113", "AffiliationName": "Open University"}, "16157629100": {"Name": "Milligan C.", "AuthorID": "16157629100", "AffiliationID": "60007573", "AffiliationName": "Caledonian Academy, Glasgow Caledonian University"}, "57008287700": {"Name": "Mustain P.", "AuthorID": "57008287700", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "University of Oxford"}}}
