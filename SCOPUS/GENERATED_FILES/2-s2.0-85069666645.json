Methods: We acquired functional neuroimaging data from two independent samples of transdiagnostically recruited adults (18\u201325 years of age; n = 56, mean age 21.9 \u00b1 2.2 years, 42 women; n = 36, mean age 21.2 \u00b1 2.2 years, 24 women) during reward expectancy task performance. Pattern recognition model performance in each sample was measured using correlation and mean squared error between actual and whole-brain activation\u2013predicted scores on behavioral traits and symptoms. Results: In the first sample, the model significantly predicted severity of a specific hypo/mania-related symptom, heightened energy, measured by the energy manic subdomain of the Mood Spectrum Structured Interviews (r = .42, p = .001; mean squared error = 9.93, p = .001). The region with the highest contribution to the model was the left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex. Results were confirmed in the second sample (r = .33, p = .01; mean squared error = 8.61, p = .01), in which the severity of this symptom was predicted using a bilateral ventrolateral prefrontal cortical mask (r = .33, p = .009, mean squared error = 9.37, p = .04). Conclusions: The severity of a specific hypo/mania-related symptom was predicted from patterns of whole-brain activation in two independent samples. Given that emerging manic symptoms predispose to bipolar disorders, these findings could provide neural biomarkers to aid early identification of individual-level bipolar disorder risk in young adults.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Biomarkers", "Bipolar disorder", "fMRI", "Machine learning", "Multivariate pattern", "Neuroimage"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Bipolar Disorder", "Brain", "Brain Mapping", "Female", "Humans", "Machine Learning", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Multivariate Analysis", "Reward", "Risk Factors", "Severity of Illness Index", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85069666645", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Biological Psychiatry", "NEUR", "2803"]], "AuthorData": {"7102852857": {"Name": "de Oliveira L.", "AuthorID": "7102852857", "AffiliationID": "60001865", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, Federal Fluminense University"}, "25122036900": {"Name": "Portugal L.C.L.", "AuthorID": "25122036900", "AffiliationID": "60001865", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, Federal Fluminense University"}, "57203998200": {"Name": "Mourao-Miranda J.", "AuthorID": "57203998200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Image Computing, Department of Computer Science"}, "7401842287": {"Name": "Pereira M.", "AuthorID": "7401842287", "AffiliationID": "60001865", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, Federal Fluminense University"}, "23481012700": {"Name": "Chase H.W.", "AuthorID": "23481012700", "AffiliationID": "60028131, 60012018, 60015543", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, Western Psychiatric Institute and Clinic, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, University of Pittsburgh"}, "6506063696": {"Name": "Bertocci M.", "AuthorID": "6506063696", "AffiliationID": "60028131, 60012018, 60015543", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, Western Psychiatric Institute and Clinic, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, University of Pittsburgh"}, "55550811500": {"Name": "Stiffler R.", "AuthorID": "55550811500", "AffiliationID": "60028131, 60012018, 60015543", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, Western Psychiatric Institute and Clinic, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, University of Pittsburgh"}, "6602433828": {"Name": "Greenberg T.", "AuthorID": "6602433828", "AffiliationID": "60028131, 60012018, 60015543", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, Western Psychiatric Institute and Clinic, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, University of Pittsburgh"}, "15724649200": {"Name": "Bebko G.", "AuthorID": "15724649200", "AffiliationID": "60028131, 60012018, 60015543", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, Western Psychiatric Institute and Clinic, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, University of Pittsburgh"}, "56029421600": {"Name": "Lockovich J.", "AuthorID": "56029421600", "AffiliationID": "60028131, 60012018, 60015543", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, Western Psychiatric Institute and Clinic, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, University of Pittsburgh"}, "56371384900": {"Name": "Aslam H.", "AuthorID": "56371384900", "AffiliationID": "60028131, 60012018, 60015543", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, Western Psychiatric Institute and Clinic, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, University of Pittsburgh"}, "57203365458": {"Name": "Phillips M.L.", "AuthorID": "57203365458", "AffiliationID": "60028131, 60012018, 60015543", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, Western Psychiatric Institute and Clinic, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, University of Pittsburgh"}}}
