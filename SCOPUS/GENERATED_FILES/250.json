However, faster transport can the result of many factors. Peritoneal protein clearance (PPC) has been proposed to distinguish faster peritoneal transport attributable to inflammatory conditions, as protein clearance reflects large-pore flow, which increases during inflammation. We followed a cohort of 300 peritoneal dialysis patients, and after adjustments for age and comorbidity, higher PPC was associated with increased risk of death (hazard ratio: 1.81; 95% confidence interval: 1.11 to 2.95), even after patients underwent transplantation or transferred to hemodialysis.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bioimpedance", "Extracellular fluid", "Fast transporter", "Peritoneal protein loss", "Survival"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Female", "Humans", "Kidney Failure, Chronic", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Peritoneal Dialysis", "Peritoneum", "Protein Transport", "Proteins", "Retrospective Studies", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84930900428", "SubjectAreas": [["Nephrology", "MEDI", "2727"]], "AuthorData": {"23994058100": {"Name": "Rajakaruna G.", "AuthorID": "23994058100", "AffiliationID": "60029950, 60032819, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Center for Nephrology, Royal Free Hospital, University College London Medical School"}, "57203209150": {"Name": "Caplin B.", "AuthorID": "57203209150", "AffiliationID": "60029950, 60032819, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Center for Nephrology, Royal Free Hospital, University College London Medical School"}, "55437680000": {"Name": "Davenport A.", "AuthorID": "55437680000", "AffiliationID": "60029950, 60032819, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Center for Nephrology, Royal Free Hospital, University College London Medical School"}}}
