The decision establishes that there is an irreducible core to the right to private life at work that does not depend on an employee\u2019s reasonable expectations of privacy, and sets out clear principles for striking a fair balance between Article 8 and the employer\u2019s interests in the context of workplace monitoring. This article considers the nature of states\u2019 positive obligation to protect human rights at work, the scope of the right to private life, and the impact of the decision on domestic law of unfair dismissal.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85049660598", "SubjectAreas": [["Law", "SOCI", "3308"]], "AuthorData": {"57202865776": {"Name": "Atkinson J.", "AuthorID": "57202865776", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
