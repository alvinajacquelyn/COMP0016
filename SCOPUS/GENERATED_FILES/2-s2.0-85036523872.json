We compared adults who were born very preterm with perinatal brain injury to those born very preterm without perinatal brain injury, and age-matched controls born at full term using [18F]-DOPA PET and structural MRI. Dopamine synthesis capacity was reduced in the perinatal brain injury group relative to those without brain injury (Cohen\u2019s d = 1.36, p=0.02) and the control group (Cohen\u2019s d = 1.07, p=0.01). Hippocampal volume was reduced in the perinatal brain injury group relative to controls (Cohen\u2019s d = 1.17, p=0.01) and was positively correlated with striatal dopamine synthesis capacity (r = 0.344, p=0.03). This is the first evidence in humans linking neonatal hippocampal injury to adult dopamine dysfunction, and provides a potential mechanism linking early life risk factors to adult mental illness.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Brain Injuries", "Dopamine", "Dopaminergic Neurons", "Female", "Hippocampus", "Humans", "London", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Positron-Emission Tomography"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85036523872", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Immunology and Microbiology (all)", "IMMU", "2400"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"55327988700": {"Name": "Froudist-Walsh S.", "AuthorID": "55327988700", "AffiliationID": "60012981", "AffiliationName": "Friedman Brain Institute, Fishberg Department of Neuroscience, Icahn School of Medicine"}, "55774659600": {"Name": "Bloomfield M.A.P.", "AuthorID": "55774659600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Psychopharmacology Unit, Research Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London"}, "56995625100": {"Name": "Kroll J.", "AuthorID": "56995625100", "AffiliationID": "60109217, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychosis Studies, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King\u2019s Health Partners, King\u2019s College London"}, "54418854000": {"Name": "Karolis V.R.", "AuthorID": "54418854000", "AffiliationID": "60109217, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychosis Studies, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King\u2019s Health Partners, King\u2019s College London"}, "6603588360": {"Name": "Jauhar S.", "AuthorID": "6603588360", "AffiliationID": "60020416, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Clinical Sciences, Imperial College London, Hammersmith Hospital"}, "26040450300": {"Name": "Bonoldi I.", "AuthorID": "26040450300", "AffiliationID": "60020416, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Clinical Sciences, Imperial College London, Hammersmith Hospital"}, "7101880438": {"Name": "McGuire P.K.", "AuthorID": "7101880438", "AffiliationID": "60109217, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychosis Studies, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King\u2019s Health Partners, King\u2019s College London"}, "7102708793": {"Name": "Kapur S.", "AuthorID": "7102708793", "AffiliationID": "60109217, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychosis Studies, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King\u2019s Health Partners, King\u2019s College London"}, "35406239400": {"Name": "Murray R.M.", "AuthorID": "35406239400", "AffiliationID": "60109217, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychosis Studies, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King\u2019s Health Partners, King\u2019s College London"}, "6602919436": {"Name": "Nosarti C.", "AuthorID": "6602919436", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Centre for the Developing Brain, Division of Imaging Sciences and Biomedical Engineering, King\u2019s College London"}, "6602176923": {"Name": "Howes O.", "AuthorID": "6602176923", "AffiliationID": "60020416, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Clinical Sciences, Imperial College London, Hammersmith Hospital"}, "36487315800": {"Name": "Veronese M.", "AuthorID": "36487315800", "AffiliationID": "60109217, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroimaging, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King\u2019s Health Partners, King\u2019s College London"}}}
