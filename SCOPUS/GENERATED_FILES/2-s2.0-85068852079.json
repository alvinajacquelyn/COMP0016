The findings suggest that managers with experience in the public and nonprofit sector are less likely to progress in their careers. This effect becomes stronger when the stage of the career at which the manager had experience in the public sector is taken into consideration. These findings are contrary to the expectations from the public and private management literature and suggest that we should see less revolving door activity in Brussels. We propose that these findings are driven by the distinct EU public policy process and the variance in individual and organizational incentives in the EU public sector.", "AuthorKeywords": ["career", "European Union", "government affairs", "lobbying"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85068852079", "SubjectAreas": [["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"], ["Public Administration", "SOCI", "3321"], ["Marketing", "BUSI", "1406"]], "AuthorData": {"7102713711": {"Name": "Coen D.", "AuthorID": "7102713711", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "56047074000": {"Name": "Vannoni M.", "AuthorID": "56047074000", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "King\u2019s College London"}}}
