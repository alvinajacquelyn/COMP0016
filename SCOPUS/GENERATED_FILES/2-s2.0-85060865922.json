Liquid air energy storage (LAES) technology has been widely researched and implemented in the United Kingdom, since there are no special restrictions on geography compared to other technologies. However, there is little attention on LAES in China. In this paper, a linear programming model for the optimal scheduling of multicarrier energy networks considering LAES is established based on the concept of cryogenic energy hub, that is LAES-HUB. The results show that the daily operation cost of LAES-HUB model is 43735.28 RMB, which is even higher than the energy networks works without LEAS. LAES can achieve load shifting through peak and off-peak operations, providing an auxiliary function for energy balance in multi-carrier energy networks.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Energy Internet", "Energy Storage", "Integrated Energy System", "Linear Programming", "optimal Scheduling"], "IndexKeywords": ["Auxiliary functions", "Cryogenic energies", "Energy internet", "Energy networks", "Energy storage technologies", "Integrated energy systems", "Linear programming models", "Optimal scheduling"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85060865922", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"], ["Hardware and Architecture", "COMP", "1708"], ["Energy Engineering and Power Technology", "ENER", "2102"], ["Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment", "ENER", "2105"], ["Control and Optimization", "MATH", "2606"]], "AuthorData": {"56939390300": {"Name": "Wang P.", "AuthorID": "56939390300", "AffiliationID": "60017060", "AffiliationName": "Central South University, School of Information Science and Engineering"}, "55790800500": {"Name": "Wang C.", "AuthorID": "55790800500", "AffiliationID": "60017060", "AffiliationName": "Central South University, School of Information Science and Engineering"}, "57205627991": {"Name": "Li J.", "AuthorID": "57205627991", "AffiliationID": "60017060", "AffiliationName": "Central South University, School of Information Science and Engineering"}, "56116162600": {"Name": "Hu Y.", "AuthorID": "56116162600", "AffiliationID": "60116362, 60004407", "AffiliationName": "Cranfield University, School of Management"}, "15081806200": {"Name": "Varga L.", "AuthorID": "15081806200", "AffiliationID": "60116362, 60004407", "AffiliationName": "Cranfield University, School of Management"}, "57192619758": {"Name": "Wang W.", "AuthorID": "57192619758", "AffiliationID": "60030270", "AffiliationName": "Guangxi University, College of Electrical Engineering"}, "57027258900": {"Name": "Chowdhury J.I.", "AuthorID": "57027258900", "AffiliationID": "60004407, 60116362", "AffiliationName": "School of Water, Energy and Environment, School of Management, Cranfield University"}, "16424528900": {"Name": "Balta-Ozkan N.", "AuthorID": "16424528900", "AffiliationID": "60004407", "AffiliationName": "Cranfield University, School of Water, Energy and Environment"}}}
