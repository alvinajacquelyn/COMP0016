All rights reserved.A 50-year-old man with known multidrug resistant coexistent focal and generalised epilepsy was commenced on ethosuximide, with normalisation of his electroencephalogram and cessation of absence seizures. Within 3 weeks, he developed a rapidly worsening paranoid psychosis with visual and olfactory hallucinations.
