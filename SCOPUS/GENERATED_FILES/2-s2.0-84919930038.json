This underlines the importance of biomarkers to detect AD pathology in vivo before clinical disease onset.Objective: To examine the evolution of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker and brain structure changes in the preclinical phase of familial AD.Methods: The study included members from four Swedish families at risk for carrying an APPswe, APParc, PSEN1 H163Y, or PSEN1 I143T mutation. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were obtained from 13 mutation carriers (MC) and 20 non-carriers (NC) and analyzed using vertex-based analyses of cortical thickness and volume. CSF was collected from 10 MC and 12 NC from familial AD families and analyzed for A\u03b242, total tau (T-tau) and phospho-tau (P-tau).Results: The MC had significantly lower levels of CSF A\u03b242 and higher levels T-tau and P-tau than the NC. There was a trend for a decrease in A\u03b242 15-20 years before expected onset of clinical symptoms, while increasing T-tau and P-tau was not found until close to the expected clinical onset. The MC had decreased volume on MRI in the left precuneus, superior temporal gyrus, and fusiform gyrus.Conclusions: Aberrant biomarker levels in CSF as well as regional brain atrophy are present in preclinical familial AD, several years before the expected onset of clinical symptoms.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alzheimer's disease", "biomarkers", "cerebrospinal fluid", "genetics", "magnetic resonance imaging", "natural history studies", "preclinical"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Alzheimer Disease", "Amyloid beta-Peptides", "Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor", "Apolipoproteins E", "Biological Markers", "Brain", "Cognition", "Family", "Female", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Mutation", "Organ Size", "Peptide Fragments", "Phosphorylation", "Presenilin-1", "Prodromal Symptoms", "Sweden", "tau Proteins"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84919930038", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Clinical Psychology", "PSYC", "3203"], ["Geriatrics and Gerontology", "MEDI", "2717"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"23475828500": {"Name": "Thordardottir S.", "AuthorID": "23475828500", "AffiliationID": "60019295", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geriatric Medicine, Karolinska University Hospital Huddinge"}, "54406054500": {"Name": "St\u00e5hlbom A.K.", "AuthorID": "54406054500", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Karolinska Institutet, Department of NVS, Division for Clinical Geriatrics"}, "57200995035": {"Name": "Graff C.", "AuthorID": "57200995035", "AffiliationID": "60019295", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geriatric Medicine, Karolinska University Hospital Huddinge"}, "55552068500": {"Name": "Eriksdotter M.", "AuthorID": "55552068500", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Karolinska Institutet, Department of NVS, Division for Clinical Geriatrics"}, "55356608800": {"Name": "Ferreira D.", "AuthorID": "55356608800", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Karolinska Institutet, Department of NVS, Division for Clinical Geriatrics"}, "35070775000": {"Name": "Westman E.", "AuthorID": "35070775000", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Karolinska Institutet, Department of NVS, Division for Clinical Geriatrics"}, "16071391500": {"Name": "Almkvist O.", "AuthorID": "16071391500", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Karolinska Institutet, Department of NVS, Center for Alzheimer Research"}, "6701454676": {"Name": "Zetterberg H.", "AuthorID": "6701454676", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "56415176000": {"Name": "Blennow K.", "AuthorID": "56415176000", "AffiliationID": "60027675, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, Department of Psychiatry and Neurochemistry, Sahlgrenska Academy at the University of Gothenburg"}}}
