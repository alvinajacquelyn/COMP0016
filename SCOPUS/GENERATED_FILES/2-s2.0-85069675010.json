The EU Target Electricity Model requires interconnector market coupling via Day Ahead and IntraDay Markets. We examine the efficiency and value of uncoupled and coupled trading for the four DC interconnectors to GB, over different timescales from year ahead to intraday, and the social costs and benefits not reflected in the private benefits. Because the GB carbon tax is not replicated abroad it transfers some \u20ac65 m./yr to the foreign interconnector part-owners and creates distortions when trade flows change. IFA and BritNed have a commercial value of about \u20ac500 million/yr, create additional infra-marginal surplus of \u20ac25 m./yr, but suffer \u20ac30 m./yr deadweight loss from the asymmetric GB carbon tax. The island of Ireland was coupled in Oct 2018, dramatically reducing trading inefficiency. While further investment in interconnectors appears socially profitable, it is important to harmonise carbon taxes across the EU. If GB leaves the EU and is uncoupled, some of these trading gains would be sacrificed, but other financial markets may alleviate the cost of Brexit, making policies to enhance liquidity desirable.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Hedging", "Interconnectors", "Market coupling", "Social value"], "IndexKeywords": ["Carbon taxes", "Hedging", "Interconnectors", "IT transfers", "Market coupling", "Security of supply", "Social cost", "Social values"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85069675010", "SubjectAreas": [["Energy (all)", "ENER", "2100"], ["Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law", "ENVI", "2308"]], "AuthorData": {"7004365924": {"Name": "Newbery D.", "AuthorID": "7004365924", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Energy Policy Research Group, Faculty of Economics, University of Cambridge"}, "57210144599": {"Name": "Gissey G.C.", "AuthorID": "57210144599", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute for Sustainable Resources, University College"}, "55224736800": {"Name": "Dodds P.E.", "AuthorID": "55224736800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute for Sustainable Resources, University College"}, "57210152757": {"Name": "Guo B.", "AuthorID": "57210152757", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Energy Policy Research Group, Faculty of Economics, University of Cambridge"}}}
