Objectives: To identify mycobacteria-specific cytokine biomarkers that characterize TB infection, determine their diagnostic performance characteristics, and establish whether these biomarkers can distinguish between LTBI and active TB. Methods: A total of 149 children investigated for TB infection were recruited; all participants underwent a tuberculin skin test and QuantiFERON-TB Gold assay. In parallel, whole-blood assays using early secretory antigenic target-6, culture filtrate protein-10, and PPD as stimulatory antigens were undertaken, and cytokine responses were determined by xMAP multiplex assays. Measurements and Main Results: IFN-\u03b3, interferon-inducible protein-10 (IP-10), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, IL-1ra, IL-2, IL-13, and MIP-1\u03b2 (macrophage inflammatory protein-1\u03b2) responses were significantly higher in LTBI and active TB cases than in TB-uninfected individuals, irrespective of the stimulant. Receiver operating characteristic analyses showed that IP-10, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-2 responses achieved high sensitivity and specificity for the distinction between TB-uninfected and TB-infected individuals. TNF-\u03b1, IL-1ra, and IL-10 responses had the greatest ability to distinguish between LTBI and active TB cases; the combinations of TNF-\u03b1/IL-1ra and TNF-\u03b1/IL-10 achieved correct classification of 95.5% and 100% of cases, respectively. Conclusions: We identified several mycobacteria-specific cytokine biomarkers with the potential to be exploited for immunodiagnosis. Incorporation of these biomarkers into future immunodiagnostic assays for TB could result in substantial gains in sensitivity and allow the distinction between LTBI and active TB based on a blood test alone.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Biomarker", "Child", "Cytokines", "Diagnosis", "Tuberculosis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Biological Markers", "Chemokine CCL4", "Chemokine CXCL10", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Cohort Studies", "Diagnosis, Differential", "Female", "Humans", "Interferon-gamma", "Interleukins", "Latent Tuberculosis", "Male", "Predictive Value of Tests", "ROC Curve", "Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84940065181", "SubjectAreas": [["Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine", "MEDI", "2740"], ["Critical Care and Intensive Care Medicine", "MEDI", "2706"]], "AuthorData": {"55911967000": {"Name": "Tebruegge M.", "AuthorID": "55911967000", "AffiliationID": "60025287", "AffiliationName": "Academic Unit of Clinical and Experimental Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton"}, "6603945411": {"Name": "Donath S.", "AuthorID": "6603945411", "AffiliationID": "60026489", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Epidemiology and Biostatistics Unit, Royal Children's Hospital Melbourne"}, "24577103100": {"Name": "Ritz N.", "AuthorID": "24577103100", "AffiliationID": "60006655", "AffiliationName": "Infectious Diseases Unit, University Children's Hospital Basel"}, "26422792000": {"Name": "Clifford V.", "AuthorID": "26422792000", "AffiliationID": "60009102", "AffiliationName": "Murdoch Children's Research Institute"}, "7006901869": {"Name": "Robins-Browne R.", "AuthorID": "7006901869", "AffiliationID": "60026553", "AffiliationName": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Melbourne"}, "55627579200": {"Name": "Graham S.M.", "AuthorID": "55627579200", "AffiliationID": "113262122", "AffiliationName": "Centre for International Child Health"}, "7004232352": {"Name": "Connell T.", "AuthorID": "7004232352", "AffiliationID": "60009102", "AffiliationName": "Murdoch Children's Research Institute"}, "7102229084": {"Name": "Curtis N.", "AuthorID": "7102229084", "AffiliationID": "60009102", "AffiliationName": "Murdoch Children's Research Institute"}, "8595555700": {"Name": "Camacho-Badilla K.", "AuthorID": "8595555700", "AffiliationID": "60026489", "AffiliationName": "Infectious Diseases Unit, Royal Children's Hospital Melbourne"}, "24072801600": {"Name": "Dutta B.", "AuthorID": "24072801600", "AffiliationID": "60009102", "AffiliationName": "Murdoch Children's Research Institute"}, "56875267100": {"Name": "Forbes B.", "AuthorID": "56875267100", "AffiliationID": "60009102", "AffiliationName": "Murdoch Children's Research Institute"}, "55301912300": {"Name": "Zufferey C.", "AuthorID": "55301912300", "AffiliationID": "60009102", "AffiliationName": "Murdoch Children's Research Institute"}, "6603950018": {"Name": "Hanekom W.", "AuthorID": "6603950018", "AffiliationID": "60000356", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Infectious Diseases and Molecular Medicine, School of Child and Adolescent Health, University of Cape Town"}}}
