This article explores one element of a two-year project recording and analysing contemporary adult reading aloud practices. It reports on an analysis of all 160 Mass Observation Project responses, examining the \u2018atypical typicality\u2019 of correspondents\u2019 reactions to the topic and their own practices; their analytical acts as researchers classifying practices and investigating artistry; and the stories they tell about how we both express and create relationships with individuals and larger groups through our oral reading practices.
