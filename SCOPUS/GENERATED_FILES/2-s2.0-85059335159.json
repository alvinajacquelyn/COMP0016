Methods: A cross-sectional study of people with epilepsy was carried out in areas in Henan, Shanxi and Ningxia provinces of China. All participants underwent a specially designed \u201cOral health and Dental status Questionnaire\u201d. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to explore the relationships between seizure frequency and oral health and dental status. Results: A total of 875 people participated. Almost two thirds (65.8%) reported brushing their teeth at least once a day but 634 (73.0%) brushed their teeth for less than 3 min each time. Only 80 (9.1%) had visited a dental clinic in the previous year. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that having 1\u20134 seizures/month (OR 0.60, 95%CI 0.40-0.90) or >4 seizures/month (OR 0.38, 95%CI 0.22-0.66) was associated with decreased odds of brushing teeth at least once a day, and higher seizure frequency was associated with increased odds of dental injury due to seizures (OR 2.07, 95%CI 1.22\u20133.50 for <1 seizure/month; OR 2.12, 95%CI 1.25\u20133.58 for 1\u20134 seizures/month; OR 3.09, 95%CI 1.57\u20136.07 for >4 seizures/month). Conclusion: Seizure frequency was significantly associated with seizure-related dental injury, and with the lack of good oral health practice. Improvement in the oral health of people with epilepsy in resource-poor areas should be encouraged.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Buccal hygiene", "Dental caries", "Dentistry", "Oral sampling", "Seizure frequency", "Tooth loss"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "China", "Cohort Studies", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Dental Caries", "Ecosystem", "Epilepsy", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Oral Health", "Rural Population", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "Tooth Diseases"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85059335159", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"57205260657": {"Name": "Wang M.", "AuthorID": "57205260657", "AffiliationID": "60073628, 60009860", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Huashan Hospital, Fudan University"}, "55451891400": {"Name": "Zhu G.", "AuthorID": "55451891400", "AffiliationID": "60073628, 60009860", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Huashan Hospital, Fudan University"}, "56810185300": {"Name": "Ge Y.", "AuthorID": "56810185300", "AffiliationID": "60073628, 60009860", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Huashan Hospital, Fudan University"}, "35331652300": {"Name": "Ding D.", "AuthorID": "35331652300", "AffiliationID": "60073628, 60009860", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neurology, WHO Collaborating Center for Research and Training in Neurosciences, Huashan Hospital, Fudan University"}, "7201414497": {"Name": "Hong Z.", "AuthorID": "7201414497", "AffiliationID": "60073628, 60009860", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neurology, WHO Collaborating Center for Research and Training in Neurosciences, Huashan Hospital, Fudan University"}, "55241899100": {"Name": "Zhang Q.", "AuthorID": "55241899100", "AffiliationID": "109481064", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Ningxia Medical University Affiliated Hospital"}, "55584795104": {"Name": "Yang B.", "AuthorID": "55584795104", "AffiliationID": "108258460", "AffiliationName": "Jiaozuo People's Hospital"}, "56135245500": {"Name": "Wang T.", "AuthorID": "56135245500", "AffiliationID": "119365725", "AffiliationName": "Jincheng Emergency Center"}, "7004369601": {"Name": "Kwan P.", "AuthorID": "7004369601", "AffiliationID": "60019578, 60008014", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Monash University, Alfred Hospital"}, "57216606865": {"Name": "Wang W.", "AuthorID": "57216606865", "AffiliationID": "60026707, 60069741", "AffiliationName": "Beijing Neurosurgical Institute, Capital Medical University"}, "57188659835": {"Name": "Sander J.W.", "AuthorID": "57188659835", "AffiliationID": "60027759", "AffiliationName": "Stichting Epilepsie Instellingen Nederland (SEIN)"}}}
