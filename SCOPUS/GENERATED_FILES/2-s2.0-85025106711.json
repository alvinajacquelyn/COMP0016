This paper is part of a larger doctoral study completed at the University College London that investigated the connection between RM education and national development. Design/methodology/approach: The research is a qualitative mixed methods study, which mainly utilises data from 34 interviews done among RM practitioners and educators, and development administrators and analysts in Kingston and Spanish Town, Jamaica. Findings: The study found that there is an urgent need for a change in how RM practitioners are recruited for their roles in Jamaica\u2019s public sector. More coherent frameworks and a more coordinated effort are required to support for the recruitment of practitioners. Research limitations/implications: This research is specific to the Jamaican case; therefore, it provides little basis for generalisation. Consequently, the study seeks to make no claims that the results in the Jamaican context are generalisable to other societies. Nonetheless, the conclusions and recommendations may be instructive in other environments. Social implications: The study evaluated some of the existing practices for the recruitment of RM practitioners. As a result, the findings should enhance the knowledge about the human resources needs in RM in Jamaica. Originality/value: In addition to providing some directions for future research, the study also gives voice to a diverse group. It brings together an analysis of national discourses around RM recruitment practices. This is done through the multifaceted views of Jamaican RM practitioners, development administrators and RM educators represented in the interviews.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Education", "Jamaica", "Public sector", "Records management", "Recruitment", "Training"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85025106711", "SubjectAreas": [["Management Information Systems", "BUSI", "1404"], ["Library and Information Sciences", "SOCI", "3309"]], "AuthorData": {"57195052002": {"Name": "Duffus K.", "AuthorID": "57195052002", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Information Studies, University College London"}}}
