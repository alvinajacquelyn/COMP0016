In total, 26 patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease were tested with both real and sham stimulation. The group was divided into an OFF-medication (4 females, mean age 65 years, disease duration 6 years) and an ON-medication group (7 females, mean age 61 years, disease duration 7 years) with each containing 13 individuals. Both groups were evaluated in terms of electrophysiological (motor-evoked potentials) and behavioural [Purdue Pegboard test (PPT), UPDRS motor subscore] parameters before (baseline condition) and after a 40-second period of real or sham continuous theta burst stimulation over the SMA ON and OFF dopaminergic drugs. Patients in the OFF group demonstrated an improved UPDRS III score (p < 0.05) and a better performance in the PPT for the less affected side (p < 0.025) compared to baseline after real stimulation. However, electrophysiological parameters did not change in either the ON or the OFF state. cTBS over the SMA has a mild effect on motor symptoms of the upper limb in the OFF state of PD patients. In contrast, stimulation did not change cortico-spinal excitability. A lack of change (i.e. no plasticity) to brain stimulation protocols is a known finding in PD. A clinical improvement in the OFF state, however, contrasts with this and the mechanism of these induced changes is worth further exploration.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Basal ganglia", "Brain plasticity", "Neuromodulation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Evoked Potentials, Motor", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Motor Cortex", "Neuronal Plasticity", "Parkinson Disease", "Theta Rhythm", "Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84925464712", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"23388928100": {"Name": "Eggers C.", "AuthorID": "23388928100", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Sobell Department of Motor Neuroscience and Movement Disorders, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "56414256500": {"Name": "G\u00fcnther M.", "AuthorID": "56414256500", "AffiliationID": "60008658", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, University Hospital of Cologne"}, "6603563144": {"Name": "Timmermann L.", "AuthorID": "6603563144", "AffiliationID": "60008658", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, University Hospital of Cologne"}, "55455767400": {"Name": "Rothwell J.", "AuthorID": "55455767400", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Sobell Department of Motor Neuroscience and Movement Disorders, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "6602133415": {"Name": "Ruge D.", "AuthorID": "6602133415", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Sobell Department of Motor Neuroscience and Movement Disorders, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}}}
