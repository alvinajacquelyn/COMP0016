All rights reserved.Down syndrome, which arises in individuals carrying an extra copy of chromosome 21, is associated with a greatly increased risk of early-onset Alzheimer disease. It is thought that this risk is conferred by the presence of three copies of the gene encoding amyloid precursor protein (APP)-an Alzheimer disease risk factor-although the possession of extra copies of other chromosome 21 genes may also play a part. Further study of the mechanisms underlying the development of Alzheimer disease in people with Down syndrome could provide insights into the mechanisms that cause dementia in the general population.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Alzheimer Disease", "Amyloid beta-Peptides", "Down Syndrome", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Humans"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84939773933", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"]], "AuthorData": {"14520663000": {"Name": "Wiseman F.K.", "AuthorID": "14520663000", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "56764220000": {"Name": "Al-Janabi T.", "AuthorID": "56764220000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, University College London, Maple House"}, "56210513900": {"Name": "Hardy J.", "AuthorID": "56210513900", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "7003649617": {"Name": "Karmiloff-Smith A.", "AuthorID": "7003649617", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Brain and Cognitive Development"}, "7003483313": {"Name": "Nizetic D.", "AuthorID": "7003483313", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Blizard Institute, Barts and the London School of Medicine, Queen Mary University of London"}, "7003735726": {"Name": "Tybulewicz V.L.J.", "AuthorID": "7003735726", "AffiliationID": "60107285", "AffiliationName": "Francis Crick Institute, Mill Hill Laboratory"}, "56079439400": {"Name": "Strydom A.", "AuthorID": "56079439400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, University College London, Maple House"}, "57203069236": {"Name": "Fisher E.M.C.", "AuthorID": "57203069236", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}}}
