Within predictive coding theory, oscillatory beta-band activity has been linked to top-down predictive signals and gamma-band activity to bottom-up prediction errors. However, neurocognitive evidence for predictive coding outside lower-level sensory areas is scarce. We used magnetoencephalography to investigate neural activity during probabilitydependent action perception in three areas pivotal for causal inference, superior temporal sulcus, temporoparietal junction and medial prefrontal cortex, using bowling action animations. Within this network, Granger-causal connectivity in the beta-band was found to be strongest for backward top-down connections and gamma for feed-forward bottom-up connections. Moreover, beta-band power in TPJ increased parametrically with the predictability of the action kinematicsoutcome sequences. Conversely, gamma-band power in TPJ and MPFC increased with prediction error. These findings suggest that the brain utilizes predictive-coding-like computations for higher-order cognition such as perception of causal events.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Action perception", "Causal inference", "Connectivity", "Magnetoencephalography", "Predictive coding"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Beta Rhythm", "Cerebral Cortex", "Gamma Rhythm", "Humans", "Magnetoencephalography", "Motor Activity", "Probability", "Thinking", "Visual Perception"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84978997767", "SubjectAreas": [["Experimental and Cognitive Psychology", "PSYC", "3205"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"]], "AuthorData": {"14033617200": {"Name": "van Pelt S.", "AuthorID": "14033617200", "AffiliationID": "60016529", "AffiliationName": "Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour, Radboud University Nijmegen"}, "56145178900": {"Name": "Heil L.", "AuthorID": "56145178900", "AffiliationID": "60016529", "AffiliationName": "Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour, Radboud University Nijmegen"}, "23397501400": {"Name": "Kwisthout J.", "AuthorID": "23397501400", "AffiliationID": "60016529", "AffiliationName": "Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour, Radboud University Nijmegen"}, "54885292500": {"Name": "Ondobaka S.", "AuthorID": "54885292500", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60084279", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging and Sobell Department, University College London"}, "57214980857": {"Name": "van Rooij I.", "AuthorID": "57214980857", "AffiliationID": "60016529", "AffiliationName": "Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour, Radboud University Nijmegen"}, "55154252600": {"Name": "Bekkering H.", "AuthorID": "55154252600", "AffiliationID": "60016529", "AffiliationName": "Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour, Radboud University Nijmegen"}}}
