The anti-inflammatory properties of corticosteroids may be most effective in the early inflammatory phase, but rapid patient recruitment remains a logistic challenge. The aim of the study was to review the effect of time to initiation of treatment on visual outcome in recurrent ON. A retrospective case note review of patients known to our centre with recurrent ON. The primary clinical outcome was change of best corrected high contrast visual acuity (BCVA). The secondary outcome was the change of optical coherence tomography (OCT) thickness of the peripapillary retinal nerve fibre layer (pRNFL) and macular ganglion cell layer (mGCL) from baseline and after a minimum of 3 months following the episode of recurrent ON. Of 269 patients with a previous episode of ON, 54 experienced recurrent ON. In total 40 OCT documented episodes of relapsing ON were captured in 19 patients. Treatment within <2 days led to better recovery of the BCVA (+0.02) and mGCL (\u22122.4 \u00b5m) if compared to delayed treatment (BCVA \u22120.2, p = 0.036, mGCL \u221225.6 \u00b5m, p = 0.019) or no corticosteroids treatment (BCVA \u22120.2, p = 0.045, GCL \u22125.0 \u00b5m, p = 0.836). These data suggest a beneficial effect of hyperacute corticosteroid treatment. A pragmatic approach for a prospective treatment trial should consider patients with recurrent ON for logistic reasons.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Corticosteroids", "Optical coherence tomography", "Recurrent optic neuritis", "Visual acuity"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adrenal Cortex Hormones", "Adult", "Disease Progression", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Neuroprotective Agents", "Optic Neuritis", "Organ Size", "Recurrence", "Retina", "Retrospective Studies", "Time-to-Treatment", "Tomography, Optical Coherence", "Treatment Outcome", "Visual Acuity", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85027582801", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Developmental Biology", "BIOC", "1309"]], "AuthorData": {"57195385042": {"Name": "Osinga E.", "AuthorID": "57195385042", "AffiliationID": "60001997", "AffiliationName": "Expertise Centre Neuro-ophthalmology, VUmc"}, "56911189900": {"Name": "van Oosten B.", "AuthorID": "56911189900", "AffiliationID": "60001997", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, VUmc MS Centre Amsterdam"}, "7006826396": {"Name": "Petzold A.", "AuthorID": "7006826396", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60016691, 60019953", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital, The National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery & UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "6603658213": {"Name": "de Vries-Knoppert W.", "AuthorID": "6603658213", "AffiliationID": "60001997", "AffiliationName": "Expertise Centre Neuro-ophthalmology, VUmc"}}}
