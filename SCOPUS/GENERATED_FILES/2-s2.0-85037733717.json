However, data on early repolarization in the paediatric population are lacking. This study aimed to assess the prevalence of early repolarization in paediatric first-degree relatives of sudden arrhythmic death syndrome (SADS) victims. Methods and results Paediatric relatives (aged <18 years) of SADS probands referred to the Inherited Arrhythmia Clinic at Great Ormond Street Hospital had their initial screening ECG reviewed for evidence of J-point elevation. J-point elevation was defined as QRS-ST slurring or a discrete notch in two or more inferior (II, III, aVF) or lateral (I, a VL, V4, V5, V6) leads with the change beginning >1 mV from baseline. The ECGs of 77 consecutive paediatric first-degree relatives of SADS victims from 46 families were reviewed by two assessors. J-point elevation was present in 24 patients (31%) of this patient group compared with the reported prevalence of 5-13% in the published general paediatric population (P = 0.02) and that of 19% in the internal control group (P = 0.07). Subgroup analysis according to J-point elevation and ST segment morphologies showed a significantly higher prevalence of inferior early repolarization 0.1-0.2 mV in the study group compared with controls (75 vs. 38%; P = 0.02). Conclusion Inferolateral J-point elevation occurs in a substantial proportion of paediatric first-degree relatives of SADS probands with a similar prevalence to that described in adults. This suggests that early repolarization could be an important inherited trait when evaluating relatives of SADS victims. However, prospective follow-up of this group of children is important to establish the implication of this finding in future risk stratification, given the apparently high prevalence in normal individuals.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Children", "Ion channel disease", "Paediatric arrhythmias", "Sudden cardiac death", "Ventricular arrhythmia"], "IndexKeywords": ["Action Potentials", "Adolescent", "Adult", "Age Factors", "Arrhythmias, Cardiac", "Case-Control Studies", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Death, Sudden, Cardiac", "Electrocardiography", "Family", "Female", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Heart Conduction System", "Heart Rate", "Heredity", "Humans", "London", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Pedigree", "Prevalence", "Risk Factors", "Time Factors", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85037733717", "SubjectAreas": [["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"], ["Physiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2737"]], "AuthorData": {"57199285723": {"Name": "McCorquodale A.", "AuthorID": "57199285723", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Inherited Cardiovascular Diseases Unit, Department of Cardiology"}, "57199254756": {"Name": "Poulton R.", "AuthorID": "57199254756", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Inherited Cardiovascular Diseases Unit, Department of Cardiology"}, "56324030000": {"Name": "Hendry J.", "AuthorID": "56324030000", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Inherited Cardiovascular Diseases Unit, Department of Cardiology"}, "57194718986": {"Name": "Norrish G.", "AuthorID": "57194718986", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Inherited Cardiovascular Diseases Unit, Department of Cardiology"}, "56324482500": {"Name": "Field E.", "AuthorID": "56324482500", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Inherited Cardiovascular Diseases Unit, Department of Cardiology"}, "25028083500": {"Name": "Mead-Regan S.", "AuthorID": "25028083500", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Inherited Cardiovascular Diseases Unit, Department of Cardiology"}, "7202196645": {"Name": "Lowe M.", "AuthorID": "7202196645", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Inherited Cardiovascular Diseases Unit, Department of Cardiology"}, "16204898600": {"Name": "Kaski J.P.", "AuthorID": "16204898600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}}}
