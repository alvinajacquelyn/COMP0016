We tested the hypothesis that cinacalcet would reduce the rate of clinical fractures in patients receiving hemodialysis using data from the Evaluation of Cinacalcet HCl Therapy to Lower Cardiovascular Events trial, a placebo-controlled trial that randomized 3883 hemodialysis patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism to receive cinacalcet or placebo for \u226464 months. This study was a prespecified secondary analysis of the trial whose primary end point was all-cause mortality and non-fatal cardiovascular events, and one of the secondary end points was first clinical fracture event. Clinical fractures were observed in 255 of 1935 (13.2%) patients randomized to placebo and 238 of 1948 (12.2%) patients randomized to cinacalcet. In an unadjusted intention-to-treat analysis, the relative hazard for fracture (cinacalcet versus placebo) was 0.89 (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.75 to 1.07). After adjustment for baseline characteristics and multiple fractures, the relative hazard was 0.83 (95% CI, 0.72 to 0.98). Using a prespecified lag-censoring analysis (a measure of actual drug exposure), the relative hazard for fracture was 0.72 (95% CI, 0.58 to 0.90). When participants were censored at the time of cointerventions (parathyroidectomy, transplant, or provision of commercial cinacalcet), the relative hazard was 0.71 (95% CI, 0.58 to 0.87). Fracture rates were higher in older compared with younger patients and the effect of cinacalcet appeared more pronounced in older patients. In conclusion, using an unadjusted intention-to-treat analysis, cinacalcet did not reduce the rate of clinical fracture. However, when accounting for differences in baseline characteristics, multiple fractures, and/or events prompting discontinuation of study drug, cinacalcet reduced the rate of clinical fracture by 16%-29%.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Age Factors", "Aged", "Cinacalcet Hydrochloride", "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug", "Drug Administration Schedule", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Fractures, Bone", "Humans", "Hyperparathyroidism, Secondary", "Incidence", "Kidney Failure, Chronic", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Naphthalenes", "Proportional Hazards Models", "Reference Values", "Renal Dialysis", "Risk Assessment", "Sex Factors", "Statistics, Nonparametric", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84930442261", "SubjectAreas": [["Nephrology", "MEDI", "2727"]], "AuthorData": {"7006851442": {"Name": "Moe S.M.", "AuthorID": "7006851442", "AffiliationID": "60021947, 60105925", "AffiliationName": "Indiana University School of Medicine, Roudebush Veterans Administration Medical Center"}, "56667081900": {"Name": "Abdalla S.", "AuthorID": "56667081900", "AffiliationID": "60032838", "AffiliationName": "Stanford University School of Medicine"}, "7006693864": {"Name": "Chertow G.M.", "AuthorID": "7006693864", "AffiliationID": "60032838", "AffiliationName": "Stanford University School of Medicine"}, "57203051418": {"Name": "Mahaffey K.W.", "AuthorID": "57203051418", "AffiliationID": "60032838", "AffiliationName": "Stanford University School of Medicine"}, "7005316785": {"Name": "Parfrey P.S.", "AuthorID": "7005316785", "AffiliationID": "60031046", "AffiliationName": "Health Sciences Center"}, "7101964110": {"Name": "Block G.A.", "AuthorID": "7101964110", "AffiliationID": "100383386", "AffiliationName": "Denver Nephrology"}, "20533642000": {"Name": "Correa-Rotter R.", "AuthorID": "20533642000", "AffiliationID": "60009149", "AffiliationName": "Salvador Zubir\u00e1n National Institute of Medical Sciences and Nutrition"}, "55961563700": {"Name": "Floege J.", "AuthorID": "55961563700", "AffiliationID": "60001097", "AffiliationName": "University Hospital RWTH Aachen"}, "55664203600": {"Name": "Herzog C.A.", "AuthorID": "55664203600", "AffiliationID": "60029445", "AffiliationName": "University of Minnesota"}, "35481047100": {"Name": "London G.M.", "AuthorID": "35481047100", "AffiliationID": "100712967", "AffiliationName": "Manh\u00e8s Hospital"}, "7202992832": {"Name": "Wheeler D.C.", "AuthorID": "7202992832", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "6506978045": {"Name": "Dehmel B.", "AuthorID": "6506978045", "AffiliationID": "60001673", "AffiliationName": "Amgen Inc."}, "7102365885": {"Name": "Goodman W.G.", "AuthorID": "7102365885", "AffiliationID": "60001673", "AffiliationName": "Amgen Inc."}, "7102412294": {"Name": "Dr\u00fceke T.B.", "AuthorID": "7102412294", "AffiliationID": "60009051, 60016097, 60000905", "AffiliationName": "French Institute of Health and Medical Research (INSERM) Unit 1088, Faculty of Medicine/Pharmacy, University of Picardie"}, "null": {"Name": null, "AuthorID": null, "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
