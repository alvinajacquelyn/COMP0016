Starting from a microscopic model, via the mean field limit, we formally derive coupled kinetic equations for the particle and link densities, following the approach of [P. Degond, F. Delebecque, and D. Peurichard, Math. Models Methods Appl. Sci., 26 (2016), pp. 269\u2013318]. Assuming that the process of remodeling the network is very fast, we simplify the description to a macroscopic model taking the form of a single aggregation-diffusion equation for the density of particles. We analyze qualitatively this equation, addressing the stability of a homogeneous distribution of particles for a general potential. For the Hookean potential we obtain a precise condition for the phase transition, and, using the central manifold reduction, we characterize the type of bifurcation at the instability onset.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Aggregation-diffusion", "Fokker\u2013Planck", "Individual-based model", "Linear stability", "Macroscopic limit", "Meanfield limit", "Phase transition"], "IndexKeywords": ["Density of particles", "Homogeneous distribution", "Individual based model", "Linear Stability", "Macroscopic limit", "Mean-field", "Microscopic modeling", "Multi scale analysis"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85038072084", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Modeling and Simulation", "MATH", "2611"], ["Ecological Modeling", "ENVI", "2302"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"]], "AuthorData": {"57191842530": {"Name": "Barr\u00e9 J.", "AuthorID": "57191842530", "AffiliationID": "60029631", "AffiliationName": "Institut Universitaire de France"}, "7005668908": {"Name": "Degond P.", "AuthorID": "7005668908", "AffiliationID": "60122685, 60008134", "AffiliationName": "CNRS, Institut de Math\u00e9matiques de Toulouse"}, "36717202900": {"Name": "Zatorska E.", "AuthorID": "36717202900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University College London"}}}
