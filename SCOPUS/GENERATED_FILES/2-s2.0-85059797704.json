Initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals with cryptococcal meningitis places them at risk for Cryptococcus-associated immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (C-IRIS). The relationship between antibody immunity and C-IRIS risk has not been investigated. Methods. We compared plasma levels of immunoglobulins, C. neoformans glucuronoxylomannan (GXM) capsule-specific and laminarin (Lam)-binding IgM and IgG, and percentages of peripheral blood total and memory B cells between 27 HIV-infected patients with CM who developed C-IRIS and 63 who did not, and evaluated associations of these parameters with risk of C-IRIS. Results. Prior to initiation of ART, plasma IgM, Lam-binding IgM (Lam-IgM), Lam-IgG, and GXM-IgM levels were significantly lower in patients who developed C-IRIS than those who did not. Multivariate analysis revealed significant inverse associations between C-IRIS and IgM (P = .0003), Lam-IgM (P = .0005), Lam-IgG (P = .002), and GXM-IgM (P = .002) independent of age, sex, HIV viral load, CD4+ T-cell count, and cerebrospinal fluid fungal burden. There were no associations between C-IRIS and total or memory B cells. Discussion. Antibody profiles that include plasma IgM, Lam-IgM, Lam-IgG, and/or GXM-IgM may have value in furthering our understanding of C-IRIS pathogenesis and hold promise as candidate biomarkers of C-IRIS risk.", "AuthorKeywords": ["cryptococcal meningitis", "Cryptococcus-associated immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome", "GXM", "HIV", "IgG", "IgM", "laminarin", "memory B cells"], "IndexKeywords": ["Anti-Retroviral Agents", "Antibody Formation", "B-Lymphocytes", "Cryptococcosis", "Cryptococcus neoformans", "HIV Infections", "Humans", "Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome", "Immunoglobulin G", "Immunoglobulin M", "Immunoglobulins", "Meningitis, Cryptococcal", "Multivariate Analysis", "Plasma", "Polysaccharides"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85059797704", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"57205370552": {"Name": "Yoon H.A.", "AuthorID": "57205370552", "AffiliationID": "60002388, 60024099", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Montefiore Medical Center"}, "7005547028": {"Name": "Pirofski L.A.", "AuthorID": "7005547028", "AffiliationID": "60002388, 60024099", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Population Health, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Montefiore Medical Center"}, "6602514326": {"Name": "Nakouzi A.", "AuthorID": "6602514326", "AffiliationID": "60002388, 60024099", "AffiliationName": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Montefiore Medical Center"}, "15126422800": {"Name": "Wang T.", "AuthorID": "15126422800", "AffiliationID": "60002388, 60024099", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Population Health, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Montefiore Medical Center"}, "56437792900": {"Name": "Chang C.C.", "AuthorID": "56437792900", "AffiliationID": "60008014, 60019578", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infectious Diseases, Alfred Hospital and Monash University"}, "15737239300": {"Name": "Lewin S.R.", "AuthorID": "15737239300", "AffiliationID": "60026553, 60117340, 60005245", "AffiliationName": "Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity, University of Melbourne, Royal Melbourne Hospital"}, "14042016100": {"Name": "Kuniholm M.H.", "AuthorID": "14042016100", "AffiliationID": "60011666", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University at Albany"}, "8295295700": {"Name": "Carre\u00f1o L.J.", "AuthorID": "8295295700", "AffiliationID": "60002946, 60012464", "AffiliationName": "Millennium Institute on Immunology and Immunotherapy, Programa de Inmunolog\u00eda, Instituto de Ciencias Biom\u00e9dicas, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad de Chile"}, "6507164421": {"Name": "Ndung'u T.", "AuthorID": "6507164421", "AffiliationID": "60022344", "AffiliationName": "Max Planck Institute for Infection Biology"}, "7202594947": {"Name": "French M.A.", "AuthorID": "7202594947", "AffiliationID": "60189720", "AffiliationName": "University of Western Australia Medical School, School of Biomedical Sciences"}}}
