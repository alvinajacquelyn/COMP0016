A fundamental feature of our multiple process model was the distinction between two types of online regulation: impulse control and limb-target control. Impulse control begins during the initial stages of the movement trajectory and involves a comparison of actual limb velocity and direction to an internal representation of expectations about the limb trajectory. Limb-target control involves discrete error-reduction based on the relative positions of the limb and the target late in the movement. Our model also considers the role of eye movements, practice, energy optimization and strategic behavior in limb control. Here, we review recent work conducted to test specific aspects of our model. As well, we consider research not fully incorporated into our earlier contribution. We conclude that a slightly modified and expanded version of our model, that includes crosstalk between the two forms of online regulation, does an excellent job of explaining speed, accuracy, and energy optimization in goal-directed reaching.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Aiming/reaching", "Limb trajectories", "Movement planning", "Speed-accuracy", "Visual feedback"], "IndexKeywords": ["Goals", "Humans", "Movement"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85000631204", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuropsychology and Physiological Psychology", "PSYC", "3206"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"], ["Behavioral Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2802"]], "AuthorData": {"55755568100": {"Name": "Elliott D.", "AuthorID": "55755568100", "AffiliationID": "60028355", "AffiliationName": "Research Institute for Sport and Exercise Sciences, Faculty of Science, Liverpool John Moores University"}, "56208284700": {"Name": "Lyons J.", "AuthorID": "56208284700", "AffiliationID": "60031828", "AffiliationName": "Department of Kinesiology, McMaster University"}, "55766256700": {"Name": "Burkitt J.J.", "AuthorID": "55766256700", "AffiliationID": "60031828", "AffiliationName": "Department of Kinesiology, McMaster University"}, "55483031200": {"Name": "Roberts J.W.", "AuthorID": "55483031200", "AffiliationID": "60031828", "AffiliationName": "Department of Kinesiology, McMaster University"}, "22957792000": {"Name": "Grierson L.E.M.", "AuthorID": "22957792000", "AffiliationID": "60031828", "AffiliationName": "Department of Family Medicine, McMaster University"}, "8629701800": {"Name": "Hayes S.J.", "AuthorID": "8629701800", "AffiliationID": "60028355", "AffiliationName": "Research Institute for Sport and Exercise Sciences, Faculty of Science, Liverpool John Moores University"}, "7403105607": {"Name": "Bennett S.J.", "AuthorID": "7403105607", "AffiliationID": "60028355", "AffiliationName": "Research Institute for Sport and Exercise Sciences, Faculty of Science, Liverpool John Moores University"}, "7403080016": {"Name": "Hansen S.", "AuthorID": "7403080016", "AffiliationID": "60028389", "AffiliationName": "Schulich School of Education, Nipissing University"}}}
