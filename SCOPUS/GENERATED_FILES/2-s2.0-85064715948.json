All rights reserved.Our goal was to investigate the efficacy of a Mindfulness-Based Intervention (MBI) in the form of a short-term, online intervention using exercises from Mindfulness-Based Stress-Reduction program on self-compassion, self-reassurance and self-criticism in a non-clinical population. We conducted pre-, post- and two-month follow-up measures of self-compassion, self-reassurance and self-criticism. A total of 146 participants, recruited through convenience sampling, were randomly allocated to the intervention with daily exercises for consecutive 15 days and to a control condition with no treatment. The intervention group reported a significant reduction in self-criticism and self-uncompassionate responding with effects present at two-month follow-up. There was a short-term effect of the training on self-compassion with no effect present at the two-month follow-up and no significant effect on self-reassurance. A limitation of the study is that participants\u2019 previous experience with meditation was not assessed, and thus the findings may be a result of previous meditation practice and not the intervention itself. Despite this limitation, the findings show that an online short-term MBI may be helpful in reducing self-criticism in general population, but a larger study taking into account the limitations needs to be conducted to replicate this effect before recommendations for clinical practice can be made.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Experiment", "Mindfulness-based intervention", "Self-compassion", "Self-criticism", "Self-reassurance"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85064715948", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychology (all)", "PSYC", "3200"]], "AuthorData": {"6508303475": {"Name": "Halamov\u00e1 J.", "AuthorID": "6508303475", "AffiliationID": "60001987", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Applied Psychology, Faculty of Social and Economic Sciences, Comenius University"}, "57220279131": {"Name": "Jurkov\u00e1 V.", "AuthorID": "57220279131", "AffiliationID": "60001987", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Applied Psychology, Faculty of Social and Economic Sciences, Comenius University"}, "56464313100": {"Name": "Kanovsk\u00fd M.", "AuthorID": "56464313100", "AffiliationID": "60001987", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Social Anthropology, Faculty of Social and Economic Sciences, Comenius University"}, "55588362000": {"Name": "Kupeli N.", "AuthorID": "55588362000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Marie Curie Palliative Care Research Department, Division of Psychiatry, University College London"}}}
