Jones, Kristin R. Mitchell, George B. Ploubidis, Kaye Wellings, Jessica Datta, Anne M. Johnson, and Catherine H. Mercer.The Natsal-SF is a psychometrically validated measure of sexual function for use in community health surveys, derived from 17 questions reflecting three components of sexual function. Scoring requires knowledge of complex statistical modeling and, given the methodological complexities, we assessed the validity of two simplified scoring methods calculated using the factor loadings produced when originally modeling the Natsal-SF items. Method 1 uses these factor loadings to three decimal places, while method 2 assigns whole numbers to each item based on the factor loadings. Scores from these simplified methods are compared to the original score using correlation coefficients, by comparing the distributions and the scores of each method in a linear regression model with key variables. We found scores from the simplified methods both correlate highly with the original score, and the distributions of scores closely match. The simplified methods result in different regression coefficients for gender and relationship context but estimate the coefficients of all other variables similarly to the original method. While the Natsal-SF should ideally be scored using latent variable modeling, the simplified methods perform well so can be used in similar contexts, increasing the utility of the Natsal-SF and enabling future studies to measure sexual function more comprehensively.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Psychometrics", "Sexual Behavior", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84952630098", "SubjectAreas": [["Gender Studies", "SOCI", "3318"], ["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"], ["Psychology (all)", "PSYC", "3200"], ["History and Philosophy of Science", "ARTS", "1207"]], "AuthorData": {"57199313412": {"Name": "Jones K.", "AuthorID": "57199313412", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Infection and Population Health, Centre for Sexual Health and HIV Research, University College London, Mortimer Market Centre"}, "55617668400": {"Name": "Johnson A.", "AuthorID": "55617668400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Infection and Population Health, Centre for Sexual Health and HIV Research, University College London, Mortimer Market Centre"}, "7103014246": {"Name": "Mercer C.", "AuthorID": "7103014246", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Infection and Population Health, Centre for Sexual Health and HIV Research, University College London, Mortimer Market Centre"}, "7202163725": {"Name": "Mitchell K.", "AuthorID": "7202163725", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Social and Environmental Research, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "14020124700": {"Name": "Ploubidis G.", "AuthorID": "14020124700", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Social and Environmental Research, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "7003609534": {"Name": "Wellings K.", "AuthorID": "7003609534", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Social and Environmental Research, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "37116738400": {"Name": "Datta J.", "AuthorID": "37116738400", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Social and Environmental Research, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}}}
