UT-DSAEK (9.5 mm diameter) grafts (n = 7) were prepared, loaded into a commercial device (iGlide; Eurobio, Les Ulis, France), preserved for 4 days at room temperature in transport medium, and analyzed. In a retrospective study, preloaded tissues (n = 39) for clinical use were prepared, transported from Italy to the United Kingdom, and surgically delivered into the eyes of patients undergoing UT-DSAEK. Central and peripheral endothelial cell density (ECD) and viability were measured before and after loading and storage of the grafts in the laboratory study. Clinically, best-corrected visual acuity, ECD before and at final follow-up, dislocation rate, primary graft failure, and surgical time were recorded.Results:In the laboratory study, postcut central graft thickness was 93.3 \u00b1 17.2 m. ECD and cell mortality did not change significantly before and after preservation (P = 0.8). Cell loss after 4 days of preservation was 1.7% \u00b1 1.6%. Clinically, 39 eyes of 39 patients at final follow-up showed a mean central graft thickness of 88 \u00b1 22 m and a best-corrected visual acuity of 0.34 \u00b1 0.24 logMAR. Nine of 39 cases (23%) needed rebubbling, and 28% cell loss was observed at final follow-up.Conclusions:Large-diameter UT-DSAEK grafts can be prepared and preloaded in the eye bank using the iGlide and transported to the surgical center facilitating surgery for patients undergoing UT-DSAEK, potentially reducing tissue wastage, surgical time, and costs related to surgery.", "AuthorKeywords": ["corneal transplant", "endothelial keratoplasty", "precut tissue", "preloaded", "UT-DSAEK"], "IndexKeywords": ["Culture Media", "Descemet Stripping Endothelial Keratoplasty", "Endothelium, Corneal", "Eye Banks", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Fuchs' Endothelial Dystrophy", "Graft Survival", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Operative Time", "Retrospective Studies", "Tissue and Organ Procurement", "Tissue Donors", "Transportation", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85060681044", "SubjectAreas": [["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"]], "AuthorData": {"54795700400": {"Name": "Parekh M.", "AuthorID": "54795700400", "AffiliationID": "60172700", "AffiliationName": "International Center for Ocular Physiopathology, Veneto Eye Bank Foundation"}, "8681862500": {"Name": "Ruzza A.", "AuthorID": "8681862500", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}, "57190211074": {"Name": "Ferrari S.", "AuthorID": "57190211074", "AffiliationID": "60172700", "AffiliationName": "International Center for Ocular Physiopathology, Veneto Eye Bank Foundation"}, "6602818721": {"Name": "Steger B.", "AuthorID": "6602818721", "AffiliationID": "60008222", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, Medical University of Innsbruck"}, "56903927400": {"Name": "Willoughby C.E.", "AuthorID": "56903927400", "AffiliationID": "60020730", "AffiliationName": "School of Biomedical Sciences, Ulster University"}, "57205595650": {"Name": "Rehman S.", "AuthorID": "57205595650", "AffiliationID": "60023925", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, St. Paul's Eye Unit, Royal Liverpool University Hospital"}, "25960336600": {"Name": "Romano V.", "AuthorID": "25960336600", "AffiliationID": "60023925", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, St. Paul's Eye Unit, Royal Liverpool University Hospital"}, "6603422101": {"Name": "Ponzin D.", "AuthorID": "6603422101", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Department of Eye and Vision Science, University of Liverpool"}, "7201931356": {"Name": "Kaye S.B.", "AuthorID": "7201931356", "AffiliationID": "60006793", "AffiliationName": "Instituto Universitario Fernandez-Vega, Universidad de Oviedo and Fundacion de Investigacion on Oftalmologica"}}}
