There are no specific venous thromboembolism prophylaxis guidelines for ENT surgery, despite the bleeding risks associated with ENT surgery and the low incidence of venous thromboembolism. Methods: An online poll of the ENT UK expert panel was conducted on the use of venous thromboembolism prophylaxis. Results: A total of 132 responses were received. Of the respondents, 84.5 per cent routinely assess all of their patients for venous thromboembolism risk. In addition, 75.4 per cent use local health trust guidelines, with the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence being the most common source of national guidelines. There was significant heterogeneity in the use of low molecular weight heparin. Only 53.7 per cent of respondents felt that the guidelines they currently used reflect their practice. Conclusion: There is significant heterogeneity in venous thromboembolism prophylaxis. There is therefore scope for revision of the ENT UK venous thromboembolism prophylaxis guidelines to reflect general ENT practice.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Otolaryngology", "Standards", "Venous Thromboembolism"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Anticoagulants", "Female", "Guideline Adherence", "Heparin, Low-Molecular-Weight", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases", "Otorhinolaryngologic Surgical Procedures", "Postoperative Complications", "Practice Patterns, Physicians'", "Risk Factors", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "Venous Thromboembolism"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84923688063", "SubjectAreas": [["Otorhinolaryngology", "MEDI", "2733"]], "AuthorData": {"35094398700": {"Name": "Nash R.", "AuthorID": "35094398700", "AffiliationID": "60029890", "AffiliationName": "Department of ENT Surgery, Royal National Throat Nose and Ear Hospital"}, "7102086722": {"Name": "Saeed S.", "AuthorID": "7102086722", "AffiliationID": "60029890", "AffiliationName": "Department of ENT Surgery, Royal National Throat Nose and Ear Hospital"}, "57190472468": {"Name": "Randhawa N.", "AuthorID": "57190472468", "AffiliationID": "60029890", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anaesthetics, Royal National Throat Nose and Ear Hospital"}}}
