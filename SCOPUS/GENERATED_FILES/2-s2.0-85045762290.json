First-order statistics and texture feature extraction were performed in 37 patients on both conventional (FLAIR) and mean diffusional kurtosis (MDK) images and recursive feature elimination (RFE) methodology based on SVM was employed to select the most discriminative diagnostic biomarkers. The first-order statistics demonstrated significantly lower MDK values in the IDH-mutant tumors. This resulted in 81.1% accuracy (sensitivity = 0.96, specificity = 0.45, AUC 0.59) for IDH mutation diagnosis. There were non-significant differences in average MDK and skewness among the different tumour grades. When texture analysis and SVM were utilized, the grading accuracy achieved by DKI biomarkers was 78.1% (sensitivity 0.77, specificity 0.79, AUC 0.79); the prediction accuracy for IDH mutation reached 83.8% (sensitivity 0.96, specificity 0.55, AUC 0.87). For the IDH mutation task, DKI outperformed significantly the FLAIR imaging. When using selected biomarkers after RFE, the prediction accuracy achieved 83.8% (sensitivity 0.92, specificity 0.64, AUC 0.88). These findings demonstrate the superiority of DKI enhanced by texture analysis and SVM, compared to conventional imaging, for gliomas staging and prediction of IDH mutational status.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Brain Neoplasms", "Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Female", "Glioma", "Humans", "Isocitrate Dehydrogenase", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Mutation", "Neoplasm Grading", "Support Vector Machine"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85045762290", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"14627355000": {"Name": "Bisdas S.", "AuthorID": "14627355000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Healthcare Engineering, University College London"}, "25936898000": {"Name": "Thust S.", "AuthorID": "25936898000", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Brain Repair and Rehabilitation, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "24391237600": {"Name": "Katsaros V.", "AuthorID": "24391237600", "AffiliationID": "60028900, 60064532", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurosurgery, University of Athens, Evangelismos Hospital"}, "56612599800": {"Name": "Shen H.", "AuthorID": "56612599800", "AffiliationID": "60008877", "AffiliationName": "Computing School of Science and Engineering, University of Dundee"}, "35301402400": {"Name": "Zhang J.", "AuthorID": "35301402400", "AffiliationID": "60008877", "AffiliationName": "Computing School of Science and Engineering, University of Dundee"}, "55913648200": {"Name": "Stranjalis G.", "AuthorID": "55913648200", "AffiliationID": "60028900, 60064532", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurosurgery, University of Athens, Evangelismos Hospital"}, "24460669000": {"Name": "Boskos C.", "AuthorID": "24460669000", "AffiliationID": "60000529", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiation Oncology, Athens Medical Center"}, "7006643850": {"Name": "Brandner S.", "AuthorID": "7006643850", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}}}
