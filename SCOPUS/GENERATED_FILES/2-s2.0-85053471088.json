Methods: Medical records of the patients with SO from UK, Singapore, India were reviewed for history of ocular trauma or surgery and subsequent development of uveitis consistent with SO, presenting symptoms, treatment, and visual outcomes. Results: A total of 130 patients were diagnosed with SO during the study period. Eighty-one (62.3%) patients were men. The mean age was 48.4 \u00b1 15.5 years. The most common presenting symptom was blurring of vision (89.2%), followed by pain (29.2%) and floaters (23.8%). Ninety-two (70.7%) required additional immunosuppressive therapy. Thirty-six (27.9%) patients underwent enucleation of the inciting eye. Conclusions: SO is a potentially sight-threatening disease with high rates of visual loss. It warrants prompt evaluation and treatment. With the advances and availability in immunotherapy, the visual prognosis is relatively good.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Corticosteroids", "enucleation", "immunosuppressive therapy", "phthisis bulbi", "sympathetic ophthalmia", "trauma"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Disease Management", "Eye Enucleation", "Female", "Glucocorticoids", "Humans", "Immunologic Factors", "Immunosuppressive Agents", "Incidence", "India", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Ophthalmia, Sympathetic", "Prognosis", "Retrospective Studies", "Singapore", "United Kingdom", "Visual Acuity", "Vitreoretinal Surgery"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85053471088", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"]], "AuthorData": {"57207408728": {"Name": "Tan X.L.", "AuthorID": "57207408728", "AffiliationID": "60095080", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, National Healthcare Group Eye Institute"}, "57193337979": {"Name": "Ling H.S.", "AuthorID": "57193337979", "AffiliationID": "60095080", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, National Healthcare Group Eye Institute"}, "8318529000": {"Name": "Teoh S.", "AuthorID": "8318529000", "AffiliationID": "60095080", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, National Healthcare Group Eye Institute"}, "7201475180": {"Name": "Agrawal R.", "AuthorID": "7201475180", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital, NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57195480849": {"Name": "Seen S.", "AuthorID": "57195480849", "AffiliationID": "60026680, 60017161", "AffiliationName": "Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore"}, "56922253900": {"Name": "Dutta Majumder P.", "AuthorID": "56922253900", "AffiliationID": "60026060", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Foundation, Sankara Netralaya"}, "7005646126": {"Name": "Ganesh S.K.", "AuthorID": "7005646126", "AffiliationID": "60026060", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Foundation, Sankara Netralaya"}, "20833248100": {"Name": "Agarwal M.", "AuthorID": "20833248100", "AffiliationID": "60026060", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Foundation, Sankara Netralaya"}, "57211774709": {"Name": "Soni A.", "AuthorID": "57211774709", "AffiliationID": "60026060", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Foundation, Sankara Netralaya"}, "7102648244": {"Name": "Biswas J.", "AuthorID": "7102648244", "AffiliationID": "60026060", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Foundation, Sankara Netralaya"}, "57198315222": {"Name": "Aggarwal K.", "AuthorID": "57198315222", "AffiliationID": "60000137", "AffiliationName": "Uveitis Department, Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research"}, "35452834800": {"Name": "Gupta V.", "AuthorID": "35452834800", "AffiliationID": "60000137", "AffiliationName": "Uveitis Department, Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research"}, "16481136500": {"Name": "Mahendradas P.", "AuthorID": "16481136500", "AffiliationID": "122223743", "AffiliationName": "Uveitis and Ocular Immunology, Narayana Nethralaya"}, "7003495942": {"Name": "Pavesio C.", "AuthorID": "7003495942", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital, NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
