Deficiency of either ICMT or NOT CH1 accelerates pancreatic neoplasia in Pdx1-Cre;LSL-KrasG12D mice, suggesting that ICMT is required for NOT CH signaling. We used Drosophila melanogaster wing vein and scutellar bristle development to screen Rab proteins predicted to be substrates for ICMT (ste14 in flies). We identified Rab7 and Rab8 as ICMT substrates that when silenced phenocopy ste14 deficiency. ICMT, RAB7, and RAB8 were all required for efficient NOT CH1 signaling in mammalian cells. Overexpression of RAB8 rescued NOT CH activation after ICMT knockdown both in U2OS cells expressing NOT CH1 and in fly wing vein development. ICMT deficiency induced mislocalization of GFP-RAB7 and GFP-RAB8 from endomembrane to cytosol, enhanced binding to RAB GDI, and decreased GTP loading of RAB7 and RAB8. Deficiency of ICMT, RAB7, or RAB8 led to mislocalization and diminished processing of NOT CH1-GFP. Thus, NOT CH signaling requires ICMT in part because it requires methylated RAB7 and RAB8.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Alkyl and Aryl Transferases", "Animals", "Cell Line, Tumor", "Drosophila melanogaster", "Drosophila Proteins", "Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic", "Genes, Reporter", "Green Fluorescent Proteins", "GTP Phosphohydrolases", "Guanine Nucleotide Dissociation Inhibitors", "Guanosine Triphosphate", "Homeodomain Proteins", "Humans", "Methylation", "Mice", "Osteoblasts", "Protein Methyltransferases", "Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras)", "rab GTP-Binding Proteins", "Receptor, Notch1", "Signal Transduction", "Trans-Activators", "Wings, Animal"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85037697094", "SubjectAreas": [["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"56694840300": {"Name": "Court H.", "AuthorID": "56694840300", "AffiliationID": "60024541, 60032105", "AffiliationName": "Perlmutter Cancer Center, New York University School of Medicine"}, "6505914069": {"Name": "Ahearn I.M.", "AuthorID": "6505914069", "AffiliationID": "60024541, 60032105", "AffiliationName": "Perlmutter Cancer Center, New York University School of Medicine"}, "7005857928": {"Name": "Bach E.A.", "AuthorID": "7005857928", "AffiliationID": "60024541, 60032105", "AffiliationName": "Perlmutter Cancer Center, New York University School of Medicine"}, "7004908090": {"Name": "Philips M.R.", "AuthorID": "7004908090", "AffiliationID": "60024541, 60032105", "AffiliationName": "Perlmutter Cancer Center, New York University School of Medicine"}, "6508153062": {"Name": "Amoyel M.", "AuthorID": "6508153062", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "School of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, University of Bristol"}}}
