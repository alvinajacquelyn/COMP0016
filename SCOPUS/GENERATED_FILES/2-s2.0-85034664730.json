All rights reserved.Nourishing and providing the (human) body with the essential nutrition is the central role of any food, but a continuing debate centers on health benefits of some foods and risks of others. (Herbal) Medicines, on the other hand, are used with a specific therapeutic goal in mind, that is, they not only are therapeutic by function but also are presented as having a medicinal role. This is embedded in the respective regulatory frameworks of the countries (or regions) where the products are used.This interface between food and medicine is explored not only in the context of using products sold commercially but also in a globalized context with regards to links between local (traditional) uses of species and their development into global foods or herbal medicines. Such local resources have a very different, culturally defined role and the confusion that exists about the borderlines between foods (supplements) and (herbal) medicines is linked, most importantly, to the commercial framework they are under.
