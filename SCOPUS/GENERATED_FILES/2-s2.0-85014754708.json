Although neurophysiological and imaging studies show an involvement of the somatosensory cortex (SI) during action observation and execution, it is unclear whether SI is essential for understanding the somatosensory aspects of observed actions. To address this issue, we used off-line transcranial magnetic continuous theta-burst stimulation (cTBS) just before a weight judgment task. Participants observed the right hand of an actor lifting a box and estimated its relative weight. In counterbalanced sessions, we delivered sham and active cTBS over the hand region of the left SI and, to test anatomical specificity, over the left motor cortex (M1) and the left superior parietal lobule (SPL). Active cTBS over SI, but not over M1 or SPL, impaired task performance relative to sham cTBS. Moreover, active cTBS delivered over SI just before participants were asked to evaluate the weight of a bouncing ball did not alter performance compared to sham cTBS. These findings indicate that SI is critical for extracting somatosensory features (heavy/light) from observed action kinematics and suggest a prominent role of SI in action understanding.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Action observation", "Causality", "Somatosensory cortex (SI)", "Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)", "Weight lifting"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Biomechanical Phenomena", "Female", "Humans", "Judgment", "Male", "Motion Perception", "Motor Cortex", "Somatosensory Cortex", "Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation", "Weight Perception", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85014754708", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"]], "AuthorData": {"26031825600": {"Name": "Valchev N.", "AuthorID": "26031825600", "AffiliationID": "60005455", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, Yale University"}, "8272521300": {"Name": "Gazzola V.", "AuthorID": "8272521300", "AffiliationID": "60002483", "AffiliationName": "Brain and Cognition, Department of Psychology, University of Amsterdam"}, "46261708700": {"Name": "Tidoni E.", "AuthorID": "46261708700", "AffiliationID": "60014416", "AffiliationName": "IRCSS Fondazione Santa Lucia"}, "9742712000": {"Name": "Avenanti A.", "AuthorID": "9742712000", "AffiliationID": "60014416", "AffiliationName": "IRCSS Fondazione Santa Lucia"}, "38060964400": {"Name": "Hamilton A.F.d.C.", "AuthorID": "38060964400", "AffiliationID": "60109771, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, University College London"}}}
