Experimental Design: Patientswith metastatic NENs commencing therapy were prospectively recruited (n = 138). Blood samples were obtained for evaluation of CTCs using the CellSearch platform and for chromogranin A (CgA) at baseline, three to five (median, 4.3) weeks and 10 to 15 (median 13.7) weeks after commencing therapy. Radiologic response and OS data were collected. Results: There was a significant association between first posttreatment CTC count and progressive disease (PD; P < 0.001). Only 8% of patients with a favorable \"CTC response\" (0 CTCs at baseline and 0 at first posttreatment time-point; or \u226550% reduction from baseline) had PD compared with 60% in the unfavorable group (<50% reduction or increase). Changes in CTCs were strongly associated with OS (P < 0.001), the best prognostic group being patients with 0 CTCs before and after therapy; followed by those with \u226550% reduction in CTCs [hazard ratio (HR), 3.31]; with those with a <50% reduction or increase in CTCs (HR, 5.07) having the worst outcome. In multivariate analysis, changes in CTCs had the strongest association with OS (HR, 4.13; P = 0.0002). Changes in CgA were not significantly associated with survival. Conclusions: Changes in CTCs are associated with response to treatment and OS in metastatic NENs, suggesting CTCs may be useful as surrogate markers to direct clinical decision making.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Biomarkers, Tumor", "Chromogranin A", "Combined Modality Therapy", "Disease Progression", "Female", "Humans", "Kaplan-Meier Estimate", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Neoplasm Grading", "Neoplasm Metastasis", "Neoplastic Cells, Circulating", "Neuroendocrine Tumors", "Prognosis", "Proportional Hazards Models", "Treatment Outcome", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84954440270", "SubjectAreas": [["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Cancer Research", "BIOC", "1306"]], "AuthorData": {"8378150500": {"Name": "Khan M.S.", "AuthorID": "8378150500", "AffiliationID": "60000020, 60138351", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gastroenterology, University Hospital of Wales, Cardiff and Vale University Hospital Board"}, "23994713600": {"Name": "Tsigani T.", "AuthorID": "23994713600", "AffiliationID": "60109234, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Cancer Institute, University College London"}, "35080753100": {"Name": "Lowe H.", "AuthorID": "35080753100", "AffiliationID": "60109234, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Cancer Institute, University College London"}, "55621232700": {"Name": "Goldstein R.", "AuthorID": "55621232700", "AffiliationID": "60109234, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Cancer Institute, University College London"}, "35599970900": {"Name": "Hartley J.A.", "AuthorID": "35599970900", "AffiliationID": "60109234, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Cancer Institute, University College London"}, "57199899475": {"Name": "Meyer T.", "AuthorID": "57199899475", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Department of Oncology, Royal Free Hospital"}, "55908628800": {"Name": "Caplin M.E.", "AuthorID": "55908628800", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Neuroendocrine Tumour Unit, Department of Gastroenterology, Royal Free Hospital"}, "35933380400": {"Name": "Kirkwood A.A.", "AuthorID": "35933380400", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60012754", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Research UK, UCL Cancer Trials Centre"}}}
