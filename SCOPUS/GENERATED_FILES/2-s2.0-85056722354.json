Patients and methods: This study includes 5407 men and women from a British population-based cohort, the Whitehall II study of civil servants, who self-reported alcohol consumption by questionnaire over approximately 30 years (1985\u20131989 through to 2012\u20132013). Drinking typologies during midlife were linked to measures of fatty liver (the fatty liver index, FLI) when participants were in older age (age range 60\u201384 years) and adjusted for age, socio-economic position, ethnicity, and smoking. Results: Those who consistently drank heavily had two-fold higher odds of increased FLI compared to stable low-risk moderate drinkers after adjustment for covariates (men: OR = 2.04, 95%CI = 1.53\u20132.74; women: OR = 2.24, 95%CI = 1.08\u20134.55). Former drinkers also had an increased FLI compared to low-risk drinkers (men: OR = 2.09, 95%CI = 1.55\u20132.85; women: OR = 1.68, 95%CI = 1.08\u20132.67). There were non-significant differences in FLI between non-drinkers and stable low-risk drinkers. Among women, there was no increased risk for current heavy drinkers in cross sectional analyses. Conclusion: Drinking habits among adults during midlife affect the development of fatty liver, and sustained heavy drinking is associated with an increased FLI compared to stable low-risk drinkers. After the exclusion of former drinkers, there was no difference between non-drinkers and low-risk drinkers, which does not support a protective effect on fatty liver from low-risk drinking. Cross-sectional analyses among women did not find an increased risk of heavy drinking compared to low-risk drinkers, thus highlighting the need to take a longitudinal approach.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alcohol", "Cohort", "Fatty liver", "Longitudinal"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Alcohol Drinking", "Cohort Studies", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Fatty Liver, Alcoholic", "Female", "Humans", "London", "Longitudinal Studies", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Population Surveillance", "Risk Factors", "Self Report", "Smoking", "Time Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85056722354", "SubjectAreas": [["Toxicology", "PHAR", "3005"], ["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"20133865900": {"Name": "Britton A.", "AuthorID": "20133865900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "55212366100": {"Name": "Mehta G.", "AuthorID": "55212366100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Liver and Digestive Health, University College London"}, "57203534931": {"Name": "O'Neill D.", "AuthorID": "57203534931", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Social Science, Institute of Education, University College London"}, "55621388300": {"Name": "Bell S.", "AuthorID": "55621388300", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Public Health and Primary Care, University of Cambridge"}}}
