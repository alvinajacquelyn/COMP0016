OLFM2 encodes a secreted glycoprotein belonging to the noelin family of olfactomedin domain-containing proteins that modulate the timing of neuronal differentiation during development. OLFM2 SNPs have been associated with open angle glaucoma in a case\u2013control study, and knockdown of Olfm2 in zebrafish results in reduced eye size. From a cohort of 258 individuals with developmental eye anomalies, we identified two with heterozygous variants in OLFM2: an individual with bilateral microphthalmia carrying a de novo 19p13.2 microdeletion involving OLFM2 and a second individual with unilateral microphthalmia and contralateral coloboma who had a novel single base change in the 5\u2032 untranslated region. Dual luciferase assays demonstrated that the latter variant causes a significant decrease in expression of OLFM2. Furthermore, RNA in situ hybridisation experiments using human developmental tissue revealed expression in relevant structures, including the lens vesicle and optic cup. Our study indicates that OLFM2 is likely to be important in mammalian eye development and disease and should be considered as a gene for human ocular anomalies.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Cell Line, Tumor", "Cohort Studies", "Extracellular Matrix Proteins", "Eye", "Eye Abnormalities", "Eye Proteins", "Gene Deletion", "Gene Expression Regulation", "Glaucoma, Open-Angle", "Glycoproteins", "High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing", "Humans", "Infant", "Male", "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84995474891", "SubjectAreas": [["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Genetics (clinical)", "MEDI", "2716"]], "AuthorData": {"7402085399": {"Name": "Holt R.", "AuthorID": "7402085399", "AffiliationID": "60014564", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Health and Life Sciences, Oxford Brookes University"}, "57191965345": {"Name": "Bax D.A.", "AuthorID": "57191965345", "AffiliationID": "60014564", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Health and Life Sciences, Oxford Brookes University"}, "56013199200": {"Name": "Broadgate S.", "AuthorID": "56013199200", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Nuffield Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Oxford"}, "57191969294": {"Name": "Zhang Y.", "AuthorID": "57191969294", "AffiliationID": "60014564", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Health and Life Sciences, Oxford Brookes University"}, "57189763428": {"Name": "Ragge N.", "AuthorID": "57189763428", "AffiliationID": "60015857", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Genetics Unit, West Midlands Regional Genetics Service, Birmingham Women\u2019s Hospital"}, "56646536900": {"Name": "Ugur Iseri S.A.", "AuthorID": "56646536900", "AffiliationID": "60028502", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genetics, Aziz Sancar Institute of Experimental Medicine, Istanbul University"}, "23480739400": {"Name": "Wyatt A.W.", "AuthorID": "23480739400", "AffiliationID": "60010365", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urologic Sciences, University of British Columbia"}, "57189336042": {"Name": "Gold Diaz D.", "AuthorID": "57189336042", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Developmental Biology & Cancer Programme, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "57189336087": {"Name": "Santos C.", "AuthorID": "57189336087", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Developmental Biology & Cancer Programme, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "6602741505": {"Name": "Gerrelli D.", "AuthorID": "6602741505", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Developmental Biology & Cancer Programme, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "57220719987": {"Name": "Dunn R.", "AuthorID": "57220719987", "AffiliationID": "60009797", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genetics, Viapath, Guy\u2019s Hospital"}, "57191968801": {"Name": "Bruty J.", "AuthorID": "57191968801", "AffiliationID": "60015857", "AffiliationName": "West Midlands Regional Genetics Laboratory, Birmingham Women\u2019s Hospital"}, "6602861629": {"Name": "Wallis Y.", "AuthorID": "6602861629", "AffiliationID": "60015857", "AffiliationName": "West Midlands Regional Genetics Laboratory, Birmingham Women\u2019s Hospital"}, "7005814704": {"Name": "McMullan D.", "AuthorID": "7005814704", "AffiliationID": "60015857", "AffiliationName": "West Midlands Regional Genetics Laboratory, Birmingham Women\u2019s Hospital"}, "55666395200": {"Name": "Ogilvie C.", "AuthorID": "55666395200", "AffiliationID": "60005518", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cytogenetics"}}}
