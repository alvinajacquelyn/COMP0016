We show that the anti-aging effects of rapamycin and reduced intestinal insulin/insulin growth factor (IGF) signaling (IIS) require the Drosophila FoxA transcription factor homolog Fork Head (FKH). Intestinal FKH induction extends lifespan, highlighting a role for the gut. FKH binds to and is phosphorylated by AKT and Target of Rapamycin. Gut-specific FKH upregulation improves gut barrier function in aged flies. Additionally, it increases the expression of nutrient transporters, as does lowered IIS. Evolutionary conservation of this effect of lowered IIS is suggested by the upregulation of related nutrient transporters in insulin receptor substrate 1 knockout mouse intestine. Our study highlights a critical role played by FKH in the gut in mediating anti-aging effects of reduced IIS. Malnutrition caused by poor intestinal absorption is a major problem in the elderly, and a better understanding of the mechanisms involved will have important therapeutic implications for human aging. Bolukbasi et al. identify the transcription factor FKH as a mediator of nutrient-sensing pathway signaling in Drosophila, and they characterize FKH's essential involvement in increased longevity via this network. They pinpoint FKH's pro-longevity effect to the gut, and they show increased expression of nutrient transporters and improvement of barrier function by FKH activity.", "AuthorKeywords": ["absorption", "Drosophila", "enterocytes", "FOXA", "insulin", "lifespan", "longevity", "midgut"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Caloric Restriction", "Cell Differentiation", "Cell Nucleus", "Drosophila melanogaster", "Drosophila Proteins", "Enterocytes", "Female", "Food", "Forkhead Transcription Factors", "Insulin", "Insulin Receptor Substrate Proteins", "Intestinal Absorption", "Intestines", "Longevity", "Membrane Transport Proteins", "Nuclear Proteins", "Oxidative Stress", "Phosphorylation", "Protein Binding", "Protein Transport", "Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt", "Sirolimus", "Somatomedins", "Transcription, Genetic", "Up-Regulation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85032009977", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"51863231600": {"Name": "Bolukbasi E.", "AuthorID": "51863231600", "AffiliationID": "60103814", "AffiliationName": "Max Planck Institute for Biology of Ageing"}, "56288257100": {"Name": "Khericha M.", "AuthorID": "56288257100", "AffiliationID": "60103814", "AffiliationName": "Max Planck Institute for Biology of Ageing"}, "54393975600": {"Name": "Regan J.", "AuthorID": "54393975600", "AffiliationID": "60103814", "AffiliationName": "Max Planck Institute for Biology of Ageing"}, "57193795398": {"Name": "Adcott J.", "AuthorID": "57193795398", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Healthy Ageing, Department of Genetics, Evolution and Environment, University College London"}, "57196147546": {"Name": "Dyson M.", "AuthorID": "57196147546", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Healthy Ageing, Department of Genetics, Evolution and Environment, University College London"}, "6602213773": {"Name": "Alic N.", "AuthorID": "6602213773", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Healthy Ageing, Department of Genetics, Evolution and Environment, University College London"}, "57202667589": {"Name": "Partridge L.", "AuthorID": "57202667589", "AffiliationID": "60103814", "AffiliationName": "Max Planck Institute for Biology of Ageing"}, "55484936500": {"Name": "Nespital T.", "AuthorID": "55484936500", "AffiliationID": "60103814", "AffiliationName": "Max Planck Institute for Biology of Ageing"}, "14041782900": {"Name": "Ivanov D.", "AuthorID": "14041782900", "AffiliationID": "60022106, 60008380, 60026124", "AffiliationName": "European Molecular Biology Laboratory, European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI), Wellcome Trust Genome Campus"}, "7402781853": {"Name": "Thornton J.", "AuthorID": "7402781853", "AffiliationID": "60022106, 60008380, 60026124", "AffiliationName": "European Molecular Biology Laboratory, European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI), Wellcome Trust Genome Campus"}}}
