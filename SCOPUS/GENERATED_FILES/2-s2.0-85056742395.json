Algorithms are described for detecting appearance anomalies of shape, texture, and density, and semantic anomalies of object category presence. The anomalies are detected on the basis of representations extracted from a convolutional neural network pre-Trained to identify object categories in photographs, from the final pooling layer for appearance anomalies, and from the logit layer for semantic anomalies. The distribution of representations in normal data is modeled using high-dimensional, full-covariance, Gaussians, and anomalies are scored according to their likelihood relative to those models. The algorithms are tested on X-ray parcel images using stream-of-commerce data as the normal class, and parcels with firearms present the examples of anomalies to be detected. Despite the representations being learned for photographic images and the varied contents of stream-of-commerce parcels, the system, trained on stream-of-commerce images only, is able to detect 90% of firearms as anomalies, while raising false alarms on 18% of stream-of-commerce.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Anomaly detection", "object categorization", "security imaging", "threat detection", "X-ray imaging"], "IndexKeywords": ["Anomaly detection", "Computational model", "Object categorization", "Security", "Security imaging", "Streaming media", "Threat detection", "Xray imaging"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85056742395", "SubjectAreas": [["Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality", "ENGI", "2213"], ["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"]], "AuthorData": {"7102753156": {"Name": "Griffin L.", "AuthorID": "7102753156", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "57199844042": {"Name": "Caldwell M.", "AuthorID": "57199844042", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "57195068529": {"Name": "Andrews J.", "AuthorID": "57195068529", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "57204690724": {"Name": "Bohler H.", "AuthorID": "57204690724", "AffiliationID": "122180679", "AffiliationName": "Spacemaker"}}}
