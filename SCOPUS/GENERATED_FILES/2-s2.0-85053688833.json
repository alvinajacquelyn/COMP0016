Published by Oxford University Press.Mutations in leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) segregate with familial Parkinson's disease (PD) and genetic variation around LRRK2 contributes to risk of sporadic disease. Although knockout (KO) of Lrrk2 or knock-in of pathogenic mutations into the mouse germline does not result in a PD phenotype, several defects have been reported in the kidneys of Lrrk2 KO mice. To understand LRRK2 function in vivo, we used an unbiased approach to determine which protein pathways are affected in LRRK2 KO kidneys. We nominated changes in cytoskeletal-associated proteins, lysosomal proteases, proteins involved in vesicular trafficking and in control of protein translation. Changes were not seen in mice expressing the pathogenic G2019S LRRK2 mutation. Using cultured epithelial kidney cells, we replicated the accumulation of lysosomal proteases and demonstrated changes in subcellular distribution of the cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate receptor. These results show that loss of LRRK2 leads to co-ordinated responses in protein translation and trafficking and argue against a dominant negative role for the G2019S mutation.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Disease Models, Animal", "Epithelial Cells", "Gene Expression Regulation", "Humans", "Kidney", "Leucine-Rich Repeat Serine-Threonine Protein Kinase-2", "Mice", "Mice, Knockout", "Mutation", "Parkinson Disease", "Phenotype", "Protein Biosynthesis", "Proteolysis", "Proteomics", "Receptor, IGF Type 2", "Signal Transduction"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85053688833", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Genetics (clinical)", "MEDI", "2716"]], "AuthorData": {"57191074830": {"Name": "Pellegrini L.", "AuthorID": "57191074830", "AffiliationID": "60016379, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacology, UCL School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "37037401600": {"Name": "Hauser D.N.", "AuthorID": "37037401600", "AffiliationID": "60006577", "AffiliationName": "Cell Biology and Gene Expression Section, Laboratory of Neurogenetics, National Institute of Aging, National Institutes of Health"}, "27467539800": {"Name": "Mamais A.", "AuthorID": "27467539800", "AffiliationID": "60006577", "AffiliationName": "Cell Biology and Gene Expression Section, Laboratory of Neurogenetics, National Institute of Aging, National Institutes of Health"}, "6507543969": {"Name": "Beilina A.", "AuthorID": "6507543969", "AffiliationID": "60006577", "AffiliationName": "Cell Biology and Gene Expression Section, Laboratory of Neurogenetics, National Institute of Aging, National Institutes of Health"}, "21834356900": {"Name": "Kumaran R.", "AuthorID": "21834356900", "AffiliationID": "60006577", "AffiliationName": "Cell Biology and Gene Expression Section, Laboratory of Neurogenetics, National Institute of Aging, National Institutes of Health"}, "57189748019": {"Name": "Heaton G.", "AuthorID": "57189748019", "AffiliationID": "60016379, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacology, UCL School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "56422366100": {"Name": "Alkaslasi M.", "AuthorID": "56422366100", "AffiliationID": "60006577", "AffiliationName": "Cell Biology and Gene Expression Section, Laboratory of Neurogenetics, National Institute of Aging, National Institutes of Health"}, "57203936193": {"Name": "Ivanina N.", "AuthorID": "57203936193", "AffiliationID": "60006577", "AffiliationName": "Cell Biology and Gene Expression Section, Laboratory of Neurogenetics, National Institute of Aging, National Institutes of Health"}, "7006533543": {"Name": "Cookson M.R.", "AuthorID": "7006533543", "AffiliationID": "60006577", "AffiliationName": "Cell Biology and Gene Expression Section, Laboratory of Neurogenetics, National Institute of Aging, National Institutes of Health"}, "55337990400": {"Name": "Wetzel A.", "AuthorID": "55337990400", "AffiliationID": "60016379, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacology, UCL School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "57188567996": {"Name": "Nixon-Abell J.", "AuthorID": "57188567996", "AffiliationID": "60013780, 60006577", "AffiliationName": "Neurogenetics Branch, National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke - National Institutes of Health"}, "7102029918": {"Name": "Harvey K.", "AuthorID": "7102029918", "AffiliationID": "60016379, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacology, UCL School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "55959808500": {"Name": "Li Y.", "AuthorID": "55959808500", "AffiliationID": "60013780, 60006577", "AffiliationName": "Mass-spetrometry Facility, National Institute of Neurological Diseases and Stroke, National Institutes of Health"}, "36797557300": {"Name": "Rudenko I.", "AuthorID": "36797557300", "AffiliationID": "60101642, 60026415", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, SUNY at Stony Brook, Health Science Center, T12-020"}, "7801449320": {"Name": "Melrose H.L.", "AuthorID": "7801449320", "AffiliationID": "60002333", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Mayo Clinic Jacksonville"}}}
