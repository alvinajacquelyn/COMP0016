A consensus statement on the essential elements of the communication curriculum was co-produced in 2008 by the communication leads of UK medical schools. This paper discusses the relational, contextual and technological changes which have affected clinical communication since then and presents an updated curriculum for communication in undergraduate medicine. Method: The consensus was developed through an iterative consultation process with the communication leads who represent their medical schools on the UK Council of Clinical Communication in Undergraduate Medical Education. Results: The updated curriculum defines the underpinning values, core components and skills required within the context of contemporary medical care. It incorporates the evolving relational issues associated with the more prominent role of the patient in the consultation, reflected through legal precedent and changing societal expectations. The impact on clinical communication of the increased focus on patient safety, the professional duty of candour and digital medicine are discussed. Conclusion: Changes in the way medicine is practised should lead rapidly to adjustments to the content of curricula. Practice implications: The updated curriculum provides a model of best practice to help medical schools develop their teaching and argue for resources.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Communication", "Curriculum", "Undergraduate medical education"], "IndexKeywords": ["Communication", "Consensus", "Curriculum", "Education, Medical, Undergraduate", "Humans", "Patient-Centered Care", "Schools, Medical", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85046147697", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"7005553699": {"Name": "Noble L.M.", "AuthorID": "7005553699", "AffiliationID": "60029950, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Medical School, University College London"}, "12808012700": {"Name": "Scott-Smith W.", "AuthorID": "12808012700", "AffiliationID": "60100018", "AffiliationName": "Division of Medical Education, Brighton & Sussex Medical School"}, "10439515200": {"Name": "O'Neill B.", "AuthorID": "10439515200", "AffiliationID": "60177635", "AffiliationName": "School of Medical Education, King's College London"}, "56001030700": {"Name": "Salisbury H.", "AuthorID": "56001030700", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Nuffield Department of Primary Care Health Sciences, University of Oxford"}, "null": {"Name": null, "AuthorID": null, "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
