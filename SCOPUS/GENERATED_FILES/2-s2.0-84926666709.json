Hypervitaminosis A has been associated with hypercalcemia. In this study we compared dietary vitamin A intake with serum retinoid levels and their associations with hypercalcemia. Methods We studied the relationship between vitamin A intake, serum retinoid levels, and serum calcium in 105 children with CKD stages 2-5 on dialysis and posttransplant. Serum retinoid measures included retinol (ROH), its active retinoic acid (RA) metabolites [all-trans RA (at-RA) and 13-cis RA] and carrier proteins [retinol-binding protein-4 (RBP4) and transthyretin (TTR)]. Dietary vitamin A intake was assessed using a food diary. Results Twenty-five children were in CKD 2-3, 35 in CKD 4-5, 23 on dialysis and 22 posttransplant; 53%had vitamin A intake above the Reference Nutrient Intake (RNI) value. Children receiving supplemental feeds compared with diet alone had higher vitamin A intake (p=0.02) and higher serum ROH (p<0.001). Notably, increased ROH was seen as early as CKD stage 2. For every 10 ml/min/1.73 m2 fall in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), there was a 13 % increase in ROH. RBP4 levels were increased in CKD 3-5 and dialysis patients. The lowest ratios of ROH:RBP4 were seen in dialysis compared with CKD 2-3 (p=0.03), suggesting a relative increase in circulating RBP4. Serum ROH, RBP4 and at-RA were associated with serum calcium. On multivariable analysis RBP4 levels and alfacalcidol dose were significant predictors of serum calcium (model R2 32 %) in dialysis patients. Conclusions Hypervitaminosis A is seen in early CKD, with highest levels in children on supplemental feeds compared with diet alone. Serum retinoid levels significantly predict hypercalcemia.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Children", "Hypercalcemia", "Retinol", "Retinol binding protein 4 (RBP4)", "Vitamin A"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid", "Diet", "Female", "Humans", "Hypercalcemia", "Hypervitaminosis A", "Infant", "Male", "Renal Insufficiency, Chronic"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84926666709", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Nephrology", "MEDI", "2727"]], "AuthorData": {"56320400200": {"Name": "Manickavasagar B.", "AuthorID": "56320400200", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Dietetics, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7003372342": {"Name": "Shaw V.", "AuthorID": "7003372342", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Dietetics, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7402428791": {"Name": "Dixon M.", "AuthorID": "7402428791", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Dietetics, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}, "36987158100": {"Name": "O'Connor G.", "AuthorID": "36987158100", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Dietetics, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}, "55555624600": {"Name": "McArdle A.J.", "AuthorID": "55555624600", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Nephrology, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}, "55535515000": {"Name": "Yadav P.", "AuthorID": "55535515000", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Nephrology, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}, "16146771300": {"Name": "Rees L.", "AuthorID": "16146771300", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Nephrology, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}, "6603058496": {"Name": "Ledermann S.", "AuthorID": "6603058496", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Nephrology, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7004098195": {"Name": "van't Hoff W.", "AuthorID": "7004098195", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Nephrology, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}, "22956754100": {"Name": "Shroff R.", "AuthorID": "22956754100", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Nephrology, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7005198654": {"Name": "Blomhoff R.", "AuthorID": "7005198654", "AffiliationID": "60010348", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nutrition, University of Oslo"}}}
