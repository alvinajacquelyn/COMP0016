The calculated value of the A solute descriptor (e.g. A = 0) indicates that the two dihydroxyanthraquinones cannot act as hydrogen-bond donors in their interactions with surrounding solvent molecules. Strong intramolecular hydrogen bonding between the hydrogen of the \u2013OH functional groups and the oxygen atom of the neighbouring aromatic carbonyl group is believed to be the reason for the molecules\u2019 inability to serve as a hydrogen-bond donor.", "AuthorKeywords": ["14-Dihydroxyanthraquinone", "18-dihydroxyanthraquinone", "Abraham model solute descriptors", "intramolecular hydrogen bonding"], "IndexKeywords": ["14-Dihydroxyanthraquinone", "18-dihydroxyanthraquinone", "Aromatic carbonyl", "Calculated values", "Hydrogen bond donors", "Intramolecular hydrogen bonding", "Solute descriptors", "Solvent molecules"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85035082693", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"], ["Materials Chemistry", "MATE", "2505"]], "AuthorData": {"35496753700": {"Name": "Acree W.", "AuthorID": "35496753700", "AffiliationID": "60024438", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of North Texas"}, "57197827367": {"Name": "Smart K.", "AuthorID": "57197827367", "AffiliationID": "60024438", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of North Texas"}, "7202901240": {"Name": "Abraham M.", "AuthorID": "7202901240", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}}}
