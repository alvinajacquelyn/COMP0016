Several factors hamper the use of current available catechol-O-methyl transferase inhibitors, that is, the moderate efficacy and multiple dosing for entacapone and the risk of liver toxicity with tolcapone. Opicapone, a new long-acting, peripherally selective, once-daily catechol-O-methyl transferase inhibitor, was recently licensed in Europe. Two phase 3 double-blind clinical trials demonstrated opicapone efficacy in reducing OFF time by an average of about 60 minutes daily compared with placebo, without increasing ON time with troublesome dyskinesias. These effects were also maintained during a subsequent open-label extension consisting of 1-year follow-up. Opicapone showed a good safety profile. From June 2016, Opicapone received the approval for marketing authorization from the European Commission as adjunctive therapy to levodopa/DOPA decarboxylase inhibitors in patients with PD and end-of-dose motor fluctuations. We aimed to review the clinical pharmacological data of opicapone, summarize its clinical efficacy and safety issues, and discuss its potential role in the management of Parkinson's disease. \u00a9 2018 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.", "AuthorKeywords": ["advanced stage", "COMT inhibitor", "motor fluctuations", "opicapone", "Parkinson's disease"], "IndexKeywords": ["Antiparkinson Agents", "Catechol O-Methyltransferase Inhibitors", "Humans", "Levodopa", "Oxadiazoles", "Parkinson Disease"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85053872326", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"26649410400": {"Name": "Fabbri M.", "AuthorID": "26649410400", "AffiliationID": "60021283", "AffiliationName": "Instituto de Medicina Molecular"}, "57201370983": {"Name": "Ferreira J.J.", "AuthorID": "57201370983", "AffiliationID": "118350759", "AffiliationName": "CNS \u2013 Campus Neurol\u00f3gico S\u00e9nior"}, "57208252964": {"Name": "Lees A.", "AuthorID": "57208252964", "AffiliationID": "60020736", "AffiliationName": "The National Hospital"}, "7005546848": {"Name": "Stocchi F.", "AuthorID": "7005546848", "AffiliationID": "60032350, 60103767", "AffiliationName": "University and Institute for Research and Medical Care, IRCCS San Raffaele"}, "35373337300": {"Name": "Poewe W.", "AuthorID": "35373337300", "AffiliationID": "60008222", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Innsbruck Medical University"}, "35392145900": {"Name": "Tolosa E.", "AuthorID": "35392145900", "AffiliationID": "60030315, 60085102, 60010814", "AffiliationName": "Movement Disorder Unit, Neurology Service, Hospital Cl\u00ednic of Barcelona, IDIBAPS, CIBERNED"}, "7102349431": {"Name": "Rascol O.", "AuthorID": "7102349431", "AffiliationID": "60027245, 60024960, 60000905", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Clinical Pharmacology and Neurosciences, Clinical Investigation Center CIC 1436, NS-Park/FCRIN network and NeuroToul COEN Center, INSERM, CHU de Toulouse, Universit\u00e9 de Toulouse 3"}}}
