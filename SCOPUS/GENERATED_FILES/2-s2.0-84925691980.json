We proceed by paying attention to specific examples of interview talk on the experience of absence via the collecting of narratives from families of missing people. We highlight how ambiguous emotions are bound up with broader ways of recognizing such talk, largely exercised here as reflections on what is involved in witnessing those who are missing in communications with police. Tensions that may be produced by official ways of regarding and responding to family character witness of the missing are discussed in the context of two case studies. In response to these tensions, we offer suggestions for finding different spaces through which to value such \u2018witness talk\u2019 by families, particularly via ideas from grief scholarship. The paper concludes by briefly reflecting on how interviewing encounters might produce versions of praxis in which the content of talk is not just, and simply, \u2018apprehended\u2019 as academic evidence.", "AuthorKeywords": ["families of missing people", "interview", "police search", "talk", "witness"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84925691980", "SubjectAreas": [["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"], ["Cultural Studies", "SOCI", "3316"], ["Environmental Science (miscellaneous)", "ENVI", "2301"]], "AuthorData": {"6603906892": {"Name": "Parr H.", "AuthorID": "6603906892", "AffiliationID": "60001490", "AffiliationName": "Glasgow University"}, "36785569300": {"Name": "Stevenson O.", "AuthorID": "36785569300", "AffiliationID": "60001490", "AffiliationName": "Glasgow University"}}}
