In vocabulary acquisition research the majority of studies have focused on the acquisition of the form and meaning of new words but research into the teaching conditions leading to the improvement of speed of lexical access is still scarce. This article reports results of two studies which explored the effectiveness of two vocabulary teaching approaches for the development of speed and automaticity of lexical access by learners of Spanish as a foreign language. Participants in Study 1 were exposed to the target vocabulary in reading passages (incidental approach), while participants in Study 2 were exposed to the target words in explicit vocabulary activities (explicit approach). A pre- and post-treatment lexical decision task assessed participants\u2019 speed of lexical access. Two indicators of improved lexical access were examined: faster reaction times (RTs) and a decrease in the coefficient of variation (CV), i.e., automaticity measure. Results showed that both types of treatment led to faster speed of lexical access, while only the explicit treatment led to automatic processing. The effect of repetition was also explored and results showed that there was no clear, significant effect of the number of repetitions on the development of speed and automaticity of lexical access. Taken together, the type and amount of vocabulary learning activities in these studies give an initial indication of the minimum amount of vocabulary engagement which may lead to significant improvement in learners\u2019 speed and automaticity of lexical access.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Automaticity", "Explicit teaching", "Incidental learning", "Lexical access", "Reading", "Vocabulary learning"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85028057021", "SubjectAreas": [["Language and Linguistics", "ARTS", "1203"], ["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["Linguistics and Language", "SOCI", "3310"]], "AuthorData": {"55387804200": {"Name": "Pellicer-S\u00e1nchez A.", "AuthorID": "55387804200", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "University of Nottingham"}}}
