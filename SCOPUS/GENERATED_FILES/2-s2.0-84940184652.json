Here we report on microdomain formation in isolated, detergent-resistant membranes from MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells, studied by atomic force microscopy (AFM). Whereas microdomains were readily observed at room temperature, they shrunk in size and mostly disappeared at higher temperatures. This shrinking in microdomain size was accompanied by a gradual reduction of the height difference between the microdomains and the surrounding membrane, consistent with the behaviour expected for lipids that are laterally segregated in liquid ordered and liquid disordered domains. Immunolabeling experiments demonstrated that the microdomains contained flotillin-1, a protein associated with lipid rafts. The microdomains reversibly dissolved and reappeared, respectively, on heating to and cooling below temperatures around 37\u00b0C, which is indicative of radical changes in local membrane order close to physiological temperature.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Cell Line, Tumor", "Detergents", "Humans", "Membrane Microdomains", "Membrane Proteins", "Temperature"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84940184652", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"42261289800": {"Name": "Cremona A.", "AuthorID": "42261289800", "AffiliationID": "60030318", "AffiliationName": "Dipartimento di Scienze Farmacologiche E Biomolecolari, Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Milano"}, "26321290300": {"Name": "Corsetto P.A.", "AuthorID": "26321290300", "AffiliationID": "60030318", "AffiliationName": "Dipartimento di Scienze Farmacologiche E Biomolecolari, Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Milano"}, "35614477300": {"Name": "Rizzo A.M.", "AuthorID": "35614477300", "AffiliationID": "60030318", "AffiliationName": "Dipartimento di Scienze Farmacologiche E Biomolecolari, Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Milano"}, "7006804042": {"Name": "Orsini F.", "AuthorID": "7006804042", "AffiliationID": "60030318", "AffiliationName": "Dipartimento di Fisica, Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Milano"}, "6701845862": {"Name": "Hoogenboom B.W.", "AuthorID": "6701845862", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}}}
