Nevertheless, relaying of primary packets may introduce delays on secondary packets called secondary delay and may require an additional power budget to forward the primary packets. Power budget is particularly crucial when a type of sensor network is deployed using devices of limited power resources. In this paper, admission control is employed to efficiently manage this packet-wise relaying process in cognitive radio sensor networks (CRSNs). To be specific, we assume a cognitive packet-relaying scenario with two pairs of primary and secondary users, i.e., transmitter and receiver. We analyze and formulate the secondary delay and the required power budget of the secondary sensor node in relation to the acceptance factor (i.e., admission control parameter) that indicates whether the primary packets are admitted for relaying or not. Having defined the above, we present a tradeoff between the secondary delay and the required power budget by tuning the acceptance factor, which can be tailored to specific chosen values. Based on this behavior, we formulate an optimization problem to minimize the secondary delay over the admission control parameter subject to a limit on the required power budget. Additionally, the constraints related to the stabilities of all individual queues at the primary and secondary networks are taken into account in the proposed optimization problem, due to their interdependence relations. The solution of this problem is provided using iterative decomposition methods, i.e., dual and primal decompositions, using Lagrange multipliers that simplify the original complicated problem and result in a final equivalent dual problem that includes the initial Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions. We obtain the optimal acceptance factor, while in addition, we highlight the opportunities for extra delay minimization that is provided by relaxing the initial constraints through changing the values of the Lagrange multipliers. Finally, we present the behavior of the secondary delay, assuming infinite and finite queues and assessing thereby the overflow and blocking probabilities, respectively.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Admission control", "Cognitive radio", "Delays", "Optimization", "Radio transmitters", "Relays", "Stability analysis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cognitive radio networks (CRNs)", "Delays", "Karush-Kuhn-Tucker condition", "Medium access control layer", "Primal decompositions", "Relays", "Stability analysis", "Transmitter and receiver"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84947777856", "SubjectAreas": [["Automotive Engineering", "ENGI", "2203"], ["Aerospace Engineering", "ENGI", "2202"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"55952568500": {"Name": "Foukalas F.", "AuthorID": "55952568500", "AffiliationID": "60072749", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical Engineering, Qatar University"}, "8334317300": {"Name": "Khattab T.", "AuthorID": "8334317300", "AffiliationID": "60072749", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical Engineering, Qatar University"}}}
