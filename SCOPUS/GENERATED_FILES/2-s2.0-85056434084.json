This paper sets out the journey of University College London (UCL) Library Services over the past 10 years. In line with UCL's radical tradition and drawing from Jeremy Bentham's utilitarian principle of 'the greatest happiness of the greatest number', the library is playing a key role in opening access to education and research. First, the paper establishes how the library's role is being extended, as libraries become providers of excellent customer service, focused on providing an outstanding user experience. As students are seen increasingly as partners, their participation within the university is growing, and education, research and public engagement are intertwining as components of the student experience. The Connected Curriculum at UCL provides a framework for this (r)evolution in higher education. The library's use of Open Access tools, particularly with UCL Press, helps to connect high-quality science and student outputs with a wide public, enabling this research to be accessed and utilised on a global scale. Finally, the paper looks at innovative approaches to public engagement, leveraging social science and technology to deliver benefits to local communities, particularly in East London. Libraries should work together, across sectors, to address the current need for evidence-based information, and to provide opportunities for citizens to acquire transferable research skills.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Customer Service", "future library", "open Access", "partnership", "public Engagement", "uCL Library Services"], "IndexKeywords": ["Customer services", "Library services", "Open Access", "partnership", "Public engagement"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85056434084", "SubjectAreas": [["Library and Information Sciences", "SOCI", "3309"]], "AuthorData": {"56178245300": {"Name": "Meunier B.", "AuthorID": "56178245300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Library Services, University College London"}}}
