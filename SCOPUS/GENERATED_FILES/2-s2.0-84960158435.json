Both pristine and GO functionalized devices show n-type semiconductor behavior with high on/off ratio exceeding \u223c105. The photoresponse of the GO-MoS2 hybrid device shows almost complete recovery from persistent photoconductivity and a substantial decrease in response time from \u223c15 s in the pristine MoS2 device to \u223c1 s in the GO-MoS2 device. The reasons behind this improvement have been explored and discussed on the basis of electrostatic and photo interaction between GO and MoS2. As GO is a strong candidate for various sensing applications, therefore this intelligent hybrid system, where GO interacts electrostatically with the underlying MoS2 channel, has tremendous potential to add more functionalities to a pristine MoS2 device for realizing various smart nanoscale FET-based biochemical and gas sensors for myriad applications.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Functionalizations", "Graphene oxides", "Hybrid devices", "Intelligent hybrid systems", "Myriad applications", "N-type semiconductors", "Persistent Photoconductivity", "Sensing applications"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84960158435", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"]], "AuthorData": {"57159534500": {"Name": "Rathi N.", "AuthorID": "57159534500", "AffiliationID": "60007511", "AffiliationName": "School of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, Sungkyunkwan Advanced Institute of Nanotechnology (SAINT), Sungkyunkwan University"}, "36838604200": {"Name": "Rathi S.", "AuthorID": "36838604200", "AffiliationID": "60007511", "AffiliationName": "School of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, Sungkyunkwan Advanced Institute of Nanotechnology (SAINT), Sungkyunkwan University"}, "35327155100": {"Name": "Lee I.", "AuthorID": "35327155100", "AffiliationID": "60007511", "AffiliationName": "School of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, Sungkyunkwan Advanced Institute of Nanotechnology (SAINT), Sungkyunkwan University"}, "56591208300": {"Name": "Kang M.", "AuthorID": "56591208300", "AffiliationID": "60003780", "AffiliationName": "Manufacturing Engineering Team, Memory Division, Samsung Electronics Co."}, "56590942800": {"Name": "Khan M.", "AuthorID": "56590942800", "AffiliationID": "60007511", "AffiliationName": "School of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, Sungkyunkwan Advanced Institute of Nanotechnology (SAINT), Sungkyunkwan University"}, "57157643900": {"Name": "Lee Y.", "AuthorID": "57157643900", "AffiliationID": "60007511", "AffiliationName": "School of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, Sungkyunkwan Advanced Institute of Nanotechnology (SAINT), Sungkyunkwan University"}, "57210288630": {"Name": "Kim G.", "AuthorID": "57210288630", "AffiliationID": "60007511", "AffiliationName": "School of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, Sungkyunkwan Advanced Institute of Nanotechnology (SAINT), Sungkyunkwan University"}, "54386255900": {"Name": "Wang J.", "AuthorID": "54386255900", "AffiliationID": "60005879", "AffiliationName": "School of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering, Guizhou Normal University"}, "56591421400": {"Name": "Lim D.", "AuthorID": "56591421400", "AffiliationID": "60007511", "AffiliationName": "School of Advanced Materials Science and Engineering, Sungkyunkwan University"}}}
