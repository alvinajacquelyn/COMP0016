Self-control is the ability to exercise restraint over one's emotions, desires and actions. An ethos is a fundamental value within a given culture that displays moral character. Thus the self-control ethos is the guiding value within a culture wherein restraint is regarded as demonstrating moral fortitude. This chapter reiterates and develops the theory, proposed by Joffe and Staerkl\u00e9 (2007) that within western cultures the self-control ethos plays a key role in the social construction of certain groups as inferior, and concomitantly, others as superior. Key developments lie in pinpointing the symbolic power held by groups that represent contravention of multiple aspects of the self-control ethos, as well as the inclusion of the concept of the thema underpinning the social representations of out-groups. The chapter begins by pointing to how mainstream models of social psychology have theorized aspersions concerning out-groups. Following this, a more visceral-emotive model of the content of stereotyping and prejudice is called for. The chapter then proposes an alternative, social representational stance to the content of people's aspersions regarding out-groups. Having suggested the centrality of the self-control ethos in shaping social representations, its instantiation in relation to body, mind and destiny is elaborated. Finally, the chapter discusses how the self-control ethos functions to perpetuate the exclusion and derogation of certain groups, on the one hand, and to buttress the superiority of dominant groups and maintain the social status quo, on the other. The nature of stereotype content in existing theories of intergroup relations The content of thought underpinning commonly derogated out-groups, and thus stereotyping and prejudice, has not attracted sufficient attention in the social sciences. The more mainstream theories of stereotypes regarding out-groups have tended to theorize the process of stereotyping in the hope that the contents of people's aspersions regarding others will take care of themselves (Duveen, 2001b). Tajfel (1969), for example, introduced the idea that the psychological process underpinning stereotypical judgement and prejudice is categorization.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84938869117", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychology (all)", "PSYC", "3200"]], "AuthorData": {"7007057357": {"Name": "Joffe H.", "AuthorID": "7007057357", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
