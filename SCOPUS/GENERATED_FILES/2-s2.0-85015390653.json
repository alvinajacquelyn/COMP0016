Research in this area draws on and is relevant to applied corpus linguistics as well as second-language (L2) pedagogy and second language acquisition. Though there is certainly potential for DDL research to inform L2 vocabulary teaching practice, as described in detail in this article, the empirical studies of DDL have fallen short both theoretically and methodologically. Despite these limitations, we see potential in DDL to inform L2 pedagogy and to both draw from and contribute to SLA theory. For these reasons, this article also includes a discussion of how and when Spanish L2 teachers might consider adopting DDL techniques in their classrooms.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Corpus", "Data-driven learning (DDL)", "Research methods", "Spanish", "Vocabulary"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85015390653", "SubjectAreas": [["Language and Linguistics", "ARTS", "1203"], ["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["Linguistics and Language", "SOCI", "3310"]], "AuthorData": {"24172401100": {"Name": "Asenci\u00f3n-Delaney Y.", "AuthorID": "24172401100", "AffiliationID": "60023517", "AffiliationName": "Department of Global Languages and Cultures, Northern Arizona University"}, "6508034420": {"Name": "Collentine J.", "AuthorID": "6508034420", "AffiliationID": "60023517", "AffiliationName": "Department of Global Languages and Cultures, Northern Arizona University"}, "34167736100": {"Name": "Collentine K.", "AuthorID": "34167736100", "AffiliationID": "60023517", "AffiliationName": "Department of Global Languages and Cultures, Northern Arizona University"}, "57195434809": {"Name": "Colmenares J.", "AuthorID": "57195434809", "AffiliationID": "60023517", "AffiliationName": "Department of Global Languages and Cultures, Northern Arizona University"}, "22935371500": {"Name": "Plonsky L.", "AuthorID": "22935371500", "AffiliationID": "60023517", "AffiliationName": "Department of English, Northern Arizona University"}}}
