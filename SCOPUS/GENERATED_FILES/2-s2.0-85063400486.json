European Journal of Neurology published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of European Academy of NeurologyBackground and purpose: The aim was to evaluate the efficacy of the catechol-O-methyltransferase inhibitor opicapone (25 and 50 mg) as adjunct therapy to levodopa in a pooled population of Parkinson's disease patients who participated in the pivotal double-blind trials of opicapone and their 1-year open-label extensions. Methods: Data (placebo, opicapone 25 mg and opicapone 50 mg) from the BIPARK-1 and BIPARK-2 double-blind and open-label studies were combined. The studies had similar designs, eligibility criteria and assessment methods. The primary efficacy variable in both double-blind studies was the change from baseline in absolute OFF time based on patient diaries. Results: Double-blind treatment with opicapone (25 and 50 mg) significantly reduced absolute daily OFF time from a baseline of 6.1\u20136.6 h. The mean (and 95% confidence interval) treatment effect versus placebo was \u221235.1 (\u221262.1, \u22128.2) min (P = 0.0106) for the 25 mg dose and \u221258.1 (\u221284.5, \u221231.7) min (P < 0.0001) for the 50 mg dose. Reductions in OFF time were mirrored by significant increases in ON time without troublesome dyskinesia (P < 0.05 and P < 0.0001 for the 25 and 50 mg doses, respectively). No significant differences were observed for ON time with troublesome dyskinesia. Patient diary results from the open-label phase indicated a maintenance of effect for patients previously treated with opicapone 50 mg. The group previously treated with the 25 mg dose benefitted with further optimization of therapy during the open-label phase, whilst switching from placebo to opicapone led to significant reductions in OFF time and increased ON time. Conclusions: Over at least 1 year of open-label therapy, opicapone consistently reduced OFF time and increased ON time without increasing the frequency of troublesome dyskinesia.", "AuthorKeywords": ["motor fluctuations", "OFF time", "opicapone", "Parkinson's disease"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Antiparkinson Agents", "Double-Blind Method", "Drug Therapy, Combination", "Female", "Humans", "Levodopa", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Oxadiazoles", "Parkinson Disease", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85063400486", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"57201370983": {"Name": "Ferreira J.J.", "AuthorID": "57201370983", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "CNS - Campus Neurol\u00f3gico S\u00e9nior"}, "57208252964": {"Name": "Lees A.", "AuthorID": "57208252964", "AffiliationID": "60115564, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Reta Lila Weston Institute, University College London"}, "35291090100": {"Name": "Rocha J.F.", "AuthorID": "35291090100", "AffiliationID": "60029357", "AffiliationName": "Department of Research and Development, BIAL \u2013 Portela & Ca SA"}, "56533432400": {"Name": "Soares-da-Silva P.", "AuthorID": "56533432400", "AffiliationID": "60007249", "AffiliationName": "Center for Drug Discovery and Innovative Medicines, MedInUP, University Porto"}, "35373337300": {"Name": "Poewe W.", "AuthorID": "35373337300", "AffiliationID": "60008222", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Medical University Innsbruck"}, "7102349431": {"Name": "Rascol O.", "AuthorID": "7102349431", "AffiliationID": "60024960, 60000905, 60027245", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Investigation Centre CIC1436, Departments of Clinical Pharmacology and Neurosciences, NS-Park/FCRIN Network, University Hospital of Toulouse, INSERM, University Toulouse 3"}}}
