All rights reserved.Tuberculosis (TB) is the number one infectious cause of death globally. A vaccine that would effectively prevent adult forms of pulmonary TB is likely to have a great impact on the epidemic. The current vaccine, BacilleCalmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG), protects infants and young children against severe TB, but is poorly protective against adult lung TB. Development of new, better vaccines focus on learning more about protective immunity, on stimulating branches of the immune system that have not traditionally been targeted by vaccines, and on developing approaches that indicate potential protective efficacy of vaccine candidates early in development.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bacille Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG)", "BCG vaccination", "HIV", "Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb)", "Nontuberculous mycobacterial (NTM)"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84987863705", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Microbiology (all)", "IMMU", "2400"]], "AuthorData": {"6603950018": {"Name": "Hanekom W.A.", "AuthorID": "6603950018", "AffiliationID": "60022241", "AffiliationName": "Initiative Lead for TB Vaccines, TB Team Division of Global Health, Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation"}}}
