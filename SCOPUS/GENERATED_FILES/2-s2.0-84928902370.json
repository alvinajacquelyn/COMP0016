We developed an instrumental learning task to model social evaluation learning, predicting that FNE would specifically bias learning about the self but not others. Methods During six test blocks (3 self-referential, 3 other-referential), participants (n = 100) met six personas and selected a word from a positive/negative pair to finish their social evaluation sentences \"I think [you are / George is]. . .\". Feedback contingencies corresponded to 3 rules, liked, neutral and disliked, with P[positive word correct] = 0.8, 0.5 and 0.2, respectively. Results As FNE increased participants selected fewer positive words (\u03b2 = -0.4, 95% CI -0.7, -0.2, p = 0.001), which was strongest in the self-referential condition (FNE \u00d7 condition 0.28, 95% CI 0.01, 0.54, p = 0.04), and the neutral and dislike rules (FNE \u00d7 condition \u00d7 rule, p = 0.07). At low FNE the proportion of positive words selected for self-neutral and self-disliked greatly exceeded the feedback contingency, indicating poor learning, which improved as FNE increased. Conclusions FNE is associated with differences in processing social-evaluative information specifically about the self. At low FNE this manifests as insensitivity to learning negative self-referential evaluation. High FNE individuals are equally sensitive to learning positive or negative evaluation, which although objectively more accurate, may have detrimental effects on mental health.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Fear", "Female", "Humans", "Interpersonal Relations", "Learning", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Phobic Disorders", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84928902370", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"37107323800": {"Name": "Button K.S.", "AuthorID": "37107323800", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "School of Social and Community Medicine, University of Bristol"}, "11940573500": {"Name": "Stapinski L.", "AuthorID": "11940573500", "AffiliationID": "60109564, 60028333", "AffiliationName": "National Drug and Alcohol Research Centre, University of New South Wales"}, "7007161151": {"Name": "Rapee R.M.", "AuthorID": "7007161151", "AffiliationID": "60019544, 60088314", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Emotional Health, Macquarie University"}, "7402636617": {"Name": "Lewis G.", "AuthorID": "7402636617", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Mental Health Sciences Unit, University College London"}, "7004859481": {"Name": "Munaf\u00f2 M.R.", "AuthorID": "7004859481", "AffiliationID": "60172455", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council Integrative Epidemiology Unit at University of Bristol, United Kingdom"}, "7801382253": {"Name": "Kounali D.", "AuthorID": "7801382253", "AffiliationID": "60020650, 60115380", "AffiliationName": "UK Centre for Tobacco and Alcohol Studies, School of Experimental Psychology, University of Bristol"}}}
