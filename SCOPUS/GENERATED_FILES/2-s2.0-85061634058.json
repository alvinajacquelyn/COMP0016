The relevance and improvement to the current state-of-the-art are discussed. The formulated optimal control problems (OCP) consist of two individual optimization challenges: vehicle speed optimization and powertrain power-split optimization. These OCPs can be merged leading to a practical and global problem, where all the aspects are optimized simultaneously for a prescribed route and traveling time. Alternatively, the global problem can be approximated by solving individual OCPs, one for each aspect, in steps and combined a posteriori. The optimal solutions in each case are investigated and compared by simulation examples to expose the trade-off between optimality of fuel economy achieved by global optimization and reduction in computational complexity and hence practicality of the two-step solution approximation.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Fuel efficiency", "Global problems", "Optimal control problem", "Optimal solutions", "Optimization formulations", "Series hybrid electric vehicles", "Simulation example", "State of the art"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85061634058", "SubjectAreas": [["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"], ["Control and Optimization", "MATH", "2606"], ["Modeling and Simulation", "MATH", "2611"], ["Transportation", "SOCI", "3313"], ["Energy Engineering and Power Technology", "ENER", "2102"], ["Automotive Engineering", "ENGI", "2203"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"56021899900": {"Name": "Chen B.", "AuthorID": "56021899900", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Dept. of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Imperial College London"}, "7004154249": {"Name": "Evangelou S.", "AuthorID": "7004154249", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Dept. of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Imperial College London"}, "6602474255": {"Name": "Lot R.", "AuthorID": "6602474255", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "Dept. of Engineering and the Environment, University of Southampton"}}}
