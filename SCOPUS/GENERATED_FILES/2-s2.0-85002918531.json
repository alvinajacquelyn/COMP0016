Thus, we take the analytical content of a pivotal regulatory reform instrument (impact assessment) as a dependent variable, draw on learning as a conceptual framework, and explain the dynamics of learning processes across departments, policy sectors, and time. Empirically, our study draws on a sample of 517 impact assessments produced in Britain (2005\u20132011). Experience and capacity in different departments matter in learning processes. Guidelines also matter, but moderately so. Departments specialize in their core policy sectors when performing regulatory analysis, but some have greater analytical capacity overall. Peripheral departments invest more in impact assessment than core executive departments. The presence of a regulatory oversight body enhances the learning process. Elections have different effects, depending on the context in which they are contested. These findings contribute to the literature on regulation, policy learning, and policy instruments.", "AuthorKeywords": ["evaluation", "evidence-based policymaking", "regulation", "regulatory impact assessment", "United Kingdom"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85002918531", "SubjectAreas": [["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"], ["Public Administration", "SOCI", "3321"], ["Law", "SOCI", "3308"]], "AuthorData": {"55637419500": {"Name": "Fritsch O.", "AuthorID": "55637419500", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "School of Geography, University of Leeds"}, "56690591300": {"Name": "Kamkhaji J.C.", "AuthorID": "56690591300", "AffiliationID": "60026479", "AffiliationName": "Department of Politics, University of Exeter"}, "6701387604": {"Name": "Radaelli C.M.", "AuthorID": "6701387604", "AffiliationID": "60026479", "AffiliationName": "Department of Politics, University of Exeter"}}}
