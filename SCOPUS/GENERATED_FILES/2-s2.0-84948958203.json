Practice-based therapies designed to induce compensatory eye movements can improve hemianopic patients' visual function, but are not readily available. We used a web-based therapy (Eye-Search) that retrains visual search saccades into patients' blind hemifield. A group of 78 suitable hemianopic patients took part. After therapy (800 trials over 11 days), search times into their impaired hemifield improved by an average of 24%. Patients also reported improvements in a subset of visually guided everyday activities, suggesting that Eye-Search therapy affects real-world outcomes.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84948958203", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"55228562100": {"Name": "Ong Y.H.", "AuthorID": "55228562100", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "57216595043": {"Name": "Leff A.P.", "AuthorID": "57216595043", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "8640532300": {"Name": "Bays P.M.", "AuthorID": "8640532300", "AffiliationID": "60025038", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cognitive and Brain Sciences, University of California"}, "6508068879": {"Name": "Jacquin-Courtois S.", "AuthorID": "6508068879", "AffiliationID": "60108296, 60023578, 60000905", "AffiliationName": "ImpAct, Centre des Neurosciences de Lyon, Inserm UMR-S 1028"}, "35995704600": {"Name": "Gorgoraptis N.", "AuthorID": "35995704600", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Restorative Neuroscience, Department of Medicine, Imperial College London"}, "7201522757": {"Name": "Husain M.", "AuthorID": "7201522757", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Nuffield Department of Clinical Neurosciences and Dept Experimental Psychology, University of Oxford"}}}
