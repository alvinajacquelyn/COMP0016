The argument is developed with particular reference to the ethnographies of living with austerity inside the eurozone contained in this special issue. The studies identify the ways the past may be activated, lived, embodied, and re-fashioned under contracting economic horizons. We argue for the empirical study of crisis that captures the decisions or non-decisions that people make, and the actual temporal processes by which they judge responses. We conclude that modern linear historicism is often overridden in such moments by other historicities, showing that in crises, not only time, but history itself as an organizing structure and set of expectations, is up for grabs.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Affect", "Crisis and Austerity", "Historicity", "Southern Europe", "Temporality"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84954128554", "SubjectAreas": [["Cultural Studies", "SOCI", "3316"], ["History", "ARTS", "1202"], ["Anthropology", "SOCI", "3314"]], "AuthorData": {"55336747800": {"Name": "Knight D.M.", "AuthorID": "55336747800", "AffiliationID": "60022175, 60176037", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anthropology, Durham University, Dawson Building"}, "56213073700": {"Name": "Stewart C.", "AuthorID": "56213073700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anthropology, University College London"}}}
