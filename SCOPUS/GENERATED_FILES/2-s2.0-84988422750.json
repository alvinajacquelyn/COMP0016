Analyses allowed detection of changes in chemical composition and surface topography. The focus was on surface phenomena as they dictate the behaviour of many nanosystems conceived for cleaning art objects. Gravimetric data showed consistency in soil removed by PVA gels. Additional applications of the PVA gels should be tested. The data showed a weight increase in samples cleaned with Gellan, suggesting absorption of the cleaning agent. Visual observation confirms that artificial soil was removed by Gellan hydro- and 2-propanol gels more effectively than by PVA gels prepared with the same liquid compositions. In both cases, 2-propanol removed more soil than neat water, suggesting the effectiveness of the solvent action. SFG used to probe the molecular structure at the contact interface between PVAc hydrogel and the PMMA surface before, during and after gel application, confirmed that PVA hydrogel is able to remove SDS from surfaces without altering the molecular structure of PMMA.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Chemical compositions", "Contact interface", "Detection of changes", "Liquid compositions", "Poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA)", "Qualitative evaluations", "Surface response", "Visual observations"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84988422750", "SubjectAreas": [["Conservation", "ARTS", "1206"]], "AuthorData": {"57191254770": {"Name": "Kavda S.", "AuthorID": "57191254770", "AffiliationID": "60107608", "AffiliationName": "UCL Qatar, University College London"}, "56464308300": {"Name": "Golfomitsou S.", "AuthorID": "56464308300", "AffiliationID": "60107608", "AffiliationName": "UCL Qatar, University College London"}, "55359137700": {"Name": "Dhopatkar N.", "AuthorID": "55359137700", "AffiliationID": "60032143", "AffiliationName": "Department of Polymer Science, University of Akron"}, "7003311252": {"Name": "Dhinojwala A.", "AuthorID": "7003311252", "AffiliationID": "60032143", "AffiliationName": "Department of Polymer Science, University of Akron"}, "36129454700": {"Name": "Angelova L.", "AuthorID": "36129454700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of History of Art, University College London"}, "55976550800": {"Name": "Richardson E.", "AuthorID": "55976550800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of History of Art, University College London"}}}
