Type B1 periprosthetic femoral fractures are associated with a well-fixed stem and have traditionally been treated with internal fixation. However, there are a subset of these fractures which fare badly when internal fixation is undertaken, and revision of the femoral component to a long-stemmed implant may be more appropriate. We look at the traditional methods of fixation, and the evidence and indications for revision of these fractures.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Hip", "Periprosthetic fracture", "Revision", "THA", "Treatment", "Type B", "Unified Classification System", "Vancouver classification"], "IndexKeywords": ["Arthroplasty, Replacement, Hip", "Femoral Fractures", "Fracture Fixation, Internal", "Hip Prosthesis", "Humans", "Middle Aged", "Periprosthetic Fractures", "Reoperation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84940459242", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Orthopedics and Sports Medicine", "MEDI", "2732"]], "AuthorData": {"56449161700": {"Name": "Yasen A.T.", "AuthorID": "56449161700", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Trauma and Orthopaedics, University College London Hospital"}, "7203033976": {"Name": "Haddad F.S.", "AuthorID": "7203033976", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Sport, Exercise & Health, University College London"}}}
