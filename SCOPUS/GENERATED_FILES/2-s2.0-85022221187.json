Earthquake Engineering & Structural Dynamics Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.Stochastic ground motion models produce synthetic time-histories by modulating a white noise sequence through functions that address spectral and temporal properties of the excitation. The resultant ground motions can be then used in simulation-based seismic risk assessment applications. This is established by relating the parameters of the aforementioned functions to earthquake and site characteristics through predictive relationships. An important concern related to the use of these models is the fact that through current approaches in selecting these predictive relationships, compatibility to the seismic hazard is not guaranteed. This work offers a computationally efficient framework for the modification of stochastic ground motion models to match target intensity measures (IMs) for a specific site and structure of interest. This is set as an optimization problem with a dual objective. The first objective minimizes the discrepancy between the target IMs and the predictions established through the stochastic ground motion model for a chosen earthquake scenario. The second objective constraints the deviation from the model characteristics suggested by existing predictive relationships, guaranteeing that the resultant ground motions not only match the target IMs but are also compatible with regional trends. A framework leveraging kriging surrogate modeling is formulated for performing the resultant multi-objective optimization, and different computational aspects related to this optimization are discussed in detail. The illustrative implementation shows that the proposed framework can provide ground motions with high compatibility to target IMs with small only deviation from existing predictive relationships and discusses approaches for selecting a final compromise between these two competing objectives.", "AuthorKeywords": ["hazard-compatible tuning", "kriging surrogate modeling", "seismic risk", "stochastic ground motion model"], "IndexKeywords": ["Computational aspects", "Computationally efficient", "Kriging surrogate model", "Optimization problems", "Predictive relationships", "Seismic risk", "Seismic risk assessment", "Stochastic ground motion model"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85022221187", "SubjectAreas": [["Geotechnical Engineering and Engineering Geology", "EART", "1909"], ["Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)", "EART", "1901"]], "AuthorData": {"55486360200": {"Name": "Tsioulou A.", "AuthorID": "55486360200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil, Environmental and Geomatic Engineering and Institute for Risk and Disaster Reduction, University College London"}, "26537243900": {"Name": "Galasso C.", "AuthorID": "26537243900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil, Environmental and Geomatic Engineering and Institute for Risk and Disaster Reduction, University College London"}, "8208864500": {"Name": "Taflanidis A.", "AuthorID": "8208864500", "AffiliationID": "60021508", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering and Earth Sciences, University of Notre Dame"}}}
