Pitting unhealthy snacking habits against snack-avoidance intentions", "Year": 2015, "Source": "BMC Psychol.", "Volume": "3", "Issue": 1, "Art.No": null, "PageStart": null, "PageEnd": null, "CitedBy": 19, "DOI": "10.1186/S40359-015-0065-4", "Link": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85007301664&origin=inward", "Abstract": "\u00a9 2015 Gardner et al.Background: Habit is defined as a process whereby an impulse towards behaviour is automatically initiated upon encountering a setting in which the behaviour has been performed in the past. A central tenet of habit theory is that habit overrides intentional tendencies in directing behaviour, such that as habit strength increases, intention becomes less predictive of behaviour. Yet, evidence of this effect has been methodologically limited by modelling the impact of positively-correlated habits and intentions. This study sought to test the effect of habits for unhealthy snacking on the relationship between intentions to avoid unhealthy snacks and snack intake. Methods: Methods were chosen to match those used in studies that have shown habit-intention interactions. 239 adults completed valid and reliable measures of habitual snacking and intention to avoid snacking at baseline, and a self-report measure of snack intake two weeks later. Data were analysed using multiple regression. Results: While both habit and intention independently predicted snack intake, no interaction between habit and intention was found. Conclusions: No support was found for the expected moderating impact of habit on the intention-behaviour relationship, indicating that individuals with intentions can act on those intentions despite having habits. Previous evidence of a habit-intention interaction effect may be unreliable. A growing literature indicates that habitual tendencies can be inhibited, albeit with difficulty. Habits and intentions may vary in the influence they exert over discrete behaviour instances. While the aggregation of behaviours across instances and individuals used in our study reflects the dominant methodology in habit research, it precludes examination of effects of in-situ habits and intentions. More sophisticated data collection and analysis methods may be needed to better understand potential habit-intention interactions.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Automaticity", "Diet", "Habit", "Health behaviour", "Reasoned action", "Snacking"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85007301664", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychology (all)", "PSYC", "3200"]], "AuthorData": {"35723547800": {"Name": "Gardner B.", "AuthorID": "35723547800", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London"}, "57192686234": {"Name": "Corbridge S.", "AuthorID": "57192686234", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Health Behaviour Research Centre, Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "57190969843": {"Name": "McGowan L.", "AuthorID": "57190969843", "AffiliationID": "60029738", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Global Food Security, Northern Ireland Technology Centre, Queen's University Belfast"}}}
