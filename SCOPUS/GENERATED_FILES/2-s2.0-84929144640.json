All rights reserved.An NMR method has been used to determine the hydrogen bond acidity, A, of a number of hydroxyisoflavones. Together with our previous studies on hydroxyflavones, these A-values enable the presence of intramolecular hydrogen bonding in hydroxyflavones and hydroxyisoflavones to be detected. A full set of Abraham descriptors has been assigned to all the monohydroxy and dihydroxy-flavones and isoflavones, and to some polyhydroxy-flavones and isoflavones as well. In these assignments, knowledge of the A-descriptor is crucial. These sets of descriptors can then be used to estimate values for a large number of physicochemical and biochemical processes.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Abraham descriptors", "Hydrogen bond acidity", "Hydroxyflavones", "Hydroxyisoflavones", "Lipophilicity", "Partition coefficient"], "IndexKeywords": ["Descriptors", "Hydroxyflavones", "Hydroxyisoflavones", "Lipophilicity", "Partition coefficient"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84929144640", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Spectroscopy", "CHEM", "1607"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"], ["Materials Chemistry", "MATE", "2505"]], "AuthorData": {"7202901240": {"Name": "Abraham M.", "AuthorID": "7202901240", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "35496753700": {"Name": "Acree W.", "AuthorID": "35496753700", "AffiliationID": "60024438", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of North Texas"}, "56641576100": {"Name": "Earp C.", "AuthorID": "56641576100", "AffiliationID": "60009652", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Geosciences and Physics, Tarleton State University"}, "55284728100": {"Name": "Whaley W.", "AuthorID": "55284728100", "AffiliationID": "60009652", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Geosciences and Physics, Tarleton State University"}, "55286911600": {"Name": "Vladimirova A.", "AuthorID": "55286911600", "AffiliationID": "60020547", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Texas A and M University"}}}
