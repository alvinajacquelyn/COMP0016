The chapter discusses peripheral nervous system synapses, neurotransmitters, glial cells, peripheral nerve fibre types, myelin and saltatory conduction, and sensory nerve endings. Neurones and glia are the structural and functional units of all parts of the nervous system. The chapter outlines the structure of different regions of the brain and cord, the connections between them and how these operate. Almost all parts of the nervous system become involved alertness, cognition, volition, mood, all special senses, sensory stimuli, motor cortex and associated cortical motor and sensory areas, spinal reflex arc, cerebellum, basal ganglia, motor nerves, neuromuscular junction and, obviously, muscles themselves. In humans, movement assumed signal further importance with the development and progressive use of tools to an extent that far exceeds the capacity of any other species.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Glial cells", "Nerve fibre types", "Nervous system", "Neuronal ultrastructure", "Neurotransmitters", "Peripheral nervous system synapses", "Sensory nerve endings"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85024847506", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"7401438377": {"Name": "Clarke C.", "AuthorID": "7401438377", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, University College London Hospitals, NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7102027025": {"Name": "Lemon R.", "AuthorID": "7102027025", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Neurology"}}}
