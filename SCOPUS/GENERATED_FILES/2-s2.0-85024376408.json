Here we used mice with deletion of the vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT) in the forebrain to model cholinergic abnormalities observed in dementia. Whole-genome RNA sequencing of hippocampal samples revealed that cholinergic failure causes changes in RNAmetabolism. Remarkably, key transcripts related to Alzheimer's disease are affected. BACE1, for instance, shows abnormal splicing caused by decreased expression of the splicing regulator hnRNPA2/B1. Resulting BACE1 overexpression leads to increased APP processing and accumulation of soluble A\u00e21-42. This is accompanied by age-related increases in GSK3 activation, tau hyperphosphorylation, caspase-3 activation, decreased synaptic markers, increased neuronal death, and deteriorating cognition. Pharmacological inhibition of GSK3 hyperactivation reversed deficits in synaptic markers and tau hyperphosphorylation induced by cholinergic dysfunction, indicating a key role for GSK3 in some of these pathological changes. Interestingly, in human brains there was a high correlation between decreased levels of VAChT and hnRNPA2/B1 levels with increased tau hyperphosphorylation. These results suggest that changes in RNA processing caused by cholinergic loss can facilitate Alzheimer's-like pathology in mice, providing a mechanism by which decreased cholinergic tone may increase risk of dementia.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Acetylcholine", "Alzheimer's disease", "cognition", "pathology", "RNA metabolism"], "IndexKeywords": ["Acetylcholine", "Alzheimer Disease", "Amyloid beta-Peptides", "Amyloid Precursor Protein Secretases", "Animals", "Aspartic Acid Endopeptidases", "Cells, Cultured", "Disease Models, Animal", "Embryo, Mammalian", "Enzyme Inhibitors", "Gene Expression Regulation", "Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3", "Hippocampus", "Humans", "Learning Disorders", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Mice, Transgenic", "RNA", "Thiazoles", "Thyroid Nuclear Factor 1", "Urea", "Vesicular Acetylcholine Transport Proteins"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85024376408", "SubjectAreas": [["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"]], "AuthorData": {"55600583200": {"Name": "Kolisnyk B.", "AuthorID": "55600583200", "AffiliationID": "105254125", "AffiliationName": "Graduate Program in Neuroscience"}, "56004408100": {"Name": "Al-Onaizi M.", "AuthorID": "56004408100", "AffiliationID": "60031619, 60010884", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology, Schulich School of Medicine and Dentistry, University of Western Ontario"}, "57191577083": {"Name": "Kish M.T.", "AuthorID": "57191577083", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Department of Physiology and Pharmacology"}, "56999714500": {"Name": "Souza Da Silva J.", "AuthorID": "56999714500", "AffiliationID": "60029991", "AffiliationName": "Robarts Research Institute"}, "7006609498": {"Name": "Prado V.F.", "AuthorID": "7006609498", "AffiliationID": "60031619, 60010884", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology, Schulich School of Medicine and Dentistry, University of Western Ontario"}, "35595960300": {"Name": "Prado M.A.M.", "AuthorID": "35595960300", "AffiliationID": "60031619, 60010884", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology, Schulich School of Medicine and Dentistry, University of Western Ontario"}, "13612054300": {"Name": "Soreq L.", "AuthorID": "13612054300", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "55356372800": {"Name": "Haberman N.", "AuthorID": "55356372800", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "57204150692": {"Name": "Ule J.", "AuthorID": "57204150692", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "35315645100": {"Name": "Barbash S.", "AuthorID": "35315645100", "AffiliationID": "60007903", "AffiliationName": "Edmond and Lily Safra Center for Brain Science, Silberman Institute of Life Sciences, Edmond J Safra Campus, Hebrew University of Jerusalem"}, "36558749600": {"Name": "Bekenstein U.", "AuthorID": "36558749600", "AffiliationID": "60007903", "AffiliationName": "Edmond and Lily Safra Center for Brain Science, Silberman Institute of Life Sciences, Edmond J Safra Campus, Hebrew University of Jerusalem"}, "35299318600": {"Name": "Hanin G.", "AuthorID": "35299318600", "AffiliationID": "60007903", "AffiliationName": "Edmond and Lily Safra Center for Brain Science, Silberman Institute of Life Sciences, Edmond J Safra Campus, Hebrew University of Jerusalem"}, "35464534500": {"Name": "Soreq H.", "AuthorID": "35464534500", "AffiliationID": "60007903", "AffiliationName": "Edmond and Lily Safra Center for Brain Science, Silberman Institute of Life Sciences, Edmond J Safra Campus, Hebrew University of Jerusalem"}, "7006132603": {"Name": "Fahnestock M.", "AuthorID": "7006132603", "AffiliationID": "60031828", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry and Behavioural Neurosciences, McMaster University"}}}
