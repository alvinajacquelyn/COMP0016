This modality behaves in the \u201crelevant\u201d style, that is, it allows contraction and permutation, but not weakening. Morrill and Valent\u00edn stated an open problem whether this system is decidable. Here we show its undecidability. Our result remains valid if we consider the fragment where all division operations have one direction. We also show that the derivability problem in a restricted case, where the modality can be applied only to variables (primitive types), is decidable and belongs to the NP class.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Lambek calculus", "NP class", "Primitive types", "Undecidability"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84981165729", "SubjectAreas": [["Theoretical Computer Science", "MATH", "2614"], ["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"]], "AuthorData": {"56117921300": {"Name": "Kanovich M.", "AuthorID": "56117921300", "AffiliationID": "60020513", "AffiliationName": "National Research University Higher School of Economics"}, "54914981600": {"Name": "Kuznetsov S.", "AuthorID": "54914981600", "AffiliationID": "60029374", "AffiliationName": "Steklov Mathematical Institute"}, "6701808416": {"Name": "Scedrov A.", "AuthorID": "6701808416", "AffiliationID": "60020513", "AffiliationName": "National Research University Higher School of Economics"}}}
