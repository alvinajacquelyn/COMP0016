C-terminal binding protein 1 (CtBP1) was shown to associate with the intracellular C-terminal regions of the N-methyl D aspartate receptor subunits GluN2A and GluN2D but not with GluN1-1a cytoplasmic C-terminal region. In yeast mating assays using a series of GluN2A C-terminal truncations, it was demonstrated that the CtBP1 binding domain was localized to GluN2A 1157\u20131382. The GluN2A binding domain was identified to lie within the CtBP1 161\u2013224 region. CtBP1 co-immunoprecipitated with assembled GluN1/GluN2A receptors expressed in mammalian cells and also, in detergent extracts of adult mouse brain. Co-expression of CtBP1 with GluN1/GluN2A resulted in a significant decrease in receptor cell surface expression. The family of C-terminal binding proteins function primarily as transcriptional co-repressors. However, they are also known to modulate intracellular membrane trafficking mechanisms. Thus the results reported herein describe a putative role for CtBP1 in the regulation of cell surface N-methyl D aspartate receptor expression.", "AuthorKeywords": ["C-terminal binding protein", "Ionotropic glutamate receptor", "NMDA receptor", "Protein\u2013protein interaction"], "IndexKeywords": ["Alcohol Oxidoreductases", "Amino Acid Sequence", "Animals", "Antibodies", "DNA-Binding Proteins", "HEK293 Cells", "Humans", "Immunoprecipitation", "Male", "Mice, Inbred BALB C", "Nerve Tissue Proteins", "Protein Binding", "Receptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate", "Saccharomyces cerevisiae"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85054517751", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"]], "AuthorData": {"15519326000": {"Name": "Cousins S.", "AuthorID": "15519326000", "AffiliationID": "60016379", "AffiliationName": "University College London School of Pharmacy"}, "7101637279": {"Name": "Stephenson F.", "AuthorID": "7101637279", "AffiliationID": "60016379", "AffiliationName": "University College London School of Pharmacy"}}}
