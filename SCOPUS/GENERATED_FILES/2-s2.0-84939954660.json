Unknown to participants, the location in which the target appeared was probabilistically determined on the basis of the location of eye-gaze immediately prior to the appearance of the target. Participants\u2019 response times to the appearance of the target in a high-probability location were faster than when it appeared in a low-probability location, revealing that participants were able to learn these gaze-contingent events. Furthermore, there was no difference in the cuing score between those participants classified as aware or unaware of the contingencies on a subsequent forced-choice recognition task. These data suggest the task involves implicit learning of instrumental (action-outcome) contingencies, which has potential implications for our understanding of gaze-contingent processes in social interaction.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Eye movements and visual attention", "Implicit learning and memory"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Anticipation, Psychological", "Fixation, Ocular", "Humans", "Learning", "Psychomotor Performance", "Visual Perception", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84939954660", "SubjectAreas": [["Experimental and Cognitive Psychology", "PSYC", "3205"], ["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"], ["Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)", "ARTS", "1201"]], "AuthorData": {"14424213800": {"Name": "Beesley T.", "AuthorID": "14424213800", "AffiliationID": "60028333", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, University of New South Wales"}, "56402562600": {"Name": "Pearson D.", "AuthorID": "56402562600", "AffiliationID": "60028333", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, University of New South Wales"}, "6603589906": {"Name": "Le Pelley M.", "AuthorID": "6603589906", "AffiliationID": "60028333", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, University of New South Wales"}}}
