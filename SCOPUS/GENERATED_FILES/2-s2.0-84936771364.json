The probability density function method and an alternative series representation of the generalized Marcum-Q function are used to obtain two upper bounds for the average detection probability. The error bounds resulting from truncating an infinite summation series to finite terms are also calculated because the derived expressions were in the form of an infinite summation series. Finally, the analysis are validated by simulations. These results are expected to assist in future studies of communication technologies, such as cognitive radios.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Communication technologies", "Cooperative relay networks", "Detection probabilities", "Energy detectors", "Generalized marcum q functions", "Probability density function method", "Selection combiners", "Series representations"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84936771364", "SubjectAreas": [["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"54784921000": {"Name": "Mughal M.", "AuthorID": "54784921000", "AffiliationID": "60028876", "AffiliationName": "Department of Information and Communication Engineering, Inha University"}, "54681046100": {"Name": "Kim J.", "AuthorID": "54681046100", "AffiliationID": "60028876", "AffiliationName": "Department of Information and Communication Engineering, Inha University"}, "25031569200": {"Name": "Razi A.", "AuthorID": "25031569200", "AffiliationID": "60060302", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic Engineering, N.E.D.
