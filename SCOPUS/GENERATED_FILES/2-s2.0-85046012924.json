Such a CAD tool, if sufficiently automated could run in the background checking every CXR taken, regardless of whether the patient is a suspected carrier of TB. This paper outlines the first phase of the project: segmenting the lung region from a CXR. This is a challenge because of the variation in the appearance of the lung in different patients and even in images of the same patient.", "AuthorKeywords": ["CAD", "Radiographs", "Segmentation", "SLICO", "Tuberculosis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Chest radiographs", "Computer Aided Diagnosis(CAD)", "Fully automated", "Lung segmentation", "Multiple image", "Radiographs", "SLICO", "Tuberculosis"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85046012924", "SubjectAreas": [["Signal Processing", "COMP", "1711"], ["Hardware and Architecture", "COMP", "1708"], ["Surfaces, Coatings and Films", "MATE", "2508"]], "AuthorData": {"57190395030": {"Name": "Yassine B.", "AuthorID": "57190395030", "AffiliationID": "116573665", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Health Informatics, CHIME"}, "7404775085": {"Name": "Taylor P.", "AuthorID": "7404775085", "AffiliationID": "116573665", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Health Informatics, CHIME"}, "57220095206": {"Name": "Story A.", "AuthorID": "57220095206", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "University College Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
