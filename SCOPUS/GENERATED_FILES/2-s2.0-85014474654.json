Cooling of nanoparticles, from phonon occupancies of 107 down to phonons, have already been achieved by several groups. Prospects for quantum ground-state cooling seem extremely promising. Cavity-cooling without added stabilisation by feedback cooling remains challenging, but trapping at high vacuum in a cavity is now possible through the addition of a Paul trap. However, the Paul trap has been found to qualitatively modify the cavity output spectrum, with the latter acquiring an atypical 'split-sideband' structure, of different form from the displacement spectrum, and which depends on N, the optical well at which the particle localises. In the present work we investigate the N-dependence of the dynamics, in particular with respect to thermometry: we show that in strong cooling regions , the temperature may still be reliably inferred from the cavity output spectra. We also explain the N-dependence of the mechanical frequencies and optomechanical coupling showing that these may be accurately estimated. We present a simple 'fast-cavity' model for the cavity output and test all our findings against full numerical solutions of the nonlinear stochastic equations of motion for the system.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Electro-optical", "Feedback cooling", "Full numerical solution", "Mechanical frequency", "Optomechanical", "Output spectrum", "Quantum ground state", "Stochastic equations"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85014474654", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"]], "AuthorData": {"57191829340": {"Name": "Aranas E.B.", "AuthorID": "57191829340", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "56576042000": {"Name": "Fonseca P.Z.G.", "AuthorID": "56576042000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "57203084776": {"Name": "Barker P.F.", "AuthorID": "57203084776", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "55950044400": {"Name": "Monteiro T.S.", "AuthorID": "55950044400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}}}
