Here, we have carried out electrical and optical characterization of graphene-MoS2 heterostructure. The few-layer MoS2 devices with metal electrode at one end and monolayer graphene electrode at the other end show nonlinearity in drain current with drain voltage sweep due to asymmetrical Schottky barrier height at the contacts and can be modulated with an external gate field. The doping effect of MoS2 on graphene was observed as double Dirac points in the transfer characteristics of the graphene field-effect transistor (FET) with a few-layer MoS2 overlapping the middle part of the channel, whereas the underlapping of graphene have negligible effect on MoS2 FET characteristics, which showed typical n-type behavior. The heterostructure also exhibits a strongest optical response for 520 nm wavelength, which decreases with higher wavelengths. Another distinct feature observed in the heterostructure is the peak in the photocurrent around zero gate voltage. This peak is distinguished from conventional MoS2 FETs, which show a continuous increase in photocurrent with back-gate voltage. These results offer significant insight and further enhance the understanding of the graphene-MoS2 heterostructure.", "AuthorKeywords": ["2D semiconductor", "field-effect transistor", "graphene", "heterostructure", "molybdenum disulfide", "Schottky barrier"], "IndexKeywords": ["Graphene field effect transistor (FET)", "Heterostructure devices", "Molybdenum disulfide", "Optical characteristics", "Optical characterization", "Schottky barrier heights", "Schottky barriers", "Transfer characteristics"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84939230676", "SubjectAreas": [["Bioengineering", "CENG", "1502"], ["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"]], "AuthorData": {"36838604200": {"Name": "Rathi S.", "AuthorID": "36838604200", "AffiliationID": "60007511", "AffiliationName": "School of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, Sungkyunkwan Advanced Institute of Nanotechnology (SAINT), Sungkyunkwan University"}, "35327155100": {"Name": "Lee I.", "AuthorID": "35327155100", "AffiliationID": "60007511", "AffiliationName": "School of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, Sungkyunkwan Advanced Institute of Nanotechnology (SAINT), Sungkyunkwan University"}, "54386255900": {"Name": "Wang J.", "AuthorID": "54386255900", "AffiliationID": "60007511", "AffiliationName": "School of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, Sungkyunkwan Advanced Institute of Nanotechnology (SAINT), Sungkyunkwan University"}, "56499702500": {"Name": "Kim G.H.", "AuthorID": "56499702500", "AffiliationID": "60007511", "AffiliationName": "School of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, Sungkyunkwan Advanced Institute of Nanotechnology (SAINT), Sungkyunkwan University"}, "56591421400": {"Name": "Lim D.", "AuthorID": "56591421400", "AffiliationID": "60007511", "AffiliationName": "School of Advanced Materials Science and Engineering, Sungkyunkwan University"}, "7202503673": {"Name": "Ochiai Y.", "AuthorID": "7202503673", "AffiliationID": "60002787", "AffiliationName": "Graduate School of Advanced Integration Science, Chiba University"}, "55626091200": {"Name": "Aoki N.", "AuthorID": "55626091200", "AffiliationID": "60002787", "AffiliationName": "Graduate School of Advanced Integration Science, Chiba University"}, "57203090873": {"Name": "Watanabe K.", "AuthorID": "57203090873", "AffiliationID": "60002414", "AffiliationName": "Advanced Materials Laboratory, National Institute for Materials Science"}, "55252500400": {"Name": "Taniguchi T.", "AuthorID": "55252500400", "AffiliationID": "60002414", "AffiliationName": "Advanced Materials Laboratory, National Institute for Materials Science"}, "55675952500": {"Name": "Lee G.H.", "AuthorID": "55675952500", "AffiliationID": "60016912", "AffiliationName": "Department of Material Science and Engineering, Yonsei University"}, "55578387300": {"Name": "Yu Y.J.", "AuthorID": "55578387300", "AffiliationID": "60001558", "AffiliationName": "Creative Research Center, Graphene Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute (ETRI)"}, "26643631500": {"Name": "Kim P.", "AuthorID": "26643631500", "AffiliationID": "60009982", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Harvard University"}}}
