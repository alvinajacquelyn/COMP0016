Suppose that there is a solution such that for all sufficiently large n, and the height of yn dominates the height of the coefficient functions an, bn and cn. We show that if the logarithmic height of yn grows no faster than a power of n then either the equation is a well known discrete Painlev\u00e9 equation dPII or its autonomous version or yn is also an admissible solution of a discrete Riccati equation. This provides further evidence that slow height growth is a good detector of integrability.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Diophantine integrability", "discrete integrable systems", "discrete Painlev\u00e9 equations"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84933060193", "SubjectAreas": [["Statistical and Nonlinear Physics", "PHYS", "3109"], ["Mathematical Physics", "MATH", "2610"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"56700190500": {"Name": "Al-Ghassani A.", "AuthorID": "56700190500", "AffiliationID": "60071768", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics and Statistics, College of Science, Sultan Qaboos University"}, "6603577604": {"Name": "Halburd R.", "AuthorID": "6603577604", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University College London"}}}
