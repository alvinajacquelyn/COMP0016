The dynamic nature of the media makes it a new and emerging base for the analysis of human behaviour and brings new opportunities to understand groups, movements and society.Analysing the results of billions of conversations has already revolutionised marketing and advertising. However, these datasets, by their very nature, are complex, time-consuming and computationally difficult to analyse. We put in place a series of examples to utilise such datasets with a view of exploring non-complex workflows via the use of new toolkits, linking into data collection via the crowd and opening up systems for analysis.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Crowdsourcing", "Geographic", "Geospatial", "Mapping", "MapTube", "Mysql", "SurveyMapper", "Toolkit", "Tweet-o-Meter"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84943410884", "SubjectAreas": [["Economics, Econometrics and Finance (all)", "ECON", "2000"], ["Business, Management and Accounting (all)", "BUSI", "1400"]], "AuthorData": {"57199318243": {"Name": "Gray S.", "AuthorID": "57199318243", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "The Bartlett Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis, University College London"}, "57198387302": {"Name": "Milton R.", "AuthorID": "57198387302", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "The Bartlett Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis, University College London"}, "15055935100": {"Name": "Hudson-Smith A.", "AuthorID": "15055935100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "The Bartlett Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis, University College London"}}}
