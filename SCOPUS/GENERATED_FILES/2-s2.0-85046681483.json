CO2 adsorption at 1 bar for [Zn2(tdc)2dabco] is 67.4 cm3\u00b7g-1 (13.2 wt %) at 298 K and 153 cm3\u00b7g-1 (30.0 wt %) at 273 K. For [Zn2(bdc)2dabco], the equivalent values are 46 cm3\u00b7g-1 (9.0 wt %) and 122 cm3\u00b7g-1 (23.9 wt %), respectively. The isosteric heat of adsorption for CO2 in [Zn2(tdc)2dabco] at zero coverage is low (23.65 kJ\u00b7mol-1), ensuring facile regeneration of the porous material. Enhancement by the thiophene group on the separation of CO2/N2 gas mixtures has been confirmed by both ideal adsorbate solution theory calculations and dynamic breakthrough experiments. The preferred binding sites of adsorbed CO2 in [Zn2(tdc)2dabco] have been unambiguously determined by in situ single-crystal diffraction studies on CO2-loaded [Zn2(tdc)2dabco], coupled with quantum-chemical calculations. These studies unveil the role of the thiophene moieties in the specific CO2 binding via an induced dipole interaction between CO2 and the sulfur center, confirming that an enhanced CO2 capacity in [Zn2(tdc)2dabco] is achieved without the presence of open metal sites. The experimental data and theoretical insight suggest a viable strategy for improvement of the adsorption properties of already known materials through the incorporation of sulfur-based heterocycles within their porous structures.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85046681483", "SubjectAreas": [["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"], ["Inorganic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1604"]], "AuthorData": {"56498771700": {"Name": "Bolotov V.A.", "AuthorID": "56498771700", "AffiliationID": "60069254, 60017604", "AffiliationName": "Nikolaev Institute of Inorganic Chemistry (NIIC), Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences"}, "8986218200": {"Name": "Kovalenko K.A.", "AuthorID": "8986218200", "AffiliationID": "60002049", "AffiliationName": "Novosibirsk State University"}, "6603747185": {"Name": "Samsonenko D.G.", "AuthorID": "6603747185", "AffiliationID": "60002049", "AffiliationName": "Novosibirsk State University"}, "7006916054": {"Name": "Fedin V.P.", "AuthorID": "7006916054", "AffiliationID": "60002049", "AffiliationName": "Novosibirsk State University"}, "6701446987": {"Name": "Dybtsev D.N.", "AuthorID": "6701446987", "AffiliationID": "60002049", "AffiliationName": "Novosibirsk State University"}, "12753164200": {"Name": "Schr\u00f6der M.", "AuthorID": "12753164200", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, University of Manchester"}, "57201871918": {"Name": "Han X.", "AuthorID": "57201871918", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, University of Manchester"}, "57197738165": {"Name": "Zhang X.", "AuthorID": "57197738165", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, University of Manchester"}, "57201985123": {"Name": "Smith G.L.", "AuthorID": "57201985123", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, University of Manchester"}, "10040815600": {"Name": "Yang S.", "AuthorID": "10040815600", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, University of Manchester"}, "25960200000": {"Name": "McCormick L.J.", "AuthorID": "25960200000", "AffiliationID": "60007174, 60026215", "AffiliationName": "Advanced Light Source, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory"}, "7005644651": {"Name": "Teat S.J.", "AuthorID": "7005644651", "AffiliationID": "60007174, 60026215", "AffiliationName": "Advanced Light Source, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory"}, "54796621200": {"Name": "Lennox M.J.", "AuthorID": "54796621200", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, University of Nottingham"}, "57189599835": {"Name": "Henley A.", "AuthorID": "57189599835", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, University of Nottingham"}, "57092687600": {"Name": "Besley E.", "AuthorID": "57092687600", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, University of Nottingham"}}}
