There is extensive depletion of Mycobacterium tuberculosis-specific CD4+ T cells in blood during early HIV infection, but little is known about responses in the lungs at this stage. Given that mucosal organs are a principal target for HIV-mediated CD4+ T-cell destruction, we investigated M. tuberculosis-specific responses in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) from persons with latent M. tuberculosis infection and untreated HIV coinfection with preserved CD4+ T-cell counts. M. tuberculosis-specific CD4+ T-cell cytokine (interferon ?, tumor necrosis factor a, and interleukin 2) responses were discordant in frequency and function between BAL and blood. Responses in BAL were 15-fold lower in HIV-infected persons as compared to uninfected persons (P = .048), whereas blood responses were 2-fold lower (P = .006). However, an increase in T cells in the airways in HIV-infected persons resulted in the overall number of M. tuberculosis-specific CD4+ T cells in BAL being similar. Our study highlights the important insights gained from studying M. tuberculosis immunity at the site of disease during HIV infection.", "AuthorKeywords": ["adaptive immunity", "bronchoalveolar lavage", "CD4+T-cell responses", "coinfection", "Human immunodeficiency virus", "lung", "Mycobacterium tuberculosis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Blood", "Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid", "CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes", "Coinfection", "Female", "HIV Infections", "Humans", "Interferon-gamma", "Interleukin-2", "Latent Tuberculosis", "Lung", "Male", "Mycobacterium tuberculosis", "Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85040034674", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"55653577100": {"Name": "Bunjun R.", "AuthorID": "55653577100", "AffiliationID": "60000356", "AffiliationName": "Division of Medical Virology, Department of Pathology, University of Cape Town"}, "14028976400": {"Name": "Riou C.", "AuthorID": "14028976400", "AffiliationID": "60000356", "AffiliationName": "Division of Medical Virology, Department of Pathology, University of Cape Town"}, "14830833500": {"Name": "Soares A.", "AuthorID": "14830833500", "AffiliationID": "60000356", "AffiliationName": "Division of Medical Virology, Department of Pathology, University of Cape Town"}, "56596835000": {"Name": "Thawer N.", "AuthorID": "56596835000", "AffiliationID": "60000356", "AffiliationName": "Division of Medical Virology, Department of Pathology, University of Cape Town"}, "26421307700": {"Name": "M\u00fcller T.", "AuthorID": "26421307700", "AffiliationID": "60000356", "AffiliationName": "Division of Medical Virology, Department of Pathology, University of Cape Town"}, "42961671300": {"Name": "Kiravu A.", "AuthorID": "42961671300", "AffiliationID": "60000356", "AffiliationName": "Division of Medical Virology, Department of Pathology, University of Cape Town"}, "50161404200": {"Name": "Ginbot Z.", "AuthorID": "50161404200", "AffiliationID": "60000356", "AffiliationName": "Division of Medical Virology, Department of Pathology, University of Cape Town"}, "26658541700": {"Name": "Oni T.", "AuthorID": "26658541700", "AffiliationID": "60000356", "AffiliationName": "Division of Public Health Medicine, School of Public Health and Family Medicine, University of Cape Town"}, "56736504900": {"Name": "Goliath R.", "AuthorID": "56736504900", "AffiliationID": "60000356", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Centre for Infectious Diseases Research in Africa, University of Cape Town"}, "6603950018": {"Name": "Hanekom W.", "AuthorID": "6603950018", "AffiliationID": "60000356", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Infectious Disease and Molecular Medicine, University of Cape Town"}, "7402272158": {"Name": "Wilkinson R.", "AuthorID": "7402272158", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Imperial College London"}, "8624742500": {"Name": "Burgers W.", "AuthorID": "8624742500", "AffiliationID": "60000356", "AffiliationName": "Division of Medical Virology, Department of Pathology, University of Cape Town"}, "36496028000": {"Name": "Von Groote-Bidlingmaier F.", "AuthorID": "36496028000", "AffiliationID": "60008907", "AffiliationName": "Division of Pulmonology, South Africa Department of Science and Technology-National Research Foundation"}, "56050296500": {"Name": "Walzl G.", "AuthorID": "56050296500", "AffiliationID": "60028973", "AffiliationName": "South African Medical Research Council Centre for Tuberculosis Research"}, "15051842900": {"Name": "Kalsdorf B.", "AuthorID": "15051842900", "AffiliationID": "105950670", "AffiliationName": "Division of Clinical Infectious Diseases, Research Center Borstel"}}}
