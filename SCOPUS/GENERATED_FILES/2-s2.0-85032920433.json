This allows the investigation of functional and structural changes in HD many years prior to disease onset, which may reveal important mechanistic insights into brain function, structure and organization in general. While regional atrophy is present at early stages of HD, it is still unclear if both hemispheres are equally affected by neurodegeneration and how the extent of asymmetry affects domain-specific functional decline. Here, we used whole-brain voxel-based analysis to investigate cross-sectional and longitudinal hemispheric asymmetries in grey matter (GM) volume in 56 manifest HD (mHD), 83 pre-manifest HD (preHD), and 80 healthy controls (HC). Furthermore, a regression analysis was used to assess the relationship between neuroanatomical asymmetries and decline in motor and cognitive measures across the disease spectrum. The cross-sectional analysis showed striatal leftward-biased GM atrophy in mHD, but not in preHD, relative to HC. Longitudinally, no net 36-month change in GM asymmetries was found in any of the groups. In the regression analysis, HD-related decline in quantitative-motor (Q-Motor) performance was linked to lower GM volume in the left superior parietal cortex. These findings suggest a stronger disease effect targeting the left hemisphere, especially in those with declining motor performance. This effect did not change over a period of three years and may indicate a compensatory role of the right hemisphere in line with recent functional imaging studies.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Asymmetries", "Grey matter volume", "Huntington's disease", "MRI", "VBM"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Atrophy", "Brain", "Cognition Disorders", "Correlation of Data", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Female", "Functional Laterality", "Gray Matter", "Humans", "Huntington Disease", "Image Processing, Computer-Assisted", "Longitudinal Studies", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Neuropsychological Tests", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85032920433", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"], ["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"]], "AuthorData": {"56383549500": {"Name": "Minkova L.", "AuthorID": "56383549500", "AffiliationID": "60025641", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Laboratory for Biological and Personality Psychology, University of Freiburg"}, "55640171500": {"Name": "Peter J.", "AuthorID": "55640171500", "AffiliationID": "60010987, 60020486", "AffiliationName": "University Hospital of Old Age Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, University of Bern"}, "23100462800": {"Name": "Kl\u00f6ppel S.", "AuthorID": "23100462800", "AffiliationID": "60010987, 60020486", "AffiliationName": "University Hospital of Old Age Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, University of Bern"}, "8082406600": {"Name": "Kaller C.P.", "AuthorID": "8082406600", "AffiliationID": "60025641", "AffiliationName": "BrainLinks-BrainTools Cluster of Excellence, University of Freiburg"}, "56785241700": {"Name": "Gregory S.", "AuthorID": "56785241700", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60084279, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "6602959028": {"Name": "Scahill R.I.", "AuthorID": "6602959028", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "7006745684": {"Name": "Tabrizi S.J.", "AuthorID": "7006745684", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "42760899800": {"Name": "Abdulkadir A.", "AuthorID": "42760899800", "AffiliationID": "60010987, 60020486", "AffiliationName": "University Hospital of Old Age Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, University of Bern"}, "7403447437": {"Name": "Long J.D.", "AuthorID": "7403447437", "AffiliationID": "60024324", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biostatistics, College of Public Health, The University of Iowa"}, "57205413781": {"Name": "Stout J.C.", "AuthorID": "57205413781", "AffiliationID": "60019578", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology and Psychiatry, Monash University"}, "6602616645": {"Name": "Reilmann R.", "AuthorID": "6602616645", "AffiliationID": "60084331, 60017246", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurodegeneration, Hertie Institute for Clinical Brain Research, University of T\u00fcbingen"}, "7203053136": {"Name": "Roos R.A.", "AuthorID": "7203053136", "AffiliationID": "60015618", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Leiden University Medical Centre"}, "24741153500": {"Name": "Durr A.", "AuthorID": "24741153500", "AffiliationID": "60120341, 60015622, 60021567", "AffiliationName": "APHP Department of Genetics, ICM (Brain and Spine Institute) Piti\u00e9-Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re University Hospital Paris"}, "7005869634": {"Name": "Leavitt B.R.", "AuthorID": "7005869634", "AffiliationID": "60010365", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Molecular Medicine and Therapeutics, Department of Medical Genetics, University of British Columbia"}}}
