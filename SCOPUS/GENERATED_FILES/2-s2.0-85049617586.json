Yet it may only be an effective description of the world, in the same way that classical physics is an effective description of the quantum world. We ask whether there exists an operationally defined theory superseding quantum theory, but which reduces to it via a decoherence-like mechanism. We prove that no such post-quantum theory exists if it is demanded that it satisfy two natural physical principles: causality and purification. Causality formalizes the statement that information propagates from present to future, and purification that each state of incomplete information arises in an essentially unique way due to lack of information about an environment. Hence, our result can be viewed either as evidence that the fundamental theory of Nature is quantum or as showing in a rigorous manner that any post-quantum theory must abandon causality, purification or both.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Decoherence", "Generalized probabilistic theories", "No-go theorem", "Quantum theory"], "IndexKeywords": ["Classical physics", "Decoherence", "Experimental evidence", "Fundamental theory", "Incomplete information", "No-go theorem", "Physical principles", "Probabilistic theory"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85049617586", "SubjectAreas": [["Mathematics (all)", "MATH", "2600"], ["Engineering (all)", "ENGI", "2200"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"56840890800": {"Name": "Lee C.M.", "AuthorID": "56840890800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "57169823900": {"Name": "Selby J.H.", "AuthorID": "57169823900", "AffiliationID": "60031486", "AffiliationName": "Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics"}}}
