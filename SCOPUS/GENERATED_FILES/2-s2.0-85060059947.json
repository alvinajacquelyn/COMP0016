All rights reserved.Our ability to rapidly detect threats is thought to be subserved by a subcortical pathway that quickly conveys visual information to the amygdala. This neural shortcut has been demonstrated in animals but has rarely been shown in the human brain. Importantly, it remains unclear whether such a pathway might influence neural activity and behavior. We conducted a multimodal neuroimaging study of 622 participants from the Human Connectome Project. We applied probabilistic tractography to diffusion-weighted images, reconstructing a subcortical pathway to the amygdala from the superior colliculus via the pulvinar. We then computationally modeled the flow of haemodynamic activity during a face-viewing task and found evidence for a functionally afferent pulvinar-amygdala pathway. Critically, individuals with greater fibre density in this pathway also had stronger dynamic coupling and enhanced fearful face recognition. Our findings provide converging evidence for the recruitment of an afferent subcortical pulvinar connection to the amygdala that facilitates fear recognition.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Afferent Pathways", "Amygdala", "Behavior", "Connectome", "Emotions", "Face", "Fear", "Female", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Oxygen", "Perception", "Probability", "Pulvinar", "Recognition, Psychology", "White Matter", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85060059947", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Immunology and Microbiology (all)", "IMMU", "2400"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"56538356500": {"Name": "McFadyen J.", "AuthorID": "56538356500", "AffiliationID": "114455342", "AffiliationName": "Australian Research Council of Excellence for Integrative Brain Function"}, "7005539263": {"Name": "Mattingley J.B.", "AuthorID": "7005539263", "AffiliationID": "60082875", "AffiliationName": "Canadian Institute for Advanced Research (CIFAR)"}, "16303496900": {"Name": "Garrido M.I.", "AuthorID": "16303496900", "AffiliationID": "60031004", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Advanced Imaging, University of Queensland"}}}
