Archaeologists often interpret such finds as indicators of rank and hierarchy among Pleistocene hunter-gatherers. Interpretations of this kind are difficult to reconcile with the view, still common in sociobiology, that pre-agricultural societies were typically egalitarian in orientation. Here we develop an alternative model of 'Palaeolithic politics', which emphasizes the ability of hunter-gatherers to alternate - consciously and deliberately - between contrasting modes of political organization, including a variety of hierarchical and egalitarian possibilities. We propose that alternations of this sort were an emergent property of human societies in the highly seasonal environments of the last Ice Age. We further consider some implications of the model for received concepts of social evolution, with particular attention to the distinction between 'simple' and 'complex' hunter-gatherers.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84939771832", "SubjectAreas": [["Anthropology", "SOCI", "3314"], ["Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)", "ARTS", "1201"]], "AuthorData": {"6508190872": {"Name": "Wengrow D.", "AuthorID": "6508190872", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Archaeology, University College London"}, "36904550900": {"Name": "Graeber D.", "AuthorID": "36904550900", "AffiliationID": "60003059", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anthropology, London School of Economics and Political Science"}}}
