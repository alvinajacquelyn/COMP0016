FRET between fluorescent proteins should therefore involve multiple energy transfer pathways. We recently demonstrated the FRET pathways between EGFP and mCherry (mC), upon the dimerization of 3-phosphoinositide dependent protein kinase 1 (PDK1), to be highly restricted. A mechanism for FRET restriction based on a highly unfavorable \u03ba2 orientation factor arising from differences in donor-Acceptor transition dipole moment angles in a far from coplanar and near static interaction geometry was proposed. Here this is tested via FRET to mC arising from the association of glutathione (GSH) and glutathione S-Transferase (GST) with an intrinsically homogeneous and more mobile donor Oregon Green 488 (OG). A new analysis of the acceptor window intensity, based on the turnover point of the sensitized fluorescence, is combined with donor window intensity and anisotropy measurements which show that unrestricted FRET to mC takes place. However, a long-lived anisotropy decay component in the donor window reveals a GST-GSH population in which FRET does not occur, explaining previous discrepancies between quantitative FRET measurements of GST-GSH association and their accepted values. This reinforces the importance of the local donor-Acceptor environment in mediating energy transfer and the need to perform spectrally resolved intensity and anisotropy decay measurements in the accurate quantification of fluorescent protein FRET.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Accurate quantifications", "Anisotropy measurements", "Fluorescence decays", "Glutathione S-transferases", "Orientation factors", "Sensitized fluorescence", "Time-resolved fluorescence", "Transition dipole moments"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85027259578", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Energy (all)", "ENER", "2100"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"], ["Surfaces, Coatings and Films", "MATE", "2508"]], "AuthorData": {"35168597900": {"Name": "Blacker T.S.", "AuthorID": "35168597900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University College London"}, "57207731091": {"Name": "Marsh R.J.", "AuthorID": "57207731091", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "7101894757": {"Name": "Bain A.J.", "AuthorID": "7101894757", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Mathematics and Physics in Life Sciences and Experimental Biology, University College London"}, "7005847722": {"Name": "Duchen M.R.", "AuthorID": "7005847722", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University College London"}, "56544799800": {"Name": "Chen W.Y.", "AuthorID": "56544799800", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering and Biotechnology, University of Cambridge"}, "7003673210": {"Name": "Kaminski C.F.", "AuthorID": "7003673210", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering and Biotechnology, University of Cambridge"}, "15724225000": {"Name": "Avezov E.", "AuthorID": "15724225000", "AffiliationID": "60103296, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Cambridge Institute for Medical Research, University of Cambridge"}}}
