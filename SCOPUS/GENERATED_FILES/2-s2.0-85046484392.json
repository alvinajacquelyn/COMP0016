Here we discuss evidence suggesting that perceived threats to control in the power domain are key determinants of the association between power and approach motivation. We propose that objective or subjective threats to the exercise of power trigger behavioral inhibition, conflicts between approach and behavioral inhibition, and reactive, negatively valenced approach motivation. Furthermore, threatened power holders reassert power\u2014in particular by using coercion\u2014as defense against threat. We discuss literature in support of these hypotheses involving external threats (e.g., instability, illegitimacy, and uncertainty) and subjective states (anxiety, motivation to maintain power, perceived incompetence, submissiveness, and perceptions of low power) that trigger the perception of lack of control in the power domain and undermine the positive tone of power holders' approach motivation.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85046484392", "SubjectAreas": [["Social Psychology", "PSYC", "3207"]], "AuthorData": {"57200532938": {"Name": "Deng M.", "AuthorID": "57200532938", "AffiliationID": "60021200", "AffiliationName": "East China Normal University"}, "57201911792": {"Name": "Zheng M.", "AuthorID": "57201911792", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "17345779900": {"Name": "Guinote A.", "AuthorID": "17345779900", "AffiliationID": "60079654", "AffiliationName": "Nova School of Business and Economics"}}}
