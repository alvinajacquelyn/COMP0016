It is an autoimmune disease occurring in genetically susceptible individuals and clinically presents as bilateral panuveitis with serous retinal detachments and hyperemic, swollen optic discs, which are associated with neurological and auditory manifestations. Early diagnosis and prompt and adequate treatment with immunosuppressive agents (corticosteroids and other immunosuppressive drugs) may halt disease progression and prevent recurrences and vision loss. This review summarizes the current knowledge on the variable clinical aspects of this disease, highlighting diagnostic and treatment strategies.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Corticosteroid", "Multifocal choroiditis", "Panuveitis", "Serous retinal detachment", "Starry sky", "Sunset glow fundus"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85003533161", "SubjectAreas": [["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"]], "AuthorData": {"36503456100": {"Name": "Baltmr A.", "AuthorID": "36503456100", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Uveitis Service, Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "15035438500": {"Name": "Lightman S.", "AuthorID": "15035438500", "AffiliationID": "60013148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Ophthalmology, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "57201661157": {"Name": "Tomkins-Netzer O.", "AuthorID": "57201661157", "AffiliationID": "60029896, 60022403", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Medicine, Technion, Israel Institute of Technology"}}}
