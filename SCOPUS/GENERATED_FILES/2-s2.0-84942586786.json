Should I invest in shares or keep my money under the bed?. We all face a perplexing array of decisions every day. Thoroughly revised and updated throughout, the new edition of Straight Choices provides an integrative account of the psychology of decision-making, and shows how psychological research can help us understand our uncertain world. Straight Choices emphasises the relationship between learning and decision-making, arguing that the best way to understand how and why decisions are made is in the context of the learning and knowledge acquisition which precedes them, and the feedback which follows. The mechanisms of learning and the structure of environments in which decisions are made are carefully examined to explore their impact on our choices. The authors then consider whether we are all constrained to fall prey to cognitive biases, or whether, with sufficient exposure, we can find optimal decision strategies and improve our decision making. Featuring three completely new chapters, this edition also contains student-friendly overviews and recommended readings in each chapter. It will be of interest to students and researchers in cognitive psychology, behavioral economics, and the decision sciences, as well as anyone interested in the nature of decision making.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84942586786", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychology (all)", "PSYC", "3200"]], "AuthorData": {"7003401856": {"Name": "Newell B.R.", "AuthorID": "7003401856", "AffiliationID": "60028333", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, University of New South Wales"}, "6507379819": {"Name": "Lagnado D.A.", "AuthorID": "6507379819", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychology and Language Sciences, University College London"}, "7005569087": {"Name": "Shanks D.R.", "AuthorID": "7005569087", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
