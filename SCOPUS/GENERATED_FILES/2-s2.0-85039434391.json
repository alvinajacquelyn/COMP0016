Objectives: We critically discuss evidence for a monotonic response in effect size with increasing current intensity, with a specific focus on a question if increasing applied current enhance the efficacy of tDCS. Methods: We analyzed tDCS intensity does-response from different perspectives including biophysical modeling, animal modeling, human neurophysiology, neuroimaging and behavioral/clinical measures. Further, we discuss approaches to design dose-response trials. Results: Physical models predict electric field in the brain increases with applied tDCS intensity. Data from animal studies are lacking since a range of relevant low-intensities is rarely tested. Results from imaging studies are ambiguous while human neurophysiology, including using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) as a probe, suggests a complex state-dependent non-monotonic dose response. The diffusivity of brain current flow produced by conventional tDCS montages complicates this analysis, with relatively few studies on focal High Definition (HD)-tDCS. In behavioral and clinical trials, only a limited range of intensities (1-2 mA), and typically just one intensity, are conventionally tested; moreover, outcomes are subject brain-state dependent. Measurements and models of current flow show that for the same applied current, substantial differences in brain current occur across individuals. Trials are thus subject to inter-individual differences that complicate consideration of population-level dose response. Conclusion: The presence or absence of simple dose response does not impact how efficacious a given tDCS dose is for a given indication. Understanding dose-response in human applications of tDCS is needed for protocol optimization including individualized dose to reduce outcome variability, which requires intelligent design of dose-response studies.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Dose-control", "Dose-response", "Neuromodulation", "Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Brain", "Humans", "Individuality", "Neuroimaging", "Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation", "Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85039434391", "SubjectAreas": [["Biophysics", "BIOC", "1304"], ["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"57215183601": {"Name": "Esmaeilpour Z.", "AuthorID": "57215183601", "AffiliationID": "60007751", "AffiliationName": "Biomedical Engineering Department, Amirkabir University of Technology"}, "6602932724": {"Name": "Bikson M.", "AuthorID": "6602932724", "AffiliationID": "60028458, 60007033", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, The City College of New York of CUNY"}, "6603706176": {"Name": "Marangolo P.", "AuthorID": "6603706176", "AffiliationID": "60017293, 60014416", "AffiliationName": "Dipartimento di Studi Umanistici, University Federico II, Naples and IRCCS Fondazione Santa Lucia"}, "6506422692": {"Name": "Hampstead B.M.", "AuthorID": "6506422692", "AffiliationID": "60025778", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, University of Michigan"}, "57218666851": {"Name": "Bestmann S.", "AuthorID": "57218666851", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Sobell Department of Motor Neuroscience and Movement Disorders, UCL Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "6507548497": {"Name": "Galletta E.", "AuthorID": "6507548497", "AffiliationID": "60032105", "AffiliationName": "Rusk Rehabilitation Medicine, New York University Langone Medical Center"}, "55904998000": {"Name": "Knotkova H.", "AuthorID": "55904998000", "AffiliationID": "60002388", "AffiliationName": "Department of Family and Social Medicine, Albert Einstein College of Medicine"}}}
