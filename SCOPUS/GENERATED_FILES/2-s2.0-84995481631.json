Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd.Eukaryogenesis - the emergence of eukaryotic cells - represents a pivotal evolutionary event. With a fundamentally more complex cellular plan compared to prokaryotes, eukaryotes are major contributors to most aspects of life on Earth. For decades, we have understood that eukaryotic origins lie within both the Archaea domain and a-Proteobacteria. However, it is much less clear when, and from which precise ancestors, eukaryotes originated, or the order of emergence of distinctive eukaryotic cellular features. Many competing models for eukaryogenesis have been proposed, but until recently, the absence of discriminatory data meant that a consensus was elusive. Recent advances in paleogeology, phylogenetics, cell biology and microbial diversity, particularly the discovery of the 'Candidatus Lokiarcheaota' phylum, are now providing new insights into these aspects of eukaryogenesis. The new data have allowed the time frame during which eukaryogenesis occurred to be finessed, a more precise identification of the contributing lineages and the biological features of the contributors to be clarified. Considerable advances have now been used to pinpoint the prokaryotic origins of key eukaryotic cellular processes, such as intracellular compartmentalisation, with major implications for models of eukaryogenesis.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Archaea", "Archaeogenesis", "Chemical fossil", "Endosymbiosis", "Eukaryogenesis", "Evolution", "First eukaryotic common ancestor", "Last eukaryotic common ancestor", "Molecular dating", "Molecular fossil"], "IndexKeywords": ["Archaea", "Eukaryotic Cells", "Fossils", "Phylogeny", "Prokaryotic Cells", "Time Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84995481631", "SubjectAreas": [["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"56490454700": {"Name": "Dacks J.B.", "AuthorID": "56490454700", "AffiliationID": "60030835", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell Biology, University of Alberta"}, "7201475745": {"Name": "Field M.C.", "AuthorID": "7201475745", "AffiliationID": "60008877", "AffiliationName": "School of Life Sciences, University of Dundee"}, "7005378854": {"Name": "Buick R.", "AuthorID": "7005378854", "AffiliationID": "60015481", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth and Space Science and Astrobiology Program, University of Washington"}, "26433309900": {"Name": "Eme L.", "AuthorID": "26433309900", "AffiliationID": "60023750", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Comparative Genomics and Evolutionary Bioinformatics, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Dalhousie University"}, "7004844245": {"Name": "Roger A.J.", "AuthorID": "7004844245", "AffiliationID": "60023750", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Comparative Genomics and Evolutionary Bioinformatics, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Dalhousie University"}, "6602954470": {"Name": "Gribaldo S.", "AuthorID": "6602954470", "AffiliationID": "60001772", "AffiliationName": "Institut Pasteur, D\u00e9partement de Microbiologie, Unit\u00e9 de Biologie Moleculaire du Gene chez les Extremophiles"}, "14123116300": {"Name": "Brochier-Armanet C.", "AuthorID": "14123116300", "AffiliationID": "60102126, 60008134", "AffiliationName": "Universit\u00e9de Lyon, Universit\u00e9Lyon 1,CNRS,UMR5558, Laboratoire de Biom\u00e9trie et Biologie Evolutive"}, "7004062844": {"Name": "Devos D.P.", "AuthorID": "7004062844", "AffiliationID": "60030114, 60103756", "AffiliationName": "Centro Andaluz de Biologi\u00e1 del Desarrollo (CABD), Universidad Pablo de Olavide"}}}
