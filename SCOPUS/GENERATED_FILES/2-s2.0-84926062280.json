Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.Aim To systematically assess the efficacy of oral health behaviour change counselling for tobacco use cessation (TUC) and the promotion of healthy lifestyles. Materials and Methods Systematic Reviews, Randomized (RCTs), and Controlled Clinical Trials (CCTs) were identified through an electronic search of four databases complemented by manual search. Identification, screening, eligibility and inclusion of studies were performed independently by two reviewers. Quality assessment of the included publications was performed according to the AMSTAR tool for the assessment of the methodological quality of systematic reviews. Results A total of seven systematic reviews were included. With the exception of inadequate oral hygiene, the following unhealthy lifestyles related with periodontal diseases were investigated: tobacco use, unhealthy diets, harmful use of alcohol, physical inactivity, and stress. Brief interventions for TUC were shown to be effective when applied in the dental practice setting while evidence for dietary counselling and the promotion of other healthy lifestyles was limited or non-existent. Conclusions While aiming to improve periodontal treatment outcomes and the maintenance of periodontal health current evidence suggests that tobacco use brief interventions conducted in the dental practice setting were effective thus underlining the rational for behavioural support.", "AuthorKeywords": ["behaviour change counselling", "health promotion", "smoking cessation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Alcohol Drinking", "Counseling", "Diet", "Health Behavior", "Health Promotion", "Humans", "Life Style", "Oral Health", "Periodontal Diseases", "Sedentary Lifestyle", "Stress, Psychological", "Tobacco Use Cessation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84926062280", "SubjectAreas": [["Periodontics", "DENT", "3506"]], "AuthorData": {"55356626000": {"Name": "Ramseier C.", "AuthorID": "55356626000", "AffiliationID": "60020486", "AffiliationName": "Department of Periodontology, School of Dental Medicine, University of Bern"}, "19637686000": {"Name": "Suvan J.", "AuthorID": "19637686000", "AffiliationID": "60013985", "AffiliationName": "Unit of Periodontology, UCL Eastman Dental Institute"}}}
