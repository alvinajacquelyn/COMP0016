Even though it remains unclear how pathogenic mutations affect LRRK2 to cause PD, recent findings provide increasing cause for optimism. We summarise here the developing consensus over the effect of pathogenic mutations in the Ras of complex proteins and C-terminal of Roc domains on LRRK2 GTPase activity. This body of work has been greatly reinforced by our own study of the protective R1398H variant contained within the LRRK2 GTPase domain. Collectively, data point towards the pathogenicity of GTP-bound LRRK2 and strengthen a working model for LRRK2 GTPase function as a GTPase activated by dimerisation. Together with the identification of the protective R1398H variant as a valuable control for pathogenic mutations, we have no doubt that these triumphs for the LRRK2 field will accelerate research towards resolving LRRK2 function and towards new treatments for PD.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["GTP Phosphohydrolases", "Humans", "Leucine-Rich Repeat Serine-Threonine Protein Kinase-2", "Models, Genetic", "Mutation", "Parkinson Disease", "Protein Binding", "Protein Domains", "Protein Multimerization"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85009904503", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"]], "AuthorData": {"57188567996": {"Name": "Nixon-Abell J.", "AuthorID": "57188567996", "AffiliationID": "60013780, 60006577", "AffiliationName": "Neurogenetics Branch, National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, National Institutes of Health"}, "7102029918": {"Name": "Harvey K.", "AuthorID": "7102029918", "AffiliationID": "60016379, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacology, UCL School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "7102127302": {"Name": "Berwick D.", "AuthorID": "7102127302", "AffiliationID": "60012113", "AffiliationName": "Department of Life, Health and Chemical Sciences, Open University"}}}
