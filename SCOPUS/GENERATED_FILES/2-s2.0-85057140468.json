The development of the synthetic mid-urethral tape signalled a revolution in the treatment of stress urinary incontinence, whilst the use of mesh in abdominal apical prolapse repair may confer benefits over native tissue alternatives. However, these procedures can be associated with mesh-specific complications, underlining the need for shared decision-making between physicians and patients prior to mesh surgery. Transvaginal non-absorbable mesh implants for pelvic organ prolapse are associated with a high risk of serious adverse events, leading to withdrawal or restricted use in many countries. Increased scrutiny has led to growing concerns about complications associated with all types of mesh-augmented reconstructive surgery, attracting widespread media attention. National and international reports have been commissioned examining the safety and efficacy of mesh surgery in gynaecology. They have all highlighted systemic failures in the development, regulation and clinical adoption of medical devices. The widespread application of novel devices prior to the availability of reliable safety and efficacy data, and delayed recognition of adverse events, is of serious concern. Notwithstanding, the available data continue to support a role for mesh augmentation. This review outlines the evolution of gynaecological mesh, the safety and efficacy of pelvic floor surgery using non-absorbable mesh materials, and an overview of specific complications.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Laparoscopy", "Pelvic organ prolapse", "Surgical mesh", "Urinary incontinence"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85057140468", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Obstetrics and Gynecology", "MEDI", "2729"]], "AuthorData": {"56679067900": {"Name": "Izett M.", "AuthorID": "56679067900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Women\u2019s Health, University College London"}, "55547210700": {"Name": "Kupelian A.", "AuthorID": "55547210700", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Urogynaecology and Pelvic Floor Unit, University College London Hospital, Clinic 2"}, "6603437159": {"Name": "Vashisht A.", "AuthorID": "6603437159", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Women\u2019s Health, University College London"}}}
