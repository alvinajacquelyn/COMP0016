Involvement of microglia and complement in AD has been attributed to neuroinflammation, prominent late in disease. Here we show in mouse models that complement and microglia mediate synaptic loss early in AD. C1q, the initiating protein of the classical complement cascade, is increased and associated with synapses before overt plaque deposition. Inhibition of C1q, C3, or the microglial complement receptor CR3 reduces the number of phagocytic microglia, as well as the extent of early synapse loss. C1q is necessary for the toxic effects of soluble \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2) oligomers on synapses and hippocampal long-term potentiation. Finally, microglia in adult brains engulf synaptic material in a CR3-dependent process when exposed to soluble A\u03b2 oligomers. Together, these findings suggest that the complement-dependent pathway and microglia that prune excess synapses in development are inappropriately activated and mediate synapse loss in AD.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Alzheimer Disease", "Amyloid beta-Peptides", "Animals", "CA1 Region, Hippocampal", "Cognition Disorders", "Complement C1q", "Complement Pathway, Classical", "Disease Models, Animal", "Guanylate Kinase", "Long-Term Potentiation", "Macrophage-1 Antigen", "Membrane Proteins", "Mice", "Mice, Knockout", "Microglia", "Phagocytosis", "Plaque, Amyloid", "Synapses", "Synaptophysin", "Up-Regulation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84962418507", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"55570445500": {"Name": "Hong S.", "AuthorID": "55570445500", "AffiliationID": "60030521, 60002746", "AffiliationName": "F.M.
