Such phase and frequency locked optical oscillators are of great interest for sensing, spectroscopy, and optical communication applications, where coherent detection offers advantages of higher sensitivity and spectral efficiency than can be achieved with direct detection. As explained in this paper, the fundamental difficulty in realising an OPLL is related to the limitations on loop bandwidth and propagation delay as a function of laser linewidth. In particular, the relatively wide linewidth of semiconductor lasers requires short delay, which can only be achieved through shortening of the feedback path, which is greatly facilitated through photonic integration. This paper reviews the advances in the development of semiconductor laser-based OPLLs and describes how improvements in performance have been enabled by improvements in photonic integration technology. We also describe the first OPLL created using foundry fabricated photonic integrated circuits and off-the-shelf electronic components. Stable locking has been achieved for offset frequencies between 4 and 12 GHz with a heterodyne phase noise below -100 dBc/Hz at 10 kHz offset. This is the highest performance yet reported for a monolithically integrated OPLL and demonstrates the attractiveness of the foundry fabrication approach.", "AuthorKeywords": ["microwave photonics", "Optical phase locked loops", "photonic integrated circuits", "semiconductor laser"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adjustable frequency", "Communication application", "Microwave Photonics", "Monolithically integrated", "Optical phase locked loops", "Photonic integrated circuits", "Photonic integrations", "Spectral efficiencies"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85029232657", "SubjectAreas": [["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"55635480300": {"Name": "Balakier K.", "AuthorID": "55635480300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "8276654100": {"Name": "Ponnampalam L.", "AuthorID": "8276654100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "6701843369": {"Name": "Fice M.", "AuthorID": "6701843369", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "7006454070": {"Name": "Renaud C.", "AuthorID": "7006454070", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "7004751445": {"Name": "Seeds A.", "AuthorID": "7004751445", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}}}
