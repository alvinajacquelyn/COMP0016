The objective of the present study was to assess whether variations in contamination profiles are indicative of social structures of young male sperm whales as they might reflect a variation in feeding preferences and/or in utilized feeding grounds. We used a total of 61 variables associated with organic compounds and trace element concentrations measured in muscle, liver, kidney and blubber gained from 24 sperm whales that stranded in the North Sea in January and February 2016. Combining contaminant and genetic data, there is evidence for at least two cohorts with different origin among these stranded sperm whales; one from the Canary Island region and one from the northern part of the Atlantic. While genetic data unravel relatedness and kinship, contamination data integrate over areas, where animals occured during their lifetime. Especially in long-lived animals with a large migratory potential, as sperm whales, contamination data may carry highly relevant information about aggregation through time and space.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Behavior, Animal", "DNA, Mitochondrial", "Environmental Monitoring", "Haplotypes", "Kidney", "Liver", "Male", "Muscles", "North Sea", "Social Behavior", "Sperm Whale", "Trace Elements", "Water Pollutants, Chemical"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85050625812", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"24491392700": {"Name": "Schnitzler J.G.", "AuthorID": "24491392700", "AffiliationID": "60011610", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Terrestrial and Aquatic Wildlife Research, University of Veterinary Medicine Hannover, Foundation"}, "50263380000": {"Name": "van Neer A.", "AuthorID": "50263380000", "AffiliationID": "60011610", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Terrestrial and Aquatic Wildlife Research, University of Veterinary Medicine Hannover, Foundation"}, "57200014326": {"Name": "Schaffeld T.", "AuthorID": "57200014326", "AffiliationID": "60011610", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Terrestrial and Aquatic Wildlife Research, University of Veterinary Medicine Hannover, Foundation"}, "7004796609": {"Name": "Siebert U.", "AuthorID": "7004796609", "AffiliationID": "60011610", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Terrestrial and Aquatic Wildlife Research, University of Veterinary Medicine Hannover, Foundation"}, "56717480800": {"Name": "Pinzone M.", "AuthorID": "56717480800", "AffiliationID": "60000964", "AffiliationName": "Freshwater and Oceanic sciences Unit of reSearch - Oceanology, University of Li\u00e8ge"}, "7402224112": {"Name": "Das K.", "AuthorID": "7402224112", "AffiliationID": "60000964", "AffiliationName": "Freshwater and Oceanic sciences Unit of reSearch - Oceanology, University of Li\u00e8ge"}, "57196465771": {"Name": "Autenrieth M.", "AuthorID": "57196465771", "AffiliationID": "60021763", "AffiliationName": "Unit of Evolutionary Biology/Systematic Zoology, Institute for Biochemistry and Biology, University of Potsdam"}, "57201455802": {"Name": "Tiedemann R.", "AuthorID": "57201455802", "AffiliationID": "60021763", "AffiliationName": "Unit of Evolutionary Biology/Systematic Zoology, Institute for Biochemistry and Biology, University of Potsdam"}, "56401851100": {"Name": "Ijsseldijk L.L.", "AuthorID": "56401851100", "AffiliationID": "60117218, 60117220, 60007989", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Department of Pathobiology, Utrecht University"}, "7402350646": {"Name": "Barber J.L.", "AuthorID": "7402350646", "AffiliationID": "60016939", "AffiliationName": "Centre for the Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science (Cefas) Lowestoft Laboratory"}, "6603658704": {"Name": "Deaville R.", "AuthorID": "6603658704", "AffiliationID": "60005453", "AffiliationName": "CSIP, Institute of Zoology"}, "7006738308": {"Name": "Jepson P.", "AuthorID": "7006738308", "AffiliationID": "60005453", "AffiliationName": "CSIP, Institute of Zoology"}, "55245783300": {"Name": "Brownlow A.", "AuthorID": "55245783300", "AffiliationID": "60107757", "AffiliationName": "SRUC Wildlife Unit, Drummondhill"}, "7101726520": {"Name": "Thom\u00e9 J.P.", "AuthorID": "7101726520", "AffiliationID": "60000964", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Animal Ecology and Ecotoxicology (CART-LEAE) B6c, Li\u00e8ge University"}}}
