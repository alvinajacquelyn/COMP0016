Organismal inactivation of PI3K-C2\u03b2 increases insulin signalling and sensitivity, whereas PI3K-C2\u03b3 inactivation has a negative metabolic impact. In contrast, the role of PI3K-C2\u03b1 in organismal metabolism remains unexplored. In this study, we investigated whether kinase inactivation of PI3K-C2\u03b1 affects glucose metabolism in mice. Methods: We have generated and characterised a mouse line with a constitutive inactivating knock-in (KI) mutation in the kinase domain of the gene encoding PI3K-C2\u03b1 (Pik3c2a). Results: While homozygosity for kinase-dead PI3K-C2\u03b1 was embryonic lethal, heterozygous PI3K-C2\u03b1 KI mice were viable and fertile, with no significant histopathological findings. However, male heterozygous mice showed early onset leptin resistance, with a defect in leptin signalling in the hypothalamus, correlating with a mild, age-dependent obesity, insulin resistance and glucose intolerance. Insulin signalling was unaffected in insulin target tissues of PI3K-C2\u03b1 KI mice, in contrast to previous reports in which downregulation of PI3K-C2\u03b1 in cell lines was shown to dampen insulin signalling. Interestingly, no metabolic phenotypes were detected in female PI3K-C2\u03b1 KI mice at any age. Conclusions/interpretation: Our data uncover a sex-dependent role for PI3K-C2\u03b1 in the modulation of hypothalamic leptin action and systemic glucose homeostasis.
