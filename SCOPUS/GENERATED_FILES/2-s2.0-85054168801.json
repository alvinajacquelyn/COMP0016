The ability to accurately reconstruct [Ba]sw will provide key constraints on these processes in the past. The geochemistry of cold-water corals has the potential to unlock paleoceanographic records at spatial and temporal resolutions not available using other sedimentary archives. Previous studies have suggested that the Ba/Ca ratio of coral skeletons is linearly related to [Ba]sw. However, these efforts have used a limited number of species, sparse global seawater databases, or have not explicitly measured the Ba/Ca ratio. Here we investigate the Ba/Ca ratio in a well-constrained set of cold-water scleractinian (aragonitic) corals as a proxy for [Ba]sw, using 58 specimens from 7 coral genera along with co-located measurements of [Ba]sw. We find that traditional chemical cleaning procedures do not significantly affect the Ba/Ca ratio of cold-water coral skeletons, allowing rapid sample throughput. We also determine that intra-sample variation in Ba/Ca ratios can be reduced by using larger sample sizes (e.g. 20 mg). By combining our results with existing data, we find that cold-water coral Ba/Ca is linearly related to [Ba]sw according to the relationship: Ba/Ca \u03bcmol/mol = [0.15 \u00b1 0.02] [Basw nmol/kg] + [2.5 \u00b1 1.4], (R2 = 0.7). We observe no species-specific \u2018vital effects\u2019 in cold-water coral Ba/Ca ratios, but site-specific effects could be a factor. Nevertheless, our results highlight the potential of Ba/Ca in cold-water corals to reconstruct biological and physical changes in the ocean interior.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Ba/Ca", "Barium", "Calibration", "Cold-water coral", "Coral"], "IndexKeywords": ["Barium concentrations", "Biological productivity", "Cleaning procedures", "Cold-water corals", "Coral", "Ocean circulation", "Spatial and temporal resolutions", "Species specifics"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85054168801", "SubjectAreas": [["Geology", "EART", "1907"], ["Geochemistry and Petrology", "EART", "1906"]], "AuthorData": {"55905482400": {"Name": "Spooner P.", "AuthorID": "55905482400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography, University College London"}, "7202234116": {"Name": "Robinson L.", "AuthorID": "7202234116", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "School of Earth Sciences, University of Bristol"}, "36921193800": {"Name": "Morris P.", "AuthorID": "36921193800", "AffiliationID": "60072604", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nuclear Sciences and Applications, International Atomic Energy Agency"}, "56706757900": {"Name": "Stewart J.", "AuthorID": "56706757900", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "School of Earth Sciences, University of Bristol"}, "57190075292": {"Name": "Hemsing F.", "AuthorID": "57190075292", "AffiliationID": "60016908", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Environmental Physics, Heidelberg University"}}}
