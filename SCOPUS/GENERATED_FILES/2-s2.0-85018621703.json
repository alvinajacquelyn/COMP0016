We therefore applied three different MI tasks (one mental chronometry task, one mental rotation task, and one EEG-based neurofeedback task) to a sample of postacute stroke patients (n=20) and age-matched healthy controls (n=20) for addressing the following questions: First, which of the MI tasks indicate impairment in stroke patients and are impairments restricted to the paretic side? Second, is there a relationship between MI impairment and sensory loss or paresis severity? And third, do the results of the different MI tasks converge? Significant differences between the stroke and control groups were found in all three MI tasks. However, only the mental chronometry task and EEG analysis revealed paresis side-specific effects. Moreover, sensitivity loss contributed to a performance drop in the mental rotation task. The findings indicate that although MI abilities may be impaired after stroke, most patients retain their ability for MI EEG-based neurofeedback. Interestingly, performance in the different MI measures did not strongly correlate, neither in stroke patients nor in healthy controls. We conclude that one MI measure is not sufficient to fully assess an individual's MI abilities.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Electroencephalography", "Female", "Functional Laterality", "Humans", "Imagery (Psychotherapy)", "Imagination", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Motor Activity", "Neurofeedback", "Psychomotor Performance", "Stroke"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85018621703", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"55972275100": {"Name": "Braun N.", "AuthorID": "55972275100", "AffiliationID": "60020306", "AffiliationName": "Neuropsychology Lab, Department of Psychology, University of Oldenburg"}, "15077752900": {"Name": "Kranczioch C.", "AuthorID": "15077752900", "AffiliationID": "60020306", "AffiliationName": "Neuropsychology Lab, Department of Psychology, University of Oldenburg"}, "55916575100": {"Name": "Zich C.", "AuthorID": "55916575100", "AffiliationID": "60020306", "AffiliationName": "Neuropsychology Lab, Department of Psychology, University of Oldenburg"}, "6601953065": {"Name": "Debener S.", "AuthorID": "6601953065", "AffiliationID": "60020306", "AffiliationName": "Research Center Neurosensory Science, University of Oldenburg"}, "26643111200": {"Name": "Liepert J.", "AuthorID": "26643111200", "AffiliationID": "60006958", "AffiliationName": "Kliniken Schmieder Allensbach"}, "57185346300": {"Name": "B\u00fcsching I.", "AuthorID": "57185346300", "AffiliationID": "60020306", "AffiliationName": "Cluster of Excellence Hearing4All, University of Oldenburg"}, "7005534204": {"Name": "Dettmers C.", "AuthorID": "7005534204", "AffiliationID": "100379874", "AffiliationName": "Kliniken Schmieder Konstanz"}}}
