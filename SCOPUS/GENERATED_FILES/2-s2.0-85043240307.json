Methods: A retrospective analysis of a prospectively collected database of non-echo-planar diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging studies (using a half-Fourier single-shot turbo-spin echo sequence) was conducted. Clinical records were retrospectively reviewed to determine indications for imaging and operative findings. Seventy-eight investigations in 74 patients with suspected cholesteatoma aged 5.7-79.2 years (mean, 41.7 years) were identified. Operative confirmation was available in 44 ears. Diagnostic accuracy of the imaging technique was calculated using operative findings as a 'gold standard'. Sensitivity of the investigation was examined via comparison with clinically evident cholesteatoma. Results: The accuracy of diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging in assessment of suspected cholesteatoma was 63.6 per cent. The imaging technique was significantly less accurate in assessment of suspected cholesteatoma than clinically evident disease (p < 0.001). Conclusion: Computed tomography and diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging may be complementary in assessment of suspected cholesteatoma, but should be used with caution, and clinical judgement is paramount.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cholesteatoma", "Diffusion Weighted MRI", "Otitis Media", "Tympanic Membrane"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Cholesteatoma, Middle Ear", "Databases, Factual", "Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Echo-Planar Imaging", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Retrospective Studies", "Sensitivity and Specificity", "Tomography, X-Ray Computed", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85043240307", "SubjectAreas": [["Otorhinolaryngology", "MEDI", "2733"]], "AuthorData": {"35094398700": {"Name": "Nash R.", "AuthorID": "35094398700", "AffiliationID": "60031535", "AffiliationName": "Department of Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery, Northwick Park Hospital"}, "38060990300": {"Name": "Chandrasekharan D.", "AuthorID": "38060990300", "AffiliationID": "60031535", "AffiliationName": "Department of Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery, Northwick Park Hospital"}, "57210906749": {"Name": "Singh A.", "AuthorID": "57210906749", "AffiliationID": "60031535", "AffiliationName": "Department of Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery, Northwick Park Hospital"}, "6701750965": {"Name": "Lingam R.", "AuthorID": "6701750965", "AffiliationID": "60031535", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Northwick Park Hospital"}}}
