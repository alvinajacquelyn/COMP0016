Furthermore, there remains uncertainty regarding the relative importance of small areas of strong methanogenic activity, vs. larger areas with net CH<inf>4</inf> uptake, in controlling landscape-level fluxes. We measured CH<inf>4</inf> fluxes from multiple microtopographical subunits (sedge-dominated lawns, interhummocks and hummocks) within an aapa mire in subarctic Finland, as well as in drier ecosystems present in the wider landscape, lichen heath and mountain birch forest. An intercomparison was carried out between fluxes measured using static chambers, up-scaled using a high-resolution landcover map derived from aerial photography and eddy covariance. Strong agreement was observed between the two methodologies, with emission rates greatest in lawns. CH<inf>4</inf> fluxes from lawns were strongly related to seasonal fluctuations in temperature, but their floating nature meant that water-table depth was not a key factor in controlling CH<inf>4</inf> release. In contrast, chamber measurements identified net CH<inf>4</inf> uptake in birch forest soils. An intercomparison between the aerial photography and satellite remote sensing demonstrated that quantifying the distribution of the key CH<inf>4</inf> emitting and consuming plant communities was possible from satellite, allowing fluxes to be scaled up to a 100 km<sup>2</sup> area. For the full growing season (May to October), ~ 1.1-1.4 g CH<inf>4</inf> m<sup>-2</sup> was released across the 100 km<sup>2</sup> area. This was based on up-scaled lawn emissions of 1.2-1.5 g CH<inf>4</inf> m<sup>-2</sup>, vs. an up-scaled uptake of 0.07-0.15 g CH<inf>4</inf> m<sup>-2</sup> by the wider landscape. Given the strong temperature sensitivity of the dominant lawn fluxes, and the fact that lawns are unlikely to dry out, climate warming may substantially increase CH<inf>4</inf> emissions in northern Finland, and in aapa mire regions in general.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Aapa mire", "Arctic", "Climate change", "Eddy covariance", "Methane oxidation", "Methanogenesis", "Remote sensing", "Static chambers"], "IndexKeywords": ["Arctic Regions", "Climate Change", "Finland", "Forests", "Methane", "Wetlands"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84941023836", "SubjectAreas": [["Global and Planetary Change", "ENVI", "2306"], ["Environmental Chemistry", "ENVI", "2304"], ["Ecology", "ENVI", "2303"], ["Environmental Science (all)", "ENVI", "2300"]], "AuthorData": {"14527027700": {"Name": "Hartley I.P.", "AuthorID": "14527027700", "AffiliationID": "60026479", "AffiliationName": "Geography, College of Life and Environmental Sciences, University of Exeter"}, "35219951700": {"Name": "Hill T.C.", "AuthorID": "35219951700", "AffiliationID": "60022132", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth and Environmental Science, University of St Andrews"}, "55754613800": {"Name": "Wade T.J.", "AuthorID": "55754613800", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "School of Geosciences, University of Edinburgh"}, "7201970424": {"Name": "Clement R.J.", "AuthorID": "7201970424", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "School of Geosciences, University of Edinburgh"}, "7006287459": {"Name": "Moncrieff J.B.", "AuthorID": "7006287459", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "School of Geosciences, University of Edinburgh"}, "35461262000": {"Name": "Williams M.", "AuthorID": "35461262000", "AffiliationID": "60007317", "AffiliationName": "NERC National Centre for Earth Observation (NCEO)"}, "26221895000": {"Name": "Prieto-Blanco A.", "AuthorID": "26221895000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography, University College London"}, "7006197933": {"Name": "Disney M.I.", "AuthorID": "7006197933", "AffiliationID": "60007317", "AffiliationName": "NERC National Centre for Earth Observation (NCEO)"}, "7006755089": {"Name": "Huntley B.", "AuthorID": "7006755089", "AffiliationID": "60022175", "AffiliationName": "School of Biological and Biomedical Sciences, University of Durham"}, "57210724003": {"Name": "Baxter R.", "AuthorID": "57210724003", "AffiliationID": "60022175", "AffiliationName": "School of Biological and Biomedical Sciences, University of Durham"}, "6602209061": {"Name": "Howden N.J.K.", "AuthorID": "6602209061", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "Queen's School of Engineering, University of Bristol"}, "7004647991": {"Name": "Wookey P.A.", "AuthorID": "7004647991", "AffiliationID": "60019656", "AffiliationName": "School of Life Sciences, Heriot-Watt University"}}}
