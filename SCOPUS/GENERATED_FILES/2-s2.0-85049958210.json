Child Development \u00a9 2017 Society for Research in Child Development, Inc.Emotional eating, that is, eating more in response to negative mood, is often seen in children. But the origins of emotional eating remain unclear. In a representative community sample of Norwegian 4-year-olds followed up at ages 6, 8, and 10 years (analysis sample: n = 801), one potential developmental pathway was examined: a reciprocal relation between parental emotional feeding and child emotional eating. The results revealed that higher levels of emotional feeding predicted higher levels of emotional eating and vice versa, adjusting for body mass index and initial levels of feeding and eating. Higher levels of temperamental negative affectivity (at age 4) increased the risk for future emotional eating and feeding.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Affect", "Body Mass Index", "Child", "Child Behavior", "Child, Preschool", "Eating", "Emotions", "Feeding Behavior", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Norway", "Parent-Child Relations", "Parents", "Problem Behavior", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "Temperament"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85049958210", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"]], "AuthorData": {"34873706500": {"Name": "Steinsbekk S.", "AuthorID": "34873706500", "AffiliationID": "60013141", "AffiliationName": "Norwegian University of Science and Technology"}, "7004283214": {"Name": "Wichstr\u00f8m L.", "AuthorID": "7004283214", "AffiliationID": "120972427", "AffiliationName": "NTNU Social Science"}, "13205249500": {"Name": "Barker E.", "AuthorID": "13205249500", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "King's College London"}, "24471042200": {"Name": "Llewellyn C.", "AuthorID": "24471042200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "54414058400": {"Name": "Fildes A.", "AuthorID": "54414058400", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "University of Leeds"}}}
