Published by BMJ.Objective To measure the trade-off between risk of complications versus patient improvement in pain and function in orthopaedic surgeons' decisions about whether to undertake total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Methods A discrete choice experiment asking surgeons to make choices between experimentally-designed scenarios describing different levels of operative risk and dimensions of pain and physical function. Variation in preferences and trade-offs according to surgeon-specific characteristics were also examined. Results The experiment was completed by a representative sample of 333 orthopaedic surgeons (n=333): Median age 52 years, 94% male, 91% fully qualified. Orthopaedic surgeons were willing to accept substantial increases in absolute risk associated with TKA surgery for greater improvements in a patient's pain and function. The maximum risk surgeons were willing to accept was 40% for reoperation and 102% for the need to seek further treatment from a general practitioner or specialist in return for a change from postoperative severe night-time pain at baseline to no night-time pain at 12 months. With a few exceptions, surgeon-specific characteristics were not associated with how much risk a surgeon is willing to accept in a patient undergoing TKA. Conclusion This is the first study to quantify risk-benefit trade-offs among orthopaedic surgeons performing TKA, using a discrete choice experiment. This study provides insight into the risk tolerance of surgeons.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Discrete choice experiment", "Joint replacement", "Medical decision-making", "Surgery"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee", "Australia", "Clinical Decision-Making", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Orthopedics", "Postoperative Complications", "Risk Assessment", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85068723843", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"57209780180": {"Name": "Szawlowski S.", "AuthorID": "57209780180", "AffiliationID": "60119186, 60026553", "AffiliationName": "Melbourne Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research, University of Melbourne"}, "36986144300": {"Name": "Scott A.", "AuthorID": "36986144300", "AffiliationID": "60119186, 60026553", "AffiliationName": "Melbourne Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research, University of Melbourne"}, "7005534751": {"Name": "Choong P.F.M.", "AuthorID": "7005534751", "AffiliationID": "60001522", "AffiliationName": "Department of Orthopaedics, St Vincent's Hospital"}, "57212709358": {"Name": "Nelson E.", "AuthorID": "57212709358", "AffiliationID": "60026553, 60001522", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery, University of Melbourne, St Vincent's Hospital"}, "57217859960": {"Name": "Dowsey M.M.", "AuthorID": "57217859960", "AffiliationID": "60001522", "AffiliationName": "Department of Orthopaedics, St Vincent's Hospital"}, "55794424600": {"Name": "Li J.", "AuthorID": "55794424600", "AffiliationID": "60018805", "AffiliationName": "Department of Economics, Deakin University"}, "8592432000": {"Name": "Nikpour M.", "AuthorID": "8592432000", "AffiliationID": "60026553, 60001522", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, University of Melbourne, St Vincent's Hospital"}, "7005660697": {"Name": "Sundararajan V.", "AuthorID": "7005660697", "AffiliationID": "60006925", "AffiliationName": "Department of Public Health, La Trobe University"}}}
