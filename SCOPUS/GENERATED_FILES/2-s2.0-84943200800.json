This Article evaluates two influential theories of freedom of religion in political theory, before introducing an alternative one. The first approach, the Substitution approach, argues that freedom of religion can be adequately expressed by a substitute category: typically, freedom of conscience. The second, the Proxy approach, argues that the notion of religion should be upheld in the law, albeit as a proxy for a range of different goods. After showing that neither approach adequately meets crucial desiderata for an inclusive theory of religious freedom, the Article sets out the Disaggregation approach and defends against the alternatives.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84943200800", "SubjectAreas": [["Philosophy", "ARTS", "1211"], ["Law", "SOCI", "3308"]], "AuthorData": {"6603669308": {"Name": "Laborde C.", "AuthorID": "6603669308", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "School of Public Policy, University College London"}}}
