Furthermore, combination approaches could ameliorate the potential increased risk of infection following vaccination in the absence of protective immunity. We used a nonhuman primate model to determine potential interactions of combining a partially effective ARV microbicide with an envelope-based vaccine. The vaccine alone provided no protection from infection following 12 consecutive low-dose intravaginal challenges with simian-HIV strain SF162P3, with more animals infected compared to naive controls. The microbicide alone provided a 68% reduction in the risk of infection relative to that of the vaccine group and a 45% reduction relative to that of naive controls. The vaccine-microbicide combination provided an 88% reduction in the per-exposure risk of infection relative to the vaccine alone and a 79% reduction relative to that of the controls. Protected animals in the vaccine-microbicide group were challenged a further 12 times in the absence of microbicide and demonstrated a 98% reduction in the risk of infection. A total risk reduction of 91% was observed in this group over 24 exposures (P=0.004). These important findings suggest that combined implementation of new biomedical prevention strategies may provide significant gains in HIV prevention.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["AIDS Vaccines", "Animals", "Anti-HIV Agents", "Antibodies, Viral", "Drug Synergism", "Female", "HIV Antibodies", "HIV Infections", "HIV-1", "Humans", "Macaca fascicularis", "Models, Animal", "Simian Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome", "Simian Immunodeficiency Virus", "Tenofovir", "Vaccination"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84971372805", "SubjectAreas": [["Microbiology", "IMMU", "2404"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"], ["Insect Science", "AGRI", "1109"], ["Virology", "IMMU", "2406"]], "AuthorData": {"7004608511": {"Name": "Le Grand R.", "AuthorID": "7004608511", "AffiliationID": "60106017, 60009386, 60000905, 60106136, 60106074", "AffiliationName": "Universit\u00e9 Paris Sud, INSERM, CEA, DRF-Department of Immunology of Viral Infections and Autoimmune Diseases (IMVA), UMR1184, IDMIT Infrastructure, iMETI"}, "7004072392": {"Name": "Dereuddre-Bosquet N.", "AuthorID": "7004072392", "AffiliationID": "60106017, 60009386, 60000905, 60106136, 60106074", "AffiliationName": "Universit\u00e9 Paris Sud, INSERM, CEA, DRF-Department of Immunology of Viral Infections and Autoimmune Diseases (IMVA), UMR1184, IDMIT Infrastructure, iMETI"}, "6603735435": {"Name": "Gosse L.", "AuthorID": "6603735435", "AffiliationID": "60106017, 60009386, 60000905, 60106136, 60106074", "AffiliationName": "Universit\u00e9 Paris Sud, INSERM, CEA, DRF-Department of Immunology of Viral Infections and Autoimmune Diseases (IMVA), UMR1184, IDMIT Infrastructure, iMETI"}, "56323639800": {"Name": "Desjardins D.", "AuthorID": "56323639800", "AffiliationID": "60106017, 60009386, 60000905, 60106136, 60106074", "AffiliationName": "Universit\u00e9 Paris Sud, INSERM, CEA, DRF-Department of Immunology of Viral Infections and Autoimmune Diseases (IMVA), UMR1184, IDMIT Infrastructure, iMETI"}, "8320801600": {"Name": "Saidi H.", "AuthorID": "8320801600", "AffiliationID": "60106017, 60009386, 60000905, 60106136, 60106074", "AffiliationName": "Universit\u00e9 Paris Sud, INSERM, CEA, DRF-Department of Immunology of Viral Infections and Autoimmune Diseases (IMVA), UMR1184, IDMIT Infrastructure, iMETI"}, "26039063200": {"Name": "Dispinseri S.", "AuthorID": "26039063200", "AffiliationID": "60082964", "AffiliationName": "Viral Evolution and Transmission Unit, Division of Immunology, Transplantation and Infectious Diseases, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute"}, "16067562600": {"Name": "Tolazzi M.", "AuthorID": "16067562600", "AffiliationID": "60082964", "AffiliationName": "Viral Evolution and Transmission Unit, Division of Immunology, Transplantation and Infectious Diseases, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute"}, "7003852850": {"Name": "Scarlatti G.", "AuthorID": "7003852850", "AffiliationID": "60082964", "AffiliationName": "Viral Evolution and Transmission Unit, Division of Immunology, Transplantation and Infectious Diseases, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute"}, "7006800325": {"Name": "Cope A.", "AuthorID": "7006800325", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Mucosal Infection and Immunity Group, Department of Medicne, St. Mary's Campus, Imperial College London"}, "7003670939": {"Name": "Shattock R.J.", "AuthorID": "7003670939", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Mucosal Infection and Immunity Group, Department of Medicne, St. Mary's Campus, Imperial College London"}, "22434098100": {"Name": "Shen X.", "AuthorID": "22434098100", "AffiliationID": "60005200, 60008724", "AffiliationName": "Duke Human Vaccine Institute, Duke University"}, "6507517468": {"Name": "Tomaras G.", "AuthorID": "6507517468", "AffiliationID": "60005200, 60008724", "AffiliationName": "Duke Human Vaccine Institute, Duke University"}, "7801368060": {"Name": "Ochsenbauer C.", "AuthorID": "7801368060", "AffiliationID": "60119100, 60027086", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine and CFAR, University of Alabama at Birmingham"}, "55274319500": {"Name": "Prague M.", "AuthorID": "55274319500", "AffiliationID": "113216870", "AffiliationName": "Vaccine Research Institute"}, "7004041016": {"Name": "Thiebaut R.", "AuthorID": "7004041016", "AffiliationID": "113216870", "AffiliationName": "Vaccine Research Institute"}, "7202725086": {"Name": "Barnett S.W.", "AuthorID": "7202725086", "AffiliationID": "117737902", "AffiliationName": "Novartis Vaccines"}}}
