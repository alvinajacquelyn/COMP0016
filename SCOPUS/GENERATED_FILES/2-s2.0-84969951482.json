Through a series of interviews with small publishers in Seattle, Portland, and Vancouver, BC, this paper will investigate whether independent publishers, based outside of the major publishing hubs of New York and Toronto, believe they can: compete in the global publishing environment; help to promote and preserve regional cultures and identities; and maintain diversity in cultural output. It will also explore how independent presses see themselves situated in the national and international publishing arena and identify what structures are in place to support them to do so. Although the focus of the empirical research is the Pacific Northwest, this paper has been contextualised within national publishing discourse.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alternative publishing", "Authors", "Canadian publishing", "Digital publishing", "Diversity", "Independent publishing", "Small presses"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84969951482", "SubjectAreas": [["Business and International Management", "BUSI", "1403"], ["Communication", "SOCI", "3315"], ["Media Technology", "ENGI", "2214"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Marketing", "BUSI", "1406"], ["Management of Technology and Innovation", "BUSI", "1405"]], "AuthorData": {"55601317700": {"Name": "Bold M.", "AuthorID": "55601317700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Information Studies, University College London"}}}
