The resultant diversity of the anatomical cardiac long axis, however, and its determinants, have yet to be systematically investigated. We enrolled 100 consecutive patients undergoing coronary arterial computed tomographic angiography, decomposing the vector of the anatomical cardiac long axis by projecting it to horizontal, frontal, and sagittal planes. The projected vectors on each plane were then converted into three rotation angles using coordinate transformation. We then measured the extent of aortic wedging, using the vertical distance between the inferior margins of the non-adjacent aortic sinus and the epicardium. We took the aortic root rotation angle to be zero when an \u201cen face\u201d view of the right coronary aortic sinus was obtained in the frontal view, defining leftward rotation to be positive. The mean horizontal, frontal, and sagittal rotation angles were 48.7\u00b0 \u00b1 9.5\u00b0, 52.3\u00b0 \u00b1 12.0\u00b0, and 34.0\u00b0 \u00b1 11.2\u00b0, respectively. The mean extent of aortic wedging, and the aortic root rotation angle, were 42.7 \u00b1 9.8 mm, and 5.3\u00b0 \u00b1 16.4\u00b0. Horizontal rotation of the anatomical axis was associated with leftward and ventral rotation, and vice versa. Multivariate analysis showed aortic root rotation to be associated with horizontal cardiac rotation, while aortic wedging is associated with frontal and sagittal cardiac rotation. We have quantified the marked individual variation observed in the anatomical axis of the living heart, identifying the different mechanisms involved in producing the marked three-dimensional diversity of the living heart.
