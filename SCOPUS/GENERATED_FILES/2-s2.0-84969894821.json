Future deep, wide-field WL surveys will provide an unprecedented opportunity to constrain deviations from General Relativity. Employing a 3D analysis based on the spherical Fourier-Bessel expansion, we investigate the extent to which MG theories will be constrained by a typical 3D WL survey configuration including noise from the intrinsic ellipticity distribution \u03c3\u03f5 of source galaxies. Here, we focus on two classes of screened theories of gravity: (i) f(R) chameleon models and (ii) environmentally dependent dilaton models. We use one-loop perturbation theory combined with halo models in order to accurately model the evolution of the matter power spectrum with redshift in these theories. Using a \u03c72 analysis, we show that for an all-sky spectroscopic survey, the parameter fR0 can be constrained in the range fR0<5\u00d710-6(9\u00d710-6) for n=1(2) with a 3\u03c3 confidence level. This can be achieved by using relatively low-order angular harmonics <100. Higher-order harmonics >100 could provide tighter constraints but are subject to nonlinear effects, such as baryonic feedback, that must be accounted for. We also employ a Principal Component Analysis in order to study the parameter degeneracies in the MG parameters. The confusion from intrinsic ellipticity correlation and modification of the matter power spectrum at a small scale due to feedback mechanisms is briefly discussed.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84969894821", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (miscellaneous)", "PHYS", "3101"]], "AuthorData": {"55240512700": {"Name": "Pratten G.", "AuthorID": "55240512700", "AffiliationID": "60017317", "AffiliationName": "Mathematical and Physical Sciences, University of Sussex"}, "35318355900": {"Name": "Munshi D.", "AuthorID": "35318355900", "AffiliationID": "60017317", "AffiliationName": "Mathematical and Physical Sciences, University of Sussex"}, "7004256515": {"Name": "Valageas P.", "AuthorID": "7004256515", "AffiliationID": "60106017, 60008134, 60106131, 60007816", "AffiliationName": "Institut de Physique Th\u00e9orique, Universit\u00e9 Paris-Saclay, CEA, CNRS"}, "7004245935": {"Name": "Brax P.", "AuthorID": "7004245935", "AffiliationID": "60106017, 60008134, 60106131, 60007816", "AffiliationName": "Institut de Physique Th\u00e9orique, Universit\u00e9 Paris-Saclay, CEA, CNRS"}}}
