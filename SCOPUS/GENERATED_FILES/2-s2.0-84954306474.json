Towards this aim, a range of scenarios depicting instances of norm violations was generated and tested with respect to their ability in evoking subjective and physiological responses. In Experiment 1, participants evaluated 29 vignettes on how upsetting, excusable and realistic the described behaviour appeared to be. Based on those ratings we selected and extended three norm violation vignettes for Experiment 2 in which participants' physiological responses were obtained in addition to their subjective ratings. In both studies, the vignettes were successful in eliciting negative responses to norm violations and were significantly affected by the perceivers' level of ethnocultural empathy. The trait measure of cultural empathy further predicted facial electromyography (EMG) activity at muscle sites associated with disgust (M. Levator Labii), thereby suggesting a potential moral response to norm-violating scenarios. We discuss the methodological merits and implications of this vignettes paradigm for investigating perceived norm transgressions and make recommendations for future work.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Disgust", "Empathy", "Facial expression", "Norm violation", "Vignettes"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Emotions", "Empathy", "Facial Expression", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84954306474", "SubjectAreas": [["Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)", "ARTS", "1201"], ["Psychology (all)", "PSYC", "3200"]], "AuthorData": {"8280916700": {"Name": "Krumhuber E.", "AuthorID": "8280916700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Experimental Psychology, University College London"}, "54941572400": {"Name": "Tsankova E.", "AuthorID": "54941572400", "AffiliationID": "60016458", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology and Methods, Jacobs University Bremen"}, "7101642010": {"Name": "Kappas A.", "AuthorID": "7101642010", "AffiliationID": "60016458", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology and Methods, Jacobs University Bremen"}}}
