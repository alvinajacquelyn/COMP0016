Optical microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy showed that CV and MB were diffused throughout the silicone samples and that Ag NPs were successfully encapsulated by the swell-encapsulation-shrink process. Antimicrobial tests on Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli showed that CV/MB-encapsulated silicone samples have stronger photobactericidal activity than CV or MB samples and the addition of Ag NPs significantly enhanced the antimicrobial activity under white light. The number of viable bacteria decreased below the detection limit (below <103 CFU) on the silicone-incorporating CV/MB/Ag NPs within 3 h for S. aureus and within 5 h for E. coli. In leaching tests over 216 h, the amount of dye leaching from the samples was barely detectable (<0.02 ppm). These surfaces have a potential for use in healthcare settings to decrease hospital-associated infections.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85049015442", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"]], "AuthorData": {"57194715976": {"Name": "Patir A.", "AuthorID": "57194715976", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Materials Chemistry Research Centre, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "35778301700": {"Name": "Hwang G.B.", "AuthorID": "35778301700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Materials Chemistry Research Centre, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "57213083930": {"Name": "Parkin I.P.", "AuthorID": "57213083930", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Materials Chemistry Research Centre, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "7402726222": {"Name": "Nair S.P.", "AuthorID": "7402726222", "AffiliationID": "60013985, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Microbial Diseases, UCL Eastman Dental Institute, University College London"}, "35848365800": {"Name": "Allan E.", "AuthorID": "35848365800", "AffiliationID": "60013985, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Microbial Diseases, UCL Eastman Dental Institute, University College London"}}}
