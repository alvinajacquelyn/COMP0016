The purpose of the current investigation was to define the current spectrum of mutations causing FH in Israel. Methods New families were collected through the MEDPED (Make Early Diagnosis Prevent Early Death) FH program. Molecular analysis of the LDLR, PCSK9 and APOB genes was done using High Resolution Melt and direct sequencing in 67 index cases. A 6-SNP LDL-C gene score calculation for polygenic hypercholesterolaemia was done using TaqMan genotyping. Results Mean serum cholesterol was 7.48 \u00b1 1.89 mmol/L and the mean serum LDL-C was 5.99 \u00b1 1.89 mmol/L. Mutations in the LDLR and APOB gene were found in 24 cases (35.8%), with 16 in LDLR, none in PCSK9 and one, p.(R3527Q), in the APOB gene, which is the first APOB mutation carrier identified in the Israeli population. Of the LDLR mutations, two were novel; p.(E140A) and a promoter variant, c.-191C > A. The c.2479G > A p.(V827I) in exon 17 of the LDLR gene was found in 8 patients (33.3% of the mutations) with modestly elevated LDL-C, but also in a compound heterozygous patient with a clinical homozygous FH phenotype, consistent with this being a \u201cmild\u201d FH-causing variant. A significantly higher 6-SNP LDL-C score was found in mutation-negative cases compared with a normal Caucasian cohort (p = 0.03), confirming that polygenic inheritance of common LDL-C raising SNPs can produce an FH phenocopy. Conclusions The results indicate a different spectrum of genetic causes of FH from that found previously, in concordance with the heterogeneous and changing origins of the Israeli population, and confirm that a polygenic cause is also contributing to the FH phenotype in Israel.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Familial hypercholesterolemia", "Hyperlipidemia", "LDL receptor", "LDLR mutation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Apolipoprotein B-100", "Biomarkers", "Child", "Cholesterol, LDL", "DNA Mutational Analysis", "Female", "Genetic Association Studies", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Heterozygote", "Homozygote", "Humans", "Hyperlipoproteinemia Type II", "Israel", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Multifactorial Inheritance", "Mutation", "Pedigree", "Phenotype", "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide", "Proprotein Convertase 9", "Receptors, LDL", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85009404035", "SubjectAreas": [["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"7005127717": {"Name": "Durst R.", "AuthorID": "7005127717", "AffiliationID": "60000087", "AffiliationName": "Center for Research Prevention and Treatment of Atherosclerosis, Department of Medicine, Hadassah Hebrew University Medical Center"}, "6507878848": {"Name": "Shpitzen S.", "AuthorID": "6507878848", "AffiliationID": "60000087", "AffiliationName": "Center for Research Prevention and Treatment of Atherosclerosis, Department of Medicine, Hadassah Hebrew University Medical Center"}, "6602692038": {"Name": "Schurr D.", "AuthorID": "6602692038", "AffiliationID": "60000087", "AffiliationName": "Center for Research Prevention and Treatment of Atherosclerosis, Department of Medicine, Hadassah Hebrew University Medical Center"}, "6506235676": {"Name": "Eliav O.", "AuthorID": "6506235676", "AffiliationID": "60000087", "AffiliationName": "Center for Research Prevention and Treatment of Atherosclerosis, Department of Medicine, Hadassah Hebrew University Medical Center"}, "7006121849": {"Name": "Leitersdorf E.", "AuthorID": "7006121849", "AffiliationID": "60000087", "AffiliationName": "Center for Research Prevention and Treatment of Atherosclerosis, Department of Medicine, Hadassah Hebrew University Medical Center"}, "57192951461": {"Name": "Ibe U.K.", "AuthorID": "57192951461", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60100024", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cardiovascular Genetics, British Heart Foundation Laboratories, Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences, University College London"}, "55446094500": {"Name": "Futema M.", "AuthorID": "55446094500", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60100024", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cardiovascular Genetics, British Heart Foundation Laboratories, Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences, University College London"}, "23037622600": {"Name": "Whittall R.", "AuthorID": "23037622600", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60100024", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cardiovascular Genetics, British Heart Foundation Laboratories, Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences, University College London"}, "57217317601": {"Name": "Humphries S.E.", "AuthorID": "57217317601", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60100024", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cardiovascular Genetics, British Heart Foundation Laboratories, Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences, University College London"}, "16445107700": {"Name": "Szalat A.", "AuthorID": "16445107700", "AffiliationID": "60000087", "AffiliationName": "Internal Medicine Department, Mount Scopus, Hadassah Hebrew University Medical Center"}, "6701661143": {"Name": "Meiner V.", "AuthorID": "6701661143", "AffiliationID": "60000087", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genetics and Metabolic Diseases, Hadassah Hebrew University Medical Center"}, "8103345600": {"Name": "Knobler H.", "AuthorID": "8103345600", "AffiliationID": "60033289", "AffiliationName": "Diabetes and Metabolic Disease Unit, Kaplan Medical Center"}, "7004016753": {"Name": "Gavish D.", "AuthorID": "7004016753", "AffiliationID": "60029655", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Wolfson Medical Center"}, "7003459016": {"Name": "Henkin Y.", "AuthorID": "7003459016", "AffiliationID": "60030184", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Soroka University Medical Center"}, "57192951744": {"Name": "Ellis A.", "AuthorID": "57192951744", "AffiliationID": "60022119", "AffiliationName": "Internal Medicine, Rabin Medical Center"}, "7102389120": {"Name": "Rubinstein A.", "AuthorID": "7102389120", "AffiliationID": "60008870", "AffiliationName": "Department of Metabolic Clinic, Tel Aviv Medical Center"}, "7006477296": {"Name": "Harats D.", "AuthorID": "7006477296", "AffiliationID": "60011766", "AffiliationName": "Bert W.
