To address this, a hybrid cell culture system integrating an active cover lid and a multi-well microplate was proposed to achieve perfusion 3-D cell culture. In this system, a microfluidic-based pneumatically-driven liquid transport mechanism was integrated into the active cover lid to realize 6-unit culture medium perfusion. Experimental results revealed that the flow of culture medium could be pneumatically driven in a flow-rate uniform manner. We used the system to successfully perform a perfusion 3-D cell culture of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) for up to 16 days. Moreover, we investigated the effects of various cell culture models on the physiology of MSCs. The physiological nature of MSCs can vary with respect to the cell culture model used. Using the perfusion 3-D cell culture format might affect the proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of MSCs. Overall, we have developed a cell culture system that can achieve multi-well microplate-based perfusion 3-D cell culture in an efficient, cost-effective, and userfriendly manner. These features could facilitate the widespread application of perfusion cell culture models for cell-based assays.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Cell Culture Techniques", "Humans", "Mesenchymal Stromal Cells"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84950293491", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"15052173300": {"Name": "Huang S.", "AuthorID": "15052173300", "AffiliationID": "60020351", "AffiliationName": "Graduate Institute of Biochemical and Biomedical Engineering, Chang Gung University"}, "57007459800": {"Name": "Li K.", "AuthorID": "57007459800", "AffiliationID": "60020351", "AffiliationName": "Graduate Institute of Biochemical and Biomedical Engineering, Chang Gung University"}, "8582133100": {"Name": "Wu M.", "AuthorID": "8582133100", "AffiliationID": "60020351", "AffiliationName": "Graduate Institute of Biochemical and Biomedical Engineering, Chang Gung University"}, "56999958600": {"Name": "Chou D.", "AuthorID": "56999958600", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Engineering Science, University of Oxford"}, "24528265700": {"Name": "Chang Y.", "AuthorID": "24528265700", "AffiliationID": "60031913", "AffiliationName": "Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital"}, "55560562000": {"Name": "Chiu T.", "AuthorID": "55560562000", "AffiliationID": "60020351", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical and Materials Engineering, Chang Gung University"}, "6603704133": {"Name": "Ventikos Y.", "AuthorID": "6603704133", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}}}
