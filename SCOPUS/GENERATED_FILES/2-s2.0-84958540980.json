We present the plan for an observational retrospective study of whether automated systems could replace one or more steps of human grading. Methods: Patients aged 12 or older who attended the Diabetes Eye Screening programme, Homerton University Hospital (London) between 1 June 2012 and 4 November 2013 had macular and disc-centred retinal images taken. All screening episodes were manually graded and will additionally be graded by three automated systems. Each system will process all screening episodes, and screening performance (sensitivity, false positive rate, likelihood ratios) and diagnostic accuracy (95% confidence intervals of screening performance measures) will be quantified. A sub-set of gradings will be validated by an approved Reading Centre. Additional analyses will explore the effect of altering thresholds for disease detection within each automated system on screening performance. Results: 2,782/20,258 diabetes patients were referred to ophthalmologists for further examination. Prevalence of maculopathy (M1), pre-proliferative retinopathy (R2), and proliferative retinopathy (R3) were 7.9%, 3.1% and 1.2%, respectivel y; 4749 (23%)patients were diagnosed with background retinopathy (R1); 1.5% were considered ungradable by human graders. Conclusions: Retinopathy prevalence was similar to other English diabetic screening programmes, so findings should be generalizable. The study population size will allow the detection of differences in screening performance between the human and automated grading systems as small as 2%. The project will compare performance and economic costs of manual versus automated systems.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Child", "Diabetic Retinopathy", "Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted", "England", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Mass Screening", "Middle Aged", "Ophthalmology", "Pattern Recognition, Automated", "Retrospective Studies", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84958540980", "SubjectAreas": [["Health Policy", "MEDI", "2719"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"55337674700": {"Name": "Kapetanakis V.V.", "AuthorID": "55337674700", "AffiliationID": "60029329", "AffiliationName": "Population Health Research Institute, St George\u2019s, University of London, Cranmer Terrace"}, "6603711082": {"Name": "Rudnicka A.R.", "AuthorID": "6603711082", "AffiliationID": "60029329", "AffiliationName": "Population Health Research Institute, St George\u2019s, University of London, Cranmer Terrace"}, "7202893034": {"Name": "Owen C.G.", "AuthorID": "7202893034", "AffiliationID": "60029329", "AffiliationName": "Population Health Research Institute, St George\u2019s, University of London, Cranmer Terrace"}, "57205928807": {"Name": "Liew G.", "AuthorID": "57205928807", "AffiliationID": "60025709", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Vision Research, University of Sydney"}, "26635526200": {"Name": "Lee A.", "AuthorID": "26635526200", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields BRC, Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "57192713868": {"Name": "Louw V.", "AuthorID": "57192713868", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields BRC, Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "8101026700": {"Name": "Egan C.", "AuthorID": "8101026700", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields BRC, Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "15924308700": {"Name": "Tufail A.", "AuthorID": "15924308700", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields BRC, Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "57163806000": {"Name": "Bolter L.", "AuthorID": "57163806000", "AffiliationID": "60005523", "AffiliationName": "Homerton University Hospital, Homerton Row"}, "55547123848": {"Name": "Anderson J.", "AuthorID": "55547123848", "AffiliationID": "60005523", "AffiliationName": "Homerton University Hospital, Homerton Row"}, "37091551200": {"Name": "Salas-Vega S.", "AuthorID": "37091551200", "AffiliationID": "60003059", "AffiliationName": "Department of Social Policy, LSE Health, London School of Economics and Political Science"}, "8384477700": {"Name": "Rudisill C.", "AuthorID": "8384477700", "AffiliationID": "60003059", "AffiliationName": "Department of Social Policy, LSE Health, London School of Economics and Political Science"}, "7404775085": {"Name": "Taylor P.", "AuthorID": "7404775085", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "CHIME, Institute of Health Informatics, University College London"}}}
