To tackle air pollution, China has taken the first steps by setting emission\u2013reduction targets for nitrogen oxides (NOx) and sulphur dioxide (SO2) in the 11th and 12th Five Year Plans. This paper uses two models\u2014the Energy\u2013Environment\u2013Economy Model at the Global level (E3MG) and the global Chemistry Transport Model pTOMCAT\u2014to test the effects of these policies. If the policy targets are met, then the maximum values of 32 % and 45 % reductions below \u2018business as usual\u2019 in the monthly mean NOx and SO2 concentrations, respectively, will be achieved in 2015. However, a decrease in NOx concentrations in some highly polluted areas of East, North-East and South-East China can lead to up to a 10% increase in the monthly mean concentrations in surface ozone in 2015. Our study demonstrates an urgent need for the more detailed analysis of the impacts and designs of air pollution reduction guidelines for China.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Atmospheric pollution", "China", "Five Year Plan", "Surface ozone"], "IndexKeywords": ["Air Pollutants", "Air Pollution", "China", "Cities", "Models, Theoretical", "Nitrogen Oxides", "Ozone", "Social Planning", "Sulfur Dioxide"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84958115447", "SubjectAreas": [["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"], ["Environmental Chemistry", "ENVI", "2304"], ["Ecology", "ENVI", "2303"]], "AuthorData": {"35104293400": {"Name": "Anger A.", "AuthorID": "35104293400", "AffiliationID": "60111504", "AffiliationName": "Downing College"}, "7103052504": {"Name": "Barker T.", "AuthorID": "7103052504", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Land Economy, University of Cambridge"}, "22633628500": {"Name": "Dessens O.", "AuthorID": "22633628500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Energy Institute, University College London"}, "35340333300": {"Name": "Xi F.", "AuthorID": "35340333300", "AffiliationID": "60027257, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Applied Ecology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "56672305900": {"Name": "Wu R.", "AuthorID": "56672305900", "AffiliationID": "60027257, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Applied Ecology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}}}
