Pharmacological therapy for resistant hypertension follows guidelines-based regimens although there is surprisingly scant evidence for beneficial outcomes using additional drug treatment after three antihypertensives have failed to achieve target blood pressure. Recently there has been considerable interest in the use of endoluminal renal denervation as an interventional technique to achieve renal nerve ablation and lower blood pressure. Although initial clinical trials of renal denervation in patients with resistant hypertension demonstrated encouraging office blood pressure reduction, a large randomised control trial (Symplicity HTN-3) with a sham-control limb, failed to meet its primary efficacy end point. The trial however was subject to a number of flaws which must be taken into consideration in interpreting the final results. Moreover a substantial body of evidence from non-randomised smaller trials does suggest that renal denervation may have an important role in the management of hypertension and other disease states characterised by overactivation of the sympathetic nervous system. The Joint UK Societies does not recommend the use of renal denervation for treatment of resistant hypertension in routine clinical practice but remains committed to supporting research activity in this field. A number of research strategies are identified and much that can be improved upon to ensure better design and conduct of future randomised studies.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Antihypertensive Agents", "Blood Pressure", "Cardiology", "Clinical Trials as Topic", "Consensus", "Drug Resistance", "Evidence-Based Medicine", "Humans", "Hypertension", "Kidney", "Sympathectomy", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84919742481", "SubjectAreas": [["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"55485842500": {"Name": "Lobo M.D.", "AuthorID": "55485842500", "AffiliationID": "60159931", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, Barts Health NHS Trust"}, "57208352518": {"Name": "Collier D.", "AuthorID": "57208352518", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Barts NIHR Cardiovascular Biomedical Research Unit, William Harvey Research Institute, Queen Mary University of London"}, "56615203500": {"Name": "Kapil V.", "AuthorID": "56615203500", "AffiliationID": "60159931", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, Barts Health NHS Trust"}, "55486090800": {"Name": "Paton J.F.R.", "AuthorID": "55486090800", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "School of Physiology and Pharmacology, Bristol Cardiovascular Medical Sciences Building, University of Bristol"}, "7006154423": {"Name": "Poulter N.", "AuthorID": "7006154423", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "International Centre for Circulatory Health, Imperial College"}, "7404503273": {"Name": "Williams B.", "AuthorID": "7404503273", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences, University College London"}, "7102853527": {"Name": "Caulfield M.J.", "AuthorID": "7102853527", "AffiliationID": "60159931", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, Barts Health NHS Trust"}, "19736493500": {"Name": "Matson M.", "AuthorID": "19736493500", "AffiliationID": "60018477, 60024453", "AffiliationName": "British Society for Interventional Radiology, Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHSFT, Northern General Hospital"}, "7202380964": {"Name": "Knight C.", "AuthorID": "7202380964", "AffiliationID": "60030723", "AffiliationName": "British Cardiovascular Society, James Cook University Hospital"}, "7005701907": {"Name": "De Belder M.A.", "AuthorID": "7005701907", "AffiliationID": "60030723", "AffiliationName": "Cardiothoracic Division, James Cook University Hospital"}, "7102735784": {"Name": "Simpson I.", "AuthorID": "7102735784", "AffiliationID": "60000703", "AffiliationName": "Wessex Regional Cardiac Unit, University Hospital"}, "7004333788": {"Name": "Deanfield J.", "AuthorID": "7004333788", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Cardiovascular Outcomes Research, University College London"}, "7004624612": {"Name": "Cleveland T.", "AuthorID": "7004624612", "AffiliationID": "60018477, 60024453", "AffiliationName": "Sheffield Vascular Institute, Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHSFT, Northern General Hospital"}, "7401487113": {"Name": "Moss J.", "AuthorID": "7401487113", "AffiliationID": "60007687", "AffiliationName": "Interventional Radiology Unit, Gartnavel General Hospital"}, "16024138200": {"Name": "Dasgupta I.", "AuthorID": "16024138200", "AffiliationID": "60024356", "AffiliationName": "Department of Renal Medicine, Birmingham Heartlands Hospital"}}}
