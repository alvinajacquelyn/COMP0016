We discuss what kind of state, policy, and administrative capacities, or routines, SS presumes. We show that over the years CEE economies have built very different routines, especially for policy coordination and public\u2013private interactions. Design and implementation of functional SS strategies requires critical attention and development of these routines through contextual policy experimentation in all CEE regions. We provide some general guidelines for this.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Central and Eastern Europe", "policy implementation", "smart specialization", "state capacity"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84931568183", "SubjectAreas": [["Business and International Management", "BUSI", "1403"], ["Economics, Econometrics and Finance (all)", "ECON", "2000"]], "AuthorData": {"44661609500": {"Name": "Karo E.", "AuthorID": "44661609500", "AffiliationID": "60068861", "AffiliationName": "Ragnar Nurkse School of Innovation and Governance, Tallinn University of Technology"}, "24166963100": {"Name": "Kattel R.", "AuthorID": "24166963100", "AffiliationID": "60068861", "AffiliationName": "Ragnar Nurkse School of Innovation and Governance, Tallinn University of Technology"}}}
