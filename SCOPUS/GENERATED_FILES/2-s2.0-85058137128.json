The aim was to explore socioeconomic inequalities in mortality in Visegrad countries\u2014the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia (V4), by three different socioeconomic indicators (unemployment, risk of poverty/social exclusion, education). The study was conducted within the H2020 Euro-Healthy project. Methods: The associations between selected socioeconomic indicators and the standardised mortality rates by four main causes (mortality related to cancer, circulatory, respiratory and digestive system) in the economically active population aged 20\u201364 years in the 35 NUTS 2 level regions of the V4 in the period 2011\u20132013 were explored, using linear regression models. Results: Lower education level was the most significant predictor of mortality in the V4. The lowest mortality rates by all causes of death were found in the regions of the Czech Republic, the highest in regions of Hungary. Conclusions: Despite the common origin, the pathways of the V4 countries in employment, poverty and education seem to be different, also having impact on health equity. Therefore, where you live in the V4 can significantly influence your health.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Ecological design", "Health equity", "Measurement", "Mortality", "Regional differences", "Socioeconomic inequalities"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Cause of Death", "Czech Republic", "Female", "Forecasting", "Humans", "Hungary", "Linear Models", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Mortality", "Poland", "Poverty", "Slovakia", "Social Discrimination", "Socioeconomic Factors", "Unemployment", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85058137128", "SubjectAreas": [["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"56299910600": {"Name": "Bosakova L.", "AuthorID": "56299910600", "AffiliationID": "60003367", "AffiliationName": "Olomouc University Social Health Institute (OUSHI), Palacky University in Olomouc"}, "57204590626": {"Name": "Filakovska Bobakova D.", "AuthorID": "57204590626", "AffiliationID": "60003367", "AffiliationName": "Olomouc University Social Health Institute (OUSHI), Palacky University in Olomouc"}, "26030051300": {"Name": "Rosicova K.", "AuthorID": "26030051300", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Department of Regional Development, Land-use Planning and Environment, Kosice Self-governing Region"}, "35085362100": {"Name": "Rosic M.", "AuthorID": "35085362100", "AffiliationID": "60032255", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Humanities and Natural Sciences, University of Presov"}, "57193362911": {"Name": "Dzurova D.", "AuthorID": "57193362911", "AffiliationID": "60016605", "AffiliationName": "Department of Social Geography and Regional Development, Faculty of Science, Charles University"}, "55758413800": {"Name": "Lustigova M.", "AuthorID": "55758413800", "AffiliationID": "60016605", "AffiliationName": "Department of Social Geography and Regional Development, Faculty of Science, Charles University"}, "6602081223": {"Name": "Pikhart H.", "AuthorID": "6602081223", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "7003526784": {"Name": "Santana P.", "AuthorID": "7003526784", "AffiliationID": "60020985", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography and Tourism, Humanities Faculty, University of Coimbra"}}}
