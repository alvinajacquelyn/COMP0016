Methods: A systematic search strategy was performed in Ovid-Medline, Embase, Cochrane library and NICE. Studies reporting outcomes of sympathetic interruption in the treatment of facial blushing were retrieved. Results: Nine studies met the inclusion criteria with 1369 patients included in the final analysis. The age range of patients was 8 to 74 years (from 7 studies) with 56% females. Mean follow up was 21 months in 8 studies (range 6 to 30 months). The pooled proportion of patients who had good relief of facial blushing was 78.30% (95% C.I. 58.20%\u201398.39%). Complete satisfaction was reported in 84.02% (95% C.I. 71.71%\u201396.33%). Compensatory sweating and gustatory sweating were the commonest complications occurring in 74.18% (95% C.I. 58.10%\u201390.26%) and 24.42% (95% C.I. 12.22%\u201336.61%) respectively. The estimated proportion of patients regretting surgery was 6.79% (C.I 2.08% 11.50%). Conclusion: Sympathetic interruption at T2 or T2-3 ganglia appears to be an effective treatment for facial blushing. However, lack of randomized trials comparing sympathetic interruption with non-surgical methods of treatment and heterogeneity of included studies with respect to assessment of outcome measures preclude strong evidence and definitive recommendations.", "AuthorKeywords": ["autonomic nerve block", "Blushing", "flushing", "sympathectomy"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Blushing", "Child", "Female", "Ganglionectomy", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Patient Satisfaction", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85010657678", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"57193087975": {"Name": "Girish G.", "AuthorID": "57193087975", "AffiliationID": "60032911", "AffiliationName": "Department of General & Vascular Surgery, Watford General Hospital"}, "57193081751": {"Name": "D\u2019souza R.E.", "AuthorID": "57193081751", "AffiliationID": "60032819, 60170516", "AffiliationName": "Department of Vascular Surgery, Royal Free Hospital, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "56605738800": {"Name": "Baker D.M.", "AuthorID": "56605738800", "AffiliationID": "60032819, 60170516", "AffiliationName": "Department of Vascular Surgery, Royal Free Hospital, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "56386213400": {"Name": "D\u2019souza P.", "AuthorID": "56386213400", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "Social Science Research Unit and EPPI-Centre, UCL Institute of Education"}, "56803054500": {"Name": "Lewis M.G.", "AuthorID": "56803054500", "AffiliationID": "60016524", "AffiliationName": "Department of statistics, Public Health Evidence, South Asia (PHESA), Manipal University"}}}
