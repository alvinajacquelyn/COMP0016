The accumulation of large amounts of aggregated protein is thought to be initiated by the formation of transient intermediate species of disease-related lysozyme variants, essentially due to the loss of global cooperativity under physiologically relevant conditions. Interestingly, all five naturally occurring, amyloidogenic, single-point mutations are located in the \u03b2-domain of lysozyme, the region that is predominantly unfolded during the formation of the transient intermediate species. Given the lack of known naturally occurring, amyloidogenic, single-point mutations in the \u03b1-domain, we chose three specific mutations to address the effects that location may have on native-state dynamics, as studied by hydrogen-deuterium (HD) exchange experiments analyzed by NMR spectroscopy, and mass spectrometry. We compared the effect of a destabilizing \u03b1-domain mutation (I23A) with that of the well-characterized I59T \u03b2-domain variant. We also investigated the effect of a mutation that has minor effects on native-state stability at the domain interface (I56V) and compared it with that of a variant with similar stability within the C-helix (I89V). We show that when variants have similar reduced native-state stabilities, the location of the mutation (I23A versus I59T) is crucial to the native-state dynamics, with the \u03b1-domain mutation having a significantly lower ability to populate transient intermediate species under physiologically relevant conditions. Interestingly, the mutation at the interface (I56V) has a greater effect in facilitating the formation of transient intermediate species at elevated temperatures compared with the variants containing \u03b1-domain mutations, even though this mutation results in only minor changes to the native-state stability of lysozyme. These findings reveal that the location of specific mutations is an important factor in determining the native-state dynamical properties of human lysozyme in the context of its propensity to populate the aggregation-prone transient intermediate species associated with pathogenic amyloid formation.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Amyloid", "Enzyme Stability", "Humans", "Models, Molecular", "Muramidase", "Mutation", "Protein Domains", "Protein Multimerization", "Protein Structure, Secondary"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85002156858", "SubjectAreas": [["Biophysics", "BIOC", "1304"]], "AuthorData": {"55487007600": {"Name": "Ahn M.", "AuthorID": "55487007600", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge"}, "57197228951": {"Name": "Hagan C.", "AuthorID": "57197228951", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge"}, "57192249796": {"Name": "Bernardo-Gancedo A.", "AuthorID": "57192249796", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge"}, "6506968142": {"Name": "De Genst E.", "AuthorID": "6506968142", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge"}, "56974141600": {"Name": "Newby F.", "AuthorID": "56974141600", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge"}, "24775645800": {"Name": "Dhulesia A.", "AuthorID": "24775645800", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge"}, "56623994700": {"Name": "Dobson C.", "AuthorID": "56623994700", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge"}, "6602336675": {"Name": "Kumita J.", "AuthorID": "6602336675", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge"}, "55919826700": {"Name": "Christodoulou J.", "AuthorID": "55919826700", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60009016", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London and Birkbeck College"}, "7004911481": {"Name": "Dumoulin M.", "AuthorID": "7004911481", "AffiliationID": "117005408", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Enzymology and Protein Folding, Centre for Protein Engineering"}, "7403375239": {"Name": "Robinson C.", "AuthorID": "7403375239", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Physical and Theoretical Chemistry Laboratory, University of Oxford"}}}
