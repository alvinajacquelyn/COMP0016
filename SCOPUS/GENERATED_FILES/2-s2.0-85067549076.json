Published by IOP Publishing Ltd on behalf of the Institute of Physics and Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft.We study the non-Gaussian character of quantum optomechanical systems evolving under the fully nonlinear optomechanical Hamiltonian. By using a measure of non-Gaussianity based on the relative entropy of an initially Gaussian state, we quantify the amount of non-Gaussianity induced by both a constant and time-dependent cubic light-matter coupling and study its general and asymptotic behaviour. We find analytical approximate expressions for the measure of non-Gaussianity and show that initial thermal phonon occupation of the mechanical element does not significantly impact the non-Gaussianity. More importantly, we also show that it is possible to continuously increase the amount of non-Gassuianity of the state by driving the light-matter coupling at the frequency of mechanical resonance, suggesting a viable mechanism for increasing the non-Gaussianity of optomechanical systems even in the presence of noise.", "AuthorKeywords": ["modulated optomechanics", "non-Gaussian", "nonlinearity", "Optomechanics"], "IndexKeywords": ["Approximate expressions", "Asymptotic behaviour", "Light-matter coupling", "Mechanical elements", "Mechanical resonance", "Non-Gaussian", "nonlinearity", "Opto-mechanical systems"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85067549076", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"57203859921": {"Name": "Qvarfort S.", "AuthorID": "57203859921", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "7006026939": {"Name": "Serafini A.", "AuthorID": "7006026939", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "26538352900": {"Name": "Xuereb A.", "AuthorID": "26538352900", "AffiliationID": "60072651", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of Malta"}, "37005823500": {"Name": "R\u00e4tzel D.", "AuthorID": "37005823500", "AffiliationID": "60000762", "AffiliationName": "Institut f\u00fcr Physik, Humboldt-Universit\u00e4t zu Berlin"}, "36833573200": {"Name": "Bruschi D.E.", "AuthorID": "36833573200", "AffiliationID": "60003156", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Quantum Optics and Quantum Information - IQOQI Vienna, Austrian Academy of Sciences"}}}
