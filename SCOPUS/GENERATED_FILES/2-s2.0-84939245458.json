Upon cooling at ambient pressure fast hydrogen ordering is observed at first followed by a slower process which manifests as a tail to the initial sharp exotherm. The residual hydrogen disorder in H<inf>2</inf>O and D<inf>2</inf>O ice XV is determined as a function of the cooling rate. We conclude that it will be difficult to obtain fully hydrogen-ordered ice XV by cooling at ambient pressure. Our new experimental findings are discussed in the context of recent computational work on ice XV.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Ambient pressures", "Complex kinetics", "Computational work", "Cooling rates", "Exotherms", "Hydrogen order", "Residual hydrogen", "Reversible phase transition"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84939245458", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"]], "AuthorData": {"25643782300": {"Name": "Shephard J.", "AuthorID": "25643782300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "7004272333": {"Name": "Salzmann C.", "AuthorID": "7004272333", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}}}
