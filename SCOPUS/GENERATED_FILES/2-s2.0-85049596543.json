Methods: A literature search was conducted in Medline, Embase, and Google Scholar. Papers were selected with a lower limit of 30 patients (no limits with autopsy confirmation). Consensus recommendations were developed through a Delphi procedure, based on the expertise of panelists, who were also informed about the availability and quality of evidence, assessed by an independent methodology team. Results: Critical outcomes were available in nine among the 17 papers initially selected. Only three papers performed a direct comparison between visual and automated assessment and quantified the incremental value provided by the latter. Sensitivity between visual and automatic analysis is similar but automatic assessment generally improves specificity and marginally accuracy. Also, automated assessment increases diagnostic confidence. As expected, performance of visual analysis is reported to depend on the expertise of readers. Conclusions: Tools for semi-quantitative evaluation are recommended to assist the nuclear medicine physician in reporting brain FDG-PET pattern in neurodegenerative conditions. However, heterogeneity, complexity, and drawbacks of these tools should be known by users to avoid misinterpretation. Head-to-head comparisons and an effort to harmonize procedures are encouraged.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Brain FDG-PET", "Dementia", "Neurodegenerative diseases", "Semi-quantitative assessment", "Visual reading"], "IndexKeywords": ["Dementia", "Diagnosis, Differential", "Fluorodeoxyglucose F18", "Humans", "Neurodegenerative Diseases", "Positron-Emission Tomography", "Sensitivity and Specificity"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85049596543", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"57206948479": {"Name": "Nobili F.", "AuthorID": "57206948479", "AffiliationID": "60025153, 60107402", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience (DINOGMI), University of Genoa and Polyclinic San Martino Hospital"}, "57194078503": {"Name": "Festari C.", "AuthorID": "57194078503", "AffiliationID": "60015300", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular and Translational Medicine, University of Brescia"}, "57191225963": {"Name": "Altomare D.", "AuthorID": "57191225963", "AffiliationID": "60015300", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular and Translational Medicine, University of Brescia"}, "6507801629": {"Name": "Boccardi M.", "AuthorID": "6507801629", "AffiliationID": "60004718", "AffiliationName": "LANVIE (Laboratoire de Neuroimagerie du Vieillissement), Department of Psychiatry, University of Geneva"}, "6701687853": {"Name": "Agosta F.", "AuthorID": "6701687853", "AffiliationID": "60009622, 60082964", "AffiliationName": "Neuroimaging Research Unit, Institute of Experimental Neurology, Division of Neuroscience, San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Vita-Salute San Raffaele University"}, "6507213223": {"Name": "Orini S.", "AuthorID": "6507213223", "AffiliationID": "60084291", "AffiliationName": "Alzheimer Operative Unit, IRCCS S.
