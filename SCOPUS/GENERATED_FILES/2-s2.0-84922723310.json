Historically the diagnosis for patients with EL who have no systemic features of MFS is isolated EL (IEL). However, the Ghent nosology for MFS was updated in 2010 and made some important alterations. In particular, patients with EL and a FBN1 mutation are now categorically diagnosed with MFS, if their mutation has previously been described with aortic dilation/dissection. This carries significant systemic implications, as many patients previously diagnosed with IEL are now reclassified. We provide a review of all published cases of IEL caused by FBN1 mutations over the last 20years to assess what impact the new Ghent nosology has on these. Indeed, 57/123 probands (46.3%) are now classified as MFS according to the revised Ghent nosology and 37/96 mutations (38.5%) reported to cause isolated EL have also been found in patients with aortic dilation/dissection. These findings suggest that EL caused by mutations in FBN1 is actually part of a spectrum of fibrillinopathies with MFS, and the term 'IEL' should be avoided in such cases.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Ectopia lentis", "FBN1", "Isolated ectopia lentis", "Marfan syndrome", "Mutation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Ectopia Lentis", "Genotype", "Humans", "Microfilament Proteins", "Mutation", "Phenotype"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84922723310", "SubjectAreas": [["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Genetics (clinical)", "MEDI", "2716"]], "AuthorData": {"16038403700": {"Name": "Chandra A.", "AuthorID": "16038403700", "AffiliationID": "113116542", "AffiliationName": "Vitreoretinal unit, Royal Victoria Eye and Ear Hospital"}, "57198986240": {"Name": "Patel D.", "AuthorID": "57198986240", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Vitreoretinal Unit, Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "7003299563": {"Name": "Charteris D.", "AuthorID": "7003299563", "AffiliationID": "60013148", "AffiliationName": "Inherited Eye Diseases, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "6508145987": {"Name": "Arno G.", "AuthorID": "6508145987", "AffiliationID": "60013148", "AffiliationName": "Inherited Eye Diseases, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "6506571859": {"Name": "Aragon-Martin J.A.", "AuthorID": "6506571859", "AffiliationID": "60029329", "AffiliationName": "Cardiac and Vascular Sciences, St Georges University of London"}, "6603826449": {"Name": "Comeglio P.", "AuthorID": "6603826449", "AffiliationID": "60029329", "AffiliationName": "Cardiac and Vascular Sciences, St Georges University of London"}, "7006605897": {"Name": "Child A.H.", "AuthorID": "7006605897", "AffiliationID": "60029329", "AffiliationName": "Cardiac and Vascular Sciences, St Georges University of London"}, "56946656300": {"Name": "Pinard A.", "AuthorID": "56946656300", "AffiliationID": "60107057, 60000905", "AffiliationName": "INSERM, UMR S 910"}, "6602761293": {"Name": "Collod-B\u00e9roud G.", "AuthorID": "6602761293", "AffiliationID": "60107057, 60000905", "AffiliationName": "INSERM, UMR S 910"}, "57203196621": {"Name": "Boileau C.", "AuthorID": "57203196621", "AffiliationID": "60123796", "AffiliationName": "Unit\u00e9 de Formation et de Recherche de M\u00e9decine, Universit\u00e9 Paris Diderot"}, "7003645330": {"Name": "Faivre L.", "AuthorID": "7003645330", "AffiliationID": "60006283", "AffiliationName": "Centre de Genetique et Centre de Reference Anomalies du Developpement et Syndromes Malformatifs, H\u00f4pital d'Enfants"}}}
