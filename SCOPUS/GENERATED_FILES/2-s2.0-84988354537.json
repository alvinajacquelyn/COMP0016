This study presents a techno-economic assessment of wind offshore energy in the Northern Aegean Sea. Different topologies are proposed, taking into account wind offshore and islands interconnections using HVDC and HVAC technology. Investment indicators are based on the expected power generated by the Weibull wind speed probability density function and the total investment cost required for wind offshore engineering. The results show that the two wind offshore farms can secure the complete electrification of the neighboring islands and supply approximately 3,379 GWh to the main consumption centers in northern and central Greece on an annual basis. A sensitivity analysis towards investment optimization has been performed, proposing different wind turbine technologies and interconnection scenarios.", "AuthorKeywords": ["energy", "HDAC", "HVDC", "interconnections", "islands", "offshore", "wind"], "IndexKeywords": ["energy", "HDAC", "HVDC", "interconnections", "islands", "offshore"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84988354537", "SubjectAreas": [["Energy Engineering and Power Technology", "ENER", "2102"], ["Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment", "ENER", "2105"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"56528434800": {"Name": "Zafeiratou E.", "AuthorID": "56528434800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Energy Institute, University College London"}, "26039534700": {"Name": "Spataru C.", "AuthorID": "26039534700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Energy Institute, University College London"}, "6603227818": {"Name": "Bleischwitz R.", "AuthorID": "6603227818", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Sustainable Resources, University College"}}}
