Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Royal Astronomical Society.Traces of photospheric hydrogen are detected in at least half of all white dwarfs with heliumdominated atmospheres through the presence of H\u03b1 in high-quality optical spectroscopy. Previous studies have noted significant discrepancies between the hydrogen abundances derived from H\u03b1 and Ly \u03b1 for a number of stars where ultraviolet spectroscopy is also available. We demonstrate that this discrepancy is caused by inadequate treatment of the broadening of Ly \u03b1 by neutral helium. When fitting Hubble Space Telescope far-ultraviolet spectroscopy of 17 DB white dwarfs using our new line profile calculations, we find good agreement between log (NH/NHe) measured from Ly \u03b1 and H\u03b1. Larger values of log (NH/NHe) based on Ly \u03b1 are still found for three stars, which are among the most distant in our sample, and we show that a small amount of interstellar absorption from neutral hydrogen can account for this discrepancy.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Line: profiles", "Stars: atmospheres", "Ultraviolet: stars", "White dwarfs"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85054706689", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"7004303221": {"Name": "G\u00e4nsicke B.", "AuthorID": "7004303221", "AffiliationID": "60022020", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of Warwick"}, "36012227500": {"Name": "Toloza O.", "AuthorID": "36012227500", "AffiliationID": "60022020", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of Warwick"}, "7004367122": {"Name": "Koester D.", "AuthorID": "7004367122", "AffiliationID": "60012345", "AffiliationName": "Institut f\u00fcr Theoretische Physik und Astrophysik, University of Kiel"}, "57203394181": {"Name": "Farihi J.", "AuthorID": "57203394181", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}}}
