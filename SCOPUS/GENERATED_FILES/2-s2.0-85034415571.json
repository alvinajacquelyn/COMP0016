Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.The South African national treatment programme includes nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) in both first and second line highly active antiretroviral therapy regimens. Mutations in the RNase H domain have been associated with resistance to NRTIs but primarily in HIV-1 subtype B studies. Here, we investigated the prevalence and association of RNase H mutations with NRTI resistance in sequences from HIV-1 subtype C infected individuals. RNase H sequences from 112 NRTI treated but virologically failing individuals and 28 antiretroviral therapy (ART)-naive individuals were generated and analysed. In addition, sequences from 359 subtype C ART-naive sequences were downloaded from Los Alamos database to give a total of 387 sequences from ART-naive individuals for the analysis. Fisher\u2019s exact test was used to identify mutations and Bayesian network learning was applied to identify novel NRTI resistance mutation pathways in RNase H domain. The mutations A435L, S468A, T470S, L484I, A508S, Q509L, L517I, Q524E and E529D were more prevalent in sequences from treatment-experienced compared to antiretroviral treatment naive individuals, however, only the E529D mutation remained significant after correction for multiple comparison. Our findings suggest a potential interaction between E529D and NRTI-treatment; however, site-directed mutagenesis is needed to understand the impact of this RNase H mutation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["HIV-1", "Mutations", "NRTIs", "Resistance", "RNase H"], "IndexKeywords": ["Anti-HIV Agents", "Antiretroviral Therapy, Highly Active", "Bayes Theorem", "Databases, Genetic", "Drug Resistance, Viral", "Genotype", "HIV Infections", "HIV-1", "Humans", "Mutation", "Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors", "Ribonuclease H, Human Immunodeficiency Virus", "Sequence Analysis, DNA"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85034415571", "SubjectAreas": [["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"], ["Virology", "IMMU", "2406"]], "AuthorData": {"56196428500": {"Name": "Ngcapu S.", "AuthorID": "56196428500", "AffiliationID": "60094841, 60010499", "AffiliationName": "Centre for the AIDS Programme of Research in South Africa, University of KwaZulu-Natal"}, "6507164421": {"Name": "Ndung\u2019u T.", "AuthorID": "6507164421", "AffiliationID": "60022344", "AffiliationName": "Max Planck Institute for Infection Biology"}, "7402800738": {"Name": "Gordon M.L.", "AuthorID": "7402800738", "AffiliationID": "60010499", "AffiliationName": "Doris Duke Medical Research Institute, University of KwaZulu-Natal"}, "23973871200": {"Name": "Theys K.", "AuthorID": "23973871200", "AffiliationID": "60068577, 60025063", "AffiliationName": "Rega Institute for Medical Research, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, KU Leuven\u2013University of Leuven"}, "25824382700": {"Name": "Libin P.", "AuthorID": "25824382700", "AffiliationID": "60000145, 60026810", "AffiliationName": "Artificial Intelligence Lab, Department of Computer Science, Vrije Universiteit Brussel"}, "22951187600": {"Name": "Marconi V.C.", "AuthorID": "22951187600", "AffiliationID": "60002339", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infectious Disease, Emory University School of Medicine"}, "14422678600": {"Name": "Sunpath H.", "AuthorID": "14422678600", "AffiliationID": "60017135, 60010499", "AffiliationName": "Infectious Diseases Unit, Nelson Mandela School of Medicine, University of KwaZulu-Natal"}}}
