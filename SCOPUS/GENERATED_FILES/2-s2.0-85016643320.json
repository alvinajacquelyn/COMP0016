Published under the terms of the CC BY 4.0 licenseAn unresolved question is how HIV-1 achieves efficient replication in terminally differentiated macrophages despite the restriction factor SAMHD1. We reveal inducible changes in expression of cell cycle-associated proteins including MCM2 and cyclins A, E, D1/D3 in macrophages, without evidence for DNA synthesis or mitosis. These changes are induced by activation of the Raf/MEK/ERK kinase cascade, culminating in upregulation of CDK1 with subsequent SAMHD1 T592 phosphorylation and deactivation of its antiviral activity. HIV infection is limited to these G1-like phase macrophages at the single-cell level. Depletion of SAMHD1 in macrophages decouples the association between infection and expression of cell cycle-associated proteins, with terminally differentiated macrophages becoming highly susceptible to HIV-1. We observe both embryo-derived and monocyte-derived tissue-resident macrophages in a G1-like phase at frequencies approaching 20%, suggesting how macrophages sustain HIV-1 replication in vivo. Finally, we reveal a SAMHD1-dependent antiretroviral activity of histone deacetylase inhibitors acting via p53 activation. These data provide a basis for host-directed therapeutic approaches aimed at limiting HIV-1 burden in macrophages that may contribute to curative interventions.", "AuthorKeywords": ["cell cycle", "histone deacetylase", "HIV", "macrophage", "SAMHD1"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cells, Cultured", "G1 Phase", "HIV-1", "Humans", "Immune Evasion", "Immunity, Innate", "Macrophages", "Monomeric GTP-Binding Proteins", "Phosphorylation", "Protein Processing, Post-Translational"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85016643320", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Immunology and Microbiology (all)", "IMMU", "2400"]], "AuthorData": {"6506026234": {"Name": "Mlcochova P.", "AuthorID": "6506026234", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London"}, "55944950000": {"Name": "Sutherland K.A.", "AuthorID": "55944950000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London"}, "55913967100": {"Name": "Watters S.A.", "AuthorID": "55913967100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London"}, "57195363908": {"Name": "Noursadeghi M.", "AuthorID": "57195363908", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London"}, "7005453955": {"Name": "Towers G.J.", "AuthorID": "7005453955", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London"}, "56848412000": {"Name": "Gupta R.K.", "AuthorID": "56848412000", "AffiliationID": "60138826", "AffiliationName": "Africa Health Research Institute"}, "15070521300": {"Name": "Bertoli C.", "AuthorID": "15070521300", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60010269", "AffiliationName": "MRC Laboratory for Molecular Cell Biology, University College London"}, "7006222988": {"Name": "de Bruin R.A.M.", "AuthorID": "7006222988", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60010269", "AffiliationName": "MRC Laboratory for Molecular Cell Biology, University College London"}, "6507679538": {"Name": "Rehwinkel J.", "AuthorID": "6507679538", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851, 60001633, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council Human Immunology Unit, Radcliffe Department of Medicine, Medical Research Council Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Oxford"}, "13613380300": {"Name": "Neil S.J.", "AuthorID": "13613380300", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Division of Immunology, Infection and Inflammatory Disease, King's College"}, "56354780500": {"Name": "Lenzi G.M.", "AuthorID": "56354780500", "AffiliationID": "60002339", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatrics, Center for Drug Discovery, Emory School of Medicine"}, "55663739700": {"Name": "Kim B.", "AuthorID": "55663739700", "AffiliationID": "60002339", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatrics, Center for Drug Discovery, Emory School of Medicine"}, "7005296444": {"Name": "Khwaja A.", "AuthorID": "7005296444", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Haematology, UCL"}, "24830499600": {"Name": "Gage M.C.", "AuthorID": "24830499600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Medicine, University College London"}, "57189003414": {"Name": "Georgiou C.", "AuthorID": "57189003414", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Medicine, University College London"}, "6506324550": {"Name": "Chittka A.", "AuthorID": "6506324550", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Medicine, University College London"}, "6602901174": {"Name": "Yona S.", "AuthorID": "6602901174", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Medicine, University College London"}}}
