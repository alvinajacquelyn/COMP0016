We investigated the analytical and diagnostic performance of 3 commonly used neurogranin assays in the same cohort of patients to improve the interpretability of CSF neurogranin test results. METHODS: The neurogranin Erenna\u00ae assay from Washington University, St. Louis, MO (WashU); ELISA from ADx Neurosciences; and ELISA from Gothenburg University, M\u00f6lndal, Sweden (UGot), were compared using silver staining and Western blot after gel electrophoresis. Clinical performance of the 3 assays was compared in samples from individuals diagnosed with subjective cognitive decline (n 22), and in patients with AD (n 22), frontotemporal dementia (n 22), dementia with Lewy bodies (n 22), or vascular dementia (n 20), adjusted for sex and age. RESULTS: The assays detected different epitopes of neurogranin: the WashU assay detected the N-terminal part of neurogranin (S10-D23) and a C-terminal part (G49-G60), the ADx assay detected C-terminal neurogranin truncated at P75, and the UGot assay detected the C-terminal neurogranin with intact ending (D78). Spearman was 0.95 between ADx and WashU, 0.87 between UGot and WashU, and 0.81 between UGot and ADx. ANCOVA (analysis of covariance) showed group differences for ranked neurogranin concentrations in each assay (all P 0.05), with specific increases in AD. CONCLUSIONS: Although the 3 assays target different epitopes on neurogranin and have different calibrators, the high correlations and the similar group differences suggest that the different forms of neurogranin in CSF carry similar diagnostic information, at least in the context of neurodegenerative diseases.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Alzheimer Disease", "Antibodies", "Biomarkers", "Cerebrospinal Fluid", "Cohort Studies", "Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel", "Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay", "Epitopes", "Humans", "Neurogranin"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85047958635", "SubjectAreas": [["Clinical Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1308"], ["Biochemistry (medical)", "MEDI", "2704"]], "AuthorData": {"56515154700": {"Name": "Willemse E.A.J.", "AuthorID": "56515154700", "AffiliationID": "60070023, 60012937", "AffiliationName": "Reference Center for Biological Markers of Dementia (BIODEM), Department of Biomedical Sciences, Institute Born-Bunge, University of Antwerp"}, "7007073571": {"Name": "Scheltens P.", "AuthorID": "7007073571", "AffiliationID": "60008734, 60013779, 60001997", "AffiliationName": "Alzheimer Center, Department of Neurology, Amsterdam Neuroscience, VU University Medical Center"}, "16047002600": {"Name": "Bjerke M.", "AuthorID": "16047002600", "AffiliationID": "60070023, 60012937", "AffiliationName": "Reference Center for Biological Markers of Dementia (BIODEM), Department of Biomedical Sciences, Institute Born-Bunge, University of Antwerp"}, "6701704380": {"Name": "Teunissen C.E.", "AuthorID": "6701704380", "AffiliationID": "60008734, 60001997", "AffiliationName": "Neurochemistry Laboratory, Department of Clinical Chemistry, Amsterdam Neuroscience, VU University Medical Center"}, "8548678900": {"Name": "Van Der Flier W.M.", "AuthorID": "8548678900", "AffiliationID": "60001997", "AffiliationName": "VU University Medical Center, Epidemiology and Biostatistics"}, "7004850774": {"Name": "Engelborghs S.", "AuthorID": "7004850774", "AffiliationID": "60070023, 60012937", "AffiliationName": "Reference Center for Biological Markers of Dementia (BIODEM), Department of Biomedical Sciences, Institute Born-Bunge, University of Antwerp"}, "57027236400": {"Name": "De Vos A.", "AuthorID": "57027236400", "AffiliationID": "60112912", "AffiliationName": "ADx Neuro Sciences"}, "7003363397": {"Name": "Vanmechelen E.", "AuthorID": "7003363397", "AffiliationID": "60112912", "AffiliationName": "ADx Neuro Sciences"}, "56856811200": {"Name": "Herries E.M.", "AuthorID": "56856811200", "AffiliationID": "60022756", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology and Immunology, Washington University School of Medicine"}, "7004480729": {"Name": "Crimmins D.", "AuthorID": "7004480729", "AffiliationID": "60022756", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology and Immunology, Washington University School of Medicine"}, "7004653901": {"Name": "Ladenson J.H.", "AuthorID": "7004653901", "AffiliationID": "60022756", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology and Immunology, Washington University School of Medicine"}, "6507790467": {"Name": "Andreasson U.", "AuthorID": "6507790467", "AffiliationID": "60027675, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Neurochemistry Laboratory, Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg"}, "6701454676": {"Name": "Zetterberg H.", "AuthorID": "6701454676", "AffiliationID": "120590429", "AffiliationName": "UK Dementia Research Institute"}, "56415176000": {"Name": "Blennow K.", "AuthorID": "56415176000", "AffiliationID": "60027675, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Neurochemistry Laboratory, Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg"}, "7006947447": {"Name": "Fagan A.M.", "AuthorID": "7006947447", "AffiliationID": "60022756", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Knight Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Research Center, Hope Center for Neurodegenerative Disorders, Washington University School of Medicine"}}}
