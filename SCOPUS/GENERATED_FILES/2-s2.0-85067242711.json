This paper explores patients\u2019 contributions to informing patient safety research at an early stage, within a project on intravenous infusion errors. Currently, there is little or no guidance on how best to involve patients and the wider public in shaping patient safety research, and indeed, whether such efforts are worthwhile. Method We ran a 3-hour workshop involving nine patients with experience of intravenous therapy in the hospital setting. The first part explored patients\u2019 experiences of intravenous therapy. We derived research questions from the resulting discussion through qualitative analysis. In the second part, patients were asked for feedback on patient information sheets considering both content and clarity, and on two potential approaches to framing our patient information: one that focused on research on safety and error, the other on quality improvement. Results The workshop led to a thorough review of how we should engage with patients. Importantly, there was a clear steer away from terms such as \u2018error\u2019 and \u2018safety\u2019 that could worry patients. The experiences that patients revealed were also richer than we had anticipated, revealing different conceptions of how patients related to their treatment and care, their role in safety and use of medical devices, the different levels of information they preferred, and broader factors impacting perceptions of their care. Conclusion Involving patients at an early stage in patient safety research can be of great value. Our workshop highlighted sensitivities around potentially worrying patients about risks that they might not have considered previously, and how to address these. Patient representatives also emphasised a need to expand the focus of patient safety research beyond clinicians and error, to include factors affecting perceptions of quality and safety for patients more broadly.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Health services research", "Intravenous medication", "Medication error", "Patient and public involvement", "Patient safety"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85067242711", "SubjectAreas": [["Health (social science)", "SOCI", "3306"], ["Health Professions (all)", "HEAL", "3600"]], "AuthorData": {"36165110400": {"Name": "Furniss D.", "AuthorID": "36165110400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Interaction Centre, University College London"}, "55203936600": {"Name": "Iacovides I.", "AuthorID": "55203936600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Interaction Centre, University College London"}, "26642597600": {"Name": "Lyons I.", "AuthorID": "26642597600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Interaction Centre, University College London"}, "7004087556": {"Name": "Blandford A.", "AuthorID": "7004087556", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Interaction Centre, University College London"}, "57194222242": {"Name": "Franklin B.D.", "AuthorID": "57194222242", "AffiliationID": "60016379", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Practice and Policy, UCL School of Pharmacy"}}}
