An implicit time integration scheme is herein developed within the framework of the u\u2013w (solid displacement\u2013relative fluid displacement) formulation for the Biot\u2019s equations. In particular, liquid water saturated porous media is considered and the linearization of the linear momentum equations taking into account all the inertia terms for both solid and fluid phases is for the first time presented. The spatial discretization is carried out through a meshfree method, in which the shape functions are based on the principle of local maximum entropy LME. The current methodology is firstly validated with the dynamic consolidation of a soil column and the plastic shear band formulation of a square domain loaded by a rigid footing. The feasibility of this new numerical approach for solving large deformation dynamic problems is finally demonstrated through the application to an embankment problem subjected to an earthquake.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Biot\u2019s equations", "Hyperelastoplasticity", "Implicit schemes", "Meshfree", "u\u2013w formulation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Dynamic consolidation", "Fluid saturated porous media", "Hyperelastoplasticity", "Implicit schemes", "Implicit time integration", "Meshfree", "Saturated porous media", "Spatial discretizations"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85037624534", "SubjectAreas": [["Computational Mechanics", "ENGI", "2206"], ["Ocean Engineering", "ENGI", "2212"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"], ["Computational Theory and Mathematics", "COMP", "1703"], ["Computational Mathematics", "MATH", "2605"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"54389848000": {"Name": "Navas P.", "AuthorID": "54389848000", "AffiliationID": "60000823", "AffiliationName": "School of Civil Engineering, University of Castilla La-Mancha"}, "7401436066": {"Name": "Yu R.", "AuthorID": "7401436066", "AffiliationID": "60000823", "AffiliationName": "School of Civil Engineering, University of Castilla La-Mancha"}, "6505929024": {"Name": "Sanavia L.", "AuthorID": "6505929024", "AffiliationID": "60000481", "AffiliationName": "Dipartimento di Ingegneria Civile, Edile e Ambientale, Universit\u00e1 degli Studi di Padova"}, "57203544711": {"Name": "L\u00f3pez-Querol S.", "AuthorID": "57203544711", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil, Environmental and Geomatic Engineering, University College London"}}}
