Much of the drive to adapt the governance of the Eurozone has been influenced by the traditional theory of optimal currency areas (OCA), which stresses the need for flexibility in product and labour markets. As a result, the Eurozone countries have been pushed towards structural reforms that aim to reduce the structural rigidities in product and labour markets, in the hope that this would lead to a more resilient monetary union capable of withstanding future asymmetric shocks. Figure 7.1, which presents the OECD product market legislation index, shows that the Eurozone countries have introduced structural reforms at a faster pace than the rest of the OECD countries. Figure 7.2, which presents the OECD index of employment protection, shows how the Eurozone has significantly reduced its tight employment protection, especially since the sovereign debt crisis in 2010. It is interesting to note that since the early 1990s the non-Eurozone OECD countries have followed a reverse trend of increasing employment protection. In this chapter, we ask whether this movement towards structural reform as part of the push for new governance is going in the right direction. We will argue that this is not the case. The main reason is that the nature of the shocks that have hit the Eurozone does not correspond to the pattern of asymmetric shocks that has been identified by the OCA theory to require more flexibility. We will argue that what is needed in the Eurozone is not more structural reforms but a better mechanism capable of dealing with the classical boom and bust dynamics that are inherent to capitalism. Hyman Minsky's classic analysis of booms and busts in capitalist systems stresses the need to stabilise using government mechanisms. We will ask whether the Eurozone, which has moved towards more flexibility, provides for this stabilising mechanism.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85048543637", "SubjectAreas": [["Social Sciences (all)", "SOCI", "3300"]], "AuthorData": {"6601959343": {"Name": "De Grauwe P.", "AuthorID": "6601959343", "AffiliationID": "60003059", "AffiliationName": "London School of Economics"}, "55418343800": {"Name": "Ji Y.", "AuthorID": "55418343800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
