The predominant in vivo synthetic pathway for ceramide formation is via sphingomyelinase catalyzed hydrolysis of sphingomyelin. The biochemistry of this essential pathway has been studied in detail; however, there is currently a lack of information on the structural behavior of sphingomyelin- and ceramide-rich model membrane systems, which is essential for developing a bottom-up understanding of ceramide signaling and platform formation. We have studied the lyotropic phase behavior of sphingomyelin-ceramide mixtures in excess water as a function of temperature (30-70 \u00b0C) and pressure (1-200 MPa) by small- and wide-angle X-ray scattering. At low ceramide concentrations the mixtures form the ripple gel phase (P\u03b2\u2032) below the gel transition temperature for sphingomyelin, and this observation has been confirmed by atomic force microscopy. Formation of the ripple gel phase can also be induced at higher temperatures via the application of hydrostatic pressure. At high ceramide concentration an inverse hexagonal phase (HII) is formed coexisting with a cubic phase.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Gel-transition temperature", "Lyotropic phase behavior", "Model membrane systems", "Signaling molecules", "Small and wide angle x ray scatterings", "Structural behaviors", "Synthetic pathways", "Temperature phase", "Animals", "Ceramides", "Phase Transition", "Pressure", "Sphingomyelins", "Temperature"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84926443046", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Surfaces and Interfaces", "PHYS", "3110"], ["Spectroscopy", "CHEM", "1607"], ["Electrochemistry", "CHEM", "1603"]], "AuthorData": {"56298292000": {"Name": "Barriga H.", "AuthorID": "56298292000", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Imperial College London"}, "56452593000": {"Name": "Parsons E.", "AuthorID": "56452593000", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Imperial College London"}, "56452513700": {"Name": "McCarthy N.", "AuthorID": "56452513700", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Imperial College London"}, "6507910297": {"Name": "Ces O.", "AuthorID": "6507910297", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Imperial College London"}, "7103239735": {"Name": "Seddon J.", "AuthorID": "7103239735", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Imperial College London"}, "7201502191": {"Name": "Law R.", "AuthorID": "7201502191", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Imperial College London"}, "23501391200": {"Name": "Brooks N.", "AuthorID": "23501391200", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Imperial College London"}}}
