The introduction traces current articulations of \u2018enough\u2019 and argues that these need to be placed within a historical and comparative context that highlights the often hidden multiplicity of its cultural and political resonance. \u2018Enough\u2019 is often malleable and changing in relation to new desires, technologies or values. Drawing on the chapters in this volume, the concept of \u2018enough\u2019 is suggested to be more complex than quantitative measures can resolve. These various case studies also prompt critical thought about the politics of sufficiency more broadly and which pose important questions for sustainability proponents.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Concept of enough", "Politics", "Presentism", "Value-laden multiplicity"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85063458113", "SubjectAreas": [["Economics, Econometrics and Finance (all)", "ECON", "2000"], ["Business, Management and Accounting (all)", "BUSI", "1400"], ["Arts and Humanities (all)", "ARTS", "1200"], ["Social Sciences (all)", "SOCI", "3300"]], "AuthorData": {"57195922830": {"Name": "Ingleby M.", "AuthorID": "57195922830", "AffiliationID": "60022109", "AffiliationName": "School of English and Drama, Queen Mary University of London"}, "23028830600": {"Name": "Randalls S.", "AuthorID": "23028830600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography, University College London"}}}
