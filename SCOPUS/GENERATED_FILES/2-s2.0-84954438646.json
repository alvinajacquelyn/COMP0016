Studies so far have demonstrated poor correlation between bilateral NIPF and symptom-specific nasal questionnaires following septorhinoplasty. Design: To perform a prospective comparative analysis between NIPF and the validated disease-specific quality-of-life questionnaire SNOT-22 and to determine whether a correlation exists following septorhinoplasty surgery. Setting: The Royal National Throat Nose and Ear Hospital, London. Participants: A total of 122 patients (78 males, 44 females; mean age 33.5 \u00b1 12.2 years) were recruited from the senior authors rhinology clinic and underwent functional septorhinoplasty surgery. Main outcome measures: Preoperative and postoperative nasal inspiratory peak flow (NIPF) measurements were performed in addition to the completion of three subjective quality-of-life and symptom assessment tool questionnaires; Sinonasal Outcome Test 22 (SNOT-22), Nasal Obstruction Symptom Evaluation (NOSE) and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS: 0-10). Results: The mean preoperative NIPF was 88.2 L/min, and the postoperative value was 101.6 L/min and showed a significant improvement following surgery (P = 0.0064). The mean total SNOT-22 score improved significantly from 48.6 to 26.6 (P < 0.0001); the NOSE score from 14.1 to 6.6 (P < 0.0001); and the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) blockage score from 6.9 to 3.2 (P < 0.0001). All individual domains assessed showed improvements postoperatively, but no correlation was found between the NIPF and SNOT-22 score. Equally, we did not find a correlation between NIPF and the symptom-specific NOSE questionnaire and the nasal blockage domain on the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) scale. Conclusion: We have demonstrated that NIPF does not correlate with the SNOT-22 disease-specific questionnaire, although both outcomes significantly improve postoperatively. At present, we are still lacking a clinically accurate objective measure of nasal function for the evaluation of patients undergoing septorhinoplasty surgery.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Humans", "Male", "Nasal Obstruction", "Nasal Septum", "Outcome Assessment (Health Care)", "Postoperative Period", "Prospective Studies", "Quality of Life", "Rhinoplasty", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84954438646", "SubjectAreas": [["Otorhinolaryngology", "MEDI", "2733"]], "AuthorData": {"14521750300": {"Name": "Andrews P.J.", "AuthorID": "14521750300", "AffiliationID": "60011326, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "The Ear Institute, UCL"}, "57212725451": {"Name": "Choudhury N.", "AuthorID": "57212725451", "AffiliationID": "60029890", "AffiliationName": "Department of Rhinology and Facial Plastic Surgery, Royal National Throat Nose and Ear Hospital"}, "55776886600": {"Name": "Takhar A.", "AuthorID": "55776886600", "AffiliationID": "60029890", "AffiliationName": "Department of Rhinology and Facial Plastic Surgery, Royal National Throat Nose and Ear Hospital"}, "6505831730": {"Name": "Poirrier A.L.", "AuthorID": "6505831730", "AffiliationID": "60029890", "AffiliationName": "Department of Rhinology and Facial Plastic Surgery, Royal National Throat Nose and Ear Hospital"}, "57213239147": {"Name": "Jacques T.", "AuthorID": "57213239147", "AffiliationID": "60029890", "AffiliationName": "Department of Rhinology and Facial Plastic Surgery, Royal National Throat Nose and Ear Hospital"}, "35373930800": {"Name": "Randhawa P.S.", "AuthorID": "35373930800", "AffiliationID": "60029890", "AffiliationName": "Department of Rhinology and Facial Plastic Surgery, Royal National Throat Nose and Ear Hospital"}}}
