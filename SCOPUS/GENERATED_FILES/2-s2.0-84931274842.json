However, the key issue as to the nature of forces driving the folding and recognition processes remains unanswered. In this study, structural changes of 22-mer ht-DNA fragment (Tel22), induced by binding of ions (K<sup>+</sup>, Na<sup>+</sup>) and specific bisquinolinium ligands, were monitored by calorimetric and spectroscopic methods and by gel electrophoresis. Using the global model analysis of a wide variety of experimental data, we were able to characterize the thermodynamic forces that govern the formation of stable Tel22 G-quadruplexes, folding intermediates, and ligand-quadruplex complexes, and then predict Tel22 behavior in aqueous solutions as a function of temperature, salt concentration, and ligand concentration. On the basis of the above, we believe that our work sets the framework for better understanding the heterogeneity of ht-DNA folding and binding pathways, and its structural polymorphism.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["G-Quadruplexes", "Humans", "Molecular Dynamics Simulation", "Potassium", "Sodium", "Telomere"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84931274842", "SubjectAreas": [["Biophysics", "BIOC", "1304"]], "AuthorData": {"6504456319": {"Name": "Bon\u010dina M.", "AuthorID": "6504456319", "AffiliationID": "60031106", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Chemistry and Chemical Technology, University of Ljubljana"}, "7003355106": {"Name": "Vesnaver G.", "AuthorID": "7003355106", "AffiliationID": "60031106", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Chemistry and Chemical Technology, University of Ljubljana"}, "35610732000": {"Name": "Lah J.", "AuthorID": "35610732000", "AffiliationID": "60031106", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Chemistry and Chemical Technology, University of Ljubljana"}, "35097318700": {"Name": "Hamon F.", "AuthorID": "35097318700", "AffiliationID": "60008134, 60030640, 60106017", "AffiliationName": "Institut Curie, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique UMR-176, Centre Universitaire d'Orsay"}, "6601942083": {"Name": "Teulade-Fichou M.P.", "AuthorID": "6601942083", "AffiliationID": "60008134, 60030640, 60106017", "AffiliationName": "Institut Curie, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique UMR-176, Centre Universitaire d'Orsay"}, "22985150000": {"Name": "Islam B.", "AuthorID": "22985150000", "AffiliationID": "60029738", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cancer Research and Cell Biology, Queen's University of Belfast"}, "57196221455": {"Name": "Haider S.", "AuthorID": "57196221455", "AffiliationID": "60016379", "AffiliationName": "University College London School of Pharmacy, Bloomsbury"}}}
