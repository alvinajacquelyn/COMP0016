All rights reserved.Objective: To define an algorithm to improve diagnosis of neonatal hemochromatosis (NH) related to gestational alloimmune liver disease (GALD), which is diagnosed by immunohistochemistry demonstrating activated complement at hepatocytes (IDACH). Study design: We assessed 56 instances of fetal death or neonatal liver failure (NLF; 2006-2009), 29 (7 stillborns, 22 NLF) with NH, and 27 (5 stillborns, 22 NLF) without NH (non-NH). Immunohistochemistry was retrospectively performed in 21 cases. Cases were grouped as follows: (1) GALD as demonstrated by IDACH (n = 17); (2) indeterminate for GALD (n = 28); or (3) alternate diagnosis found (n = 11). We compared cases of immunohistochemically proven GALD with those with an alternate diagnosis. Results: Of the 12 stillborns, 7 had NH because of GALD (NH-GALD), one was undeterminate, and 4 had alternate diagnoses (GALD excluded). Of the 22 newborns with NH, 6 had NH-GALD, one had mitochondrial respiratory chain disorder (MRCD), and 15 were indeterminate for GALD. Of 22 non-NH newborns, extrahepatic siderosis (EHS) was not assessed in 13 (3 GALD, 1 alternate diagnosis [MRCD] and 9 indeterminate GALD) and excluded in 9 (5 alternate diagnoses and 4 indeterminate GALD). The only clinical features found to be associated with GALD were intrafamilial recurrence, prematurity, and EHS. Conclusions: In unexplained fetal death or NLF, the diagnosis of subsets of NH requires tissue analysis (autopsy) to assess EHS. In patients with NH, if MRCD is ruled out, NH-GALD is likely. The rate of IDACH in the diagnosis of GALD in cases without NH requires further study.", "AuthorKeywords": ["DGUOK Deoxyguanosine kinase", "EHS Extrahepatic siderosis", "ET Exchange transfusion", "GA Gestational age", "GALD Gestational alloimmune liver disease", "HLH Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis", "HUS Hemolytic uremic syndrome", "IDACH Immunohistochemistry demonstrating activated complement in hepatocytes", "IUGR Intrauterine growth restriction", "IV-IG Intravenous immunoglobulin", "MRCD Mitochondrial respiratory chain disorder", "MRI Magnetic resonance imaging", "NH Neonatal hemochromatosis", "NH-GALD Neonatal hemochromatosis because of gestational alloimmune liver disease", "NLF Neonatal liver failure", "RES Reticuloendothelial system"], "IndexKeywords": ["Autopsy", "Female", "Fetal Death", "Fetus", "France", "Hemochromatosis", "Hepatocytes", "Humans", "Immunohistochemistry", "Infant, Newborn", "Liver Failure", "Male", "Pedigree", "Pregnancy", "Retrospective Studies", "Stillbirth"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84922022049", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"]], "AuthorData": {"35080429700": {"Name": "Heissat S.", "AuthorID": "35080429700", "AffiliationID": "60012357, 60023578", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Hepatology, H\u00f4pital Femme M\u00e8re Enfant, Hospices Civils de Lyon et Universit\u00e9 Lyon 1"}, "21734143300": {"Name": "Collardeau-Frachon S.", "AuthorID": "21734143300", "AffiliationID": "60012357, 60023578", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, H\u00f4pital Femme M\u00e8re Enfant, Hospices Civils de Lyon et Universit\u00e9 Lyon 1"}, "55368578100": {"Name": "Dubruc E.", "AuthorID": "55368578100", "AffiliationID": "60012357, 60023578", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, H\u00f4pital Femme M\u00e8re Enfant, Hospices Civils de Lyon et Universit\u00e9 Lyon 1"}, "7005595143": {"Name": "Bouvier R.", "AuthorID": "7005595143", "AffiliationID": "60012357, 60023578", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, H\u00f4pital Femme M\u00e8re Enfant, Hospices Civils de Lyon et Universit\u00e9 Lyon 1"}, "26430341400": {"Name": "Baruteau J.", "AuthorID": "26430341400", "AffiliationID": "60024960", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatric Hepatology and Metabolic Diseases, CHU Toulouse"}, "6602427765": {"Name": "Brou\u00e9 P.", "AuthorID": "6602427765", "AffiliationID": "60024960", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatric Hepatology and Metabolic Diseases, CHU Toulouse"}, "7101818706": {"Name": "Fabre M.", "AuthorID": "7101818706", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology"}, "7006781535": {"Name": "Cordier M.P.", "AuthorID": "7006781535", "AffiliationID": "115231400", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genetics, H\u00f4pital Femme-M\u00e8re-Enfant, HCL Lyon"}, "6602537015": {"Name": "Guigonis V.", "AuthorID": "6602537015", "AffiliationID": "60015759", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatrics, H\u00f4pital M\u00e8re et Enfant, CHU Limoges"}, "7004317787": {"Name": "Debray D.", "AuthorID": "7004317787", "AffiliationID": "60026877, 60021567", "AffiliationName": "Medical-Surgical Center, Hepatology, and Transplantation AP-HP, H\u00f4pital Necker Enfants Malades"}}}
