The UK has excellent potential for wind and wave power. The costs of wind energy are cost- competitive but there are issues with intermittency and public acceptance of onshore wind. Marine energy could provide a more stable electricity source but has significant uncertainty about future costs and deployment risks. What role do ocean and wind energy play in a cost effective, technically feasible long-term low carbon energy system? We study the necessary technological learning of tidal energy with UKTM (a long running energy system model) and analyse the impacts of adding tidal to the electricity system with highRES (a high spatial and temporal resolution electricity system model). We find that while tidal energy reduces the need for investment into flexible generation, it does so less than the spatial diversification of already existing renewable energy sources. Translating the results into policy advice it may be time to pick existing technologies (in this case wind energy) as winners.", "AuthorKeywords": ["electricity system", "spatially and temporally explicit", "technological learning", "tidal energy", "wind energy"], "IndexKeywords": ["Electricity system", "Low-carbon energy systems", "Low-carbon technologies", "Renewable energy source", "Spatial and temporal resolutions", "spatially and temporally explicit", "Technological learning", "Tidal energy"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84983239124", "SubjectAreas": [["Marketing", "BUSI", "1406"], ["Energy Engineering and Power Technology", "ENER", "2102"], ["Fuel Technology", "ENER", "2103"]], "AuthorData": {"55368951400": {"Name": "Zeyringer M.", "AuthorID": "55368951400", "AffiliationID": "60084282", "AffiliationName": "UCL Energy Institute"}, "56215999300": {"Name": "Fais B.", "AuthorID": "56215999300", "AffiliationID": "60084282", "AffiliationName": "UCL Energy Institute"}, "57198904204": {"Name": "Price J.", "AuthorID": "57198904204", "AffiliationID": "60084282", "AffiliationName": "UCL Energy Institute"}}}
