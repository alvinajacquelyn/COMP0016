Specifically, our analyses of 674 media articles, focusing on the relationship between labeling and categorization, identify classification inconsistencies at three levels: within clusters of labels, between labels and categories, and between category attributes. These inconsistencies hamper categorization based on attribute similarity, audience goals, and causal models, respectively. We identify four factors that nurture this categorical anarchy and conclude with a call for research on the socioeconomic revolution heralded by blockchain technology.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bitcoin", "Categorization", "Expertise", "Innovation", "Media"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85016402949", "SubjectAreas": [["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"], ["Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management", "BUSI", "1407"]], "AuthorData": {"36020814100": {"Name": "Vergne J.", "AuthorID": "36020814100", "AffiliationID": "60115928, 60010884", "AffiliationName": "Ivey Business School, Western University"}, "57193764646": {"Name": "Swain G.", "AuthorID": "57193764646", "AffiliationID": "60115928, 60010884", "AffiliationName": "Ivey Business School, Western University"}}}
