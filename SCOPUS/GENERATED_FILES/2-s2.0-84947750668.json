The proposed bundle of full-standard OFDM wireless signals includes broadcast of ETSI EN 300 744 DVB-T signals and multi-format wireless signals 3GPP long-term evolution (LTE), IEEE 802.16 Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX), and ECMA-368 ultra-wide band (UWB). This bundle of OFDM-based signals is transmitted using radio-over-fibre in overlay with: (i) legacy baseband data of a conventional passive optical network (PON) or (ii) a custom OFDM signal providing Gigabit Ethernet (OFDM-GbE) for next-generation access networks. The optimum RF input power level for the combined bundle of signals is evaluated for both downstream (using external transmission) and upstream (using direct modulation). The successful demodulation of all signals confirms the actual possibility of coexistence of multi-format OFDM wireless with legacy baseband data. Also, it is demonstrated that the system with OFDM-GbE can achieve longer optical reach using centralized OFDM compensation. In this case, the possibility of providing video overlay with more DVB-T channels is confirmed for the complete UHF band.", "AuthorKeywords": ["baseband", "fibre-to-the-home (FTTH)", "orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)", "Radio-over-fibre"], "IndexKeywords": ["3gpp long term evolutions", "Access network", "Base bands", "Direct modulation", "Gigabit Ethernet", "Next generation access networks", "Optical reach", "Wireless signals"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84947750668", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"]], "AuthorData": {"25929423700": {"Name": "Morant M.", "AuthorID": "25929423700", "AffiliationID": "60011476", "AffiliationName": "Nanophotonics Technology Centre, Universitat Polit\u00e8cnica de Val\u00e8ncia"}, "35495003200": {"Name": "Llorente R.", "AuthorID": "35495003200", "AffiliationID": "60011476", "AffiliationName": "Nanophotonics Technology Centre, Universitat Polit\u00e8cnica de Val\u00e8ncia"}, "56114372900": {"Name": "Thakur M.", "AuthorID": "56114372900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "8207205100": {"Name": "Mitchell J.", "AuthorID": "8207205100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}}}
