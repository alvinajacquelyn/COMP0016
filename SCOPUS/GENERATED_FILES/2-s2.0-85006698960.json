The oil and gas occurrences have been reported from the Proterozoic successions globally and the hydrocarbon potential of the SLFm cannot be ruled out. The interbedded shales and algal laminated dolostones within the SLFm have yielded microflora comparable to those reported in the North African Neoproterozoic sandstones and the Late Proterozoic carbonates of the giant oil and gas fields of the Siberian Platform. The SLFm contains a rich and diverse biota comprising ~ 10% of the rock volume in thin section. The rich organic assemblage justified a hydrocarbon source potential analysis of the SLFm, tested in this study by Rock Eval (RE) pyrolysis. RE pyrolysis yielded a total organic carbon (TOC) content of 0.02 to 1 wt. % with very low Hydrogen Index (HI) values for the shales and TOC content averaging 0.02 wt. % for the dolostones. The organically lean shales and dolostones exhibit Tmax values indicative of immature to post mature stage. But, since these values are for the samples with complex thermal and tectonic history the results may be unreliable. The highly altered organic matter and kerogen present in the SLFm had the potential to generate hydrocarbons and presently indicates no significant source potential. This study is important for understanding the hydrocarbon occurrences in the SLFm particularly in light of the recent oil and gas discoveries from the coeval Proterozoic successions.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Hydrocarbon Source", "Jammu", "NW Himalaya", "Proterozoic", "Rock Eval Pyrolysis", "Sirban Limestone Formation"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85006698960", "SubjectAreas": [["Geology", "EART", "1907"]], "AuthorData": {"55510148000": {"Name": "Hakhoo N.", "AuthorID": "55510148000", "AffiliationID": "60031541", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Energy Research and Training (IERT), and Post-graduate Department of Geology, University of Jammu"}, "7103251078": {"Name": "Bhat G.", "AuthorID": "7103251078", "AffiliationID": "60031541", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Energy Research and Training (IERT), and Post-graduate Department of Geology, University of Jammu"}, "55573852700": {"Name": "Hafiz M.", "AuthorID": "55573852700", "AffiliationID": "60031541", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Energy Research and Training (IERT), and Post-graduate Department of Geology, University of Jammu"}, "47361225200": {"Name": "Koul S.", "AuthorID": "47361225200", "AffiliationID": "60031541", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Energy Research and Training (IERT), and Post-graduate Department of Geology, University of Jammu"}, "57192546124": {"Name": "Ahmed W.", "AuthorID": "57192546124", "AffiliationID": "60031541", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Energy Research and Training (IERT), and Post-graduate Department of Geology, University of Jammu"}, "15844561400": {"Name": "Thusu B.", "AuthorID": "15844561400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, University College London"}, "6604012416": {"Name": "Thurow J.", "AuthorID": "6604012416", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, University College London"}, "23028116600": {"Name": "Mani D.", "AuthorID": "23028116600", "AffiliationID": "60005720", "AffiliationName": "CSIR-National Geophysical Research Institute"}, "8787315200": {"Name": "Craig J.", "AuthorID": "8787315200", "AffiliationID": "60015202", "AffiliationName": "Eni Upstream and Technical Services"}, "7004829943": {"Name": "Kanungo S.", "AuthorID": "7004829943", "AffiliationID": "60025488", "AffiliationName": "Energy and Geoscience Institute (EGI), University of Utah"}}}
