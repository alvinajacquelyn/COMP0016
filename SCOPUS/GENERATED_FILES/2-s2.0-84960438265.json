Studies have demonstrated the involvement of mutations or common variants of the gene encoding Eph receptor A2 (EPHA2), in congenital cataract and in age-related cataract. This study investigated a number of disease-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in EPHA2 in patients with age-related cataract.Materials and methods: The study included 491 Estonian patients who had surgery for age-related cataract, classified as nuclear, cortical, posterior subcapsular and mixed lens opacities, and 185 controls of the same ethnical origin. Seven SNPs in EPHA2 (rs7543472, rs11260867, rs7548209, rs3768293, rs6603867, rs6678616, rs477558) were genotyped using TaqMan Allelic Discrimination. Statistical analyses for single factor associations used \u03c72-test and logistic regression was performed including relevant covariates (age, sex and smoking).Results: In single-SNP allele analysis, only the rs7543472 showed a borderline significant association with risk of cataract (p = 0.048). Regression analysis with known risk factors for cataract showed no significant associations of the studied SNPs with cataract. Stratification by cataract subtype did not alter the results. Adjusted odds ratios were between 0.82 and 1.16 (95% confidence interval 0.61-1.60).Conclusions: The present study does not support a major role of EphA2 in cataractogenesis in an Estonian population.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cataract", "EPHA2", "single nucleotide polymorphisms"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Aging", "Cataract", "Estonia", "Female", "Gene Frequency", "Genotyping Techniques", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Polymerase Chain Reaction", "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide", "Receptor, EphA2", "Risk Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84960438265", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"], ["Genetics (clinical)", "MEDI", "2716"]], "AuthorData": {"35317036700": {"Name": "Celojevic D.", "AuthorID": "35317036700", "AffiliationID": "60016437", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Neuroscience and Rehabilitation/Ophthalmology, Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, University of Gothenburg"}, "6506898631": {"Name": "Zetterberg M.", "AuthorID": "6506898631", "AffiliationID": "60016437", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Neuroscience and Rehabilitation/Ophthalmology, Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, University of Gothenburg"}, "6603188649": {"Name": "Abramsson A.", "AuthorID": "6603188649", "AffiliationID": "60027675, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry and Neurochemistry, Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, Sahlgrenska Academy at University of Gothenburg"}, "16680206400": {"Name": "Seibt Palm\u00e9r M.", "AuthorID": "16680206400", "AffiliationID": "60027675, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry and Neurochemistry, Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, Sahlgrenska Academy at University of Gothenburg"}, "6701454676": {"Name": "Zetterberg H.", "AuthorID": "6701454676", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "6602854908": {"Name": "Tasa G.", "AuthorID": "6602854908", "AffiliationID": "60068856", "AffiliationName": "Department of Human Biology and Genetics, Institute of General and Molecular Pathology, University of Tartu"}, "7004020446": {"Name": "Juronen E.", "AuthorID": "7004020446", "AffiliationID": "60068856", "AffiliationName": "Department of Human Biology and Genetics, Institute of General and Molecular Pathology, University of Tartu"}}}
