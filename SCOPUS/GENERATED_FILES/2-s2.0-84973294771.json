In addition to these systemic aspects, CAPS has multiple neurological manifestations. The largest case series to date is presented focusing on the neurological features of this disorder. Methods: The case histories of a cohort of 38 UK patients with genetically proven CAPS who were treated with interleukin 1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) inhibition as part of a national treatment programme and underwent detailed neurological assessment were reviewed. Results: Across the entire disease course neurological manifestations were present in 95% of patients; 84% had some form of headache; 66% sensorineural hearing loss; 60% myalgia; 34% papilloedema and 26% optic atrophy. Patients with the T348M mutation tended to have a more severe neurological phenotype with an earlier age of onset. Four patients had cerebrospinal fluid examination, three of whom had evidence of aseptic meningitis. There was a marked response to IL-1\u03b2 inhibition, which has revolutionized management of these patients (29/32 patients with headache responding). Conclusion: Neurological symptoms are extremely common in CAPS and these results highlight the importance of increasing awareness amongst neurologists, particularly as highly effective therapies are available.", "AuthorKeywords": ["aseptic meningitis", "canakinumab", "CAPS", "headache", "hearing impairment", "migraine", "NLRP3"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84973294771", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"55359123400": {"Name": "Parker T.", "AuthorID": "55359123400", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Royal Free Hospital"}, "7006192808": {"Name": "Ginsberg L.", "AuthorID": "7006192808", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Royal Free Hospital"}, "57217678638": {"Name": "Keddie S.", "AuthorID": "57217678638", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Royal Free Hospital"}, "7005492072": {"Name": "Kidd D.", "AuthorID": "7005492072", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Royal Free Hospital"}, "41861760800": {"Name": "Lane T.", "AuthorID": "41861760800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "National Amyloidosis Centre, UCL"}, "35464959200": {"Name": "Hawkins P.N.", "AuthorID": "35464959200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "National Amyloidosis Centre, UCL"}, "7004915734": {"Name": "Lachmann H.J.", "AuthorID": "7004915734", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "National Amyloidosis Centre, UCL"}, "54385605100": {"Name": "Maviki M.", "AuthorID": "54385605100", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Royal Free Hospital"}}}
