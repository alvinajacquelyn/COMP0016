Direct electroporation technique was performed on both cancerous (A549) and normal lung (L132) cells targeting the AKT-1 gene expression. Interestingly the investigation showed significant down-regulation of AKT-1 siRNA gene expression by combined effect of AKT-siRNA and AgNP treatment in A549 cells when compared to their alone effect. Based on above findings and previous reports the plausible molecular mechanistic pathway was proposed. This study put further impetus in the development of nanotherapeutics combining AgNP and AKT-1 siRNA for efficient lung carcinoma treatment.", "AuthorKeywords": ["AKT1-siRNA", "Combination therapy", "Lung adenocarcinoma", "Silver nanoparticle"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85044478596", "SubjectAreas": [["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"]], "AuthorData": {"56830630100": {"Name": "Dubey P.", "AuthorID": "56830630100", "AffiliationID": "60031818", "AffiliationName": "Nanobiotechnology Laboratory, Centre for Nanotechnology, Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee"}, "56242963200": {"Name": "Gopinath P.", "AuthorID": "56242963200", "AffiliationID": "60031818", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biotechnology, Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee"}}}
