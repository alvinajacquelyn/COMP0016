Published by Taylor & Francis.The field of arts in health is currently undergoing a burgeoning in activity. However, there remains a problem surrounding research into this field. Arts in health research can be confusing and is frequently misunderstood by those working in the arts and in health, artists, reviewers, researchers and funders. Aesop 1 is a framework specially devised to tackle these problems. It synthesises existing arts research methodologies, health research methodologies, health policy documents and reporting guidelines in order to guide projects right from the initial idea for an arts intervention, through the development and design of a research project, its delivery and its dissemination. This article outlines the rationale behind the framework and explains how it should be used, with the aim of facilitating the running of arts and health research projects and increasing their rigour and acceptance within both the arts and health communities.", "AuthorKeywords": ["action research", "art forms", "experimental design", "health issues", "methods"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84940290148", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (miscellaneous)", "MEDI", "2701"], ["Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)", "ARTS", "1201"]], "AuthorData": {"55911947100": {"Name": "Fancourt D.", "AuthorID": "55911947100", "AffiliationID": "60032993", "AffiliationName": "Chelsea and Westminster Health Charity, Chelsea and Westminster Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "56746303900": {"Name": "Joss T.", "AuthorID": "56746303900", "AffiliationID": "115614947", "AffiliationName": "The Rayne Foundation"}}}
