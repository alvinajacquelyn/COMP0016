Although recent convolutional neural network (CNN)-based methods for finger vein verification have shown powerful capacity for feature representation and promising perspective in this area, they still have two critical issues to address. First, these CNN-based methods unexceptionally utilize fully connected layers, which restrict the size of finger vein images to process and increase the processing time. Second, the capacity of CNN for feature representation generally suffers from the low quality of finger vein ground-truth pattern maps for training, particularly due to outliers and vessel breaks. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a novel approach termed FV-GAN to finger vein extraction and verification, based on generative adversarial network (GAN), as the first attempt in this area. Unlike the CNN-based methods, FV-GAN learns from the joint distribution of finger vein images and pattern maps rather than the direct mapping between them, with the aim at achieving stronger robustness against outliers and vessel breaks. Moreover, FV-GAN adopts fully convolutional networks as the basic architecture and discards fully connected layers, which relaxes the constraint on the input image size and reduces the computational expenditure for feature extraction. Furthermore, we design an adversarial training strategy and propose a hybrid loss function for FV-GAN. The experimental results on two public databases show significant improvement by FV-GAN in finger vein verification in terms of both verification accuracy and equal error rate.", "AuthorKeywords": ["convolutional neural network (CNN)", "cycle-consistent adversarial network (CycleGAN)", "deep convolutional generative adversarial network (DCGAN)", "Finger vein verification", "generative adversarial network (GAN)", "pattern extraction", "U-Net"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adversarial networks", "Convolutional networks", "Convolutional neural network", "Feature representation", "Finger vein", "Joint distributions", "Pattern extraction", "Training strategy"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85067117548", "SubjectAreas": [["Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality", "ENGI", "2213"], ["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"]], "AuthorData": {"55364108400": {"Name": "Yang W.", "AuthorID": "55364108400", "AffiliationID": "60025278", "AffiliationName": "Shenzhen Key Laboratory of Information Science and Technology, Shenzhen Engineering Laboratory of ISandDCP, Graduate School at Shenzhen, Department of E.E., Tsinghua University"}, "57203137951": {"Name": "Hui C.", "AuthorID": "57203137951", "AffiliationID": "60025278", "AffiliationName": "Shenzhen Key Laboratory of Information Science and Technology, Shenzhen Engineering Laboratory of ISandDCP, Graduate School at Shenzhen, Department of E.E., Tsinghua University"}, "57203722365": {"Name": "Chen Z.", "AuthorID": "57203722365", "AffiliationID": "60025278", "AffiliationName": "Shenzhen Key Laboratory of Information Science and Technology, Shenzhen Engineering Laboratory of ISandDCP, Graduate School at Shenzhen, Department of E.E., Tsinghua University"}, "7102880275": {"Name": "Liao Q.", "AuthorID": "7102880275", "AffiliationID": "60025278", "AffiliationName": "Shenzhen Key Laboratory of Information Science and Technology, Shenzhen Engineering Laboratory of ISandDCP, Graduate School at Shenzhen, Department of E.E., Tsinghua University"}, "7202881908": {"Name": "Xue J.", "AuthorID": "7202881908", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Statistical Science, University College London"}}}
