All rights reserved.Abstract Objectives Findings from nonrandomized studies on safety or efficacy of treatment in patient subgroups may trigger postlaunch randomized clinical trials (RCTs). In the analysis of such RCTs, results from nonrandomized studies are typically ignored. This study explores the trade-off between bias and power of Bayesian RCT analysis incorporating information from nonrandomized studies. Study Design and Setting A simulation study was conducted to compare frequentist with Bayesian analyses using noninformative and informative priors in their ability to detect interaction effects. In simulated subgroups, the effect of a hypothetical treatment differed between subgroups (odds ratio 1.00 vs. 2.33). Simulations varied in sample size, proportions of the subgroups, and specification of the priors. Results As expected, the results for the informative Bayesian analyses were more biased than those from the noninformative Bayesian analysis or frequentist analysis. However, because of a reduction in posterior variance, informative Bayesian analyses were generally more powerful to detect an effect. In scenarios where the informative priors were in the opposite direction of the RCT data, type 1 error rates could be 100% and power 0%. Conclusion Bayesian methods incorporating data from nonrandomized studies can meaningfully increase power of interaction tests in postlaunch RCTs.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bayesian statistics", "Frequentist statistics", "Nonrandomized study design", "Observational study design", "Randomized controlled trial", "Simulation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Bayes Theorem", "Bias (Epidemiology)", "Computer Simulation", "Female", "Hip Fractures", "Humans", "Male", "Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic", "Research Design", "Sample Size", "Thiazolidinediones"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84925302257", "SubjectAreas": [["Epidemiology", "MEDI", "2713"]], "AuthorData": {"55622055900": {"Name": "Schmidt A.", "AuthorID": "55622055900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular Science, Faculty of Population Health, University College London"}, "7006204390": {"Name": "Klungel O.", "AuthorID": "7006204390", "AffiliationID": "60070172", "AffiliationName": "Division of Pharmacoepidemiology and Clinical Pharmacology, Utrecht Institute for Pharmaceutical Sciences"}, "35370614300": {"Name": "Hoes A.", "AuthorID": "35370614300", "AffiliationID": "60032724", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology, Julius Center for Health Sciences and Primary Care, University Medical Center Utrecht"}, "56600212200": {"Name": "Groenwold R.", "AuthorID": "56600212200", "AffiliationID": "60070172", "AffiliationName": "Division of Pharmacoepidemiology and Clinical Pharmacology, Utrecht Institute for Pharmaceutical Sciences"}, "56489803600": {"Name": "De Boer A.", "AuthorID": "56489803600", "AffiliationID": "60070172", "AffiliationName": "Division of Pharmacoepidemiology and Clinical Pharmacology, Utrecht Institute for Pharmaceutical Sciences"}, "7005960263": {"Name": "Nielen M.", "AuthorID": "7005960263", "AffiliationID": "60117225, 60117220, 60007989", "AffiliationName": "Department of Farm Animal Health, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Utrecht University"}, "8324308900": {"Name": "Klugkist I.", "AuthorID": "8324308900", "AffiliationID": "60007989", "AffiliationName": "Department of Methodology and Statistics, Faculty of Social and Behavioural Sciences, Utrecht University"}}}
