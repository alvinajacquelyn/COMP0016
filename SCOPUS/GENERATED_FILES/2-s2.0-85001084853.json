It has usually been performed in a Bayesian setting, but recently it has become possible in a frequentist setting using multivariate meta-analysis and meta-regression, implemented in Stata with mvmeta. I describe a suite of Stata programs for network meta-analysis that perform the necessary data manipulation, fit consistency and inconsistency models using mvmeta, and produce various graphics.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Mixed-treatment comparisons", "Multiple treatments meta-analysis", "Network components", "Network convert", "Network forest", "Network import", "Network map", "Network meta", "Network meta-analysis", "Network pattern", "Network query", "Network rank", "Network setup", "Network sidesplit", "Network table", "Network unset", "St0410"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85001084853", "SubjectAreas": [["Mathematics (miscellaneous)", "MATH", "2601"]], "AuthorData": {"35235524000": {"Name": "White I.R.", "AuthorID": "35235524000", "AffiliationID": "60009587, 60006654", "AffiliationName": "MRC Biostatistics Unit, Cambridge Institute of Public Health"}}}
