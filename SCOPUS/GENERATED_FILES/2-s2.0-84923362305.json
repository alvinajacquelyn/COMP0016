The pattern of pig mortality profiles (targeting two-year-old animals), standardized butchery cut-marks and the under-occurrence of ham-bearing bones suggest that there was standardized pork production potentially designed for trade. This hypothesis was investigated through enamel \u03b418O analysis, allowing the seasonality of pig births to be determined and the reasons for a particular age class in the kill-off patterns to be explained. Results reveal that pig births were spread across more than half a year, suggesting that slaughter was not seasonally constrained, but was performed to target a specific age class and weight/size at death, thus supporting the hypothesis of standardized pork production in Levroux Les Ar\u00e8nes. For the first time, the stable isotope approach - sequential \u03b418O analysis in pig incisors developed on a modern reference set - has been performed on an archaeological assemblage, after methodological adaptation. The results constitute the first zooarchaeological evidence of such a standardization of meat production from the second century onwards in Gaul.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Birth seasonality", "Iron Age", "Levroux Les Ar\u00e8nes", "Pig", "Sequential sampling", "Stable oxygen isotope", "Tooth enamel"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84923362305", "SubjectAreas": [["Archeology (arts and humanities)", "ARTS", "1204"], ["Archeology", "SOCI", "3302"]], "AuthorData": {"35787837200": {"Name": "Fr\u00e9mondeau D.", "AuthorID": "35787837200", "AffiliationID": "60025063", "AffiliationName": "Center for Archaeological Sciences, KU Leuven"}, "57189656690": {"Name": "Ughetto-Monfrin J.", "AuthorID": "57189656690", "AffiliationID": "60028311, 60008134", "AffiliationName": "UMR 7209 CNRS/MNHN, D\u00e9partement Ecologie et Gestion de la Biodiversit\u00e9, Arch\u00e9ozoologie, Arch\u00e9obotanique: Soci\u00e9t\u00e9s, Pratiques et Environnements, B\u00e2timent d'Anatomie Compar\u00e9e CP 56"}, "6602276342": {"Name": "Balasse M.", "AuthorID": "6602276342", "AffiliationID": "60028311, 60008134", "AffiliationName": "UMR 7209 CNRS/MNHN, D\u00e9partement Ecologie et Gestion de la Biodiversit\u00e9, Arch\u00e9ozoologie, Arch\u00e9obotanique: Soci\u00e9t\u00e9s, Pratiques et Environnements, B\u00e2timent d'Anatomie Compar\u00e9e CP 56"}, "6504583713": {"Name": "Horard-Herbin M.P.", "AuthorID": "6504583713", "AffiliationID": "60032530, 60159342", "AffiliationName": "Universit\u00e9 de Tours, Laboratoire Arch\u00e9ologie et Territoire, UMR 7324 (CITERES)MSH"}, "15135252800": {"Name": "Buchsenschutz O.", "AuthorID": "15135252800", "AffiliationID": "60000179, 60105788", "AffiliationName": "UMR 8546 - AOROC, \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure 45 rue d'Ulm"}}}
