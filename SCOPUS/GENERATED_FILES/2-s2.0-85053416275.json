In order to improve our understanding of the kinetics of the cometary coma, theoretical studies of the major reactive collisions in these environments are needed. Deep in the collisional coma, inelastic collisions between thermal electrons and molecular ions result in recombination and vibrational excitation, the rates of these processes being particularly elevated due to the high charged particle densities in the inner region. Aims. This work addresses the dissociative recombination, vibrational excitation, and vibrational de-excitation of electrons with CO+ molecular cations. The aim of this study is to understand the importance of these reactive collisions in producing carbon and oxygen atoms in cometary activity. Methods. The cross-section calculations were based on multichannel quantum defect theory. The molecular data sets, used here to take into account the nuclear dynamics, were based on ab initio R-matrix approach. Results. The cross-sections for the dissociative recombination, vibrational excitation, and vibrational de-excitation processes, for the six lowest vibrational levels of CO+ \u2013 relevant for the electronic temperatures observed in comets \u2013 are computed, as well as their corresponding Maxwell rate coefficients. Moreover, final state distributions for different dissociation pathways are presented. Conclusions. Among all reactive collisions taking place between low-energy electrons and CO+, the dissociative recombination is the most important process at electronic temperatures characterizing the comets. We have shown that this process can be a major source of O(3P), O(1D), O(1S), C(3P) and C(1D) produced in the cometary coma at small cometocentric distances.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Comets: general", "Molecular data", "Molecular processes"], "IndexKeywords": ["Comets: general", "Dissociation pathways", "Dissociative recombinations", "Electronic temperature", "Molecular data", "Molecular process", "Multi-channel quantum defect theory", "Vibrational excitation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85053416275", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"57195549148": {"Name": "Moulane Y.", "AuthorID": "57195549148", "AffiliationID": "60012570, 60122732", "AffiliationName": "Laboratoire Ondes et Milieux Complexes, CNRS-UMR-6294, Universit du Havre"}, "6602845544": {"Name": "Benkhaldoun Z.", "AuthorID": "6602845544", "AffiliationID": "60002714", "AffiliationName": "Oukaimeden Observatory, High Energy Physics and Astrophysics Laboratory, Cadi Ayyad University"}, "6603183231": {"Name": "Jehin E.", "AuthorID": "6603183231", "AffiliationID": "118412224", "AffiliationName": "Technologies and Astrophysics Research (STAR) Institute, University of Li ge"}, "6701631541": {"Name": "Mezei J.Z.", "AuthorID": "6701631541", "AffiliationID": "60004981, 60023504, 60106017", "AffiliationName": "Laboratoire Aim Cotton, CNRS-UMR-9188, Universit Paris Sud, ENS Cachen et Universit Paris Saclay"}, "6504449278": {"Name": "Laporta V.", "AuthorID": "6504449278", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "7202213186": {"Name": "Schneider I.F.", "AuthorID": "7202213186", "AffiliationID": "60004981, 60023504, 60106017", "AffiliationName": "Laboratoire Aim Cotton, CNRS-UMR-9188, Universit Paris Sud, ENS Cachen et Universit Paris Saclay"}}}
