The current paper extends this argument by considering the dynamic contexts, or 'evidence ecosystems', within which reviews are undertaken; the fact that these ecosystems are constantly changing; and the relevance of this broader context for understanding 'dimensions of difference' in the unfolding development and refinement of review methods. The concept of an evidence ecosystem is used to consider particular issues within the three key dimensions of difference outlined in the 2012 paper of (1) review aims and approach, (2) structure and components of reviews, and (3) breadth, depth, and 'work done' by reviews.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Ecosystem", "Humans", "Research Design", "Systematic Reviews as Topic"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85069042441", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (miscellaneous)", "MEDI", "2701"]], "AuthorData": {"7101774088": {"Name": "Gough D.", "AuthorID": "7101774088", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "EPPI-Centre, Social Science Research Unit, Department of Social Science, University College London"}, "55574208395": {"Name": "Thomas J.", "AuthorID": "55574208395", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "EPPI-Centre, Social Science Research Unit, Department of Social Science, University College London"}, "57220732075": {"Name": "Oliver S.", "AuthorID": "57220732075", "AffiliationID": "60000717", "AffiliationName": "Africa Centre for Evidence, Faculty of the Humanities, University of Johannesburg"}}}
