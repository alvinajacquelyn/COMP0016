A test database for full-scale models of welded steel plate structures is developed. Elastic-plastic finite element method solutions, associated with thermal stresses in welded steel plate panels, are also developed. The proposed formula is derived by a curve fitting of the databases obtained from both full-scale measurements and numerical computations as a function of plate thickness and weld leg length. The paper demonstrates an applied example of the derived formulations to prevent the thermal buckling of thin steel plate panels that occurs during the welding process.", "AuthorKeywords": ["elastic-plastic thermal stress finite element method analysis", "full-scale residual stress measurements", "steel stiffened plate structures", "thermal plate buckling", "Welding-induced residual stresses"], "IndexKeywords": ["Compressive residual stress", "Elastic-plastic finite element method", "Finite element method analysis", "Full scale measurements", "Numerical computations", "Stiffened plate", "Thermal plates", "Welding-induced residual stress"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85057602677", "SubjectAreas": [["Ocean Engineering", "ENGI", "2212"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"]], "AuthorData": {"55329277500": {"Name": "Yi M.", "AuthorID": "55329277500", "AffiliationID": "60094133", "AffiliationName": "Ship & Offshore Research Institute, Samsung Heavy Industries Co., Ltd."}, "35821146600": {"Name": "Paik J.", "AuthorID": "35821146600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "24722619500": {"Name": "Hyun C.", "AuthorID": "24722619500", "AffiliationID": "60094133", "AffiliationName": "Ship & Offshore Research Institute, Samsung Heavy Industries Co., Ltd."}}}
