The objective of this study was to estimate changes in type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality attributable to a transition from traditional food aid to either (i) a debit card restricted to food purchases, (ii) cash, or (iii) an alternative food parcel with less grain and more fruits and vegetables, each valued at $30/person/month. Methods and findings: An individual-level microsimulation was created to estimate relationships between food aid delivery method, food consumption, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality using demographic data from the United Nations (UN; 2017) on 5,340,443 registered Palestinian refugees in Syria, Jordan, Lebanon, Gaza, and the West Bank, food consumption data (2011\u20132017) from households receiving traditional food parcel delivery of food aid (n = 1,507 households) and electronic debit card delivery of food aid (n = 1,047 households), and health data from a random 10% sample of refugees receiving medical care through the UN (2012\u20132015; n = 516,386). Outcome metrics included incidence per 1,000 person-years of hypertension, type 2 diabetes, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease events, microvascular events (end-stage renal disease, diabetic neuropathy, and proliferative diabetic retinopathy), and all-cause mortality. The model estimated changes in total calories, sodium and potassium intake, fatty acid intake, and overall dietary quality (Mediterranean Dietary Score [MDS]) as mediators to each outcome metric. We did not observe that a change from food parcel to electronic debit card delivery of food aid or to cash aid led to a meaningful change in consumption, biomarkers, or disease outcomes. By contrast, a shift to an alternative food parcel with less grain and more fruits and vegetables was estimated to produce a 0.08 per 1,000 person-years decrease in the incidence of hypertension (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.05\u20130.11), 0.18 per 1,000 person-years decrease in the incidence of type 2 diabetes (95% CI 0.14\u20130.22), 0.18 per 1,000 person-years decrease in the incidence of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease events (95% CI 0.17\u20130.19), and 0.02 decrease per 1,000 person-years all-cause mortality (95% CI 0.01 decrease to 0.04 increase) among those receiving aid. The benefits of this shift, however, could be neutralized by a small (2%) increase in compensatory (out-of-pocket) increases in consumption of refined grains, fats and oils, or confectionaries. A larger alternative parcel requiring an increase in total food aid expenditure by 27% would be more likely to have a clinically meaningful improvement on type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease incidence. Conclusions: Contrary to the supposition in the literature, our findings do not robustly support the theory that transitioning from traditional food aid to either debit card or cash delivery alone would necessarily reduce chronic disease outcomes. Rather, an alternative food parcel would be more effective, even after matching current budget ceilings. But compensatory increases in consumption of less healthy foods may neutralize the improvements from an alternative food parcel unless total aid funding were increased substantially. Our analysis is limited by uncertainty in estimates of modeling long-term outcomes from shorter-term trials, focusing on diabetes and cardiovascular outcomes for which validated equations are available instead of all nutrition-associated health outcomes, and using data from food frequency questionnaires in the absence of 24-hour dietary recall data.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Arabs", "Cardiovascular Diseases", "Chronic Disease", "Computer Simulation", "Cost-Benefit Analysis", "Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2", "Edible Grain", "Female", "Financial Support", "Food Assistance", "Fruit", "Healthy Diet", "Humans", "Incidence", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Middle East", "Nutritional Status", "Nutritive Value", "Recommended Dietary Allowances", "Refugee Camps", "Refugees", "Socioeconomic Factors", "Time Factors", "Vegetables", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85056802671", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"9335409500": {"Name": "Basu S.", "AuthorID": "9335409500", "AffiliationID": "60002746", "AffiliationName": "Harvard Medical School"}, "24728579800": {"Name": "Yudkin J.S.", "AuthorID": "24728579800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "57202771882": {"Name": "Berkowitz S.A.", "AuthorID": "57202771882", "AffiliationID": "60025111", "AffiliationName": "University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"}, "54980322500": {"Name": "Jawad M.", "AuthorID": "54980322500", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Public Health Policy Evaluation Unit, School of Public Health, Imperial College London"}, "8610765600": {"Name": "Millett C.", "AuthorID": "8610765600", "AffiliationID": "60008088", "AffiliationName": "Center for Epidemiological Studies in Health and Nutrition, University of S\u00e3o Paulo"}}}
