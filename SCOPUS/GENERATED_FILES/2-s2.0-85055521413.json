This evidence, combined with new dates and palaeoclimatic data, suggests that this transition took place in the Iron Age, at a time of increasingly arid climate, and when a number of broader societal changes become apparent in the archaeological record. For the first time, it is possible to relate changes in subsistence economy to shifts in regional climate and water-management strategies, and to the emergence of state societies in Southeast Asia.", "AuthorKeywords": ["agricultural intensification", "archaeobotany", "Iron Age", "rice farming", "Southeast Asia", "Thailand", "weed flora"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85055521413", "SubjectAreas": [["Archeology", "SOCI", "3302"], ["Arts and Humanities (all)", "ARTS", "1200"]], "AuthorData": {"36117767700": {"Name": "Castillo C.C.", "AuthorID": "36117767700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Institute of Archaeology"}, "57204468229": {"Name": "Miller K.", "AuthorID": "57204468229", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Institute of Archaeology"}, "56844729800": {"Name": "Fuller D.Q.", "AuthorID": "56844729800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Institute of Archaeology"}, "7003507065": {"Name": "Higham C.F.W.", "AuthorID": "7003507065", "AffiliationID": "60017311", "AffiliationName": "University of Otago, Department of Anthropology and Archaeology"}, "54079339400": {"Name": "Chang N.", "AuthorID": "54079339400", "AffiliationID": "60019870", "AffiliationName": "James Cook University, College of Arts, Society and Education"}, "25960036700": {"Name": "Douka K.", "AuthorID": "25960036700", "AffiliationID": "60108650", "AffiliationName": "Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History, Department of Archaeology"}, "7003799879": {"Name": "Higham T.F.G.", "AuthorID": "7003799879", "AffiliationID": "60175816, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Oxford Radiocarbon Accelerator Unit, Research Laboratory for Archaeology and the History of Art, Dyson Perrins Building, University of Oxford"}}}
