The American Astronomical Society. All rights reserved.We report on the Solar Dynamics Observatory/Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) and Hinode/EUV Imaging Spectrograph (EIS) observations of a transient coronal loop. The loop brightens up in the same location after the disappearance of an arcade formed during a B8.9-class microflare 3 hr earlier. EIS captures this loop during its brightening phase, as observed in most of the AIA filters. We use the AIA data to study the evolution of the loop, as well as to perform the differential emission measure (DEM) diagnostics as a function of \u03ba. The Fe xi-Fe xiii lines observed by EIS are used to perform the diagnostics of electron density and subsequently the diagnostics of \u03ba. Using ratios involving the Fe xi 257.772 self-blend, we diagnose \u03ba \u2272 2, i.e., an extremely non-Maxwellian distribution. Using the predicted Fe line intensities derived from the DEMs as a function of \u03ba, we show that, with decreasing \u03ba, all combinations of ratios of line intensities converge to the observed values, confirming the diagnosed \u03ba \u2272 2. These results represent the first positive diagnostics of \u03ba-distributions in the solar corona despite the limitations imposed by calibration uncertainties.", "AuthorKeywords": ["radiation mechanisms: non-thermal", "Sun: corona", "Sun: UV radiation", "Sun: X-rays, gamma rays", "techniques: spectroscopic"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84936990566", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"12768925300": {"Name": "Dud\u00edk J.", "AuthorID": "12768925300", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "DAMTP, CMS, University of Cambridge"}, "55053265000": {"Name": "Mackovjak \u0160.", "AuthorID": "55053265000", "AffiliationID": "60001987", "AffiliationName": "DAPEM, Faculty of Mathematics Physics and Computer Science, Comenius University"}, "56720383200": {"Name": "Dzif\u010d\u00e1 Kov\u00e1 E.", "AuthorID": "56720383200", "AffiliationID": "60031135, 60001847", "AffiliationName": "Astronomical Institute of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic"}, "56375950800": {"Name": "Karlick\u00fd M.", "AuthorID": "56375950800", "AffiliationID": "60031135, 60001847", "AffiliationName": "Astronomical Institute of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic"}, "55977021800": {"Name": "Kotr\u010d P.", "AuthorID": "55977021800", "AffiliationID": "60031135, 60001847", "AffiliationName": "Astronomical Institute of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic"}, "6701744883": {"Name": "F\u00e1rn\u00edk F.", "AuthorID": "6701744883", "AffiliationID": "60031135, 60001847", "AffiliationName": "Astronomical Institute of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic"}, "56568094500": {"Name": "Zemanov\u00e1 A.", "AuthorID": "56568094500", "AffiliationID": "60031135, 60001847", "AffiliationName": "Astronomical Institute of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic"}, "6603668975": {"Name": "Del Zanna G.", "AuthorID": "6603668975", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "DAMTP, CMS, University of Cambridge"}, "55496407600": {"Name": "Mason H.E.", "AuthorID": "55496407600", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "DAMTP, CMS, University of Cambridge"}, "6701629397": {"Name": "L\u00f6rin\u010d\u00edk J.", "AuthorID": "6701629397", "AffiliationID": "60001987", "AffiliationName": "DAPEM, Faculty of Mathematics Physics and Computer Science, Comenius University"}, "57213469053": {"Name": "Williams D.R.", "AuthorID": "57213469053", "AffiliationID": "60084281, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Mullard Space Science Laboratory"}}}
