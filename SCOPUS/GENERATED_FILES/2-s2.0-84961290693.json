However, there is not a feasible evaluation method to be applied in clinical or Good Manufacturing Practice settings. In this study, we describe and assess an innovative easy-Applied photographic-based method (PBM) for measuring functional optical blurring and transparency in corneal surface grafts. Methods Plastic compressed collagen scaffolds (PCCS) and multilayered amniotic membranes (AM) samples were optically and histologically evaluated. Transparency and image blurring measures were obtained by PBM, analyzing photographic images of a standardized band pattern taken through the samples. These measures were compared and correlated to those obtained applying the Inverse Adding-Doubling (IAD) technique, which is the gold standard method. Results All the samples used for optical evaluation by PBM or IAD were histological suitable. PCCS samples presented transmittance values higher than 60%, values that increased with increasing wavelength as determined by IAD. The PBM indicated that PCCS had a transparency ratio (TR) value of 80.3\u00b12.8%, with a blurring index (BI) of 50.6\u00b14.2%. TR and BI obtained from the PBM showed a high correlation (p>0.6) with the diffuse transmittance and the diffuse reflectance, both determined using the IAD (p<0.005). The AM optical properties showed that there was a largely linear relationship between the blurring and the number of amnion layers, with more layers producing greater blurring. Conclusions This innovative proposed method represents an easy-Applied technique for evaluating transparency and blurriness of tissues and biomaterials used for corneal surface repair.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Amnion", "Animals", "Biocompatible Materials", "Collagen", "Cornea", "Corneal Transplantation", "Equipment Design", "Humans", "Light", "Photography", "Photometry", "Regeneration", "Tissue Scaffolds"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84961290693", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"16244602900": {"Name": "Gonzalez-Andrades M.", "AuthorID": "16244602900", "AffiliationID": "60030459", "AffiliationName": "Ophthalmology Department, San Cecilio University Hospital"}, "55574210899": {"Name": "Brown R.", "AuthorID": "55574210899", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Tissue Repair and Engineering Centre, University College of London"}, "26534292700": {"Name": "De La Cruz Cardona J.", "AuthorID": "26534292700", "AffiliationID": "60027844", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Biomaterials and Optics-Optics Department, University of Granada"}, "36554145500": {"Name": "Ionescu A.", "AuthorID": "36554145500", "AffiliationID": "60027844", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Biomaterials and Optics-Optics Department, University of Granada"}, "7003418009": {"Name": "Mosse C.", "AuthorID": "7003418009", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Optics Department, University College of London"}}}
