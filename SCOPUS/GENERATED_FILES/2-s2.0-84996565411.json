Whereas several studies have shown how interoceptive accuracy or cardiac feedback influences body-awareness, no studies have looked at the reverse effect, namely how exteroceptively-driven changes in body-ownership and self-identification can influence individuals\u2019 ability to detect internal bodily signals. We exposed participants to the Rubber Hand Illusion (Experiment 1) and to the Enfacement Illusion (Experiment 2), and tested how this change in the sense of body-ownership and self-identification affected their interoceptive accuracy (IAcc). The heartbeat-counting task was used to measure IAcc before the bodily illusions, and then the same task was interleaved with periods of visuo-tactile stimulation, during which synchronous and asynchronous multisensory stimulation was applied. We found that a change in body-ownership significantly improved performance of participants with lower interoceptive accuracy. In contrast, a change in self-identification significantly decreased performance of participants with higher interoceptive accuracy. These results suggest that changes in different domains of self-awareness can differentially impact individuals\u2019 ability to accurately detect signals arising from within the body, highlighting the distinct role that interoceptive signals play for different facets of bodily self-consciousness.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Body-ownership", "Enfacement Illusion", "Interoceptive accuracy", "Rubber Hand Illusion", "Self-awareness", "Self-identification"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Awareness", "Body Image", "Female", "Heart Rate", "Humans", "Illusions", "Interoception", "Male", "Photic Stimulation", "Physical Stimulation", "Touch Perception", "Visual Perception", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84996565411", "SubjectAreas": [["Experimental and Cognitive Psychology", "PSYC", "3205"], ["Language and Linguistics", "ARTS", "1203"], ["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"], ["Linguistics and Language", "SOCI", "3310"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"]], "AuthorData": {"55930991200": {"Name": "Filippetti M.L.", "AuthorID": "55930991200", "AffiliationID": "60020595", "AffiliationName": "Royal Holloway, University of London, Department of Psychology"}, "8612330500": {"Name": "Tsakiris M.", "AuthorID": "8612330500", "AffiliationID": "60020595", "AffiliationName": "Royal Holloway, University of London, Department of Psychology"}}}
