After discovering the lack of thermodynamic integration into stock modelling, this paper presents the development of an exergy-based building stock model. The aim of this paper is twofold. Firstly, to investigate the impact of large-scale future energy retrofit scenarios in the English and Welsh (E&W) non-domestic sector, and secondly, to determine the potential of exergy analysis in improving sectoral efficiency and its potential implications on exergy-oriented policy making. The research explores seven different large-scale future retrofit scenarios that encompass typical, low-carbon, and low-exergy approaches. Modelling results show that by 2050, current regulations have the potential to reduce carbon emissions by up to 49.0\u00b12.9% and increasing sector thermodynamic efficiency from 10.7% to 13.7%. On the other hand, a low-exergy oriented scenario based on renewable electricity and heat pumps is able to reduce carbon emissions by 88.2\u00b12.4%, achieving a sectoral exergy efficiency of 19.8%. This modelling framework can provide energy policy makers with new insights on policy options based on exergy indicators and the assessment of their potential impact.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Energy conservation", "Exergy", "Low-exergy buildings", "Non-domestic", "Retrofit scenarios", "Stock model"], "IndexKeywords": ["Energy policy makers", "Low exergies", "Non-domestic", "Renewable electricity", "Retrofit scenarios", "Stock models", "Thermodynamic efficiency", "Thermodynamic integration"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85015372331", "SubjectAreas": [["Energy (all)", "ENER", "2100"], ["Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law", "ENVI", "2308"]], "AuthorData": {"57215934565": {"Name": "Garc\u00eda Kerdan I.", "AuthorID": "57215934565", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Process Systems Engineering, Imperial College London"}, "6507276018": {"Name": "Ruyssevelt P.", "AuthorID": "6507276018", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Energy Institute, University College London"}, "35956865000": {"Name": "Raslan R.", "AuthorID": "35956865000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Environmental Design and Engineering, University College London"}, "56429668200": {"Name": "Morill\u00f3n G\u00e1lvez D.", "AuthorID": "56429668200", "AffiliationID": "60032442", "AffiliationName": "Departamento de Mec\u00e1nica y Energ\u00eda, Instituto de Ingenier\u00eda, Universidad Nacional Aut\u00f3noma de M\u00e9xico"}}}
