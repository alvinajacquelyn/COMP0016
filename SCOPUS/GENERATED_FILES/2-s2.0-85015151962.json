Published by John Wiley & Sons LtdBackground: The irritant sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) is known to cause a decrease in the stratum corneum level of natural moisturizing factor (NMF), which in itself is associated with changes in corneocyte surface topography. Objective: To explore this phenomenon in allergic contact dermatitis. Methods: Patch testing was performed on patients with previously positive patch test reactions to potassium dichromate (Cr), nickel sulfate (Ni), methylchloroisothiazolinone (MCI)/methylisothiazolinone (MI), or p-phenylenediamine. Moreover, a control (pet.) patch and an irritant (SLS) patch were applied. After 3 days, the stratum corneum from tested sites was collected, and NMF levels and corneocyte morphology, expressed as the amount of circular nanosize objects, quantified according to the Dermal Texture Index (DTI), were determined. Results: Among allergens, only MCI/MI reduced NMF levels significantly, as did SLS. Furthermore, only MCI/MI caused remarkable changes at the microscopic level; the corneocytes were hexagonal-shaped with pronounced cell borders and a smoother surface. The DTI was increased after SLS exposure but not after allergen exposure. Conclusions: MCI/MI significantly decreased NMF levels, similarly to SLS. The altered corneocyte morphology suggests that skin barrier damage plays a role in the pathogenesis of MCI/MI contact allergy. The DTI seems to differentiate reactions to SLS from those to the allergens tested, as SLS was the only agent that caused a DTI increase.", "AuthorKeywords": ["allergic contact dermatitis", "Dermal Texture Index", "irritant contact dermatitis", "natural moisturizing factor"], "IndexKeywords": ["Allergens", "Dermatitis, Allergic Contact", "Epidermis", "Humans", "Irritants", "Patch Tests", "Skin Physiological Phenomena", "Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85015151962", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Dermatology", "MEDI", "2708"]], "AuthorData": {"56676334800": {"Name": "Koppes S.A.", "AuthorID": "56676334800", "AffiliationID": "60001997", "AffiliationName": "Department of Dermatology-Allergology, VU University Medical Centre"}, "7006975012": {"Name": "Frings-Dresen M.H.W.", "AuthorID": "7006975012", "AffiliationID": "60001157", "AffiliationName": "Academic Medical Center, Department: Coronel institute of Occupational Health, Amsterdam Public Health Research Institute"}, "6603776964": {"Name": "Kezic S.", "AuthorID": "6603776964", "AffiliationID": "60001157", "AffiliationName": "Academic Medical Center, Department: Coronel institute of Occupational Health, Amsterdam Public Health Research Institute"}, "6603849258": {"Name": "Rustemeyer T.", "AuthorID": "6603849258", "AffiliationID": "60001997", "AffiliationName": "Department of Dermatology-Allergology, VU University Medical Centre"}, "57188702826": {"Name": "Ljubojevi\u0107 Had\u017eavdi\u0107 S.", "AuthorID": "57188702826", "AffiliationID": "60006461", "AffiliationName": "Department of Dermatology and Venereology, University Hospital Centre Zagreb and University of Zagreb School of Medicine"}, "26023306400": {"Name": "Juraki\u0107 Ton\u010dic R.", "AuthorID": "26023306400", "AffiliationID": "60006461", "AffiliationName": "Department of Dermatology and Venereology, University Hospital Centre Zagreb and University of Zagreb School of Medicine"}, "7003552377": {"Name": "Marinovic B.", "AuthorID": "7003552377", "AffiliationID": "60006461", "AffiliationName": "Department of Dermatology and Venereology, University Hospital Centre Zagreb and University of Zagreb School of Medicine"}, "6506471671": {"Name": "Jakasa I.", "AuthorID": "6506471671", "AffiliationID": "60087204, 60008408", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Food Technology and Biotechnology, Laboratory for Analytical Chemistry, Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of Zagreb"}, "57193609183": {"Name": "Franceschi N.", "AuthorID": "57193609183", "AffiliationID": "60006461", "AffiliationName": "Department of Dermatology and Venereology, University Clinical Hospital Centre \u2018Sestre Milosrdnice\u2019"}, "6602402499": {"Name": "Riethm\u00fcller C.", "AuthorID": "6602402499", "AffiliationID": "108958017", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Nanotechnology, Serend-ip GmbH, Centre for Nanotechnology"}, "57189026590": {"Name": "Raj N.", "AuthorID": "57189026590", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Skin Research Laboratory, Department of Pharmaceutics, University College London"}, "6701560382": {"Name": "Rawlings A.V.", "AuthorID": "6701560382", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Skin Research Laboratory, Department of Pharmaceutics, University College London"}, "56393831400": {"Name": "Lane M.E.", "AuthorID": "56393831400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Skin Research Laboratory, Department of Pharmaceutics, University College London"}, "56626940600": {"Name": "Voegeli R.", "AuthorID": "56626940600", "AffiliationID": "60020316", "AffiliationName": "DSM Nutritional Products Ltd."}, "56247876600": {"Name": "Haftek M.", "AuthorID": "56247876600", "AffiliationID": "60102126, 60108297", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Tissue Biology and Therapeutic Engineering, CNRS and University of Lyon"}}}
