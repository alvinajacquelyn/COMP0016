However, reherniation is a potential limitation of this standard technique. OBJECTIVE: To describe early results of a novel technique that utilizes the dentate ligament to hitch the spinal cord and prevent reherniation. METHODS: Two patients underwent dural hernia repair and the dentate hitch technique was performed. RESULTS: Restored lower limb power and mobility, and satisfactory reduction of spinal cord herniation on magnetic resonance imaging in 2 patients at 6- and 24-mo follow-ups, respectively. CONCLUSION: The dentate hitch technique can achieve repair of spinal cord herniation, with satisfactory postoperative results and minimizes the risk of reherniation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Dentate ligament", "Dura", "Herniation", "Hitch stitch", "Spinal cord"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Female", "Hernia", "Herniorrhaphy", "Humans", "Laminectomy", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Spinal Cord", "Spinal Cord Diseases", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85044418267", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"57201349858": {"Name": "Lui J.", "AuthorID": "57201349858", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "57200650096": {"Name": "Sayal P.", "AuthorID": "57200650096", "AffiliationID": "60020736", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurosurgery, The National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "23049327300": {"Name": "Choi D.", "AuthorID": "23049327300", "AffiliationID": "60020736", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurosurgery, The National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}}}
