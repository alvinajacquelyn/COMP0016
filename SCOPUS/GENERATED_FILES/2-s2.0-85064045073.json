Less is known about the physiological concentration of extracellular calcium in the brain. In electrophysiological brain slice experiments, the artificial cerebrospinal fluid traditionally contains relatively high concentrations of calcium (2-4 mM) to support synaptic transmission and suppress neuronal excitability. Using an ion-selective electrode, we determined the fraction of ionized calcium in healthy human cerebrospinal fluid to 1.0 mM of a total concentration of 1.2 mM (86%). Using patch-clamp and extracellular recordings in the CA1 region in acute slices of rat hippocampus, we then compared the effects of this physiological concentration of calcium with the commonly used 2 mM on neuronal excitability, synaptic transmission, and long-term potentiation (LTP) to examine the magnitude of changes in this range of extracellular calcium. Increasing the total extracellular calcium concentration from 1.2 to 2 mM decreased spontaneous action potential firing, induced a depolarization of the threshold, and increased the rate of both de- and repolarization of the action potential. Evoked synaptic transmission was approximately doubled, with a balanced effect between inhibition and excitation. In 1.2 mM calcium high-frequency stimulation did not result in any LTP, whereas a prominent LTP was observed at 2 or 4 mM calcium. Surprisingly, this inability to induce LTP persisted during blockade of GABAergic inhibition. In conclusion, an increase from the physiological 1.2 mM to 2 mM calcium in the artificial cerebrospinal fluid has striking effects on neuronal excitability, synaptic transmission, and the induction of LTP.
