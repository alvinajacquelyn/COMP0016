It is less clear whether cardiovascular risk factors influence PD phenotype, and if statins are prescribed appropriately. Objectives To quantify vascular risk and statin use in recent-onset PD, and examine the relationship between vascular risk, PD severity and phenotype. Methods Cardiovascular risk was quantified using the QRISK2 calculator (high \u226520%, medium \u226510 and <20%, low risk <10%). Motor severity and phenotype were assessed using the Movement Disorder Society Unified PD Rating Scale (UPDRS) and cognition by the Montreal cognitive assessment. Results In 2909 individuals with recent-onset PD, the mean age was 67.5 years (SD 9.3), 63.5% were men and the mean disease duration was 1.3 years (SD 0.9). 33.8% of cases had high vascular risk, 28.7% medium risk, and 22.3% low risk, while 15.2% of cases had established CVD. Increasing vascular risk and CVD were associated with older age ( p<0.001), worse motor score (p<0.001), more cognitive impairment (p<0.001) and worse motor phenotype ( p=0.021). Statins were prescribed in 37.2% with high vascular risk, 15.1% with medium vascular risk and 6.5% with low vascular risk, which compared with statin usage in 75.3% of those with CVD. Conclusions Over 60% of recent-onset PD patients have high or medium cardiovascular risk (meriting statin usage), which is associated with a worse motor and cognitive phenotype. Statins are underused in these patients, compared with those with vascular disease, which is a missed opportunity for preventive treatment.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Age Factors", "Aged", "Cardiovascular Diseases", "Comorbidity", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Drug Utilization", "England", "Female", "Humans", "Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Parkinson Disease", "Phenotype", "Risk Assessment"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84988921991", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"56007117800": {"Name": "Swallow D.M.A.", "AuthorID": "56007117800", "AffiliationID": "100782426", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Institute of Neurological Sciences"}, "6506382805": {"Name": "Grosset K.A.", "AuthorID": "6506382805", "AffiliationID": "100782426", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Institute of Neurological Sciences"}, "36727900800": {"Name": "Malek N.", "AuthorID": "36727900800", "AffiliationID": "100782426", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Institute of Neurological Sciences"}, "7005989891": {"Name": "Grosset D.G.", "AuthorID": "7005989891", "AffiliationID": "117444061", "AffiliationName": "UK Clinical Consortium, 72 Clinical Centres Across the UK"}, "55599815100": {"Name": "Lawton M.A.", "AuthorID": "55599815100", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "School of Social and Community Medicine, University of Bristol"}, "7006649063": {"Name": "Ben-Shlomo Y.", "AuthorID": "7006649063", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "School of Social and Community Medicine, University of Bristol"}, "26429517800": {"Name": "Klein J.", "AuthorID": "26429517800", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Oxford Parkinson's Disease Centre, Nuffield Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Oxford"}, "35184829900": {"Name": "Baig F.", "AuthorID": "35184829900", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Oxford Parkinson's Disease Centre, Nuffield Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Oxford"}, "13608762000": {"Name": "Ruffmann C.", "AuthorID": "13608762000", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Oxford Parkinson's Disease Centre, Nuffield Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Oxford"}, "57189494530": {"Name": "Hu M.T.M.", "AuthorID": "57189494530", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Oxford Parkinson's Disease Centre, Nuffield Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Oxford"}, "6603851732": {"Name": "Bajaj N.P.", "AuthorID": "6603851732", "AffiliationID": "60030816", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Queen's Medical Centre"}, "57198363260": {"Name": "Barker R.A.", "AuthorID": "57198363260", "AffiliationID": "60120904", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Neurosciences, John Van Geest Centre for Brain Repair"}, "26034521700": {"Name": "Burn D.J.", "AuthorID": "26034521700", "AffiliationID": "60006222", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neuroscience, University of Newcastle"}, "8984550100": {"Name": "Foltynie T.", "AuthorID": "8984550100", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Sobell Department of Motor Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "7401534782": {"Name": "Morris H.R.", "AuthorID": "7401534782", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "7402772034": {"Name": "Williams N.", "AuthorID": "7402772034", "AffiliationID": "60023998, 60170145", "AffiliationName": "Psychological Medicine and Clinical Neurosciences, MRC Centre for Neuropsychiatric Genetics and Genomics, Cardiff University"}, "7202960784": {"Name": "Wood N.W.", "AuthorID": "7202960784", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology"}}}
