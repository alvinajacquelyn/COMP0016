Published by BMJ.Background In recent years, there has been increasing research interest in improving diagnostic and management protocols in childhood arterial ischaemic stroke (AIS). However, childhood stroke comprises, in approximately equal parts, both arterial ischaemic and haemorrhagic stroke (HS). Objective The aim of this study was to focus on the aetiology, clinical presentation, treatment and short-term outcome of children with spontaneous intracranial bleeding in a university hospital and elucidate differences to childhood AIS. Design We performed a retrospective analysis of electronic medical records of children (28 days-18 years) diagnosed with HS between 2010 and 2016. Results We included 25 children (male child, n=11) with a median age of 8 years 1 month. The most common clinical presentations were vomiting (48%), headache (40%) and altered level of consciousness (32%). In more than half of the patients, HS was caused by vascular malformations. Other risk factors were brain tumour, coagulopathy and miscellaneous severe underlying diseases. Aetiology remained unclear in one child. Therapy was neurosurgical in most children (68%). Two patients died, 5 patients needed further (rehabilitation) treatment and 18 children could be discharged home. Conclusions HS differs from AIS in aetiology (vascular malformations as number one risk factor), number of risk factors ('mono-risk' disease), clinical presentation (vomiting, headache and altered level of consciousness) and (emergency) therapy.", "AuthorKeywords": ["haemorrhagic stroke", "intracranial bleeding", "paediatric"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85067873136", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"]], "AuthorData": {"55579394300": {"Name": "Gerstl L.", "AuthorID": "55579394300", "AffiliationID": "60000291, 60028717", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Neurology and Developmental Medicine, LMU Munich, University Hospital, Dr. von Hauner Children's Hospital"}, "57201471299": {"Name": "Badura K.", "AuthorID": "57201471299", "AffiliationID": "60000291, 60028717", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Neurology and Developmental Medicine, LMU Munich, University Hospital, Dr. von Hauner Children's Hospital"}, "26663458300": {"Name": "Heinen F.", "AuthorID": "26663458300", "AffiliationID": "60000291, 60028717", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Neurology and Developmental Medicine, LMU Munich, University Hospital, Dr. von Hauner Children's Hospital"}, "36766777600": {"Name": "Bonfert M.", "AuthorID": "36766777600", "AffiliationID": "60000291, 60028717", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Neurology and Developmental Medicine, LMU Munich, University Hospital, Dr. von Hauner Children's Hospital"}, "7003736523": {"Name": "Berweck S.", "AuthorID": "7003736523", "AffiliationID": "112447229", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuropaediatrics and Neurorehabilitation, Sch\u00f6n Klinik Vogtareuth"}, "57002839300": {"Name": "Weinberger R.", "AuthorID": "57002839300", "AffiliationID": "60028717", "AffiliationName": "Division of Epidemiology, LMU Munich, Institute of Social Paediatrics and Adolescent Medicine"}, "6701774885": {"Name": "Peraud A.", "AuthorID": "6701774885", "AffiliationID": "60010819", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Neurosurgery, University Hospital Ulm"}, "6603433108": {"Name": "Dorn F.", "AuthorID": "6603433108", "AffiliationID": "60000291, 60028717", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroradiology, LMU Munich, University Hospital"}, "7004263408": {"Name": "O'Callaghan F.", "AuthorID": "7004263408", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Institute of Child Health, Clinical Neuroscience Section"}}}
