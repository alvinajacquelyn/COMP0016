Methods Myocardial T2 quantification was achieved in 279 consecutive examinations from 78 different patients. The protocol consisted of 10 successive black-blood fast spin echo sequences with varying echo times, and a postprocessing based on image registration and exponential fitting. An automatic nonrigid registration method was applied to correct for myocardium misalignment. Finally T2 values were compared with those obtained with a conventional rigid registration followed by manual correction. Results Nonrigid registration was feasible in 98% of the datasets and was judged of higher quality compared with conventional processing (P<0.001). No significant difference was found in the clinical outcome (average septal T2) between nonrigid and conventional registration (P=0.66). Interobserver variability was improved with 95% limits of agreement of 2.7 ms (against 3.7 ms with conventional registration). The quality of T2 fitting, as assessed by the coefficient of determination R2, was significantly improved (P<0.001).
