We analyze this social behavior in the domain of evolutionary game theory, using as reference the Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma. Methods: In particular, we investigate whether, in an agent population, it is possible to identify a relation between competitiveness and cooperation. The agent population is embedded both in continuous and in discrete spaces, hence agents play the Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma with their neighbors. In continuous spaces, each agent computes its neighbors by an Euclidean distance-based rule, whereas in discrete spaces agents have as neighbors those directly connected with them. We map competitiveness to the amount of opponents each agent wants to face; therefore, this value is used to define the set of neighbors. Notably, in continuous spaces, competitive agents have a high interaction radius used to compute their neighbors. Instead, since discrete spaces are implemented as directed networks, competitiveness corresponds to the out-degree of each agent, i.e., to the number of arrows starting from the considered agent and directed to those agents it wants to face. Results and conclusions: Then, we study the evolution of the system with the aim to investigate if, and under which conditions, cooperation among agents emerges. As result, numerical simulations of the proposed model show that competitiveness strongly increases cooperation. Furthermore, we found other relevant phenomena as the emergence of hubs in directed networks.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Competitiveness", "Cooperation", "Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma", "Social dynamics"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85016074553", "SubjectAreas": [["Information Systems", "COMP", "1710"], ["Modeling and Simulation", "MATH", "2611"], ["Human-Computer Interaction", "COMP", "1709"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"]], "AuthorData": {"55601598500": {"Name": "Javarone M.", "AuthorID": "55601598500", "AffiliationID": "60010110", "AffiliationName": "Department of Humanities and Social Science, University of Sassari"}, "56574959100": {"Name": "Atzeni A.", "AuthorID": "56574959100", "AffiliationID": "60032259", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of Cagliari"}}}
