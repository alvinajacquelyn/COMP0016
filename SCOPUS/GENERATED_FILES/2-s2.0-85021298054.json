Those studies that have been carried out are also not widely known in the field. To help address the second point, in 2011, we carried out a review of the evidence base for psychodynamic psychotherapy for children and adolescents, which identified 35 studies which together provided some preliminary evidence for this treatment for a range of childhood disorders. The present study is an updated review, focusing on research published between March 2011 and November 2016. During this period, 23 additional studies were published, of which 5 were reports on randomised controlled trials, 3 were quasi-experimental controlled studies and 15 were observational studies. Although most studies covered children with mixed diagnoses, there were a number of studies examining specific diagnostic groups, including children with depression, anxiety and disruptive disorders. whilst the quality of studies was mixed, some were well-designed and reported, and overall indicated promising findings. Nevertheless, further high-quality research is needed in order to better understand the effectiveness of psychodynamic psychotherapy across a range of different disorders, and to ensure that services can provide a range of evidence-based treatments for children and young people.", "AuthorKeywords": ["child and adolescent psychotherapy", "effectiveness", "efficacy", "evidence-based practice", "outcome studies", "psychodynamic psychotherapy"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85021298054", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Clinical Psychology", "PSYC", "3203"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"57216973595": {"Name": "Midgley N.", "AuthorID": "57216973595", "AffiliationID": "60170329", "AffiliationName": "Anna Freud National Centre for Children and Families"}, "57194620609": {"Name": "O\u2019Keeffe S.", "AuthorID": "57194620609", "AffiliationID": "60170329", "AffiliationName": "Anna Freud National Centre for Children and Families"}, "57194626833": {"Name": "French L.", "AuthorID": "57194626833", "AffiliationID": "60170329", "AffiliationName": "Anna Freud National Centre for Children and Families"}, "16030968700": {"Name": "Kennedy E.", "AuthorID": "16030968700", "AffiliationID": "60170329", "AffiliationName": "Anna Freud National Centre for Children and Families"}}}
