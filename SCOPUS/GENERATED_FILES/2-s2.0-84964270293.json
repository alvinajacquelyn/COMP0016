An accurate tightening of bolts and nuts requires uniformly distributed clamping forces along flanges and surfaces of contact between hub and bearings. Due to the role of friction forces and the dynamics of the phenomenon, this process is nonlinear and currently performed manually; it is also time consuming, requiring high-cost equipment and expert operators. This paper proposes a set of neural networks, which infer the clamping force achievable with a tightening tool while fastening M24 nuts on bolts. The tool embeds a torque sensor and shaft encoder, therefore two types of inputs of the neural networks are considered in order to fit the clamping force output: the time signals of (a) the applied torque of the tool and (b) the combination of the torque and of the angular speed of the tool. According to results, neural networks properly model the clamping force, both during the training stage and when exposed to unseen testing data. This approach could be generalized to other industrial processes and specifically to those requiring repetitive tightening tasks and involving highly nonlinear aspects, such as friction forces.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bolt tightening", "Neural network", "Self-adaptive manufacturing", "Wind turbine"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adaptive manufacturing", "Clamping Force", "Industrial manufacturing", "Industrial processs", "Large scale wind turbines", "Mechanical components", "Torque sensors", "Wind turbine blades"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84964270293", "SubjectAreas": [["Information Systems", "COMP", "1710"], ["Artificial Intelligence", "COMP", "1702"], ["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"]], "AuthorData": {"7004042937": {"Name": "Secco E.", "AuthorID": "7004042937", "AffiliationID": "60105090", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, Liverpool Hope University"}, "8840681600": {"Name": "Nagar A.", "AuthorID": "8840681600", "AffiliationID": "60105090", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, Liverpool Hope University"}, "52563406900": {"Name": "Deters C.", "AuthorID": "52563406900", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Centre of Robotics Research, Department of Informatics, King's College London"}, "35119695800": {"Name": "Wurdemann H.", "AuthorID": "35119695800", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Centre of Robotics Research, Department of Informatics, King's College London"}, "16316079000": {"Name": "Lam H.", "AuthorID": "16316079000", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Centre of Robotics Research, Department of Informatics, King's College London"}, "6701489118": {"Name": "Althoefer K.", "AuthorID": "6701489118", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Centre of Robotics Research, Department of Informatics, King's College London"}}}
