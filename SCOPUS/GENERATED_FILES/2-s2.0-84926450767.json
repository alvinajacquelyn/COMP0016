We explore the origins of TERM concepts in myths, their application in the ancient era, their resurgence during Enlightenment, and, finally, their systematic codification into an emerging scientific and technological framework in recent past. The development of computational/mathematical approaches in TERM is also briefly discussed.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Regenerative medicine", "Scientific breakthrough", "Technological framework", "Animals", "History, 20th Century", "History, 21st Century", "Humans", "Regenerative Medicine", "Tissue Engineering"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84926450767", "SubjectAreas": [["Bioengineering", "CENG", "1502"], ["Biomaterials", "MATE", "2502"], ["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"]], "AuthorData": {"55635298800": {"Name": "Kaul H.", "AuthorID": "55635298800", "AffiliationID": "60001881", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University of Sheffield"}, "6603704133": {"Name": "Ventikos Y.", "AuthorID": "6603704133", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}}}
