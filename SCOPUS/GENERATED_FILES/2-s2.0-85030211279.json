It is not clear by which mechanisms this increased risk for cognitive disease is mediated. Further, amyloid \u03b2 production has been suggested to depend on the sleep-wake cycle and neuronal activity. The aim of the present study was to examine if cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations of a number of biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease-related processes, including amyloid \u03b2, neuronal injury, and inflammation, changed over time during intravenous anesthesia in surgical patients. Methods: We included patients scheduled for hysterectomy via laparotomy during general anesthesia with intravenous propofol and remifentanil. CSF samples were obtained before, during, and after surgery (5h after induction) and tested for 27 biomarkers. Changes over time were tested with linear mixed effects models. Results: A total of 22 patients, all females, were included. The mean age was 50years (\u00b19 SD). The mean duration of the anesthesia was 145min (\u00b140 SD). Interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1, and vascular endothelial growth factor A increased over time. IL-15 and IL-7 decreased slightly over time. Macrophage inflammatory protein 1\u03b2 and placental growth factor also changed significantly. There were no significant effects on amyloid \u03b2 (A\u03b2) or tau biomarkers. Conclusions: Surgery and general anesthesia with intravenous propofol and remifentanil induce, during and in the short term after the procedure, a neuroinflammatory response which is dominated by monocyte attractants, without biomarker signs of the effects on Alzheimer's disease pathology or neuronal injury.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Anesthesia", "Biomarkers", "Cerebrospinal fluid", "Inflammation", "Surgery"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Alzheimer Disease", "Amyloid beta-Peptides", "Anesthesia, Intravenous", "Biomarkers", "Cohort Studies", "Cytokines", "Female", "Humans", "Inflammation", "Middle Aged", "Peptide Fragments", "Piperidines", "Propofol", "tau Proteins", "Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85030211279", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"], ["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"]], "AuthorData": {"13605932200": {"Name": "Pikwer A.", "AuthorID": "13605932200", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "M\u00e4larsjukhuset, Department of Anesthesia"}, "57195939846": {"Name": "Namdar S.", "AuthorID": "57195939846", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "M\u00e4larsjukhuset, Department of Anesthesia"}, "54901785400": {"Name": "Castegren M.", "AuthorID": "54901785400", "AffiliationID": "60019295, 60012311", "AffiliationName": "Karolinska University Hospital and Clintec, Karolinska Institute, Perioperative medicine and intensive care (PMI)"}, "56415176000": {"Name": "Blennow K.", "AuthorID": "56415176000", "AffiliationID": "60031699", "AffiliationName": "Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Clinical Neurochemistry Laboratory"}, "6701454676": {"Name": "Zetterberg H.", "AuthorID": "6701454676", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Neurology, Department of Molecular Neuroscience"}, "23005631700": {"Name": "Mattsson N.", "AuthorID": "23005631700", "AffiliationID": "60014077", "AffiliationName": "Sk\u00e5ne University Hospital, Department of Neurology"}}}
