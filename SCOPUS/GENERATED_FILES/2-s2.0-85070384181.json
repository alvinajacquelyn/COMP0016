Design: Prospective observational sub-study of a birth cohort. Setting: Single-day assessment at a research centre in London, UK. Participants: 502 individuals were recruited from the MRC National Survey of Health and Development (NSHD), the 1946 British birth cohort, based on pre-specified eligibility criteria; mean age was 70.7 (SD: 0.7) and 49% were female. Outcome measures: Data regarding the number and types of incidental findings were summarised as counts and percentages, and 95% confidence intervals were calculated. Results: 93.8% of participants completed a brain scan (n=471); 4.5% of scanned participants had a pre-defined reportable abnormality on brain MRI (n=21); suspected vascular malformations and suspected intracranial mass lesions were present in 1.9% (n=9) and 1.5% (n=7) respectively; suspected cerebral aneurysms were the single most common vascular abnormality, affecting 1.1% of participants (n=5), and suspected meningiomas were the most common intracranial lesion, affecting 0.6% of participants (n=3); 34.6% of participants had at least one abnormality on clinical blood tests (n=169), but few reached the prespecified threshold for urgent action (n=11). Conclusions: In older adults, aged 69-71 years, potentially serious brain MRI findings were detected in around 5% of participants, and clinical blood test abnormalities were present in around one third of participants. Knowledge of the expected prevalence of incidental findings in the general population at this age is useful in both research and clinical settings.", "AuthorKeywords": ["epidemiology", "internal medicine", "medical ethics", "neurology"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Brain", "Brain Diseases", "Female", "Hematologic Tests", "Humans", "Incidental Findings", "London", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Neuroimaging", "Prevalence", "Prospective Studies"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85070384181", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"57202756708": {"Name": "Keuss S.E.", "AuthorID": "57202756708", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Dementia Research Centre, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology"}, "55359123400": {"Name": "Parker T.D.", "AuthorID": "55359123400", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Dementia Research Centre, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology"}, "57136307200": {"Name": "Lane C.A.", "AuthorID": "57136307200", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Dementia Research Centre, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology"}, "56410615100": {"Name": "Cash D.M.", "AuthorID": "56410615100", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Dementia Research Centre, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology"}, "55034699600": {"Name": "Keshavan A.", "AuthorID": "55034699600", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Dementia Research Centre, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology"}, "57202440462": {"Name": "Buchanan S.M.", "AuthorID": "57202440462", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Dementia Research Centre, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology"}, "57194062479": {"Name": "Murray-Smith H.", "AuthorID": "57194062479", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Dementia Research Centre, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology"}, "57205113051": {"Name": "Lu K.", "AuthorID": "57205113051", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Dementia Research Centre, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology"}, "57205107566": {"Name": "Collins J.", "AuthorID": "57205107566", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Dementia Research Centre, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology"}, "16637997400": {"Name": "Malone I.B.", "AuthorID": "16637997400", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Dementia Research Centre, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology"}, "7201444328": {"Name": "Fox N.", "AuthorID": "7201444328", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Dementia Research Centre, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology"}, "7103177641": {"Name": "Schott J.M.", "AuthorID": "7103177641", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Dementia Research Centre, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology"}, "57192278679": {"Name": "Hoskote C.", "AuthorID": "57192278679", "AffiliationID": "60020736", "AffiliationName": "Lysholm Department of Neuroradiology, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "7403887736": {"Name": "Shah S.", "AuthorID": "7403887736", "AffiliationID": "60020736", "AffiliationName": "Lysholm Department of Neuroradiology, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "57205235639": {"Name": "Wong A.", "AuthorID": "57205235639", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Unit for Lifelong Health and Ageing, University College London"}, "57210000595": {"Name": "James S.N.", "AuthorID": "57210000595", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Unit for Lifelong Health and Ageing, University College London"}, "7402054647": {"Name": "Richards M.", "AuthorID": "7402054647", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Unit for Lifelong Health and Ageing, University College London"}, "22978548500": {"Name": "Beasley D.G.", "AuthorID": "22978548500", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "School of Biomedical Engineering and Imaging Sciences, King's College London"}, "55485914900": {"Name": "Thomas D.L.", "AuthorID": "55485914900", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Brain Repair and Neurorehabilitation, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology"}, "24075571700": {"Name": "Barnes A.", "AuthorID": "24075571700", "AffiliationID": "60024544, 60090043", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Nuclear Medicine, University College London Hospitals"}}}
