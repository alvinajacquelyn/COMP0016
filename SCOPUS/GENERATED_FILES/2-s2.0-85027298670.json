This is one of the first studies to explore the clinical impact of the overlap between OCD and ASD as a categorical diagnosis. Methods: A cross-sectional survey in 73 adult outpatients with DSM-IV OCD. Autistic traits were measured using the Autism-Spectrum Quotient (AQ). A clinical estimate ASD diagnosis was made by interview using DSM-IV-TR criteria. OCD patients with and without autistic traits or ASD were compared on demographic and clinical parameters and level of OCD treatment-resistance based on treatment history. Results: Thirty-four (47%) patients scored above the clinical threshold on the AQ (\u226526) and 21 (27.8%) met diagnostic criteria for ASD. These diagnoses had not been made before. Patients with autistic traits showed a borderline significant increase in OCD symptom-severity (Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS); p =.054) and significantly increased impairment of insight (Brown Assessment of Beliefs Scale; p =.01). There was a positive correlation between AQ and Y-BOCS scores (p =.04), but not with OCD treatment resistance. Conclusion: There is a high prevalence of previously undiagnosed ASD in patients with OCD. ASD traits are associated with greater OCD symptom-severity and poor insight.", "AuthorKeywords": ["autism", "Autism spectrum disorders", "autistic spectrum disorder", "autistic traits", "co-morbidity", "obsessive compulsive disorder"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Autism Spectrum Disorder", "Comorbidity", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder", "Outpatients", "Severity of Illness Index", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85027298670", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"57195346411": {"Name": "Wikramanayake W.N.M.", "AuthorID": "57195346411", "AffiliationID": "60032760", "AffiliationName": "Postgraduate Medical School, University of Hertfordshire"}, "35413253200": {"Name": "Fineberg N.A.", "AuthorID": "35413253200", "AffiliationID": "60170490", "AffiliationName": "Hertfordshire Partnership University NHS Foundation Trust"}, "9743239400": {"Name": "Mandy W.", "AuthorID": "9743239400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London"}, "57195348325": {"Name": "Shahper S.", "AuthorID": "57195348325", "AffiliationID": "60032760", "AffiliationName": "Department of Life & Medical Science, University of Hertfordshire"}, "57213734409": {"Name": "Kaur S.", "AuthorID": "57213734409", "AffiliationID": "60170490", "AffiliationName": "South West Crisis and Home Treatment Team, Hertfordshire Partnership University NHS Foundation Trust"}, "56046496400": {"Name": "Kolli S.", "AuthorID": "56046496400", "AffiliationID": "60099152", "AffiliationName": "East London Foundation NHS Trust"}, "57195350364": {"Name": "Osman S.", "AuthorID": "57195350364", "AffiliationID": "60105394", "AffiliationName": "Northumberland, Tyne & Wear NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57195346564": {"Name": "Reid J.", "AuthorID": "57195346564", "AffiliationID": "60170490", "AffiliationName": "Highly Specialized Obsessive Compulsive Disorders Service, Hertfordshire Partnership University NHS Foundation Trust"}, "56486123000": {"Name": "Jefferies-Sewell K.", "AuthorID": "56486123000", "AffiliationID": "60170490", "AffiliationName": "Hertfordshire Partnership University NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
