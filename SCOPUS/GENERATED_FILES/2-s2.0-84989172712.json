Effective targeted drug delivery systems often rely on external stimuli to effect release, therefore knowing the exact location of the capsule and when to apply an external stimulus is paramount. We present a drug delivery system for the GI tract based on coating standard gelatin drug capsules with a model eicosane- superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticle composite coating, which is activated using magnetic hyperthermia as an on-demand release mechanism to heat and melt the coating. We also show that the capsules can be readily detected via rapid X-ray computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), vital for progressing such a system towards clinical applications. This also offers the opportunity to image the dispersion of the drug payload post release. These imaging techniques also influenced capsule content and design and the delivered dosage form. The ability to easily change design demonstrates the versatility of this system, a vital advantage for modern, patient-specific medicine.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84989172712", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"51160971600": {"Name": "Bear J.C.", "AuthorID": "51160971600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Materials Chemistry Centre, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "57191358929": {"Name": "Casson A.", "AuthorID": "57191358929", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Materials Chemistry Centre, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "55839956500": {"Name": "Powell M.J.", "AuthorID": "55839956500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Materials Chemistry Centre, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "56217400400": {"Name": "Parkin I.P.", "AuthorID": "56217400400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Materials Chemistry Centre, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "55811675700": {"Name": "Patrick P.S.", "AuthorID": "55811675700", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Advanced Biomedical Imaging (CABI), Department of Medicine and Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "9434519300": {"Name": "Kalber T.", "AuthorID": "9434519300", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Advanced Biomedical Imaging (CABI), Department of Medicine and Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "7004107686": {"Name": "Lythgoe M.", "AuthorID": "7004107686", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Advanced Biomedical Imaging (CABI), Department of Medicine and Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "26432363000": {"Name": "Southern P.", "AuthorID": "26432363000", "AffiliationID": "60028113, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Healthcare Biomagnetics Laboratories, Royal Institution of Great Britain"}, "57220714582": {"Name": "Lin F.Y.", "AuthorID": "57220714582", "AffiliationID": "60028113, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Healthcare Biomagnetics Laboratories, Royal Institution of Great Britain"}, "7006435054": {"Name": "Pankhurst Q.A.", "AuthorID": "7006435054", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "7103244120": {"Name": "Mayes A.G.", "AuthorID": "7103244120", "AffiliationID": "60000112, 60176145", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, University of East Anglia, Norwich Research Park"}}}
