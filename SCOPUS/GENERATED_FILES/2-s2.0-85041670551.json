However, traditionally, such research fails to consider the gastrointestinal differences between the sexes of rats and the impact on oral drug delivery. This study aimed to identify and characterise the potential sex-related differences in the gastrointestinal environment of sacrificed male and female Wistar rats. Their gastrointestinal tracts were excised and segmented into the stomach, duodenum, jejunum, ileum, caecum and colon. The respective contents and tissue sections were collected and analysed for pH, buffer capacity, surface tension, osmolality and relative P-glycoprotein (P-gp) expression. The pH in the stomach of females was found to be lower than in males. Female rats also exhibited a higher buffer capacity in the caecum and colon when compared with their male counterparts. Males were found to have a higher osmolality than females in the duodenum, ileum and colon. Significant sex differences (p < 0.05) in surface tension were observed in the ileum, where females exhibited a higher surface tension. Interestingly, female rats displayed significantly higher relative P-gp expression levels (p < 0.05) when compared with male rats in the duodenum (1.24 \u00b1 0.85 vs. 0.36 \u00b1 0.26), jejunum (1.45 \u00b1 0.88 vs. 0.38 \u00b1 0.26) and ileum (0.92 \u00b1 0.43 vs. 0.40 \u00b1 0.18) but not in the colon (0.5 \u00b1 0.32 vs. 0.33 \u00b1 0.16) segments. The work reported has demonstrated the stark physiological differences between male and female rats at a physiological level, indicating how the \u2018sex of the gut\u2019 could influence oral drug delivery. These findings, therefore, are of critical importance in pre-clinical research and drug development.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Gastrointestinal", "Oral drug delivery", "P-glycoprotein", "Pre-clinical development", "Rat models", "Sex differences"], "IndexKeywords": ["Administration, Oral", "Animals", "Drug Delivery Systems", "Female", "Gastrointestinal Tract", "Male", "Models, Animal", "Osmolar Concentration", "Rats", "Rats, Wistar", "Sex Characteristics"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85041670551", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmaceutical Science", "PHAR", "3003"]], "AuthorData": {"56205649000": {"Name": "Afonso-Pereira F.", "AuthorID": "56205649000", "AffiliationID": "60053227, 60020985", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Coimbra"}, "57200565921": {"Name": "Dou L.", "AuthorID": "57200565921", "AffiliationID": "60016379, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmaceutics, UCL School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "57190062563": {"Name": "Trenfield S.", "AuthorID": "57190062563", "AffiliationID": "60016379, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmaceutics, UCL School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "57200558361": {"Name": "Madla C.", "AuthorID": "57200558361", "AffiliationID": "60016379, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmaceutics, UCL School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "55078653600": {"Name": "Murdan S.", "AuthorID": "55078653600", "AffiliationID": "60016379, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmaceutics, UCL School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "7003826707": {"Name": "Basit A.", "AuthorID": "7003826707", "AffiliationID": "60016379, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmaceutics, UCL School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "7202617786": {"Name": "Sousa J.", "AuthorID": "7202617786", "AffiliationID": "60053227, 60020985", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Coimbra"}, "35567448700": {"Name": "Veiga F.", "AuthorID": "35567448700", "AffiliationID": "60053227, 60020985", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Coimbra"}}}
