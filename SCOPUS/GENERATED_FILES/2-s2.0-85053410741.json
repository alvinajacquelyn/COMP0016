It does so by examining the Biblioteca de la Mujer series, the publishing project Pardo Baz\u00e1n established in 1892 to spread awareness of the growing moves towards female emancipation in Europe. It looks at the frame provided by the other volumes in that series and their efforts to re-establish the claims of Spanish women to prominence in the nation\u2019s cultural imaginary. The discussion then focuses in detail on the text of La esclavitud femenina, the title given to Mill\u2019s tract in Spanish, and on the questions of authorship that surround the text. Particular attention is paid to the subtle amendments incorporated into the translation to strengthen its feminist case and also to attenuate its potentially controversial aspects.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Biblioteca de la Mujer", "Emilia Pardo Baz\u00e1n", "Feminism", "John Stuart Mill", "The subjection of women"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85053410741", "SubjectAreas": [["Cultural Studies", "SOCI", "3316"], ["Literature and Literary Theory", "ARTS", "1208"]], "AuthorData": {"36610992300": {"Name": "Wood G.", "AuthorID": "36610992300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
