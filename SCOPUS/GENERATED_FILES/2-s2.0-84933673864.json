Despite growing interest, no study to date has systematically investigated the effects of different stimulus configurations on pRF estimates from human visual cortex. Here we compared the effects of three different stimulus configurations on a model-based approach to pRF estimation: size-invariant bars and eccentricity-scaled bars defined in Cartesian coordinates and traveling along the cardinal axes, and a novel simultaneous \"wedge and ring\u201d stimulus defined in polar coordinates, systematically covering polar and eccentricity axes. We found that the presence or absence of eccentricity scaling had a significant effect on goodness of fit and pRF size estimates. Further, variability in pRF size estimates was directly influenced by stimulus configuration, particularly for higher visual areas including V5/MT+. Finally, we compared eccentricity estimation between phase-encoded and model-based pRF approaches. We observed a tendency for more peripheral eccentricity estimates using phase-encoded methods, independent of stimulus size. We conclude that both eccentricity scaling and polar rather than Cartesian stimulus configuration are important considerations for optimal experimental design in pRF mapping. While all stimulus configurations produce adequate estimates, simultaneous wedge and ring stimulation produced higher fit reliability, with a significant advantage in reduced acquisition time.", "AuthorKeywords": ["fMRI", "Population receptive field modeling", "PRF", "Primary visual cortex (V1)", "Retinotopy", "Stimulus design", "Visual cortex"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84933673864", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuropsychology and Physiological Psychology", "PSYC", "3206"], ["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"], ["Biological Psychiatry", "NEUR", "2803"], ["Behavioral Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2802"]], "AuthorData": {"56190051500": {"Name": "Alvarez I.", "AuthorID": "56190051500", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "55290679000": {"Name": "Clark C.A.", "AuthorID": "55290679000", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "36143796900": {"Name": "de Haas B.", "AuthorID": "36143796900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Experimental Psychology, University College London"}, "7202374409": {"Name": "Rees G.", "AuthorID": "7202374409", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60084279", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, University College London"}, "15766309800": {"Name": "Samuel Schwarzkopf D.", "AuthorID": "15766309800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Experimental Psychology, University College London"}}}
