In intentional smouldering applications (e.g., hydrocarbon-contaminated soil remediation), extinction is undesired. In this work, a previously validated one-dimensional numerical model was employed to explore how the energy is transferred towards/away from a forward smouldering reaction. The energy balance analysis revealed that under self-sustaining conditions char oxidation provided the major energy source to sustain smouldering, with negligible contribution from pyrolysis. Moreover, heat losses were significant but could be compensated by heat transfer from the hot sand towards the reaction. Self-sustaining conditions included indefinite propagation at steady-state and also continuously accumulating energy in the system. Smouldering extinction conditions were characterized by a negative rate of net energy caused by energy losses exceeding that released by oxidation. In such cases, heat transfer from the hot sand towards the reaction delayed extinction with important implications for the extent of remediation (i.e., amount of fuel consumed).", "AuthorKeywords": ["Energy balance", "Heat loss", "Local thermal non-equilibrium", "Porous medium", "Smouldering combustion"], "IndexKeywords": ["Contaminated soils", "Energy balance analysis", "Local thermal non-equilibrium", "Negative rates", "Porous medium", "Positive energies", "Reaction zones", "Smouldering combustions"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85051968208", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"]], "AuthorData": {"57205184750": {"Name": "Zanoni M.", "AuthorID": "57205184750", "AffiliationID": "60010884", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of Western Ontario"}, "7007145814": {"Name": "Gerhard J.", "AuthorID": "7007145814", "AffiliationID": "60010884", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of Western Ontario"}, "7004558676": {"Name": "Torero J.", "AuthorID": "7004558676", "AffiliationID": "60078684, 60020304", "AffiliationName": "James Clark School of Engineering, University of Maryland"}}}
