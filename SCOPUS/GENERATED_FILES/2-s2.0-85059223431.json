Chlamydia trachomatis (Ct) infection and anti-Ct antibody responses (anti-Pgp3) have both been evaluated as alternative indicators in settings with varying levels of trachoma. There is a need to evaluate the feasibility of using tests for Ct infection and anti-Pgp3 antibodies at scale in a trachoma-endemic country and to establish the added value of the data generated for understanding transmission dynamics in the peri-elimination setting. Methodology/Principal findings: Dried blood spots for serological testing and ocular swabs for Ct infection testing (taken from children aged 1\u20139 years) were integrated into the pre-validation trachoma surveys conducted in the Northern and Upper West regions of Ghana in 2015 and 2016. Ct infection was detected using the GeneXpert PCR platform and the presence of anti-Pgp3 antibodies was detected using both the ELISA assay and multiplex bead array (MBA). The overall mean cluster-summarised TF prevalence (the clinical indicator) was 0.8% (95% CI: 0.6\u20131.0) and Ct infection prevalence was 0.04% (95%CI: 0.00\u20130.12). Anti-Pgp3 seroprevalence using the ELISA was 5.5% (95% CI: 4.8\u20136.3) compared to 4.3% (95%CI: 3.7\u20134.9) using the MBA. There was strong evidence from both assays that seropositivity increased with age (p<0.001), although the seroconversion rate was estimated to be very low (between 1.2 to 1.3 yearly events per 100 children). Conclusions/Significance: Infection and serological data provide useful information to aid in understanding Ct transmission dynamics. Elimination of trachoma as a public health problem does not equate to the absence of ocular Ct infection nor cessation in acquisition of anti-Ct antibodies.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Antibodies, Bacterial", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Chlamydia trachomatis", "Female", "Ghana", "Humans", "Infant", "Male", "Polymerase Chain Reaction", "Public Health", "Seroepidemiologic Studies", "Serologic Tests", "Trachoma"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85059223431", "SubjectAreas": [["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"55809148700": {"Name": "Senyonjo L.", "AuthorID": "55809148700", "AffiliationID": "120618842", "AffiliationName": "Haywards Heath"}, "57193313743": {"Name": "Migchelsen S.", "AuthorID": "57193313743", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Research Department, Faculty of Infectious and Tropical Diseases, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"}, "57203174951": {"Name": "Solomon A.", "AuthorID": "57203174951", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Research Department, Faculty of Infectious and Tropical Diseases, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"}, "7402652011": {"Name": "Bailey R.", "AuthorID": "7402652011", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Research Department, Faculty of Infectious and Tropical Diseases, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"}, "36628047200": {"Name": "Debrah O.", "AuthorID": "36628047200", "AffiliationID": "60071871", "AffiliationName": "Eye Care Unit, Ghana Health Service"}, "57204802710": {"Name": "Addy J.", "AuthorID": "57204802710", "AffiliationID": "60071871", "AffiliationName": "Eye Care Unit, Ghana Health Service"}, "7406285982": {"Name": "Martin D.", "AuthorID": "7406285982", "AffiliationID": "60021658", "AffiliationName": "Division of Parasitic Diseases and Malaria, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"}, "57150831300": {"Name": "Gwyn S.", "AuthorID": "57150831300", "AffiliationID": "60021658", "AffiliationName": "Division of Parasitic Diseases and Malaria, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"}, "14059503100": {"Name": "Asante-Poku A.", "AuthorID": "14059503100", "AffiliationID": "60017910", "AffiliationName": "Bacteriology Department, Noguchi Memorial Institute for Medical Research, University of Ghana"}, "57205238143": {"Name": "deSouza D.", "AuthorID": "57205238143", "AffiliationID": "60017910", "AffiliationName": "Parasitology Department, Noguchi Memorial Institute for Medical Research, University of Ghana"}, "57200138344": {"Name": "Agyemang D.", "AuthorID": "57200138344", "AffiliationID": "60112986", "AffiliationName": "Sightsavers Ghana"}, "56434316000": {"Name": "Bakajika D.", "AuthorID": "56434316000", "AffiliationID": "60112986", "AffiliationName": "Sightsavers Ghana"}, "36627854300": {"Name": "Aboe A.", "AuthorID": "36627854300", "AffiliationID": "60112986", "AffiliationName": "Sightsavers Ghana"}, "26435713700": {"Name": "Biritwum-Kwadwo N.", "AuthorID": "26435713700", "AffiliationID": "60071871", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neglected Tropical Diseases, Ghana Health Service"}, "55597697900": {"Name": "Marfo B.", "AuthorID": "55597697900", "AffiliationID": "60071871", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neglected Tropical Diseases, Ghana Health Service"}, "57189514465": {"Name": "Mensah E.", "AuthorID": "57189514465", "AffiliationID": "60120612", "AffiliationName": "FHI360 Ghana"}, "36660785900": {"Name": "Koroma J.", "AuthorID": "36660785900", "AffiliationID": "60120612", "AffiliationName": "FHI360 Ghana"}}}
