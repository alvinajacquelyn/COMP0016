Metacognitive accuracy is associated with the grey matter volume (GMV) in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), an area also impacted in schizophrenia. The present study set out to investigate whether deficits in metacognitive accuracy are present in the early stages of psychosis. Methods: Metacognitive accuracy in first-episode psychosis (FEP) was assessed on a perceptual decision-making task and their performance compared to matched healthy control participants (N = 18). A novel signal detection theory approach was used to model metacognitive sensitivity independently from objective perceptual performance. A voxel-based morphometry investigation was also conducted on GMV. Results: We found that the FEP group demonstrated significantly worse metacognitive accuracy compared to controls (p =.039). Importantly, GMV deficits were also observed in the superior frontal gyrus. The findings suggest a specific deficit in this processing domain to exist at first episode; however, no relationship was found between GMV and metacognitive accuracy. Conclusions: Our findings support the notion that an inability to accurately scrutinise perception may underpin functional deficits observed in later schizophrenia; however, the exact neural basis of metacognitive deficits in FEP remains elusive.", "AuthorKeywords": ["consciousness", "metacognition", "psychosis", "Schizophrenia", "voxel-based morphometry"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Case-Control Studies", "Decision Making", "Female", "Gray Matter", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Metacognition", "Organ Size", "Prefrontal Cortex", "Psychotic Disorders", "Schizophrenia", "Schizophrenic Psychology", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85042915879", "SubjectAreas": [["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"57193734098": {"Name": "Davies G.", "AuthorID": "57193734098", "AffiliationID": "60170299", "AffiliationName": "Sussex Partnership NHS Foundation Trust"}, "35556649600": {"Name": "Greenwood K.", "AuthorID": "35556649600", "AffiliationID": "60170299", "AffiliationName": "Sussex Partnership NHS Foundation Trust"}, "6508151521": {"Name": "Medford N.", "AuthorID": "6508151521", "AffiliationID": "60100018", "AffiliationName": "Neuroscience, Brighton & Sussex Medical School"}, "7006731538": {"Name": "Critchley H.D.", "AuthorID": "7006731538", "AffiliationID": "60100018", "AffiliationName": "Neuroscience, Brighton & Sussex Medical School"}, "54792126900": {"Name": "Rae C.L.", "AuthorID": "54792126900", "AffiliationID": "60100018", "AffiliationName": "Neuroscience, Brighton & Sussex Medical School"}, "26648254700": {"Name": "Garfinkel S.N.", "AuthorID": "26648254700", "AffiliationID": "60100018", "AffiliationName": "Neuroscience, Brighton & Sussex Medical School"}, "7103146527": {"Name": "Seth A.K.", "AuthorID": "7103146527", "AffiliationID": "60017317", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering & Informatics, University of Sussex"}}}
