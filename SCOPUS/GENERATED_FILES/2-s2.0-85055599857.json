Stroke is published on behalf of the American Heart Association, Inc., by Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.Background and Purpose: Prediction models may help physicians to stratify patients with high and low risk for periprocedural complications or long-term stroke risk after carotid artery stenting or carotid endarterectomy. We aimed to evaluate external performance of previously published prediction models for short- and long-term outcome after carotid revascularization in patients with symptomatic carotid artery stenosis. Methods: From a literature review, we selected all prediction models that used only readily available patient characteristics known before procedure initiation. Follow-up data from 2184 carotid artery stenting and 2261 carotid endarterectomy patients from 4 randomized trials (EVA-3S [Endarterectomy Versus Angioplasty in Patients With Symptomatic Severe Carotid Stenosis], SPACE [Stent-Protected Angioplasty Versus Carotid Endarterectomy], ICSS [International Carotid Stenting Study], and CREST [Carotid Revascularization Endarterectomy Versus Stenting Trial]) were used to validate 23 short-term outcome models to estimate stroke or death risk \u226430 days after the procedure and the original outcome measure for which the model was developed. Additionally, we validated 7 long-term outcome models for the original outcome measure. Predictive performance of the models was assessed with C statistics and calibration plots. Results: Stroke or death \u226430 days after the procedure occurred in 158 (7.2%) patients after carotid artery stenting and in 84 (3.7%) patients after carotid endarterectomy. Most models for short-term outcome after carotid artery stenting (n=4) or carotid endarterectomy (n=19) had poor discriminative performance (C statistics ranging from 0.49-0.64) and poor calibration with small absolute risk differences between the lowest and highest risk groups and overestimation of risk in the highest risk groups. Long-term outcome models (n=7) had a slightly better performance with C statistics ranging from 0.59 to 0.67 and reasonable calibration. Conclusions: Current models did not reliably predict outcome after carotid revascularization in a trial population of patients with symptomatic carotid stenosis. In particular, prediction of short-term outcome seemed to be difficult. Further external validation of existing prediction models or development of new prediction models is needed before such models can be used to support treatment decisions in individual patients.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Angioplasty", "Carotid endarterectomy", "Carotid stenosis", "Myocardial infarction", "Prognosis", "Thromboembolism"], "IndexKeywords": ["Carotid Stenosis", "Endarterectomy, Carotid", "Humans", "Models, Biological", "Predictive Value of Tests", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85055599857", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"], ["Advanced and Specialized Nursing", "NURS", "2902"]], "AuthorData": {"57189761826": {"Name": "Volkers E.J.", "AuthorID": "57189761826", "AffiliationID": "60032724", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology and Neurosurgery, Julius Center for Health Sciences and Primary Care, University Medical Center Utrecht"}, "7102299895": {"Name": "Algra A.", "AuthorID": "7102299895", "AffiliationID": "100345991", "AffiliationName": "Julius Center for Health Sciences and Primary Care"}, "19734239500": {"Name": "Jaap Kappelle L.", "AuthorID": "19734239500", "AffiliationID": "114241960", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology and Neurosurgery, Brain Center Rudolf Magnus"}, "7102733140": {"Name": "Becquemin J.P.", "AuthorID": "7102733140", "AffiliationID": "121396194", "AffiliationName": "IVPE, Hopital Priv\u00e9 Paul D'Egine"}, "7003660124": {"Name": "Hendrikse J.", "AuthorID": "7003660124", "AffiliationID": "60032724, 60007989", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht University"}, "7004559323": {"Name": "Jansen O.", "AuthorID": "7004559323", "AffiliationID": "112576214", "AffiliationName": "Clinic for Radiology and Neuroradiology, UKSH Campus Kiel"}, "7202021947": {"Name": "Howard G.", "AuthorID": "7202021947", "AffiliationID": "60033096", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biostatistics, UAB School of Public Health"}, "7102593623": {"Name": "Halliday A.", "AuthorID": "7102593623", "AffiliationID": "60008323, 60002634", "AffiliationName": "Nuffield Department of Surgical Sciences, John Radcliffe Hospital"}, "16238705700": {"Name": "Gregson J.", "AuthorID": "16238705700", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Statistics, London School for Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "55134488000": {"Name": "Fraedrich G.", "AuthorID": "55134488000", "AffiliationID": "60008222", "AffiliationName": "Department of Vascular Surgery, Medical University of Innsbruck"}, "23488507900": {"Name": "Eckstein H.H.", "AuthorID": "23488507900", "AffiliationID": "60103459, 60019722", "AffiliationName": "Department of Vascular, Endovascular Surgery/Vascular Center, Klinikum rechts der Isar, Technical University Munich"}, "7004467702": {"Name": "Calvet D.", "AuthorID": "7004467702", "AffiliationID": "60020773, 60123796, 60000905", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, H\u00f4pital Sainte-Anne, Universit\u00e9 Paris-Descartes, DHU Neurovasc Sorbonne Paris Cit\u00e9, INSERM U894"}, "7102288811": {"Name": "Mas J.L.", "AuthorID": "7102288811", "AffiliationID": "60020773, 60123796, 60000905", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, H\u00f4pital Sainte-Anne, Universit\u00e9 Paris-Descartes, DHU Neurovasc Sorbonne Paris Cit\u00e9, INSERM U894"}, "6506642821": {"Name": "Bulbulia R.", "AuthorID": "6506642821", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851, 60022323", "AffiliationName": "MRC Population Health Research Unit, Clinical Trial Service Unit and Epidemiological Studies Unit, Nuffield Department of Population Health, University of Oxford"}, "57197409420": {"Name": "Brown M.M.", "AuthorID": "57197409420", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Brain Repair and Rehabilitation, UCL Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "56521233200": {"Name": "Bonati L.H.", "AuthorID": "56521233200", "AffiliationID": "60028287", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Stroke Center, Department of Clinical Research, University Hospital Basel"}, "7003924176": {"Name": "Ringleb P.A.", "AuthorID": "7003924176", "AffiliationID": "60016908", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, University of Heidelberg, Medical School"}, "7007060770": {"Name": "Brott T.G.", "AuthorID": "7007060770", "AffiliationID": "60002333", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Mayo Clinic"}, "12797608800": {"Name": "Greving J.P.", "AuthorID": "12797608800", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
