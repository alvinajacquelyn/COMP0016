Four methods of delivery of an adenovirus encoding \u03b2-galactosidase (Ad.LacZ) were evaluated: intravascular injection using phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) into (1) uterine artery (UtA) or (2) internal iliac artery or external administration in (3) PBS or (4) pluronic F-127 gel (Sigma Aldrich). Postmortem examination was performed 4 to 7 days after gene transfer. Tissue transduction was assessed by X-gal histochemistry and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. External vascular application of the adenovirus vector in combination with pluronic gel had 91.7% success rate in terms of administration (85% maternal survival) and gave the best results for maternal/fetal survival and local transduction efficiency without any spread to maternal or fetal tissues. This study suggests an optimal method of gene delivery to the UtAs of a small rodent for preclinical studies.", "AuthorKeywords": ["adenovirus vector", "Guinea pig", "pluronic gel", "prenatal gene therapy", "uteroplacental circulation", "VEGF-A165"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adenoviridae", "Animals", "beta-Galactosidase", "Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay", "Female", "Fetal Growth Retardation", "Gene Targeting", "Genetic Therapy", "Genetic Vectors", "Guinea Pigs", "Iliac Artery", "Placental Circulation", "Pregnancy", "Radial Artery", "Uterine Artery"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84978194389", "SubjectAreas": [["Obstetrics and Gynecology", "MEDI", "2729"]], "AuthorData": {"35604074600": {"Name": "Mehta V.", "AuthorID": "35604074600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Medicine, Centre for Cardiovascular Biology and Medicine, University College London, Rayne Building"}, "6507850992": {"Name": "Ofir K.", "AuthorID": "6507850992", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Women's Health, University College London"}, "56567581800": {"Name": "Swanson A.", "AuthorID": "56567581800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Women's Health, University College London"}, "57220257683": {"Name": "Kloczko E.", "AuthorID": "57220257683", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Women's Health, University College London"}, "7006889522": {"Name": "Peebles D.", "AuthorID": "7006889522", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Women's Health, University College London"}, "7402605276": {"Name": "David A.L.", "AuthorID": "7402605276", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Women's Health, University College London"}, "55619306923": {"Name": "Martin J.", "AuthorID": "55619306923", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Medicine, Centre for Cardiovascular Biology and Medicine, University College London, Rayne Building"}, "7006463251": {"Name": "Zachary I.", "AuthorID": "7006463251", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Medicine, Centre for Cardiovascular Biology and Medicine, University College London, Rayne Building"}, "35602921400": {"Name": "Boyd M.", "AuthorID": "35602921400", "AffiliationID": "60026530", "AffiliationName": "BSU, Royal Veterinary College"}, "57190184397": {"Name": "Barker H.", "AuthorID": "57190184397", "AffiliationID": "60026530", "AffiliationName": "BSU, Royal Veterinary College"}, "55356573700": {"Name": "Avdic-Belltheus A.", "AuthorID": "55356573700", "AffiliationID": "60026530", "AffiliationName": "BSU, Royal Veterinary College"}}}
