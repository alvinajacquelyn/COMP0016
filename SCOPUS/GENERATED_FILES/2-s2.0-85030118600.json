Its water splitting function is particularly favoured by the formation of a stable charge separated state via a pathway that starts at an accessory chlorophyll. Here we envision a photovoltaic device that places one of these complexes between electrodes and investigate how the mean current and its fluctuations depend on the microscopic interactions underlying charge separation in the pathway considered. Our results indicate that coupling to well resolved vibrational modes does not necessarily offer an advantage in terms of power output but can lead to photo-currents with suppressed noise levels characterizing a multi-step ordered transport process. Besides giving insight into the suitability of these complexes for molecular-scale photovoltaics, our work suggests a new possible biological function for the vibrational environment of photosynthetic reaction centres, namely, to reduce the intrinsic current noise for regulatory processes.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Biological functions", "Charge separations", "Charge-separated state", "Microscopic interaction", "Photosynthetic reaction centres", "Photovoltaic devices", "Regulatory process", "Transport process"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85030118600", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"]], "AuthorData": {"57192419514": {"Name": "Stones R.", "AuthorID": "57192419514", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "33067795400": {"Name": "Hossein-Nejad H.", "AuthorID": "33067795400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "6603420246": {"Name": "Olaya-Castro A.", "AuthorID": "6603420246", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "35599806700": {"Name": "Van Grondelle R.", "AuthorID": "35599806700", "AffiliationID": "60008734", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, VU University"}}}
