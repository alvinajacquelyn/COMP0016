During slow-wave sleep, it stands out from other cortical regions by exhibiting persistent activity that outlasts neocortical Up states, decoupling the entorhinal cortex-hippocampal interaction from the neocortex. Here, we compared the mechanisms involved in the maintenance of the Up state in the barrel cortex (BC) and mEC using whole cell recordings in acute mouse brain slices. Bath application of an NMDA receptor antagonist abolished Up states in the BC, and reduced the incidence but not the duration of Up states in the mEC. Conversely, blockade of kainate receptors decreased Up state duration in the mEC, but not in the BC. Voltage clamp recordings demonstrated the presence of a non-NMDA glutamate receptor-mediated slow excitatory postsynaptic current, sensitive to the selective kainate receptor antagonist UBP-302, in layer III neurons of the mEC, which was not observed in the BC. Moreover, we found that kainate receptor-mediated currents assist in recovery back to the Up state membrane potential following a current-induced hyperpolarisation of individual cells in the mEC. Finally, we were able to generate Up state activity in a network model of exponential integrate-and-fire neurons only supported by AMPA and kainate receptor-mediated currents. We propose that synaptic kainate receptors are responsible for the unique properties of mEC Up states.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Barrel cortex", "Kainate receptor", "Medial entorhinal cortex", "NMDA receptor", "Slow oscillation", "Up state"], "IndexKeywords": ["Action Potentials", "Animals", "Entorhinal Cortex", "Female", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Neocortex", "Nerve Net", "Organ Culture Techniques", "Receptors, Kainic Acid", "Receptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84995654908", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"]], "AuthorData": {"57189600076": {"Name": "Digby R.J.", "AuthorID": "57189600076", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physiology Development and Neuroscience, Physiological Laboratory, University of Cambridge"}, "54683424700": {"Name": "Bravo D.S.", "AuthorID": "54683424700", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physiology Development and Neuroscience, Physiological Laboratory, University of Cambridge"}, "7006225727": {"Name": "Paulsen O.", "AuthorID": "7006225727", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physiology Development and Neuroscience, Physiological Laboratory, University of Cambridge"}, "24068893100": {"Name": "Magloire V.", "AuthorID": "24068893100", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Experimental Epilepsy, Institute of Neurology, University of College London"}}}
