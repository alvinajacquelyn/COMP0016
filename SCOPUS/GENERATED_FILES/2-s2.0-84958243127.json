Fluciclatide is an arginine-glycine-aspartic acid peptide with high affinity for \u00e1v\u00e23/\u00e1v\u00e25 integrin, which can be radiolabeled for PET imaging of angiogenesis. Thus, 18F-fluciclatide is a potential biomarker of therapeutic response to antiangiogenic inhibitors. The aim of this study was to evaluate the reproducibility of 18F-fluciclatide in multiple solid-tumor types. Methods: Thirtynine patients underwent PET/CT scanning at 40, 65, and 90 min after injection of 18F-fluciclatide (maximum, 370 MBq) on 2 separate days (2-9 d apart). Patients did not receive any therapy between PET/CT scans. 18F-fluciclatide images were reported and quantitative measures of uptake were extracted using the PERCIST methodology. Intrasubject reproducibility of PET uptake in all measurable lesions was evaluated by calculating relative differences in SUV between PET scans for each lesion during the 2 imaging sessions. Results: Thirty-nine measurable lesions were detected in 26 patients. Lesion uptake correlated strongly across imaging sessions (r 5 0.92, P < 0.05, at 40 min; r 5 0.94, P < 0.05, at 65 min; r 5 0.94, P < 0.05, at 90 min) with a mean relative difference and SD of the relative difference of 0.006 \u00b1 0.18 at 40 min, 0.003 \u00b1 0.19 at 65 min, and 0.025 \u00b1 0.20 at 90 min. This reflects 95% limits of repeatability of 35%-39% for the difference between the 2 SUV measurements or a variability of 18%-20% in agreement from that observed in well-calibrated multicenter 18F-FDG studies. Conclusion: The test-retest reproducibility of 18F-fluciclatide across multiple tumor types has been measured and shown to be acceptable. This is an important step in the development of this in vivo biomarker to identify and quantify response to antiangiogenic therapy in cancer patients.", "AuthorKeywords": ["18F-fluciclatide", "Angiogenesis", "Cancer", "Reproducibility"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Angiogenesis Inhibitors", "Female", "Humans", "Image Processing, Computer-Assisted", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Neoplasms", "Peptides", "Polyethylene Glycols", "Positron-Emission Tomography", "Quality Control", "Radiopharmaceuticals", "Reproducibility of Results"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84958243127", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"56434950800": {"Name": "Sharma R.", "AuthorID": "56434950800", "AffiliationID": "60020416, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Experimental Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London, Hammersmith Hospital"}, "6504671523": {"Name": "Kallur K.G.", "AuthorID": "6504671523", "AffiliationID": "112956221", "AffiliationName": "PETCT and Cyclotron Department, HCG"}, "16424625800": {"Name": "Ryu J.S.", "AuthorID": "16424625800", "AffiliationID": "60068691", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nuclear Medicine, Asan Medical Center"}, "56779764400": {"Name": "Parameswaran R.V.", "AuthorID": "56779764400", "AffiliationID": "60012073", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nuclear Medicine, PET-CT Division, Manipal Hospital"}, "6603454405": {"Name": "Lindman H.", "AuthorID": "6603454405", "AffiliationID": "60015216", "AffiliationName": "Uppsala University Hospital, Department of Oncology"}, "7004216305": {"Name": "Avril N.", "AuthorID": "7004216305", "AffiliationID": "60022109, 60159931", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nuclear Medicine, Barts Health, Queen Mary University of London"}, "34974131200": {"Name": "Gleeson F.V.", "AuthorID": "34974131200", "AffiliationID": "60021328, 60170323", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Churchill Hospital, Oxford Radcliffe Hospitals Trust"}, "57218485243": {"Name": "Lee J.D.", "AuthorID": "57218485243", "AffiliationID": "60094974", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nuclear Medicine, Yonsei University Health System"}, "23567120300": {"Name": "Lee K.H.", "AuthorID": "23567120300", "AffiliationID": "60020857", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nuclear Medicine, Samsung Medical Center"}, "7004886946": {"Name": "O'Doherty M.J.", "AuthorID": "7004886946", "AffiliationID": "60172291, 60177635", "AffiliationName": "PET Imaging Centre, Division of Imaging Sciences and Biomedical Engineering, King's College London"}, "7004435019": {"Name": "Groves A.M.", "AuthorID": "7004435019", "AffiliationID": "60090043, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Nuclear Medicine, University College London"}, "7406531809": {"Name": "Miller M.P.", "AuthorID": "7406531809", "AffiliationID": "60013294, 60106890", "AffiliationName": "GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Imaging R and D"}, "7003846165": {"Name": "Somer E.J.", "AuthorID": "7003846165", "AffiliationID": "60013294, 60106890", "AffiliationName": "GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Imaging R and D"}, "7202546957": {"Name": "Coombes C.R.", "AuthorID": "7202546957", "AffiliationID": "60020416, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery and Cancer, Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London, Hammersmith Hospital"}, "7004143668": {"Name": "Aboagye E.O.", "AuthorID": "7004143668", "AffiliationID": "60020416, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery and Cancer, Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London, Hammersmith Hospital"}}}
