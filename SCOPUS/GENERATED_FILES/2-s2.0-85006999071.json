Methods: 17 patients with MS and 11 healthy controls (HCs) underwent 3 experimental sessions (baseline, real-rTMS, sham-rTMS), all including an N-back task (3 task loads: N1, N2, N3; control condition: N0) inside the MR scanner. Prior to imaging, real-rTMS (10 Hz) was applied to the right DLPFC. The stimulation site was defined based on individually assessed N-back task activation at baseline and located using neuronavigation. Changes in whole brain functional activation and functional connectivity with the right DLPFC were calculated. Results: N-back task accuracy (N2 and N3) improved after real-rTMS (and not after sham-rTMS) compared with baseline (p=0.029 and p=0.015, respectively), only in patients. At baseline, patients with MS, compared with HCs, showed higher task-related frontal activation (left DLPFC, N2>N0), which disappeared after real-rTMS. Task-related (N1>N0) functional connectivity between the right DLPFC and the right caudate nucleus and bilateral (para)cingulate gyrus increased in patients after real-rTMS when compared with sham stimulation. Conclusions: In patients with MS, N-back accuracy improved while frontal hyperactivation (seen at baseline relative to HCs) disappeared after real-rTMS. Together with the changes in functional connectivity after real-rTMS in patients, these findings may represent an rTMS-induced change in network efficiency in patients with MS, shifting patients' brain function towards the healthy situation. This implicates a potentially relevant role for rTMS in cognitive rehabilitation in MS.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Brain Mapping", "Caudate Nucleus", "Female", "Functional Laterality", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Memory, Short-Term", "Multiple Sclerosis", "Neural Pathways", "Neuropsychological Tests", "Prefrontal Cortex", "Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85006999071", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"57214771421": {"Name": "Hulst H.E.", "AuthorID": "57214771421", "AffiliationID": "60008734, 60001997", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anatomy and Neurosciences, Section of Clinical Neuroscience, VUmc MS Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam Neuroscience, VU University Medical Center"}, "26867592500": {"Name": "Goldschmidt T.", "AuthorID": "26867592500", "AffiliationID": "60008734, 60001997", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anatomy and Neurosciences, Section of Clinical Neuroscience, VUmc MS Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam Neuroscience, VU University Medical Center"}, "6603278935": {"Name": "Van Den Heuvel O.A.", "AuthorID": "6603278935", "AffiliationID": "60008734, 60001997", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, Amsterdam Neuroscience, VU University Medical Center"}, "6603160309": {"Name": "Van Der Werf Y.D.", "AuthorID": "6603160309", "AffiliationID": "60008734, 60001997", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anatomy and Neurosciences, Section of Clinical Neuroscience, VUmc MS Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam Neuroscience, VU University Medical Center"}, "26643174700": {"Name": "Geurts J.J.G.", "AuthorID": "26643174700", "AffiliationID": "60008734, 60001997", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anatomy and Neurosciences, Section of Clinical Neuroscience, VUmc MS Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam Neuroscience, VU University Medical Center"}, "57220456239": {"Name": "Nitsche M.A.", "AuthorID": "57220456239", "AffiliationID": "60013088", "AffiliationName": "Department Neurology, University Medical Hospital Bergmannsheil"}, "57201603274": {"Name": "De Wit S.J.", "AuthorID": "57201603274", "AffiliationID": "60008734, 60001997", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, Amsterdam Neuroscience, VU University Medical Center"}, "7102989379": {"Name": "Barkhof F.", "AuthorID": "7102989379", "AffiliationID": "60008734, 60001997", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology and Nuclear Medicine, VUmc MS Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam Neuroscience, VU University Medical Center"}, "35380443100": {"Name": "Paulus W.", "AuthorID": "35380443100", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institutes of Neurology and Healthcare Engineering, UCL"}}}
