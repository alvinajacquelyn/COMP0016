Unexpectedly, SI is reduced in skilled pianists. We tested whether repeated practice of focal contraction in non-pianists could reduce SI. Methods: Motor-evoked potentials were elicited by transcranial magnetic stimulation in the relaxed abductor digiti minimi randomly at the onset and 5 s after offset of a 2 s focal contraction (10% maximum) of the first dorsal interosseous (FDI). Over 5 blocks of 40 trials participants obtained points for increasing contraction speed and stability in FDI. In a final block, the interval between contractions was varied randomly to increase attention to the task. Results: Over the first 5 blocks, SI declined as performance (points scored) improved. In the final \"attention\" block SI increased towards baseline without affecting performance. Conclusions: Although SI may be useful during the early stages of learning, skilled focal finger movement does not require SI to prevent activity in non-involved muscles. This could be due to better targeting of the excitatory command to move. Results from the final block suggest that increased attention can re-engage SI when task parameters change. Significance: SI is not necessary for successful focal contraction, but may contribute during learning and during attention to task.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Attention", "Motor-evoked potentials", "Surround inhibition", "TMS"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Attention", "Evoked Potentials, Motor", "Exercise", "Female", "Hand", "Humans", "Learning", "Male", "Motor Cortex", "Muscle Contraction", "Muscle, Skeletal", "Neural Inhibition", "Psychomotor Performance"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84963571269", "SubjectAreas": [["Sensory Systems", "NEUR", "2809"], ["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Physiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2737"]], "AuthorData": {"57188817838": {"Name": "Akkad H.", "AuthorID": "57188817838", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Sobell Department of Motor Neuroscience and Movement Disorders, Univ.
