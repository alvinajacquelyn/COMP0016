This phase consists of infinite [Cu7P3]- layers with hexagonal P sheets separated by K+ ions. The structure of the layers is unique but related to both Cu3P and the CaCu4P2 structure-types. Single-crystal refinement reveals extensive disorder within the Cu3P-like slabs. KCu7P3 is paramagnetic and exhibits a room temperature resistivity of \u223c335 \u03bc\u03c9 cm with a metal-like temperature dependence. The metallic character is supported by density functional theory electronic structure calculations. Hall and Seebeck effect measurements yield p-type behavior with a hole mobility of \u223c15 cm2 V-1 s-1 at 300 K and a carrier concentration on the order of 1021 cm-3. KCu7P3 is chemically stable in ambient conditions, as well as in aqueous neutral and acidic solutions.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85070924076", "SubjectAreas": [["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"], ["Inorganic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1604"]], "AuthorData": {"55201215900": {"Name": "Rettie A.", "AuthorID": "55201215900", "AffiliationID": "60028609", "AffiliationName": "Materials Science Division, Argonne National Laboratory"}, "36536570900": {"Name": "Bao J.", "AuthorID": "36536570900", "AffiliationID": "60028609", "AffiliationName": "Materials Science Division, Argonne National Laboratory"}, "7401719279": {"Name": "Chung D.", "AuthorID": "7401719279", "AffiliationID": "60028609", "AffiliationName": "Materials Science Division, Argonne National Laboratory"}, "35392448100": {"Name": "Kanatzidis M.", "AuthorID": "35392448100", "AffiliationID": "60007363", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Northwestern University"}, "8633705300": {"Name": "Malliakas C.", "AuthorID": "8633705300", "AffiliationID": "60007363", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Northwestern University"}, "36697632400": {"Name": "Botana A.", "AuthorID": "36697632400", "AffiliationID": "60003892", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Arizona State University"}}}
