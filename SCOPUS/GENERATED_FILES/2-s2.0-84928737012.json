Only the near-wall shear of the oncoming flow affects the local motion past the tiny blip. Slowly evolving features are examined first to allow for variations in the incident flow. Linear and nonlinear solutions show that at certain parameter values (eigenvalues) intensifications occur in which the interactive effect on flow and blip shape is larger by an order of magnitude than at most parameter values. Similar findings apply to the boundary layer with several tiny blips present or to channel flows with blips of almost any length. These intensifications lead on to fully nonlinear unsteady motion as a second stage, after some delay, thus combining with finite-time breakups to form a distinct path into transition of the flow.", "AuthorKeywords": ["drag reduction", "flow-structure interactions", "flow-vessel interactions"], "IndexKeywords": ["Enhanced effects", "Flow-structure interaction", "Flow-vessel interactions", "Fully nonlinear", "High Reynolds number", "Interactive effect", "Non-linear solutions", "Unsteady motion"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84928737012", "SubjectAreas": [["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Mechanics of Materials", "ENGI", "2211"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"]], "AuthorData": {"56611941100": {"Name": "Pruessner L.", "AuthorID": "56611941100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University College London"}, "57203583662": {"Name": "Smith F.", "AuthorID": "57203583662", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University College London"}}}
