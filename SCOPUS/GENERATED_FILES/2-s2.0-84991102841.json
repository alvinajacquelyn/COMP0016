We find that a trough-bridging structure is sufficient to explain adsorption at low coverages. At higher coverages when steric hindrance prevents the phenyl ring lying flat on the surface, the 2+2 cycloaddition structure dominates.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84991102841", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"]], "AuthorData": {"36537756900": {"Name": "O'Donnell K.M.", "AuthorID": "36537756900", "AffiliationID": "60031226", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Astronomy and Medical Radiation Science, Curtin University"}, "10642051300": {"Name": "Hedgeland H.", "AuthorID": "10642051300", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "London Centre for Nanotechnology, University College London"}, "57200626217": {"Name": "Moore G.", "AuthorID": "57200626217", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "56492556400": {"Name": "Suleman A.", "AuthorID": "56492556400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "57191505876": {"Name": "Siegl M.", "AuthorID": "57191505876", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "7006018442": {"Name": "Schofield S.R.", "AuthorID": "7006018442", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "8557150400": {"Name": "Thomsen L.", "AuthorID": "8557150400", "AffiliationID": "60105848", "AffiliationName": "Australian Synchrotron"}, "6602002254": {"Name": "Warschkow O.", "AuthorID": "6602002254", "AffiliationID": "60025709, 60160443", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Quantum Computation and Communication Technology, School of Physics, University of Sydney"}}}
