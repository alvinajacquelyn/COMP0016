{"Title": "Localization of double-strand break repair proteins to viral replication compartments following lytic reactivation of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus", "Year": 2017, "Source": "J. Virol.", "Volume": "91", "Issue": 22, "Art.No": null, "PageStart": null, "PageEnd": null, "CitedBy": 11, "DOI": "10.1128/JVI.00930-17", "Link": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85032306198&origin=inward", "Abstract": "\u00a9 2017 American Society for Microbiology.Double-strand breaks (DSBs) in DNA are recognized by the Ku70/80 heterodimer and the MRE11-RAD50-NBS1 (MRN) complex and result in activation of the DNA-PK and ATM kinases, which play key roles in regulating the cellular DNA damage response (DDR). DNA tumor viruses such as Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) are known to interact extensively with the DDR during the course of their replicative cycles. Here we show that during lytic amplification of KSHV DNA, the Ku70/80 heterodimer and the MRN complex consistently colocalize with viral genomes in replication compartments (RCs), whereas other DSB repair proteins form foci outside RCs. Depletion of MRE11 and abrogation of its exonuclease activity negatively impact viral replication, while in contrast, knockdown of Ku80 and inhibition of the DNA-PK enzyme, which are involved in nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) repair, enhance amplification of viral DNA. Although the recruitment of DSB-sensing proteins to KSHV RCs is a consistent occurrence across multiple cell types, activation of the ATM-CHK2 pathway during viral replication is a cell line-specific event, indicating that recognition of viral DNA by the DDR does not necessarily result in activation of downstream signaling pathways. We have also observed that newly replicated viral DNA is not associated with cellular histones. Since the presence and modification of these DNA-packaging proteins provide a scaffold for docking of multiple DNA repair factors, the absence of histone deposition may allow the virus to evade localization of DSB repair proteins that would otherwise have a detrimental effect on viral replication.", "AuthorKeywords": ["ATM", "DDR", "DNA repair", "DNA-PK", "Herpesvirus", "Kaposi's sarcomaassociated herpesvirus", "Lytic replication", "MRN complex", "NHEJ", "Replication compartments"], "IndexKeywords": ["Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins", "Cell Cycle Proteins", "Checkpoint Kinase 2", "DNA Breaks, Double-Stranded", "DNA Repair Enzymes", "DNA, Viral", "DNA-Binding Proteins", "HEK293 Cells", "Herpesvirus 8, Human", "Humans", "Ku Autoantigen", "Nuclear Proteins", "Sarcoma, Kaposi", "Virus Activation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85032306198", "SubjectAreas": [["Microbiology", "IMMU", "2404"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"], ["Insect Science", "AGRI", "1109"], ["Virology", "IMMU", "2406"]], "AuthorData": {"56681915000": {"Name": "Hollingworth R.", "AuthorID": "56681915000", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cancer and Genomic Sciences, University of Birmingham"}, "55895113500": {"Name": "Horniblow R.", "AuthorID": "55895113500", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cancer and Genomic Sciences, University of Birmingham"}, "57045543400": {"Name": "Forrest C.", "AuthorID": "57045543400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Haematology, University College London"}, "7402287015": {"Name": "Stewart G.", "AuthorID": "7402287015", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cancer and Genomic Sciences, University of Birmingham"}, "24434779300": {"Name": "Grand R.", "AuthorID": "24434779300", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cancer and Genomic Sciences, University of Birmingham"}}}
