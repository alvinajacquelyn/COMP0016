Both simulations predict an increase in dose enhancement in the presence of nanoparticles, but the two methods predict different levels of enhancement over the studied energy, nanoparticle materials, and concentration regime for several reasons. The Monte Carlo simulation calculates energy deposited by electrons and photons, while the analytical one only calculates energy deposited by source photons and photoelectrons; the Monte Carlo simulation accounts for electron\u2013hole recombination, while the analytical one does not; and the Monte Carlo simulation randomly samples photon or electron path and accounts for particle interactions, while the analytical simulation assumes a linear trajectory. This study demonstrates that the Monte Carlo simulation will be a better choice to evaluate dose enhancement with nanoparticles in radiation therapy.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Analytical simulation", "Dose enhancement", "Monte carlo simulation", "Nanoparticle", "Radiation therapy", "Tumor cell", "X-ray"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cell Line, Tumor", "Computer Simulation", "Electrons", "Humans", "Metal Nanoparticles", "Monte Carlo Method", "Nanomedicine", "Neoplasms", "Photons", "Radiotherapy", "X-Rays"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84988892853", "SubjectAreas": [["Biophysics", "BIOC", "1304"], ["Bioengineering", "CENG", "1502"], ["Biomaterials", "MATE", "2502"], ["Pharmaceutical Science", "PHAR", "3003"], ["Drug Discovery", "PHAR", "3002"], ["Organic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1605"]], "AuthorData": {"57191337100": {"Name": "Paro A.D.", "AuthorID": "57191337100", "AffiliationID": "60028628", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, Northeastern University"}, "7101765741": {"Name": "Webster T.J.", "AuthorID": "7101765741", "AffiliationID": "60008073, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "Wenzhou Institute of Biomaterials and Engineering, Chinese Academy of Science, Wenzhou Medical University"}, "7403167084": {"Name": "Su M.", "AuthorID": "7403167084", "AffiliationID": "60008073, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "Wenzhou Institute of Biomaterials and Engineering, Chinese Academy of Science, Wenzhou Medical University"}, "57203734814": {"Name": "Hossain M.", "AuthorID": "57203734814", "AffiliationID": "60022144", "AffiliationName": "NanoScience Technology Center and School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Central Florida"}}}
