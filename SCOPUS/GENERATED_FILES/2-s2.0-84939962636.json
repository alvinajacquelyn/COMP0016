Schwann cells play a vital role in maintaining the peripheral nervous system and in injury and repair. Using immunohistochemistry, Western blot, calcium assay and bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) proliferation assay, the present study clearly demonstrated that P2X7 receptors (R) were expressed in myelinating and non-myelinating Schwann cells in longitudinal sections of sciatic nerves. After sciatic nerve injury (SNI), P2X7R expression in Schwann cells of injured sciatic nerves was significantly up-regulated during the early days of SNI. Double immunofluorescence of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and P2X7R implied that P2X7R may be involved in proliferation of Schwann cells. Further experiments on primary cultures of Schwann cells showed that P2X7R are functionally expressed in Schwann cells of rat sciatic nerves; ATP via P2X7R can promote Schwann cell proliferation, possibly via the MAPK/ERK intracellular signalling pathway. Other possible roles of P2X7R on Schwann cells are discussed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["P2X7 receptor", "Proliferation", "Schwann cell", "Sciatic nerve injury"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Cell Proliferation", "Ganglia, Spinal", "Male", "Nerve Regeneration", "Rats, Sprague-Dawley", "Receptors, Purinergic P2X7", "Schwann Cells", "Sciatic Nerve", "Sciatic Neuropathy", "Up-Regulation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84939962636", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"57215060100": {"Name": "Song X.M.", "AuthorID": "57215060100", "AffiliationID": "60025234", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurobiology, Second Military Medical University"}, "56518387600": {"Name": "Zhu J.", "AuthorID": "56518387600", "AffiliationID": "60025234", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurobiology, Second Military Medical University"}, "7402284736": {"Name": "He C.", "AuthorID": "7402284736", "AffiliationID": "60025234", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurobiology, Second Military Medical University"}, "7102138871": {"Name": "Xiang Z.", "AuthorID": "7102138871", "AffiliationID": "60025234", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurobiology, Second Military Medical University"}, "55706168900": {"Name": "Xu X.H.", "AuthorID": "55706168900", "AffiliationID": "60023813", "AffiliationName": "School of Life Science, Shanghai University"}, "35186966100": {"Name": "Guo Z.", "AuthorID": "35186966100", "AffiliationID": "60069758, 60025234", "AffiliationName": "Department of Dermatology, Changhai Hospital, Second Military Medical University"}, "36037094600": {"Name": "Burnstock G.", "AuthorID": "36037094600", "AffiliationID": "60026553", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics, The University of Melbourne"}, "56071856500": {"Name": "Li J.", "AuthorID": "56071856500", "AffiliationID": "60013516, 60025234", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anesthesiology, Changzheng Hospital, Second Military Medical University"}, "35217025200": {"Name": "Yuan H.", "AuthorID": "35217025200", "AffiliationID": "60013516, 60025234", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anesthesiology, Changzheng Hospital, Second Military Medical University"}}}
