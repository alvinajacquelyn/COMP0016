We investigate the validity of simple questionnaires about sedentary behaviour (SB), (including the widely used proxy television (TV) viewing), and physical activity (PA) in comparison with objective measures. Methods: Community dwelling men aged 71-93 years, from a UK population-based cohort wore a GT3X accelerometer over the right hip for 7 days and self-completed a questionnaire including information about SB (TV, reading, computer use and car use) and PA (leisure and sporting domains). Results: 1566/3137 surviving men (mean age 79 years) attended. 1377 ambulatory men provided questionnaire and accelerometer data. Questionnaires under-estimated mean daily sedentary time; 317 minutes total SB (TV, computer use, reading or driving), 176 minutes (TV) vs 619 minutes (objectively measured). Correlations between objective measures and self-reports were 0.18 (total SB) and 0.17 (TV), both P < 0.001. Objective SB levels were similar across the lowest three quartiles of self-reported SB but raised in the highest quartile. Correlations between steps/day or moderate to vigorous PA with self-reported total PA were both 0.49, P < 0.001 and measured PA levels were progressively higher at higher levels of self-reported PA. Conclusions: Among older men, simple SB questions performed poorly for identifying total SB time, although simple PA questions were associated with a graded increase with objectively measured PA. Future studies of health effects of SB in older men would benefit from objective measures of SB.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Accelerometer", "Cohort study", "Older adults", "Physical activity", "Questionnaire", "Sedentary behaviour"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Automobile Driving", "Cohort Studies", "Computers", "Exercise", "Health Behavior", "Humans", "Leisure Activities", "Male", "Motor Activity", "Sedentary Lifestyle", "Self Report", "Sports", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "Television"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84959368086", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (miscellaneous)", "MEDI", "2701"], ["Physical Therapy, Sports Therapy and Rehabilitation", "HEAL", "3612"], ["Nutrition and Dietetics", "NURS", "2916"]], "AuthorData": {"6507251154": {"Name": "Jefferis B.", "AuthorID": "6507251154", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Physical Activity Research Group, University College London"}, "55811454000": {"Name": "Sartini C.", "AuthorID": "55811454000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Physical Activity Research Group, University College London"}, "56124564300": {"Name": "Ash S.", "AuthorID": "56124564300", "AffiliationID": "60029950, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Department of Primary Care and Population Health, UCL Medical School"}, "6603033975": {"Name": "Lennon L.", "AuthorID": "6603033975", "AffiliationID": "60029950, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Department of Primary Care and Population Health, UCL Medical School"}, "7006543768": {"Name": "Wannamethee S.", "AuthorID": "7006543768", "AffiliationID": "60029950, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Department of Primary Care and Population Health, UCL Medical School"}, "7006237290": {"Name": "Whincup P.", "AuthorID": "7006237290", "AffiliationID": "60029329", "AffiliationName": "Population Health Research Institute, St George's University of London, Cranmer Terrace"}}}
