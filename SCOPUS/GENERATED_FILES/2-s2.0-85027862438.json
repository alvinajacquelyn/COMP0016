I suggest that consideration and assessment of the origins of the concept of the Rule of Law not only matters, but also that it is a practice that is often neglected. Further, I suggest our failure to take account of the origins of the Rule of Law\u2014by continuing to simply innovate around the idea of the contemporary understanding of the concept\u2014limits the concept\u2019s future development and will, potentially, not reflect faithfully the ideas from which our contemporary understanding of the concept is ultimately derived. As a result of this failure, we risk the (unintentional) imposition of a selective approach in the interpretation and application of the concept of the Rule of Law in the future. Increasing our focus on the origins of the Rule of Law will not only illuminate the rationale for and behind the operation of the concept, but it will also expose aspects of the concept that are no longer considered or included\u2014in contemporary conceptions of the idea\u2014and will ensure our future solutions are not curtailed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["History", "Origin", "Path dependence", "Rule of Law"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85027862438", "SubjectAreas": [["Law", "SOCI", "3308"]], "AuthorData": {"57191523722": {"Name": "Burgess P.", "AuthorID": "57191523722", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "University of Edinburgh"}}}
