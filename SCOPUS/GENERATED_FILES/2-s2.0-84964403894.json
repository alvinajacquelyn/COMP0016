An understanding of the structure and related properties of these intriguing liquids has been limited to date. We report the results of a study of molten sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) which combines high energy X-ray diffraction, containerless techniques and computer simulation to provide insight into the liquid structure. Total structure factors (Fx(Q)) are collected on the laser-heated carbonate spheres suspended in flowing gases of varying composition in an aerodynamic levitation furnace. The respective partial structure factor contributions to Fx(Q) are obtained by performing molecular dynamics simulations treating the carbonate anions as flexible entities. The carbonate liquid structure is found to be heavily temperature-dependent. At low temperatures a low-dimensional carbonate chain network forms, at T = 1100 K for example ~55% of the C atoms form part of a chain. The mean chain lengths decrease as temperature is increased and as the chains become shorter the rotation of the carbonate anions becomes more rapid enhancing the diffusion of Na+ ions.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84964403894", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"57205868517": {"Name": "Wilding M.C.", "AuthorID": "57205868517", "AffiliationID": "60030480", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of Bath"}, "35556605200": {"Name": "Wilson M.", "AuthorID": "35556605200", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Physical, Theoretical Chemistry Laboratory, University of Oxford"}, "55340796000": {"Name": "Alderman O.L.G.", "AuthorID": "55340796000", "AffiliationID": "60115290", "AffiliationName": "Materials Development Inc."}, "7003748350": {"Name": "Benmore C.", "AuthorID": "7003748350", "AffiliationID": "60028609", "AffiliationName": "X-ray Science Division, Argonne National Laboratory"}, "35579941200": {"Name": "Weber J.K.R.", "AuthorID": "35579941200", "AffiliationID": "60115290", "AffiliationName": "Materials Development Inc."}, "14056931200": {"Name": "Skinner L.", "AuthorID": "14056931200", "AffiliationID": "60026415", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Stony Brook University"}, "55960880400": {"Name": "Tamalonis A.", "AuthorID": "55960880400", "AffiliationID": "60115290", "AffiliationName": "Materials Development Inc."}, "7103376969": {"Name": "Parise J.B.", "AuthorID": "7103376969", "AffiliationID": "60026415", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Stony Brook University"}}}
