We aimed to identify risk factors for SBP development and mortality to optimize stratification for primary prophylaxis and therapeutic strategies to improve survival. Methods: 575 patients with cirrhosis and ascites undergoing paracentesis at a tertiary care hospital were included in this retrospective cohort study. Demographical, clinical and laboratory parameters were recorded at first paracentesis and during follow-up. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to identify independent predictors of SBP development and mortality. Results: Child-Pugh stage C (OR: 3.323; P = 0.009), ascitic fluid polymorph-nuclear cell (PMN) count (OR: 1.544; P = 0.028) and low serum sodium (OR: 0.917; P = 0.029) emerged as independent risk factors for SBP development. SBP-na\u00efve patients undergoing paracentesis and presenting with PMN-counts \u2265100 cells/\u03bcl, or hyponatraemia <125 mM were at highest risk for developing SBP. Increases in MELD and CRP levels indicated SBP development, while no changes where observed in a matched control group with sterile ascites at multiple paracenteses. MELD score (OR: 1.565; P = 0.001) and CRP (OR: 1.067; P = 0.037) were identified as independent risk factors for 30-day mortality after SBP diagnosis. In particular SBP patients with MELD\u226522, CRP \u22653.5 mg/dl and development of grade III/IV hepatic encephalopathy showed highest mortality. Conclusions: Low serum sodium levels, Child-Pugh stage C and elevated ascites PMN counts (\u2265100 cells/\u03bcl) indicate a significant risk for SBP development. SBP-related mortality is highest in patients with MELD\u226522 and elevated CRP levels.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Ascites", "Cirrhosis", "Development", "Mortality", "Risk factors", "Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Ascites", "Ascitic Fluid", "Austria", "Bacterial Infections", "Female", "Humans", "Kaplan-Meier Estimate", "Liver Cirrhosis", "Logistic Models", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Multivariate Analysis", "Paracentesis", "Peritonitis", "Retrospective Studies", "Risk Factors", "Sodium", "Tertiary Care Centers"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84938954520", "SubjectAreas": [["Hepatology", "MEDI", "2721"]], "AuthorData": {"35485391200": {"Name": "Schwabl P.", "AuthorID": "35485391200", "AffiliationID": "60011394", "AffiliationName": "Vienna Hepatic Hemodynamic Laboratory, Medical University of Vienna"}, "56176028800": {"Name": "Bucsics T.", "AuthorID": "56176028800", "AffiliationID": "60011394", "AffiliationName": "Vienna Hepatic Hemodynamic Laboratory, Medical University of Vienna"}, "56528035300": {"Name": "Soucek K.", "AuthorID": "56528035300", "AffiliationID": "60011394", "AffiliationName": "Vienna Hepatic Hemodynamic Laboratory, Medical University of Vienna"}, "55369068500": {"Name": "Mandorfer M.", "AuthorID": "55369068500", "AffiliationID": "60011394", "AffiliationName": "Vienna Hepatic Hemodynamic Laboratory, Medical University of Vienna"}, "36344590600": {"Name": "Bota S.", "AuthorID": "36344590600", "AffiliationID": "60011394", "AffiliationName": "Vienna Hepatic Hemodynamic Laboratory, Medical University of Vienna"}, "6603727095": {"Name": "Ferlitsch A.", "AuthorID": "6603727095", "AffiliationID": "60011394", "AffiliationName": "Vienna Hepatic Hemodynamic Laboratory, Medical University of Vienna"}, "7006061605": {"Name": "Trauner M.", "AuthorID": "7006061605", "AffiliationID": "60011394", "AffiliationName": "Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Department of Internal Medicine III, Medical University of Vienna"}, "7004157033": {"Name": "Peck-Radosavljevic M.", "AuthorID": "7004157033", "AffiliationID": "60011394", "AffiliationName": "Vienna Hepatic Hemodynamic Laboratory, Medical University of Vienna"}, "24315181000": {"Name": "Reiberger T.", "AuthorID": "24315181000", "AffiliationID": "60011394", "AffiliationName": "Vienna Hepatic Hemodynamic Laboratory, Medical University of Vienna"}, "56031015200": {"Name": "Blacky A.", "AuthorID": "56031015200", "AffiliationID": "60011394", "AffiliationName": "Division of Microbiology, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Medical University of Vienna"}, "7006321493": {"Name": "Hirschl A.", "AuthorID": "7006321493", "AffiliationID": "60011394", "AffiliationName": "Division of Microbiology, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Medical University of Vienna"}}}
