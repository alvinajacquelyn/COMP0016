Comparisons with other early Epi-Palaeolithic and Neolithic sites indicate that the Dhra\u2018 grains are larger than recorded wild specimens, but fall at the lower range of domestic species, consistent with intermediary pre-domestication cultivation status. We contextualize these results in relation to associated evidence for food storage at Dhra\u2018, as well as the ecology of wild plants and early crops, and processing technologies across the Levant.", "AuthorKeywords": ["cultivation", "food storage", "Pre-Pottery Neolithic", "production intensification", "southern Levant"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85041108439", "SubjectAreas": [["Archeology (arts and humanities)", "ARTS", "1204"], ["History", "ARTS", "1202"], ["Archeology", "SOCI", "3302"]], "AuthorData": {"6506782318": {"Name": "Colledge S.", "AuthorID": "6506782318", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Archaeology"}, "6506400813": {"Name": "Conolly J.", "AuthorID": "6506400813", "AffiliationID": "60031024", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anthropology, Trent University"}, "23969909400": {"Name": "Finlayson B.", "AuthorID": "23969909400", "AffiliationID": "60012197", "AffiliationName": "Department of Archaeology, University of Reading"}, "6506354646": {"Name": "Kuijt I.", "AuthorID": "6506354646", "AffiliationID": "60021508", "AffiliationName": "University of Notre Dame"}}}
