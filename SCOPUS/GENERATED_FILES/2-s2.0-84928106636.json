Neighborhood perceptions were assessed at baseline (2006/2007) and three measures of well-being - hedonic, eudaimonic and evaluative - were assessed at baseline and follow-up (2010/2011) for 6134 participants. In cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses, negative neighborhood perceptions were associated with poorer well-being on all three measures. These associations remained significant after adjusting for a range of sociodemographic and health status variables and depressive symptoms.", "AuthorKeywords": ["English longitudinal study of ageing", "Life satisfaction", "Neighborhood", "Older adults", "Well-being"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aging", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Depression", "Female", "Health Status", "Humans", "Longitudinal Studies", "Male", "Mental Health", "Middle Aged", "Personal Satisfaction", "Residence Characteristics"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84928106636", "SubjectAreas": [["Health (social science)", "SOCI", "3306"], ["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"], ["Life-span and Life-course Studies", "SOCI", "3319"]], "AuthorData": {"56600077900": {"Name": "Toma A.", "AuthorID": "56600077900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, UCL"}, "8502496600": {"Name": "Hamer M.", "AuthorID": "8502496600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, UCL"}, "16029356900": {"Name": "Shankar A.", "AuthorID": "16029356900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, UCL"}}}
