Here, we provide a mechanistic explanation of these effects using MEG data acquired from healthy human volunteers (N = 13, 7 female). In a source-level analysis of induced responses, we established the effects of orthogonal predictability manipulations of rapid tone-pip sequences (namely, sequence regularity and alphabet size) along the auditory processing stream. In auditory cortex, regular sequences with smaller alphabets induced greater gamma activity. Furthermore, sequence regularity shifted induced activity in frontal regions toward higher frequencies. To model these effects in terms of the underlying neurophysiology, we used dynamic causal modeling for cross-spectral density and estimated slow fluctuations in neural (postsynaptic) gain. Using the model-based parameters, we accurately explain the sensor-level sustained field amplitude, demonstrating that slow changes in synaptic efficacy, combined with sustained sensory input, can result in profound and sustained effects on neural responses to predictable sensory streams.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Auditory processing", "Dynamic causal modeling", "Gain modulation", "Magnetoencephalography", "Neural oscillations", "Predictive coding"], "IndexKeywords": ["Acoustic Stimulation", "Adult", "Anticipation, Psychological", "Attention", "Auditory Cortex", "Auditory Pathways", "Auditory Perception", "Female", "Humans", "Long-Term Potentiation", "Male", "Synaptic Transmission"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85024113163", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"]], "AuthorData": {"37761031800": {"Name": "Auksztulewicz R.", "AuthorID": "37761031800", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60084279", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, UCL"}, "35476748000": {"Name": "Nobre A.C.", "AuthorID": "35476748000", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Oxford Centre for Human Brain Activity, University of Oxford"}, "22979049400": {"Name": "Cooray G.", "AuthorID": "22979049400", "AffiliationID": "60019295", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Neuroscience, Karolinska University Hospital"}, "36080215500": {"Name": "Friston K.", "AuthorID": "36080215500", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60084279", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, UCL"}, "56024555900": {"Name": "Barascud N.", "AuthorID": "56024555900", "AffiliationID": "60105775, 60000179, 60008134, 60108665, 60025070", "AffiliationName": "LSCP, D\u00e9partement d\u2019Etudes Cognitives, ENS, EHESS, CNRS, PSL Research University"}, "8953499500": {"Name": "Chait M.", "AuthorID": "8953499500", "AffiliationID": "60011326, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Ear Institute, University College London"}}}
