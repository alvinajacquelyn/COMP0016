Methods: A systematised review protocol was used to conduct a comprehensive search of the qualitative speech pathology literature within five electronic databases (CINAHL, MEDLINE, PubMed, PsycIFNO, SCOPUS) using key words related to engagement (e.g., family-professional partnerships, involvement, participation). Thematic synthesis was used to analyse the data. Results: A total of 6935 unique papers were retrieved. Of these, 28 peer-reviewed articles satisfied the inclusion criteria. The following themes were identified: 1) engagement is both a state and a process; 2) parents are supported to engage with intervention when they build trusting relationships with speech-language pathologists; 3) parents are supported to engage with intervention when open, two-way communication is established; and 4) parents are supported to engage in intervention when speech-language pathologists work together with them in sessions. Conclusions: Engagement in early speech pathology intervention is a complex, multifaceted state where parents are ready and empowered to take an active role in their child\u2019s intervention, both inside and outside intervention sessions. All parents have different journeys towards engagement, but many parents need time and support from speech-language pathologists to \u201cbecome engaged\u201d in early speech pathology intervention.Implications for rehabilitation Based on this review, engagement in early speech pathology intervention can be described as a complex, multifaceted state where parents are ready and empowered to take an active role in their child\u2019s intervention, both inside and outside speech pathology sessions. While all parents have different journeys towards engagement, most parents \u201cbecome engaged\u201d in early speech pathology intervention over time when supported to do so by their speech-language pathologist. Speech-language pathologists can support parents to become engaged in early speech pathology intervention by building a trusting relationship; establishing open, two-way communication; and working together with them in intervention sessions.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Early intervention", "engagement", "family-centred care", "speech-language pathology"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85061050926", "SubjectAreas": [["Rehabilitation", "MEDI", "2742"]], "AuthorData": {"57205669338": {"Name": "Melvin K.", "AuthorID": "57205669338", "AffiliationID": "60031004", "AffiliationName": "Communication Disability Centre, School of Health and Rehabilitation Sciences, The University of Queensland"}, "26027432100": {"Name": "Meyer C.", "AuthorID": "26027432100", "AffiliationID": "60031004", "AffiliationName": "Communication Disability Centre, School of Health and Rehabilitation Sciences, The University of Queensland"}, "13608802400": {"Name": "Scarinci N.", "AuthorID": "13608802400", "AffiliationID": "60031004", "AffiliationName": "Communication Disability Centre, School of Health and Rehabilitation Sciences, The University of Queensland"}}}
