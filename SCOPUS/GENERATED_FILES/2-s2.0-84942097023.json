All rights reserved.This chapter defines politics in relation to disaster risk reduction and resilience. It considers the political organization of society in the context of the architecture and effectiveness of emergency management systems. Ethical questions are dealt with in relation to denial of human rights, corruption, lack of regulation, and use of relief funds for \"buying\" votes. It is concluded that the ethical framework within which politics are conducted has a strong bearing on the ability to manage disaster risk. The political roots of strategies to improve resilience are examined, and the widespread lack of concern for women's issues is marked as one of the most serious political failings that need to be addressed. Global political processes of disaster reduction are surveyed critically, and finally trends and future prospects are assessed. One of these is the increasing use of the term governance to denote political processes that require transparency and a participatory approach. In this sense, we may be seeing the beginnings of a swing away from total reliance on representative democracy to a resurgence of the participatory kind.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Democracy", "Devolution", "Disaster", "Human rights", "Nationalism", "Politics"], "IndexKeywords": ["Democracy", "Devolution", "Human rights", "Nationalism", "Politics"], "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84942097023", "SubjectAreas": [["Earth and Planetary Sciences (all)", "EART", "1900"]], "AuthorData": {"7402830661": {"Name": "Alexander D.", "AuthorID": "7402830661", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Risk and Disaster Reduction (IRDR), University College London"}}}
