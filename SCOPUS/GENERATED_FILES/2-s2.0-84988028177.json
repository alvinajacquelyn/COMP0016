The etiology, biology, and growth pattern of mesothelioma present unique challenges for each modality used to capture various aspects of this disease. Clinical implementation of imaging techniques and information derived from images continue to evolve based on active research in this field worldwide. This paper summarizes the imaging-based research presented orally at the 2016 International Conference of the International Mesothelioma Interest Group (iMig) in Birmingham, United Kingdom, held May 1\u20134, 2016. Presented topics included intraoperative near-infrared imaging of mesothelioma to aid the assessment of resection completeness, an evaluation of tumor enhancement improvement with increased time delay between contrast injection and image acquisition in standard clinical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, the potential of early contrast enhancement analysis to provide MRI with a role in mesothelioma detection, the differentiation of short- and long-term survivors based on MRI tumor volume and histogram analysis, the response-assessment potential of hemodynamic parameters derived from dynamic contrast-enhanced computed tomography (DCE-CT) scans, the correlation of CT-based tumor volume with post-surgical tumor specimen weight, and consideration of the need to update the mesothelioma tumor response assessment paradigm.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Dynamic contrast-enhanced CT", "Modified RECIST", "Near-infrared imaging", "Perfusion MRI", "Tumor response assessment", "Tumor volume"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Congresses as Topic", "Humans", "Lung Neoplasms", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Mesothelioma", "Middle Aged", "Neoplasm Staging", "Pleural Neoplasms", "Radionuclide Imaging", "Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors", "Spectroscopy, Near-Infrared", "Tomography, Emission-Computed", "Tumor Burden", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84988028177", "SubjectAreas": [["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine", "MEDI", "2740"], ["Cancer Research", "BIOC", "1306"]], "AuthorData": {"7003375808": {"Name": "Armato S.G.", "AuthorID": "7003375808", "AffiliationID": "60029278", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, The University of Chicago"}, "57191229193": {"Name": "Gudmundsson E.", "AuthorID": "57191229193", "AffiliationID": "60029278", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, The University of Chicago"}, "8921989700": {"Name": "Blyth K.G.", "AuthorID": "8921989700", "AffiliationID": "60117212, 60001490", "AffiliationName": "Department of Respiratory Medicine, Queen Elizabeth University Hospital, Glasgow, UK and Institute of Infection, Immunity & Inflammation, University of Glasgow"}, "37099187800": {"Name": "Tsim S.", "AuthorID": "37099187800", "AffiliationID": "60117212, 60001490", "AffiliationName": "Department of Respiratory Medicine, Queen Elizabeth University Hospital, Glasgow, UK and Institute of Infection, Immunity & Inflammation, University of Glasgow"}, "56577466000": {"Name": "Keating J.J.", "AuthorID": "56577466000", "AffiliationID": "60023009, 60006297", "AffiliationName": "Center for Precision Surgery, Abramson Cancer Center, University of Pennsylvania Pearlman School of Medicine"}, "13613459000": {"Name": "Katz S.", "AuthorID": "13613459000", "AffiliationID": "60003711", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine"}, "7004415673": {"Name": "Coolen J.", "AuthorID": "7004415673", "AffiliationID": "60031069", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, University Hospitals Leuven"}, "6602911064": {"Name": "Opitz I.", "AuthorID": "6602911064", "AffiliationID": "60019619", "AffiliationName": "Division of Thoracic Surgery, University Hospital Zurich"}, "7201664962": {"Name": "Nowak A.K.", "AuthorID": "7201664962", "AffiliationID": "60087991, 60025898, 60031806", "AffiliationName": "School of Medicine and Pharmacology and National Centre for Asbestos Related Diseases, University of Western Australia, Western Australia and Department of Medical Oncology, Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital"}}}
