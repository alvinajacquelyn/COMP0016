Achieving local stakeholder participation in ways that lead to the expected benefits is burdened by challenges and difficulties. By drawing on examples of practices of local stakeholder participation in FRM in two European countries, the United Kingdom and Germany, this paper aims to understand the extent to which local stakeholders are able to influence FRM. Empirically, the paper focuses on flood defence planning and implementation-related decisions as they still remain the dominant approach of managing flood risks in those locations. The findings from the two case studies show that involvement of local stakeholders in decisions related to flood defence schemes is limited and likely to lead to conflict and frustration as well as, potentially, a strengthening of inequalities. These lessons have implications for the United Kingdom and Germany as well as for other locations around the world.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Flood defence", "participatory processes", "public engagement", "risk governance"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85019760292", "SubjectAreas": [["Environmental Engineering", "ENVI", "2305"], ["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"], ["Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality", "ENGI", "2213"], ["Water Science and Technology", "ENVI", "2312"]], "AuthorData": {"53163334900": {"Name": "Begg C.", "AuthorID": "53163334900", "AffiliationID": "60117630, 60023643", "AffiliationName": "Lancaster Environment Centre, Library Avenue, Lancaster University"}, "56700327300": {"Name": "Callsen I.", "AuthorID": "56700327300", "AffiliationID": "60018229", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urban and Environmental Sociology, Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research GmbH\u2013UFZ"}, "12787469400": {"Name": "Kuhlicke C.", "AuthorID": "12787469400", "AffiliationID": "60018229", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urban and Environmental Sociology, Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research GmbH\u2013UFZ"}, "23390064600": {"Name": "Kelman I.", "AuthorID": "23390064600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Risk and Disaster Reduction and Institute for Global Health, University College London"}}}
