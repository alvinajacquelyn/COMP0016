We hypothesized that IUGR cases with abnormal UAD but normal UtAD has a different spectrum of placental pathology compared with those with abnormal UtAD. Study Design Retrospective review of pregnancies with sonographic evidence of IUGR and abnormal UAD prior to delivery. Cases with \u2265 1 UtAD record(s) after 18+0 weeks' gestation and placental pathology were included. Cases were stratified according to initial UtAD pulsatility index (PI) values (n = 196): normal (n = 19; PI < 95th centile for gestational age/no notching), intermediate (n = 69; PI \u2265 95th centile/no/unilateral notching) and abnormal (n = 108; PI \u2265 95th centile/bilateral notching). Pregnancy outcomes and placental pathology were compared between groups. Results Women in the normal group delivered later than those in the abnormal group (30.1 \u00b1 3.5 vs. 28.0 \u00b1 3.5 weeks; mean \u00b1 standard deviation; p = 0.03). Their placentas exhibited higher rates of chronic intervillositis (15.8 vs. 0.9%; p = 0.01), chorangiosis (15.8 vs. 0.9%; p < 0.0001), and massive perivillous fibrin deposition (21.1 vs. 7.4%; p = 0.05), but had lower rates of uteroplacental vascular insufficiency (26.3 vs. 79.6%; p < 0.0001). Conclusion Approximately 10% of pregnancies with early-onset IUGR and abnormal UAD exhibited normal UtAD waveforms. They delivered later, and their placentas exhibited unusual placental pathologies.", "AuthorKeywords": ["early-onset IUGR", "placental pathology", "umbilical artery Doppler", "uterine artery Doppler"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Birth Weight", "Female", "Fetal Death", "Fetal Growth Retardation", "Gestational Age", "Humans", "Male", "Placenta", "Placenta Diseases", "Placental Circulation", "Pregnancy", "Pregnancy Outcome", "Retrospective Studies", "Ultrasonography, Doppler", "Ultrasonography, Prenatal", "Umbilical Arteries", "Uterine Artery"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84988418447", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Obstetrics and Gynecology", "MEDI", "2729"]], "AuthorData": {"42961994000": {"Name": "Levytska K.", "AuthorID": "42961994000", "AffiliationID": "60006894", "AffiliationName": "Division of Maternal-Fetal Medicine, Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Mount Sinai Hospital"}, "23566616100": {"Name": "Higgins M.", "AuthorID": "23566616100", "AffiliationID": "60006894", "AffiliationName": "Division of Maternal-Fetal Medicine, Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Mount Sinai Hospital"}, "57192121263": {"Name": "Walker M.", "AuthorID": "57192121263", "AffiliationID": "60006894", "AffiliationName": "Division of Maternal-Fetal Medicine, Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Mount Sinai Hospital"}, "7004475800": {"Name": "Kingdom J.C.P.", "AuthorID": "7004475800", "AffiliationID": "60006894", "AffiliationName": "Mount Sinai Hospital"}, "35600808100": {"Name": "Keating S.", "AuthorID": "35600808100", "AffiliationID": "60006894", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Mount Sinai Hospital"}, "22951447600": {"Name": "Melamed N.", "AuthorID": "22951447600", "AffiliationID": "60016849, 60029150", "AffiliationName": "Division of Maternal-Fetal Medicine, Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, University of Toronto"}, "7004794073": {"Name": "Sebire N.J.", "AuthorID": "7004794073", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148, 60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Histopathology, Institute of Child Health, Great Ormond Street Hospital, University College London"}}}
