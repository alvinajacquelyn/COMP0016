Methods: Five meta-analyses were conducted on data from papers identified in a systematic review. Studies were grouped according to outcomes (dementia, cognitive impairment including amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment (aMCI), Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), and cognitive decline) and output (risk (RR), odds (OR), or hazard ratios (HR)). Results: Nineteen studies met our inclusion criteria and quality assessments. Four of five meta-analyses showed significant associations between participation in cognitive leisure activities and reduced risk of cognitive impairment (OR = 0.69, 95% CI: 0.56-0.85) and dementia (HR = 0.58, 95% CI: 0.46-0.74; RR = 0.61, 95% CI: 0.42-0.90; OR = 0.78, 95% CI: 0.67-0.90). However, one pooled analysis of cognitive impairment studies did not reach significance (HR = 0.85, 95% CI: 0.71-1.02). Mentally stimulating leisure activities were significantly associated with later life cognition (\u03b2 = 0.11, p = 0.05), better memory (\u03b2 = 0.20, 95% CI: 0.11-0.29), speed of processing (\u03b2 = 0.37, 95% CI: 0.29-0.45), and executive functioning (\u03b2 = 0.23, 95% CI: 0.15-0.29), and less decline in overall cognition (\u03b2 = -0.23, p < 0.01), language (\u03b2 = -0.11, p < 0.05), and executive functioning (\u03b2 = -0.13, p < 0.05). Activities were also shown to reduce rate of cognitive decline (estimate = 0.03, SE = 0.01, p = 0.00). Conclusions: There is increasing evidence that participation in cognitively stimulating leisure activities may contribute to a reduction of risk of dementia and cognitive impairment in later life. Promoting involvement in such activities across lifespan could be an important focus for primary prevention strategies for governments and health services.", "AuthorKeywords": ["cognitive activity", "cognitive impairment", "cognitive reserve", "dementia", "leisure activities", "risk factors"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cognition", "Dementia", "Humans", "Leisure Activities", "Life Style", "Quality of Life", "Risk Factors", "Risk Reduction Behavior"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84981291139", "SubjectAreas": [["Clinical Psychology", "PSYC", "3203"], ["Gerontology", "NURS", "2909"], ["Geriatrics and Gerontology", "MEDI", "2717"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"8664530600": {"Name": "Yates L.A.", "AuthorID": "8664530600", "AffiliationID": "60015138, 60172395", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Mental Health, University of Nottingham"}, "7006161600": {"Name": "Orrell M.", "AuthorID": "7006161600", "AffiliationID": "60015138, 60172395", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Mental Health, University of Nottingham"}, "57190575435": {"Name": "Ziser S.", "AuthorID": "57190575435", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "School of Medicine, University College London (UCL)"}, "7203039292": {"Name": "Spector A.", "AuthorID": "7203039292", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London (UCL)"}}}
