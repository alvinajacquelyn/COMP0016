This data set complements and enhances our recent study on functional and regulatory aspects of energy metabolism by providing additional proteins that are involved in respiration. Most proteins identified in this mutant screen have not been implicated in respiration in budding yeast. We also provide a protocol to generate a prototrophic mutant library, and data on technical and biological reproducibility of colony-based high-throughput screens.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Energy metabolism", "Fermentation", "Fission yeast", "Functional profiling", "Glycerol", "Mitochondria", "Mutant screen", "Respiration"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85041085756", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (miscellaneous)", "MEDI", "2701"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"6603788294": {"Name": "B\u00e4hler J.", "AuthorID": "6603788294", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Genetics, Evolution and Environment and Institute of Healthy Ageing, University College London"}, "12791327300": {"Name": "Malecki M.", "AuthorID": "12791327300", "AffiliationID": "60013756", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genetics and Biotechnology, Faculty of Biology, University of Warsaw"}}}
