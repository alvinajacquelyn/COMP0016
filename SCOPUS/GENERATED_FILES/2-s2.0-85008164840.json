By including a work system whose energy is allowed to fluctuate, we derive a set of equalities that all thermodynamical transitions have to satisfy. This extends the condition for maps to be Gibbs preserving to the case of fluctuating work, providing a more general characterization of maps commonly used in the information theoretic approach to thermodynamics. For final states, block diagonal in the energy basis, this set of equalities is a necessary and sufficient condition for a thermodynamical state transition to be possible. The conditions serve as a parent equation that can be used to derive a number of results. These include writing the second law of thermodynamics as an equality featuring a fine-grained notion of the free energy. It also yields a generalization of the Jarzynski fluctuation theorem which holds for arbitrary initial states, and under the most general manipulations allowed by the laws of quantum mechanics. Furthermore, we show that each of these relations can be seen as the quasiclassical limit of three fully quantum identities. This allows us to consider the free energy as an operator, and allows one to obtain more general and fully quantum fluctuation relations from the information theoretic approach to quantum thermodynamics.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Quantum Information", "Quantum Physics", "Statistical Physics"], "IndexKeywords": ["Fluctuation relations", "Information-theoretic approach", "Quantum Information", "Quantum physics", "Quantum thermodynamics", "Quasiclassical limits", "Second Law of Thermodynamics", "Statistical physics"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85008164840", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"56104744100": {"Name": "Alhambra \u00e1.M.", "AuthorID": "56104744100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "12809144900": {"Name": "Masanes L.", "AuthorID": "12809144900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "7102137778": {"Name": "Oppenheim J.", "AuthorID": "7102137778", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "56102945500": {"Name": "Perry C.", "AuthorID": "56102945500", "AffiliationID": "60030840", "AffiliationName": "QMATH, Department of Mathematical Sciences, University of Copenhagen"}}}
