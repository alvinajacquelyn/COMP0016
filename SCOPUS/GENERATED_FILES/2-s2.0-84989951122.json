Gibbons are typically detected by their daily song through passive listening surveys, but lone gibbon individuals and low-density populations are less likely to sing, making detection difficult or impossible using standard survey techniques. Call playback represents an alternative potential method for detecting gibbon presence, but there has been no empirical evaluation of the usefulness of this method in the field. We investigated the efficacy of call playback as a survey method for detecting previously unconfirmed or unknown individuals of the Critically Endangered Hainan gibbon (Nomascus hainanus), the world\u2019s rarest primate, in patches of good-quality forest outside the current home ranges of the three known Hainan gibbon social groups in Bawangling National Nature Reserve, Hainan, China. Call playback led to detection of a male-only call likely to have been made by a solitary male, and a previously unknown social group comprising an adult male, adult female, and an infant, increasing the number of known breeding females in the global Hainan gibbon population from five to six. Call playback therefore represents an effective tool for improved monitoring of Hainan gibbons, as well as other gibbon populations; however, it is a moderately disruptive survey technique, and should be employed sparingly, in key locations, and for short periods of time only when attempting to detect gibbon presence.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Critically Endangered", "Gibbon", "Nomascus hainanus", "Population monitoring", "Social group", "Survey methods"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84989951122", "SubjectAreas": [["Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics", "AGRI", "1105"], ["Animal Science and Zoology", "AGRI", "1103"]], "AuthorData": {"26530556100": {"Name": "Bryant J.", "AuthorID": "26530556100", "AffiliationID": "60005453, 60009498", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Zoology, Zoological Society of London"}, "57145810900": {"Name": "Wong M.", "AuthorID": "57145810900", "AffiliationID": "60005453, 60009498", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Zoology, Zoological Society of London"}, "57191410179": {"Name": "Jeffree T.", "AuthorID": "57191410179", "AffiliationID": "60005453, 60009498", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Zoology, Zoological Society of London"}, "8608216100": {"Name": "Turvey S.", "AuthorID": "8608216100", "AffiliationID": "60005453, 60009498", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Zoology, Zoological Society of London"}, "6508050864": {"Name": "Brul\u00e9 A.", "AuthorID": "6508050864", "AffiliationID": "117467655", "AffiliationName": "Project Kalaweit, Palangka Raya, Central Kalimantan"}, "57206833028": {"Name": "Hong X.", "AuthorID": "57206833028", "AffiliationID": "117468094", "AffiliationName": "Bawangling National Nature Reserve Management Office, Changjiang Lizu Autonomous County"}, "57191408667": {"Name": "Zhou Z.", "AuthorID": "57191408667", "AffiliationID": "117468094", "AffiliationName": "Bawangling National Nature Reserve Management Office, Changjiang Lizu Autonomous County"}, "57191406890": {"Name": "Han W.", "AuthorID": "57191406890", "AffiliationID": "117468094", "AffiliationName": "Bawangling National Nature Reserve Management Office, Changjiang Lizu Autonomous County"}}}
