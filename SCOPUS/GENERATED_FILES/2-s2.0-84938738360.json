This manuscript reviews the history of neurostimulation of the GI tract with emphasis on current methods of stimulation. Materials and Methods A review was completed of the current research on GI neurostimulation methods with an emphasis on their clinical applications. Results Upper GI disorders can be modulated with both temporary (placed endoscopically or surgically) or permanent (placed surgically) gastric electrical stimulation (GES) devices. The current GI neurostimulation of stomach (GES) devices have been used in both children and adults, and some patients have been followed in excess of 15 years with good long-term results. Similar GES devices also have been used for a variety of lower GI disorders, including constipation and fecal incontinence, for a number of years. Conclusions GI neurostimulation, as a type of neuromodulation, has been demonstrated to function at several locations in the GI tract for a variety of disorders. The future of neurostimulation in the GI tract will likely be influenced by a better understanding of pathophysiology as well as the development of new techniques and devices for neuromodulation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Gastric electrical stimulation", "gastroparesis", "nausea and vomiting", "neuromodulation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Electric Stimulation Therapy", "Gastrointestinal Diseases", "Gastrointestinal Tract", "Humans"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84938738360", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine", "MEDI", "2703"]], "AuthorData": {"35429978500": {"Name": "Abell T.L.", "AuthorID": "35429978500", "AffiliationID": "60020633", "AffiliationName": "Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition, University of Louisville"}, "8085734000": {"Name": "Chen J.", "AuthorID": "8085734000", "AffiliationID": "113552456", "AffiliationName": "Ningbo Pace Translational Medical Research Center"}, "7003781894": {"Name": "Emmanuel A.", "AuthorID": "7003781894", "AffiliationID": "60020736", "AffiliationName": "National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "6603561834": {"Name": "Jolley C.", "AuthorID": "6603561834", "AffiliationID": "60013959", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatrics, Division of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Heptatology and Nutrition, University of Florida"}, "7003628003": {"Name": "Sarela A.I.", "AuthorID": "7003628003", "AffiliationID": "60020454, 60023959", "AffiliationName": "Department of Upper Gastrointestinal Surgery, St. James's University Hospital, University of Leeds School of Medicine"}, "7801453693": {"Name": "T\u00f6rnblom H.", "AuthorID": "7801453693", "AffiliationID": "60027675, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Department of Internal Medicine, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg"}}}
