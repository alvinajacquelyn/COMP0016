The authors developed a multidimensional trans-diagnostic predictive model of functional outcome in patients with the recent-onset of a psychiatric illness. Baseline clinical, psychosis-risk status, cognitive, neurological-soft-signs measures, and dopamine-related-gene polymorphisms (DRD1-rs4532, COMT-rs165599, and DRD4-rs1800955) were collected in 138 young non-psychotic outpatients. 116 individuals underwent follow-up (mean = 2.2 years, SD = 0.9) examination. A binary logistic model was used to predict low-functioning status at follow-up as defined by a score lower than 65 in the social occupational functioning assessment scale. A total of 54% of patients experiences low functioning at follow-up. Attention, Avolition, and Motor-Coordination subscale were significant predictors of low-functioning with an accuracy of 79.7%. A non-significant trend was found for a dopamine-related-gene polymorphism (DRD1-rs4532). The model was independent of psychotic-risk status, DSM-diagnosis, and psychotic conversion. A trans-diagnostic approach taking into account specific neurocognitive, clinical, and neurological information has the potential to identify those individuals with low-functioning independent of DSM diagnosis or the level of psychosis-risk. Specific early interventions targeting modifiable risk factors and emphasize functional recovery in young psychiatric samples, independent of DSM-diagnosis and psychosis-risk, are essential.", "AuthorKeywords": ["CAARMS", "Functioning", "Genetics", "Neurocognition", "Neurological soft signs", "Ultra high risk"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Catechol O-Methyltransferase", "Cognition Disorders", "Female", "Humans", "Logistic Models", "Longitudinal Studies", "Male", "Mental Disorders", "Neuropsychological Tests", "Psychiatric Status Rating Scales", "Receptors, Dopamine D1", "Retrospective Studies", "Risk Factors", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85009347619", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"], ["Biological Psychiatry", "NEUR", "2803"]], "AuthorData": {"50561834000": {"Name": "Minichino A.", "AuthorID": "50561834000", "AffiliationID": "60121686, 60030612", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, UCSD"}, "55404455500": {"Name": "Francesconi M.", "AuthorID": "55404455500", "AffiliationID": "60121686, 60030612", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, UCSD"}, "7005127267": {"Name": "Biondi M.", "AuthorID": "7005127267", "AffiliationID": "60032350", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology and Psychiatry, Sapienza University of Rome"}, "7003657064": {"Name": "Delle Chiaie R.", "AuthorID": "7003657064", "AffiliationID": "60032350", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology and Psychiatry, Sapienza University of Rome"}, "6701917723": {"Name": "Cadenhead K.", "AuthorID": "6701917723", "AffiliationID": "60121686, 60030612", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, UCSD"}, "55391052300": {"Name": "Carri\u00f3n R.E.", "AuthorID": "55391052300", "AffiliationID": "60020942", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, Zucker Hillside Hospital"}, "7005903823": {"Name": "Bevilacqua A.", "AuthorID": "7005903823", "AffiliationID": "60032350", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Section of Neuroscience, Sapienza University of Rome"}, "57191747058": {"Name": "Parisi M.", "AuthorID": "57191747058", "AffiliationID": "120458473", "AffiliationName": "Villa Armonia Nuova"}, "6603636389": {"Name": "Rullo S.", "AuthorID": "6603636389", "AffiliationID": "107323251", "AffiliationName": "Casa di Cura Villa Letizia"}, "57075809800": {"Name": "Ando A.", "AuthorID": "57075809800", "AffiliationID": "60012259", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, University of Turin"}}}
