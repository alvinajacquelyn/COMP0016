This study examined the longitudinal directional associations between conduct problems and expressive language ability. Children enrolled in the UK Millennium Cohort Study (N = 14, 004; 50.3 % boys) were assessed at 3 and 5 years of age. Parent reports of conduct problems and standardised assessments of expressive language were analyzed using cross-lagged modeling. Conduct problems at 3 years was associated with poorer expressive language at 5 years and poorer expressive language at 3 years was associated with increased conduct problems by 5 years. The results support reciprocal associations, rather than a specific unidirectional path, which is commonly found with samples of older children. The emergence of problems in either domain can thus negatively impact upon the other over time, albeit the effects were modest. Studies examining the effects of intervention targeting conduct problems and language acquisition prior to school entry may be warranted in testing the efficacy of prevention programmes related to conduct problems and poor language ability early in childhood.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Conduct problems", "Early childhood", "Expressive language", "Millennium Cohort Study"], "IndexKeywords": ["Age Factors", "Child Language", "Child, Preschool", "Conduct Disorder", "Female", "Humans", "Language Development", "Male"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84945311641", "SubjectAreas": [["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"37072472300": {"Name": "Girard L.C.", "AuthorID": "37072472300", "AffiliationID": "60005141", "AffiliationName": "School of Public Health, Physiotherapy, and Population Sciences, Geary Institute for Public Policy, University College Dublin"}, "57188642378": {"Name": "Tremblay R.E.", "AuthorID": "57188642378", "AffiliationID": "60005141", "AffiliationName": "School of Public Health, Physiotherapy and Population Sciences, University College Dublin"}, "7003400734": {"Name": "Falissard B.", "AuthorID": "7003400734", "AffiliationID": "60123796", "AffiliationName": "Facult\u00e9 de M\u00e9decine, Universit\u00e9 Paris-Descartes"}, "8369960100": {"Name": "Pingault J.B.", "AuthorID": "8369960100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychology and Language Sciences, University College London"}, "55751703900": {"Name": "Doyle O.", "AuthorID": "55751703900", "AffiliationID": "60005141", "AffiliationName": "School of Economics, Geary Institute for Public Policy, University College Dublin"}}}
