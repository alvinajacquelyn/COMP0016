In this paper, we review the literature on cognitive function in idiopathic and DYT1 dystonia. In idiopathic or DYT1 dystonia, cognition is largely intact with only isolated executive dysfunction. Dystonia patients also have increased temporal and spatial discrimination thresholds, considered endophenotypes of the disorder because deficits are also shown by unaffected relatives and nonmanifesting carriers of the DYT1 mutation. Anticholinergic medication in high doses can be associated with memory impairment in dystonia. The successful treatment of dystonia with botulinum toxin injections or deep brain stimulation does not produce any major adverse effects on cognition. The aspects of cognition that require further investigation in future studies of dystonia include inhibitory control, decision making, and social cognition. \u00a9 2017 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.", "AuthorKeywords": ["cognition", "deep brain stimulation", "dystonia", "neuropsychology"], "IndexKeywords": ["Botulinum Toxins", "Cognition Disorders", "Deep Brain Stimulation", "Dystonia Musculorum Deformans", "Humans", "Molecular Chaperones", "Mutation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85020538987", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"7006891841": {"Name": "Jahanshahi M.", "AuthorID": "7006891841", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60020736, 60109771", "AffiliationName": "Cognitive Motor Neuroscience Group, Sobell Department of Motor Neuroscience & Movement Disorders, University College London (UCL) Institute of Neurology, The National Hospital for Neurology & Neurosurgery"}, "55908474200": {"Name": "Torkamani M.", "AuthorID": "55908474200", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60020736, 60109771", "AffiliationName": "Cognitive Motor Neuroscience Group, Sobell Department of Motor Neuroscience & Movement Disorders, University College London (UCL) Institute of Neurology, The National Hospital for Neurology & Neurosurgery"}}}
