The aim of this study was to elucidate secondary cytokine responses in an in vitro enriched (>80%) human stem cell-derived neuronal model. We exposed neuronal cultures to pre-determined and clinically relevant pathophysiological levels of tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), shown to be present in the inflammatory aftermath of TBI. Data from this reductionist human model were then compared with our in vivo data. Human embryonic stem cell (hESC)-derived neurons were exposed to recombinant TNF (1-10,000 pg/mL), IL-1\u03b2 (1-10,000 pg/mL), and IL-6 (0.1-1000 ng/mL). After 1, 24, and 72 h, culture supernatant was sampled and analyzed using a human cytokine/chemokine 42-plex Milliplex kit on the Luminex platform. The culture secretome revealed both a dose- and/or time-dependent release of cytokines. The IL-6 and TNF exposure each resulted in significantly increased levels of >10 cytokines over time, while IL-1\u03b2 increased the level of C-X-C motif chemokine 10 (CXCL10/IP10) alone. Importantly, these patterns are consistent with our in vivo (human) TBI data, thus validating our human stem cell-derived neuronal platform as a clinically useful reductionist model. Our data cumulatively suggest that IL-6 and TNF have direct actions, while the action of IL-1\u03b2 on human neurons likely occurs indirectly through inflammatory cells. The hESC-derived neurons provide a valuable platform to model cytokine mediated inflammation and can provide important insights into the mechanisms of neuroinflammation after TBI.", "AuthorKeywords": ["cytokine exposure", "human embryonic stem cell-derived neurons", "in vitro", "interleukin-1\u03b2", "interleukin-6", "tumor necrosis factor"], "IndexKeywords": ["Brain Injuries, Traumatic", "Cells, Cultured", "Cytokines", "Humans", "Inflammation", "Neural Stem Cells"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85041057115", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"55669665400": {"Name": "Thelin E.P.", "AuthorID": "55669665400", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Neuroscience, Karolinska Institutet"}, "7202706619": {"Name": "Carpenter K.L.H.", "AuthorID": "7202706619", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Wolfson Brain Imaging Centre, Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Cambridge"}, "25643268600": {"Name": "Hutchinson P.J.", "AuthorID": "25643268600", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Wolfson Brain Imaging Centre, Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Cambridge"}, "57219722340": {"Name": "Helmy A.", "AuthorID": "57219722340", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Division of Neurosurgery, Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Cambridge, Cambridge Biomedical Campus"}, "57194416399": {"Name": "Hall C.E.", "AuthorID": "57194416399", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "16302224400": {"Name": "Patani R.", "AuthorID": "16302224400", "AffiliationID": "60107285", "AffiliationName": "Francis Crick Institute"}, "37095085400": {"Name": "Gupta K.", "AuthorID": "37095085400", "AffiliationID": "60032702", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurological Surgery, Oregon Health and Science University"}, "7004332041": {"Name": "Chandran S.", "AuthorID": "7004332041", "AffiliationID": "60110825, 60027272", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Clinical Brain Sciences, University of Edinburgh"}}}
