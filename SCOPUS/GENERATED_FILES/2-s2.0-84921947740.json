European Journal of Personality published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of European Association of Personality Psychology. \u00a9 2014 The Authors. European Journal of Personality published.Driven by the challenge of representing and measuring psychological attributes, this article outlines a psychometric method aimed at identifying problem facets. The method, which integrates theoretical and empirical steps, is applied in the context of the construct of trait emotional intelligence (trait EI), using data from six different samples (N=1284) collected across Europe. Alternative representations of the trait EI variance, derived from the outcome variables used in previous validation studies of the Trait Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire, were regressed on the 15 trait EI facets using the stepwise method. The analyses revealed five facets, which did not occupy unique construct variance in any of the six samples. As expected, a composite of the remaining 10 facets consistently showed greater construct validity than the original 15-facet composite. Implications for construct and scale development are discussed, and directions for further validation of the method and for its application to other constructs are provided.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Assessment", "Facets", "Psychometrics", "Scale construction and development", "TEIQue", "Trait emotional self-efficacy"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84921947740", "SubjectAreas": [["Social Psychology", "PSYC", "3207"]], "AuthorData": {"54913642400": {"Name": "Siegling A.", "AuthorID": "54913642400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "London Psychometric Laboratory, University College London"}, "6603597461": {"Name": "Petrides K.", "AuthorID": "6603597461", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "London Psychometric Laboratory, University College London"}, "55734610400": {"Name": "Martskvishvili K.", "AuthorID": "55734610400", "AffiliationID": "101412627", "AffiliationName": "Tbilisi State University"}}}
