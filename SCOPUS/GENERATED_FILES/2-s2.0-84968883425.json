Raman and infrared (IR) active phonon modes and their eigenvectors are analyzed. Phonon mode-Gr\u00fcnseisen parameter and macroscopic Gr\u00fcnseisen constants are evaluated from phonon spectra. Employing quasiharmonic approximation (QHA), the thermal expansion tensor is obtained. The calculated volumetric thermal expansion coefficient (TEC) of Al4SiC4 is high than that of Al4Si2C5; and the linear TEC in the [001] direction is slightly higher than that of the [100] direction for both compounds. The computed average linear TECs for Al4SiC4 and Al4Si2C5 are 9.96 \u00d7 10-6 K-1 and 8.9 \u00d7 10-6 K-1 in a range from room temperature to 1500 K, respectively. Other thermal properties such as specific heats (CV, and CP), entropy (S), isothermal and isobaric bulk moduli (KT and KS) are also discussed. Using Slack's model, it is found that thermal conductivities are 59.9 W m-1 K-1 and 78.3 W m-1 K-1 at room temperature for Al4SiC4 and Al4Si2C5, respectively. The response of chemical bonds to hydrostatic pressure is discussed using Milliken population analysis. We also plot the charge density and its reduced density gradient to reveal the covalent bonds in the structure.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Chemical bondings", "First principles", "First-principles study", "Phonon spectrum", "Population analysis", "Reduced density gradients", "Thermal-expansion tensors", "Volumetric thermal expansion"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84968883425", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"]], "AuthorData": {"54385389700": {"Name": "Li Y.F.", "AuthorID": "54385389700", "AffiliationID": "60018308", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory for Mechanical Behavior of Materials, Xi'an Jiaotong University"}, "57188688392": {"Name": "Sun L.", "AuthorID": "57188688392", "AffiliationID": "60018308", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory for Mechanical Behavior of Materials, Xi'an Jiaotong University"}, "55442839500": {"Name": "Gao Y.M.", "AuthorID": "55442839500", "AffiliationID": "60018308", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory for Mechanical Behavior of Materials, Xi'an Jiaotong University"}, "55856717100": {"Name": "Xiao B.", "AuthorID": "55856717100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, University College London"}, "55549736400": {"Name": "Cheng Y.H.", "AuthorID": "55549736400", "AffiliationID": "60018308", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Electric Insulation and Power Equipment, Xi'an Jiaotong University"}}}
