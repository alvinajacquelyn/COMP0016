Although methodological caveats with a failure to adequately appreciate biological mechanisms may explain these disappointing results, it must be acknowledged that nutritional support during early critical illness, when considered alone, may have limited long-term functional impact. This narrative review focuses specifically on recent clinical trials and evaluates the impact of nutrition during critical illness on long-term physical and functional recovery. Specific focus on the trial design and methodological limitations has been considered in detail. Limitations include delivery of caloric and protein targets, patient heterogeneity, short duration of intervention, inappropriate clinical outcomes and a disregard for baseline nutritional status and nutritional intake in the post-ICU period. With survivorship at the forefront of critical care research, it is imperative that nutrition studies carefully consider biological mechanisms and trial design because these factors can strongly influence outcomes, in particular long-term physical and functional outcome. Failure to do so may lead to inconclusive clinical trials and consequent rejection of the potentially beneficial effects of nutrition interventions during critical illness.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Critical illness", "Energy", "Nutrition", "Physical recovery", "Protein"], "IndexKeywords": ["Critical Illness", "Energy Intake", "Humans", "Nutritional Status", "Nutritional Support", "Recovery of Function", "Time Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85028355599", "SubjectAreas": [["Critical Care and Intensive Care Medicine", "MEDI", "2706"]], "AuthorData": {"55967669300": {"Name": "Bear D.E.", "AuthorID": "55967669300", "AffiliationID": "60005518", "AffiliationName": "Lane Fox Clinical Respiratory Physiology Research Centre, Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust"}, "17136525800": {"Name": "Wandrag L.", "AuthorID": "17136525800", "AffiliationID": "60005518", "AffiliationName": "Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust, Department of Critical Care"}, "57203032669": {"Name": "Hart N.", "AuthorID": "57203032669", "AffiliationID": "60005518", "AffiliationName": "Lane Fox Clinical Respiratory Physiology Research Centre, Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust"}, "55044436900": {"Name": "Connolly B.", "AuthorID": "55044436900", "AffiliationID": "60026553", "AffiliationName": "The University of Melbourne, Department of Physiotherapy"}, "36091367300": {"Name": "Merriweather J.L.", "AuthorID": "36091367300", "AffiliationID": "60027272, 60002975", "AffiliationName": "University of Edinburgh, Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, Anaesthesia, Critical Care and Pain Medicine"}, "55348894800": {"Name": "Grocott M.P.W.", "AuthorID": "55348894800", "AffiliationID": "60000703", "AffiliationName": "University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust, Anaesthesia and Critical Care Research Unit"}, "null": {"Name": null, "AuthorID": null, "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
