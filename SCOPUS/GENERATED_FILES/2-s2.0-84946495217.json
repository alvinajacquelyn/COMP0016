Patients and Methods In all, 42 men with low-risk prostate cancer were enrolled in the study but two who underwent anaesthesia for the procedure did not receive the drug or light dose. Thus, 40 men received a single dose of 2, 4 or 6 mg/kg WST11 activated by 200 J/cm light at 753 nm. WST11 was given as a 10-min intravenous infusion. The light dose was delivered using cylindrical diffusing fibres within hollow plastic needles positioned in the prostate using transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS) guidance and a brachytherapy template. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to assess treatment effect at 7 days, with assessment of urinary function (International Prostate Symptom Score [IPSS]), sexual function (International Index of Erectile Function [IIEF]) and adverse events at 7 days, 1, 3 and 6 months after VTP. TRUS-guided biopsies were taken at 6 months. Results In all, 39 of the 40 treated men completed the follow-up. The Day-7 MRI showed maximal treatment effect (95% of the planned treatment volume) in men who had a WST11 dose of 4 mg/kg, light dose of 200 J/cm and light density index (LDI) of >1. In the 12 men treated with these parameters, the negative biopsy rate was 10/12 (83%) at 6 months, compared with 10/26 (45%) for the men who had either a different drug dose (10 men) or an LDI of <1 (16). Transient urinary symptoms were seen in most of the men, with no significant difference in IPSS score between baseline and 6 months after VTP. IIEF scores were not significantly different between baseline and 6 months after VTP. Conclusion Treatment with 4 mg/kg TOOKAD Soluble activated by 753 nm light at a dose of 200 J/cm and an LDI of >1 resulted in treatment effect in 95% of the planned treatment volume and a negative biopsy rate at 6 months of 10/12 men (83%).", "AuthorKeywords": ["cancer", "focal therapy", "prostate", "TOOKAD", "VTP"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Antineoplastic Agents", "Bacteriochlorophylls", "Biopsy", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Photochemotherapy", "Photosensitizing Agents", "Prostate", "Prostatic Neoplasms", "Radiation Dosage"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84946495217", "SubjectAreas": [["Urology", "MEDI", "2748"]], "AuthorData": {"7402982572": {"Name": "Moore C.M.", "AuthorID": "7402982572", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Surgery and Interventional Science, University College London"}, "15836399300": {"Name": "Arumainayagam N.", "AuthorID": "15836399300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Surgery and Interventional Science, University College London"}, "7402266611": {"Name": "Allen C.", "AuthorID": "7402266611", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Surgery and Interventional Science, University College London"}, "7004667094": {"Name": "Emberton M.", "AuthorID": "7004667094", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Surgery and Interventional Science, University College London"}, "7006478578": {"Name": "Muir G.H.", "AuthorID": "7006478578", "AffiliationID": "60021923", "AffiliationName": "King's College Hospital"}, "7005001182": {"Name": "Barber N.J.", "AuthorID": "7005001182", "AffiliationID": "60026788, 60032285", "AffiliationName": "Frimley Park and Basingstoke Hospitals"}, "7102212029": {"Name": "Bott S.", "AuthorID": "7102212029", "AffiliationID": "60026788, 60032285", "AffiliationName": "Frimley Park and Basingstoke Hospitals"}, "14323136200": {"Name": "Azzouzi A.R.", "AuthorID": "14323136200", "AffiliationID": "60009445", "AffiliationName": "CHU"}, "23046226500": {"Name": "Barret E.", "AuthorID": "23046226500", "AffiliationID": "106701438", "AffiliationName": "Institut Monsouris"}, "7005694427": {"Name": "Villers A.", "AuthorID": "7005694427", "AffiliationID": "60017724", "AffiliationName": "H\u00f4pital Claude Huriez, CHRU"}, "35310170100": {"Name": "Gaillac B.", "AuthorID": "35310170100", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Steba Biotech"}, "56602488500": {"Name": "Trachtenberg J.", "AuthorID": "56602488500", "AffiliationID": "60027817", "AffiliationName": "Princess Margaret Hospital"}, "56602759800": {"Name": "Schertz A.", "AuthorID": "56602759800", "AffiliationID": "60017563", "AffiliationName": "Plant Sciences, Weizmann Institute of Science"}}}
