Background We evaluated the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the Incredible Years \u00ae Teacher Classroom Management (TCM) programme as a universal intervention, given schools' important influence on child mental health.Methods A two-arm, pragmatic, parallel group, superiority, cluster randomised controlled trial recruited three cohorts of schools (clusters) between 2012 and 2014, randomising them to TCM (intervention) or Teaching As Usual (TAU-control). TCM was delivered to teachers in six whole-day sessions, spread over 6 months. Schools and teachers were not masked to allocation. The primary outcome was teacher-reported Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) Total Difficulties score. Random effects linear regression and marginal logistic regression models using Generalised Estimating Equations were used to analyse the outcomes. Trial registration: ISRCTN84130388.Results Eighty schools (2075 children) were enrolled; 40 (1037 children) to TCM and 40 (1038 children) to TAU. Outcome data were collected at 9, 18, and 30-months for 96, 89, and 85% of children, respectively. The intervention reduced the SDQ-Total Difficulties score at 9 months (mean (s.d.):5.5 (5.4) in TCM v. 6.2 (6.2) in TAU; adjusted mean difference =-1.0; 95% CI-1.9 to-0.1; p = 0.03) but this did not persist at 18 or 30 months. Cost-effectiveness analysis suggested that TCM may be cost-effective compared with TAU at 30-months, but this result was associated with uncertainty so no firm conclusions can be drawn. A priori subgroup analyses suggested TCM is more effective for children with poor mental health.Conclusions TCM provided a small, short-term improvement to children's mental health particularly for children who are already struggling.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Child", "Child Behavior", "Child, Preschool", "Cluster Analysis", "Cost-Benefit Analysis", "Educational Personnel", "England", "Female", "Humans", "Linear Models", "Logistic Models", "Male", "Program Evaluation", "Schools", "Social Behavior", "Students"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85049942439", "SubjectAreas": [["Applied Psychology", "PSYC", "3202"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"57212942850": {"Name": "Ford T.", "AuthorID": "57212942850", "AffiliationID": "60111707", "AffiliationName": "University of Exeter Medical School, South Cloisters, St Luke's Campus"}, "7402082201": {"Name": "Hayes R.", "AuthorID": "7402082201", "AffiliationID": "60111707", "AffiliationName": "University of Exeter Medical School, South Cloisters, St Luke's Campus"}, "23391901500": {"Name": "Edwards V.", "AuthorID": "23391901500", "AffiliationID": "60111707", "AffiliationName": "University of Exeter Medical School, South Cloisters, St Luke's Campus"}, "57202950910": {"Name": "Fletcher M.", "AuthorID": "57202950910", "AffiliationID": "60111707", "AffiliationName": "University of Exeter Medical School, South Cloisters, St Luke's Campus"}, "57192895691": {"Name": "Logan S.", "AuthorID": "57192895691", "AffiliationID": "60111707", "AffiliationName": "University of Exeter Medical School, South Cloisters, St Luke's Campus"}, "7202632264": {"Name": "Allen K.", "AuthorID": "7202632264", "AffiliationID": "60111707", "AffiliationName": "University of Exeter Medical School, South Cloisters, St Luke's Campus"}, "57200597806": {"Name": "Allwood M.", "AuthorID": "57200597806", "AffiliationID": "60111707", "AffiliationName": "University of Exeter Medical School, South Cloisters, St Luke's Campus"}, "56374399100": {"Name": "Hansford L.", "AuthorID": "56374399100", "AffiliationID": "60111707", "AffiliationName": "University of Exeter Medical School, South Cloisters, St Luke's Campus"}, "57202956683": {"Name": "Longdon B.", "AuthorID": "57202956683", "AffiliationID": "60111707", "AffiliationName": "University of Exeter Medical School, South Cloisters, St Luke's Campus"}, "57195934037": {"Name": "Price A.", "AuthorID": "57195934037", "AffiliationID": "60111707", "AffiliationName": "University of Exeter Medical School, South Cloisters, St Luke's Campus"}, "7003610970": {"Name": "Byford S.", "AuthorID": "7003610970", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "King's College London, King's Health Economics, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience"}, "57195625800": {"Name": "Ganguli P.", "AuthorID": "57195625800", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "King's College London, King's Health Economics, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience"}, "6603876406": {"Name": "Norwich B.", "AuthorID": "6603876406", "AffiliationID": "60026479", "AffiliationName": "Graduate School of Education, University of Exeter, North Cloisters"}, "57195414275": {"Name": "Pritchard W.", "AuthorID": "57195414275", "AffiliationID": "100371249", "AffiliationName": "Education and Early Years, Cornwall County Council"}, "57202950962": {"Name": "Grimes K.", "AuthorID": "57202950962", "AffiliationID": "60010365", "AffiliationName": "Educational and Counselling Psychology and Special Education, University of British Columbia"}, "55329560400": {"Name": "Norman S.", "AuthorID": "55329560400", "AffiliationID": "60026479", "AffiliationName": "University of Exeter, Sir Henry Wellcome Building, Streatham Campus"}, "6701555392": {"Name": "Ukoumunne O.C.", "AuthorID": "6701555392", "AffiliationID": "60026479", "AffiliationName": "NIHR CLAHRC South West Peninsula, PenCLAHRC, University of Exeter"}}}
