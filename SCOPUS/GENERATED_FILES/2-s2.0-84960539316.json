The results show that processing exports in China involves relatively lower CO2 emissions than other production types for the same output levels. Therefore, if processing exports are not appropriately distinguished, net CO2 emission exports from China to other regions will be distorted; the relative bias occasionally reaches 15%. Net emission exports from regions other than China are also distorted, particularly for regions that use considerable Chinese processing exports as intermediates, such as the United States, European Union (EU), and East Asia. Given that processing exports prevail in a large number of developing countries, such as Mexico and Vietnam, one should carefully interpret measurements of net emission transfers by international trade by utilizing the ordinary world-wide MRIO model.", "AuthorKeywords": ["China", "industrial ecology", "international trade", "multiregional input-output table", "net emissions transfers", "processing trade"], "IndexKeywords": ["Carbon dioxide emissions", "China", "European union", "Industrial ecology", "Input-output table", "Measurements of", "Net emissions transfers", "Output levels"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84960539316", "SubjectAreas": [["Environmental Science (all)", "ENVI", "2300"], ["Social Sciences (all)", "SOCI", "3300"]], "AuthorData": {"55861109000": {"Name": "Jiang X.", "AuthorID": "55861109000", "AffiliationID": "60014337", "AffiliationName": "Capital University of Economics and Business"}, "56920924500": {"Name": "Chen Q.", "AuthorID": "56920924500", "AffiliationID": "60013503", "AffiliationName": "University of International Business and Economics"}, "36448761500": {"Name": "Zhu K.", "AuthorID": "36448761500", "AffiliationID": "60013503", "AffiliationName": "University of International Business and Economics"}, "15839411900": {"Name": "Guan D.", "AuthorID": "15839411900", "AffiliationID": "60000112", "AffiliationName": "University of East Anglia"}, "55761406500": {"Name": "Yang C.", "AuthorID": "55761406500", "AffiliationID": "60003707, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "Academy of Mathematics and Systems Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}}}
