The event took place in the European Parliament of Brussels and was hosted by MEP David Borrelli and MEP Sirpa Pietikainen. The aim of the Summit was to correspond to the needs of the European Commission and of patients suffering from CRD to join forces in Europe for the prevention and self-management. Delegates of the European Rhinologic Society, European Respiratory Society, European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, European Academy of Paediatrics, and European Patients Organization EFA all lectured on their vision and action plan to join forces in achieving adequate prevention and self-management of CRD in the context of Precision Medicine. Recent data highlight the preventive capacity of education on optimal care pathways for CRD. Self-management and patient empowerment can be achieved by novel educational on-line materials and by novel mobile health tools enabling patients and doctors to monitor and optimally treat CRDs based on the level of control. This report summarizes the contributions of the representatives of different European academic stakeholders in the field of CRD.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Advocacy", "Allergy", "Asthma", "EUFOREA", "Mobile health technology"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85039421134", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"], ["Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine", "MEDI", "2740"]], "AuthorData": {"7004215789": {"Name": "Hellings P.W.", "AuthorID": "7004215789", "AffiliationID": "60001157", "AffiliationName": "Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Academic Medical Center"}, "35355799700": {"Name": "Fokkens W.", "AuthorID": "35355799700", "AffiliationID": "60001157", "AffiliationName": "Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Academic Medical Center"}, "57044467000": {"Name": "Borrelli D.", "AuthorID": "57044467000", "AffiliationID": "119989006", "AffiliationName": "Italian Member of the European Parliament, EFDD Group"}, "57044588900": {"Name": "Pietikainen S.", "AuthorID": "57044588900", "AffiliationID": "119988920", "AffiliationName": "Finnish Member of the European Parliament"}, "57201020933": {"Name": "Agache I.", "AuthorID": "57201020933", "AffiliationID": "60023654", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Medicine, Transylvania University"}, "7007154667": {"Name": "Akdis C.", "AuthorID": "7007154667", "AffiliationID": "109328213", "AffiliationName": "Christine K\u00fchne - Center for Allergy Research and Education (CK-CARE)"}, "7102663930": {"Name": "Bachert C.", "AuthorID": "7102663930", "AffiliationID": "60068590", "AffiliationName": "Upper Airways Research Laboratory, ENT Department, Ghent University Hospital"}, "56624195200": {"Name": "Bewick M.", "AuthorID": "56624195200", "AffiliationID": "117522057", "AffiliationName": "Q4U Consultants Ltd"}, "16548818800": {"Name": "Botjes E.", "AuthorID": "16548818800", "AffiliationID": "100497387", "AffiliationName": "EFA - European Federation of Allergy and Airways Diseases Patients' Associations"}, "7004386888": {"Name": "Constantinidis J.", "AuthorID": "7004386888", "AffiliationID": "60015331", "AffiliationName": "Department of ORL Head and Neck Surgery, Aristotle University"}, "7004531314": {"Name": "Haahtela T.", "AuthorID": "7004531314", "AffiliationID": "60098944, 60016987", "AffiliationName": "Skin and Allergy Hospital, Helsinki University Hospital"}, "55543341300": {"Name": "Hopkins C.", "AuthorID": "55543341300", "AffiliationID": "60005518", "AffiliationName": "ENT Department, Guy's and St Thomas' Hospitals"}, "6507765583": {"Name": "Illario M.", "AuthorID": "6507765583", "AffiliationID": "60015426", "AffiliationName": "Division for Health Innovation, Campania Region and Federico II University Hospital Naples, RandD and DISMET"}, "7102353943": {"Name": "Joos G.", "AuthorID": "7102353943", "AffiliationID": "60068590", "AffiliationName": "Department of Respiratory Medicine, Ghent University Hospital"}, "57214935023": {"Name": "Lund V.", "AuthorID": "57214935023", "AffiliationID": "60029890, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "Royal National Throat, Nose and Ear Hospital, University College London Hospitals"}, "35611705000": {"Name": "Muraro A.", "AuthorID": "35611705000", "AffiliationID": "60027298", "AffiliationName": "Food Allergy Referral Centre Veneto Region, Department of Women and Child Health, Padua General University Hospital"}, "57191846803": {"Name": "Pugin B.", "AuthorID": "57191846803", "AffiliationID": "118589874", "AffiliationName": "European Forum for Research and Education in Allergy and Airway Diseases (EUFOREA)"}, "55092765800": {"Name": "Seys S.", "AuthorID": "55092765800", "AffiliationID": "60025063", "AffiliationName": "Lab of Clinical Immunology, Department of Immunology and Microbiology, KU Leuven"}, "56563149400": {"Name": "Somekh D.", "AuthorID": "56563149400", "AffiliationID": "119634104", "AffiliationName": "European Health Futures Forum (EHFF)"}, "6603925553": {"Name": "Stj\u00e4rne P.", "AuthorID": "6603925553", "AffiliationID": "60019295", "AffiliationName": "Rhinology Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Karolinska University Hospital"}, "57204694158": {"Name": "Valiulis A.", "AuthorID": "57204694158", "AffiliationID": "117860697", "AffiliationName": "European Academy of Paediatrics (EAP/UEMS-SP)"}, "34573947500": {"Name": "Valovirta E.", "AuthorID": "34573947500", "AffiliationID": "60006876", "AffiliationName": "Department of Lung Diseases and Clinical Allergology, Univ. of Turku, and Allergy Clinic"}, "55156315400": {"Name": "Bousquet J.", "AuthorID": "55156315400", "AffiliationID": "119853903", "AffiliationName": "EUFOREA Aisbl"}}}
