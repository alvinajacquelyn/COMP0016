This study aimed to identify the factors associated with analgesic use in persons with AD; in particular, how AD severity, functional status, neuropsychiatric symptoms of AD, co-morbidities and somatic symptoms are associated with analgesic use. 236 community-dwelling persons with very mild or mild AD at baseline, and their caregivers, were interviewed over five years as part of the prospective ALSOVA study. Generalized Estimating Equations (GEEs) were used to estimate unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for the factors associated with analgesic use over a five year follow-up. The proportion of persons with AD using any analgesic was low (13.6%) at baseline and remained relatively constant during the follow-up (15.3% at Year 5). Over time, the most prevalent analgesic changed from non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (8.1% of persons with AD at Year 1) to acetaminophen (11.1% at Year 5). Depressive symptoms (measured by the Beck Depression Inventory, BDI) were independently associated with analgesic use, after effects of age, gender, education, AD severity, comorbidities and somatic symptoms were taken into account. For every one unit increase in BDI, the odds of analgesic use increased by 4% (OR = 1.04, 95% confidence interval CI = 1.02-1.07). Caregiver depressive symptoms were not statistically significantly associated with analgesic use of the person with AD. Depressive symptoms were significantly associated with analgesic use during the five year followup period. Possible explanations warranting investigation are that persons with AD may express depressive symptoms as painful somatic complaints, or untreated pain may cause depressive symptoms. Greater awareness of the association between depressive symptoms and analgesic use may lead to safer and more effective prescribing for these conditions.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Alzheimer Disease", "Analgesics", "Caregivers", "Depression", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Neuropsychological Tests", "Pain"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84923338663", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"55621888000": {"Name": "Gilmartin J.F.M.", "AuthorID": "55621888000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, School of Pharmacy"}, "56526736100": {"Name": "Salo L.", "AuthorID": "56526736100", "AffiliationID": "60103673", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Clinical Medicine, Neurology, School of Medicine, University of Eastern Finland"}, "46062125500": {"Name": "Hallikainen I.", "AuthorID": "46062125500", "AffiliationID": "60103673", "AffiliationName": "School of Educational Sciences and Psychology, University of Eastern Finland"}, "57210906244": {"Name": "Koivisto A.M.", "AuthorID": "57210906244", "AffiliationID": "60024252", "AffiliationName": "Neurology of NeuroCentre, Kuopio University Hospital"}, "7103237198": {"Name": "Hallikainen M.", "AuthorID": "7103237198", "AffiliationID": "60103673", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Clinical Medicine, Neurology, School of Medicine, University of Eastern Finland"}, "55791982000": {"Name": "Hongisto K.", "AuthorID": "55791982000", "AffiliationID": "60103673", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Public Health and Clinical Nutrition, Department of Geriatrics, University of Eastern Finland"}, "6503879164": {"Name": "Kalinen M.", "AuthorID": "6503879164", "AffiliationID": "60103673", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Clinical Medicine, Neurology, School of Medicine, University of Eastern Finland"}, "35508107000": {"Name": "Bell J.S.", "AuthorID": "35508107000", "AffiliationID": "60103673", "AffiliationName": "Kuopio Research Centre of Geriatric Care, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Eastern Finland"}, "56012002100": {"Name": "V\u00e4\u00e4t\u00e4inen S.", "AuthorID": "56012002100", "AffiliationID": "60103673", "AffiliationName": "Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research Unit (PHORU), School of Pharmacy, University of Eastern Finland"}, "6507434709": {"Name": "T\u00f6rm\u00e4lehto S.", "AuthorID": "6507434709", "AffiliationID": "60103673", "AffiliationName": "Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research Unit (PHORU), School of Pharmacy, University of Eastern Finland"}, "8849908900": {"Name": "Martikainen J.", "AuthorID": "8849908900", "AffiliationID": "60103673", "AffiliationName": "Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research Unit (PHORU), School of Pharmacy, University of Eastern Finland"}, "12763101900": {"Name": "L\u00f6nnroos E.", "AuthorID": "12763101900", "AffiliationID": "60103673", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Public Health and Clinical Nutrition, Department of Geriatrics, University of Eastern Finland"}, "57214815517": {"Name": "H\u00e4nninen T.", "AuthorID": "57214815517", "AffiliationID": "60024252", "AffiliationName": "Neurology of NeuroCentre, Kuopio University Hospital"}, "24318493000": {"Name": "Soininen H.", "AuthorID": "24318493000", "AffiliationID": "60103673", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Health Sciences, Institute of Clinical Medicine, Neurology, University of Eastern Finland"}, "56526418900": {"Name": "Tikkanen M.", "AuthorID": "56526418900", "AffiliationID": "60103673", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Health Sciences, Institute of Clinical Medicine, Neurology, University of Eastern Finland"}, "6603005308": {"Name": "Von Zu Fraunberg M.", "AuthorID": "6603005308", "AffiliationID": "60024252", "AffiliationName": "Neurosurgery of Neuro Center, Kuopio University Hospital"}, "57197511540": {"Name": "Hiltunen A.", "AuthorID": "57197511540", "AffiliationID": "60070302", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, North Karelia Central Hospital"}, "6603348034": {"Name": "Karppi P.", "AuthorID": "6603348034", "AffiliationID": "60070298", "AffiliationName": "Mikkeli Central Hospital"}, "16445242000": {"Name": "V\u00e4lim\u00e4ki T.", "AuthorID": "16445242000", "AffiliationID": "60024252", "AffiliationName": "Development, Clinical Education and Research Unit of Nursing, Kuopio University Hospital"}, "57079771200": {"Name": "M\u00e4kel\u00e4 H.", "AuthorID": "57079771200", "AffiliationID": "60103673", "AffiliationName": "Brain Research Unit, Clinical Research Centre, University of Eastern Finland"}}}
