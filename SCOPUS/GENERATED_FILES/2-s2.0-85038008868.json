For the first time, an experimental procedure is adopted to conduct a direct comparison between participatory and non-participatory decision-making in the context of heritage tourism planning. Contrary to previous work, this is the first ex-ante assessment of community participation at a destination with no such prior experience. The analysis relies on behavioural data on choices, deliberation and conflict studied in the context of a controlled collaborative environment. The findings suggest that choices and deliberation between participatory and non-participatory groups exhibit no statistically significant differences although participatory groups were more susceptible to conflict. However, interestingly, conflict was constructive as it increased provisions for heritage goods. Furthermore, intra-group heterogeneity did not always affect collective decisions negatively whereas trust and institutional credibility played a major role in influencing both individual and collective preferences. These findings have important implications for research and policy, opening a novel avenue for the systematic study of participation dynamics to inform the instigation of participatory endeavours.", "AuthorKeywords": ["community participation", "experimental economics", "Heritage tourism", "voluntary contributions to public goods"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85038008868", "SubjectAreas": [["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"], ["Tourism, Leisure and Hospitality Management", "BUSI", "1409"]], "AuthorData": {"56414884500": {"Name": "Dragouni M.", "AuthorID": "56414884500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute for Sustainable Heritage, University College London"}, "38961158600": {"Name": "Fouseki K.", "AuthorID": "38961158600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute for Sustainable Heritage, University College London"}, "6506118760": {"Name": "Georgantzis N.", "AuthorID": "6506118760", "AffiliationID": "60002676", "AffiliationName": "LEE & Economics Department, Universitat Jaume I"}}}
