The physicochemical properties of synthesized samples were determined by using different characterization techniques. The characterization results indicated that the as-synthesized sample was comprised of both ZnO and Zn(OH)2 phases with a particle size of approximately 50 nm. Thermal treatment of the as-synthesized sample at 150\u00b0C resulted in a pure ZnO phase with a particle size of 40 nm. The results also demonstrated that the surface area, pore diameter and bandgap energy reach a maximum value for the ZnO sample treated at 200\u00b0C. The ZnO nanoparticles pretreated at 200\u00b0C showed the highest photocatalytic activity (99% of degradation) in a short reaction time (90 min), which can be attributed to the combined effects of several factors including low crystallite size, relatively high surface area, pore diameter, pore volume and bandgap energy. Reusability results show that the catalysts can be readily separated from the reaction mixture by filtration after the photocatalytic reaction and reused at least five times without any loss of activity.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84919471660", "SubjectAreas": [["Catalysis", "CENG", "1503"], ["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Materials Chemistry", "MATE", "2505"]], "AuthorData": {"35745595000": {"Name": "Ali T.T.", "AuthorID": "35745595000", "AffiliationID": "60014101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Science, Sohag University"}, "55331248800": {"Name": "Narasimharao K.", "AuthorID": "55331248800", "AffiliationID": "60004582", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Science, King Abdulaziz University"}, "55411212800": {"Name": "Basahel S.N.", "AuthorID": "55411212800", "AffiliationID": "60004582", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Science, King Abdulaziz University"}, "14062876800": {"Name": "Bawaked S.M.", "AuthorID": "14062876800", "AffiliationID": "60004582", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Science, King Abdulaziz University"}, "6507891443": {"Name": "Al-Thabaiti S.A.", "AuthorID": "6507891443", "AffiliationID": "60004582", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Science, King Abdulaziz University"}, "56217400400": {"Name": "Parkin I.P.", "AuthorID": "56217400400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Materials Chemistry Centre, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "7003437916": {"Name": "Carmalt C.J.", "AuthorID": "7003437916", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Materials Chemistry Centre, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "37081732100": {"Name": "Sathasivam S.", "AuthorID": "37081732100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Materials Chemistry Centre, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}}}
