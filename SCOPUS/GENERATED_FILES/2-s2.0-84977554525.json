The minimum level of donor chimerism (DC) required to prevent HLH reactivation in humans remains to be determined. In a multicenter retrospective study, 103 patients transplanted for hereditary HLH (2000-2013) and DC permanently or transiently <75% (overall, CD3+, CD56+) were analyzed regarding DC, specific immunologic function, occurrence of systemic reactivations (\u22655/8 HLH criteria), partial systemic flares (<5 criteria and HLH-directed treatment), isolated central nervous system reactivations, and management. Recurrence was reported in 18 patients (systemic reactivation n = 11, partial flare n = 3, isolated central nervous system reactivation n = 4). Tenevents occurred during profound immune suppression before day 180 (median DC, 10%; range, 1-100%; CD3+ if available, otherwise overall DC), which renders a differentiation between secondary post-HSCT HLH and HLH related to the genetic defect difficult. Eight events occurred between 0.5 and 6.7 years post-HSCT (median DC, 13%; range, 0-30%). In 5 patients, overall and lineage-specific DC were \u226410% for >6 months (median, 5.1; range, 1.1-10 years) without reactivation. A second HSCT was performed in 18 patients (median, DC 4%; range, 0-19%). Death from reactivation occurred in 4 patients (22% of recurrences). Six patients died of transplant complications following a second HSCT (33% of second HSCT). We conclude that a DC >20%-30% is protective against late reactivation. Lower levels do not, however, inescapably result in recurrences. The decision for or against second HSCT must be based on a thorough risk assessment.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Chimerism",
