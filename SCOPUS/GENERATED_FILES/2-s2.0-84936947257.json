It comprises a monthly psycho-educational workshop involving discussions about the meaning of mental health, dramatizations of stories constructed by the children (often filmed), and concurrent parents' groups, as well as joint seminars and review sessions. This paper presents a qualitative analysis of interviews with young people (n=6) and parents (n=5) attending the groups and interviews with former service users (n=9). Five themes emerged from the thematic analysis: initial engagement, sharing with others, learning about mental health, opportunity for fun and impact on family relationships. Areas for further development were identified including the formation of a distinct adolescent Kidstime workshop to better meet their age-specific needs, and adjustments to the system for introducing new families to established workshop groups. Given the positive experience of the groups by those attending, a rigorous evaluation of the approach is suggested.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Child", "Kidstime", "mental health", "parent", "parental mental illness"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Child", "Child of Impaired Parents", "Child, Preschool", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Mental Disorders", "Parent-Child Relations", "Parents", "Patient Education as Topic", "Patient Satisfaction", "Qualitative Research", "Social Support"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84936947257", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Clinical Psychology", "PSYC", "3203"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"6701596440": {"Name": "Wolpert M.", "AuthorID": "6701596440", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60170329", "AffiliationName": "UCL, Anna Freud Centre, CAMHS EBPU"}, "56719025100": {"Name": "Hoffman J.", "AuthorID": "56719025100", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60170329", "AffiliationName": "UCL, Anna Freud Centre, CAMHS EBPU"}, "55746098200": {"Name": "Martin A.", "AuthorID": "55746098200", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60170329", "AffiliationName": "UCL, Anna Freud Centre, CAMHS EBPU"}, "6701487338": {"Name": "Fagin L.", "AuthorID": "6701487338", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60170329", "AffiliationName": "UCL, Anna Freud Centre, CAMHS EBPU"}, "6602727939": {"Name": "Cooklin A.", "AuthorID": "6602727939", "AffiliationID": "60161451", "AffiliationName": "Camden and Islington NHS Foundation Trust, UCL"}}}
