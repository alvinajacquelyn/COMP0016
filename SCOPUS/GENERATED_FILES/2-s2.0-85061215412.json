Our analysis unpacks the socio-cultural practices through which the ongoing interaction among these actors re-enacts and reproduces the social order that ascribes shinise a distinct social standing in exchange for their continued commitment to practices and structures that help the community preserve its cultural integrity and collective identity. By doing so, our findings trace a connection between status maintenance and the expressive function that a category of firms performs within a community. At the same time, our study reveals a dark side of high status, by showing how their commitments lock shinise in a position of \u2018benign entrapment\u2019 that may impose sacrifices on family members and severe limitations to their personal freedom.", "AuthorKeywords": ["craft", "culture", "institutional theory", "Selznick", "status"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85061215412", "SubjectAreas": [["Strategy and Management", "BUSI", "1408"], ["Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management", "BUSI", "1407"], ["Management of Technology and Innovation", "BUSI", "1405"]], "AuthorData": {"55936934300": {"Name": "Sasaki I.", "AuthorID": "55936934300", "AffiliationID": "60023643", "AffiliationName": "Lancaster University"}, "56006342100": {"Name": "Ravasi D.", "AuthorID": "56006342100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "55508650800": {"Name": "Micelotta E.", "AuthorID": "55508650800", "AffiliationID": "60033021", "AffiliationName": "University of New Mexico"}}}
