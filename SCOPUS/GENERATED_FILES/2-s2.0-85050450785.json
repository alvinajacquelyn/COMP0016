In the history of the Women's Liberation Movement (WLM) and feminist organizing more broadly in the UK, professional working has often been positioned as antithetical to feminist working, and relatively little scholarship has examined the interface between the two. This article argues that the individuals involved should be considered \u2018professional feminists\u2019 as opposed to \u2018femocrats\u2019, drawing from across feminist, social movement and organizational theory, and interviews carried out in 2011 and archival texts from three UK councils. It also suggests their work (undertaken between the beginning of the 1980s and the beginning of the 1990s) serves to blur the boundaries usually marked between social movement and state. This contributes to the existing literature by exploring the specific understandings and practices put to work by those working on gender equality professionally, but not in an elected capacity, within local government, and how their work can be positioned in relation to feminist organizing more broadly.", "AuthorKeywords": ["femocrats", "gender equality", "local government", "professional feminists"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85050450785", "SubjectAreas": [["Gender Studies", "SOCI", "3318"], ["Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management", "BUSI", "1407"]], "AuthorData": {"57197710102": {"Name": "Johnson Ross F.", "AuthorID": "57197710102", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Education, University College London"}}}
