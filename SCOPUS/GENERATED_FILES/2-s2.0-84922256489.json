Most studies have focused on age-related effects, whilst puberty-related changes are not well understood. Using diffusion tensor imaging and tract-based spatial statistics, we investigated the effects of pubertal status on white matter mean diffusivity (MD) and fractional anisotropy (FA) in 61 males aged 12.7-16.0 years. Participants were grouped into early-mid puberty (\u2264Tanner Stage 3 in pubic hair and gonadal development; n = 22) and late-post puberty (\u2264Tanner Stage 4 in pubic hair or gonadal development; n = 39). Salivary levels of pubertal hormones (testosterone, DHEA and oestradiol) were also measured. Pubertal stage was significantly related to MD in diverse white matter regions. No relationship was observed between pubertal status and FA. Regression modelling of MD in the significant regions demonstrated that an interaction model incorporating puberty, age and puberty \u00d7 age best explained our findings. In addition, testosterone was correlated with MD in these pubertally significant regions. No relationship was observed between oestradiol or DHEA and MD. In conclusion, pubertal status was significantly related to MD, but not FA, and this relationship cannot be explained by changes in chronological age alone.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Adolescence", "Brain development", "Diffusion tensor imaging", "Puberty", "Structural magnetic resonance imaging", "Testosterone", "White matter"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Aging", "Anisotropy", "Brain", "Child", "Diffusion Tensor Imaging", "Humans", "Male", "Neuroimaging", "Puberty", "Saliva", "Sexual Maturation", "Testosterone", "White Matter"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84922256489", "SubjectAreas": [["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"]], "AuthorData": {"57189082094": {"Name": "Menzies L.", "AuthorID": "57189082094", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "General Adolescent and Paediatric Unit, University College London, Institute of Child Health"}, "55354421500": {"Name": "Goddings A.", "AuthorID": "55354421500", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "General Adolescent and Paediatric Unit, University College London, Institute of Child Health"}, "26643513600": {"Name": "Blakemore S.", "AuthorID": "26643513600", "AffiliationID": "60109771, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, Alexandra House"}, "7005899067": {"Name": "Viner R.", "AuthorID": "7005899067", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "General Adolescent and Paediatric Unit, University College London, Institute of Child Health"}, "24774205600": {"Name": "Whitaker K.", "AuthorID": "24774205600", "AffiliationID": "114960172", "AffiliationName": "Brain Mapping Unit, Department of Psychiatry, Cambridge Biomedical Campus"}}}
