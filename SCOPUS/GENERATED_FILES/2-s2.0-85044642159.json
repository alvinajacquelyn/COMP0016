We aimed to evaluate this association among participants in the Strategies for Management of Antiretroviral Therapy (SMART) study who had virologic suppression (HIV-1 VL < 200 copies/mL) at enrollment. Based on self-reported adherence (7-day recall), plasma concentrations of interleukin 6 and D-dimer were 9% (95% confidence interval [CI], 1%-18%; P = .02) and 11% (95% CI, 1%-22%; P = .03) higher in participants who reported suboptimal vs 100% adherence, respectively. These findings confirm previous observations and support the hypothesis that suboptimal ART adherence, even in the context of virologic suppression, may have significant biological consequences.
