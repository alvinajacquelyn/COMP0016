However, all such models face a common challenge: how can microscopic scatterers be represented without limiting the overall size of the sample that can be modelled? Here we show how micro-scopic scatterers can be accurately represented on computational grids with cells too large to faithfully represent such scatterers using conventional approaches. We also validate this approach experimentally. This approach to OCT image simulation allows for image formation for biological tissues to be simulated with unprecedented realism.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Biological tissues", "Computational grids", "Conventional approach", "OCT images", "Realistic simulation"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85058297660", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"], ["Instrumentation", "PHYS", "3105"], ["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"]], "AuthorData": {"56594958900": {"Name": "Ossowski P.", "AuthorID": "56594958900", "AffiliationID": "60021858", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Physics, Nicolaus Copernicus University"}, "35188735600": {"Name": "Curatolo A.", "AuthorID": "35188735600", "AffiliationID": "60031806", "AffiliationName": "School of Electrical, Electronic and Computer Engineering, University of Western Australia Perth"}, "7103073866": {"Name": "Sampson D.", "AuthorID": "7103073866", "AffiliationID": "60021097", "AffiliationName": "University of Surrey"}, "7102012051": {"Name": "Munro P.", "AuthorID": "7102012051", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}}}
