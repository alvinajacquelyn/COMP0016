Hence, accurate and practical NET markers are needed. Cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART) peptide is a potential novel NET marker. Design and Participants: Circulating levels of CART peptide and the established NET markers chromogranin A (CgA) and chromogranin B (CgB) were measured using RIA in 353 patients with NET (normal renal function) and in controls. Clinical data were collected retrospectively. Main Outcome Measure(s): The comparative and combined utility of CART, CgA, and CgB for diagnosis and assessment of disease progression was measured in different NET subtypes. Results: CgA and CgB in combination improved diagnostic accuracy in patients with gut NETs, nongastroenteropancreatic NETs, and NETs with an unknown primary origin compared with each biomarker alone. Measuring CART did not further improve diagnosis in these NET subtypes. For pancreatic NETs, CgB was superior to CgA and CART in detecting stable disease (P<.007), whereas CgA and CART in combination were most effective in identifying progressive disease. In phaeochromocytomas/paragangliomas (PCC/PGL), CART was the most useful biomarker for identifying stable (P <.001) and progressive (P =.001) disease. Consistent with this, plasma CART decreased following PCC/PGL tumor resection, remaining low in all patients in remission, but increasing in those with progressive disease. Conclusions: CART is a useful marker for identifying progressive pancreatic NETs. CART is superior to CgA and CgB in detecting stable and progressive PCC/PGLs, and may have a role as a surveillance marker for PCC/PGL patients.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adrenal Gland Neoplasms", "Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Case-Control Studies", "Chromogranin A", "Chromogranin B", "Diagnostic Techniques, Endocrine", "Disease Progression", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Nerve Tissue Proteins", "Neuroendocrine Tumors", "Paraganglioma", "Pheochromocytoma", "Predictive Value of Tests", "Prognosis", "Retrospective Studies", "Tumor Markers, Biological", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84927593708", "SubjectAreas": [["Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism", "MEDI", "2712"], ["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Endocrinology", "BIOC", "1310"], ["Clinical Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1308"], ["Biochemistry (medical)", "MEDI", "2704"]], "AuthorData": {"56238561400": {"Name": "Ramachandran R.", "AuthorID": "56238561400", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Division of Diabetes, Endocrinology and Metabolism, Section of Investigative Medicine, Imperial College London"}, "24068522300": {"Name": "Bech P.", "AuthorID": "24068522300", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Division of Diabetes, Endocrinology and Metabolism, Section of Investigative Medicine, Imperial College London"}, "35238019500": {"Name": "Murphy K.G.", "AuthorID": "35238019500", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Division of Diabetes, Endocrinology and Metabolism, Section of Investigative Medicine, Imperial College London"}, "57213987453": {"Name": "Patel M.", "AuthorID": "57213987453", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Division of Diabetes, Endocrinology and Metabolism, Section of Investigative Medicine, Imperial College London"}, "57214481332": {"Name": "Vohra S.", "AuthorID": "57214481332", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Division of Diabetes, Endocrinology and Metabolism, Section of Investigative Medicine, Imperial College London"}, "6602557342": {"Name": "Dhillo W.S.", "AuthorID": "6602557342", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Division of Diabetes, Endocrinology and Metabolism, Section of Investigative Medicine, Imperial College London"}, "56434950800": {"Name": "Sharma R.", "AuthorID": "56434950800", "AffiliationID": "60111785", "AffiliationName": "Division of Experimental Medicine, Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, London"}, "7004552023": {"Name": "Palazzo F.F.", "AuthorID": "7004552023", "AffiliationID": "60111785", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery and Cancer, Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, London"}, "8911643600": {"Name": "Win Z.", "AuthorID": "8911643600", "AffiliationID": "60111785", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, London"}, "7402022077": {"Name": "Tan T.", "AuthorID": "7402022077", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "European Neuroendocrine Tumor Society (ENETS) Centre of Excellence, Imperial College London"}, "7003675147": {"Name": "Meeran K.", "AuthorID": "7003675147", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Division of Diabetes, Endocrinology and Metabolism, Section of Investigative Medicine, Imperial College London"}, "56248644000": {"Name": "Frilling A.", "AuthorID": "56248644000", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "European Neuroendocrine Tumor Society (ENETS) Centre of Excellence, Imperial College London"}, "57202559235": {"Name": "Ghatei M.A.", "AuthorID": "57202559235", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Division of Diabetes, Endocrinology and Metabolism, Section of Investigative Medicine, Imperial College London"}, "36471613400": {"Name": "Bloom S.R.", "AuthorID": "36471613400", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Division of Diabetes, Endocrinology and Metabolism, Section of Investigative Medicine, Imperial College London"}, "7401810310": {"Name": "Martin N.M.", "AuthorID": "7401810310", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Division of Diabetes, Endocrinology and Metabolism, Section of Investigative Medicine, Imperial College London"}, "55908628800": {"Name": "Caplin M.E.", "AuthorID": "55908628800", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "ENETS Centre of Excellence Neuroendocrine Tumor Unit, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust Hospital"}, "8378150500": {"Name": "Khan M.S.", "AuthorID": "8378150500", "AffiliationID": "60000020", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gastroenterology, University Hospital of Wales"}, "36185394100": {"Name": "Khoo B.", "AuthorID": "36185394100", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "ENETS Centre of Excellence Neuroendocrine Tumor Unit, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust Hospital"}}}
