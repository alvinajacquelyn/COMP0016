Both PEG 400 and \u03b2-alanine were found to produce stable dispersions that were used to deposit ITO thin films on glass substrates by dip and spin coating methods. The ITO thin films were heat-treated using both conventional and microwave heat treatment in order to improve the inter-particle connections and hence the resistivity and transparency of the films. All the films exhibited an average transmittance of >80% over the visible spectrum after being subjected to the heat treatment process. ITO films prepared with no dispersant showed very high resistivity values for both heating methods, however addition of 2 wt% PEG 400 to the dispersion yielded a reduction in the resistivity values to 1.4\u00d710\u22121 \u03a9 cm and 3.8\u00d710\u22122 \u03a9 cm for conventionally and microwave treated films, respectively. The surface morphological studies confirmed that addition of dispersants improved the film uniformity and inter-particle connections of the ITO films considerably.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Dispersants/Dispersion", "Indium/Indium compounds", "Nanoparticles", "Thin films", "Transparent conducting oxides"], "IndexKeywords": ["Dispersants", "Heat treatment process", "Microwave processing", "Nano-sized ITO powders", "Particle size distribution measurement", "Tin doped indium oxide", "Transparent conducting oxide", "Transparent conductive oxides"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84995495606", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Ceramics and Composites", "MATE", "2503"], ["Process Chemistry and Technology", "CENG", "1508"], ["Surfaces, Coatings and Films", "MATE", "2508"], ["Materials Chemistry", "MATE", "2505"]], "AuthorData": {"55801616100": {"Name": "Ghanizadeh S.", "AuthorID": "55801616100", "AffiliationID": "60000891", "AffiliationName": "Wolfson School of Mechanical, Electrical and Manufacturing Engineering, Loughborough University"}, "7003370659": {"Name": "Hutt D.", "AuthorID": "7003370659", "AffiliationID": "60000891", "AffiliationName": "Wolfson School of Mechanical, Electrical and Manufacturing Engineering, Loughborough University"}, "7101911461": {"Name": "Conway P.", "AuthorID": "7101911461", "AffiliationID": "60000891", "AffiliationName": "Wolfson School of Mechanical, Electrical and Manufacturing Engineering, Loughborough University"}, "54896015300": {"Name": "Peiris T.", "AuthorID": "54896015300", "AffiliationID": "60000891", "AffiliationName": "Energy Research Laboratory, Department of Chemistry, Loughborough University"}, "57189846810": {"Name": "Jayathilake D.", "AuthorID": "57189846810", "AffiliationID": "60000891", "AffiliationName": "Energy Research Laboratory, Department of Chemistry, Loughborough University"}, "6603635340": {"Name": "Wijayantha K.", "AuthorID": "6603635340", "AffiliationID": "60000891", "AffiliationName": "Energy Research Laboratory, Department of Chemistry, Loughborough University"}, "16022734300": {"Name": "Southee D.", "AuthorID": "16022734300", "AffiliationID": "60000891", "AffiliationName": "Design School, Loughborough University"}, "55243347800": {"Name": "Marchand P.", "AuthorID": "55243347800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "6603926697": {"Name": "Darr J.", "AuthorID": "6603926697", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "56217400400": {"Name": "Parkin I.", "AuthorID": "56217400400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "7003437916": {"Name": "Carmalt C.", "AuthorID": "7003437916", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}}}
