The objective of this study was to investigate the role of EDI-OCT to assess the choroidal and retinal changes in posterior uveitis. Methods: In this retrospective study, EDI-OCT scans of patients with idiopathic posterior uveitis or panuveitis were reviewed. Morphological features from retina and choroid from the OCT scans were assessed and compared to the fellow normal eyes. Follow-up assessment was performed at 6-month follow-up. Results: Nineteen patients with idiopathic posterior or panuveitis were included in the study. Choroidal examination using EDI-OCT scans showed areas of focal hypo-reflective and discrete hyper-reflective foci in one-third patients. Macular edema, disruption of the ellipsoid zone (generalized and discrete), outer retinal hyper-reflective foci, and intraretinal and subretinal fluid were observed. Conclusions: The index study reports qualitative OCT-derived parameters as possible tools in monitoring disease progression in uveitis.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Enhanced depth imaging optical coherence tomography (EDI-OCT)", "Heterogeneous uveitis", "Hyper-reflective foci", "Hypo-reflective foci", "Intraretinal fluid", "Subretinal fluid"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Choroid", "Female", "Fluorescein Angiography", "Fundus Oculi", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Panuveitis", "Retina", "Retrospective Studies", "Tomography, Optical Coherence", "Uveitis, Posterior", "Visual Acuity"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85020169219", "SubjectAreas": [["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"]], "AuthorData": {"7201475180": {"Name": "Agrawal R.", "AuthorID": "7201475180", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}, "24480921100": {"Name": "Keane P.A.", "AuthorID": "24480921100", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}, "7003495942": {"Name": "Pavesio C.", "AuthorID": "7003495942", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}, "57210458661": {"Name": "Arora R.", "AuthorID": "57210458661", "AffiliationID": "60002284", "AffiliationName": "Salisbury District Hospital"}, "57209565397": {"Name": "Agarwal A.", "AuthorID": "57209565397", "AffiliationID": "60000137", "AffiliationName": "Advanced Eye Center, Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER)"}}}
