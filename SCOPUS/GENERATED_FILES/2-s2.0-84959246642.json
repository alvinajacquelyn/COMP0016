The how and why individual behaviour affects energy use are discussed, together with the principles and perspectives which have so far been considered in order to explain the habitual consuming behaviour. The research gaps, which are revealed from previous studies in terms of the limitations or assumptions on the methodology to alter individuals\u2019 energy usage, give insights for a conceptual framework to define a comprehensive approach. The proposed framework suggests that the individual energy perception gaps are affected by psychological, habitual, structural and cultural variables in a wider-contextual, meso-societal and micro-individual spectrum. All these factors need to be considered in order for a variety of combined intervention methods, which are discussed and recommended, to introduce a more effective shift in the conventional energy-consuming behaviour, advancing insights for successful energy policies.", "AuthorKeywords": ["energy efficiency and energy conservation", "habitual energy behaviour", "household energy savings"], "IndexKeywords": ["Behavioural changes", "Conceptual frameworks", "Cultural variables", "Energy behaviours", "Household energy", "Household energy consumption", "Individual behaviour", "Intervention methods"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84959246642", "SubjectAreas": [["Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment", "ENER", "2105"], ["Fuel Technology", "ENER", "2103"], ["Energy (all)", "ENER", "2100"], ["Process Chemistry and Technology", "CENG", "1508"], ["Fluid Flow and Transfer Processes", "CENG", "1507"]], "AuthorData": {"56268678700": {"Name": "Pothitou M.", "AuthorID": "56268678700", "AffiliationID": "60004407", "AffiliationName": "Division of Energy and Power Engineering, School of Engineering, Cranfield University"}, "36544079300": {"Name": "Kolios A.", "AuthorID": "36544079300", "AffiliationID": "60004407", "AffiliationName": "Division of Energy and Power Engineering, School of Engineering, Cranfield University"}, "35236986500": {"Name": "Gu S.", "AuthorID": "35236986500", "AffiliationID": "60004407", "AffiliationName": "Division of Energy and Power Engineering, School of Engineering, Cranfield University"}, "15081806200": {"Name": "Varga L.", "AuthorID": "15081806200", "AffiliationID": "60116362, 60004407", "AffiliationName": "Complex Systems Research Centre (CSRC), School of Management (SoM), Cranfield University"}}}
