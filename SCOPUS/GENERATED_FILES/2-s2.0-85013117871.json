They exhibited only minor changes upon removal of bulk water during film formation, contrary to previously reported studies of proteins dehydrated by lyophilization (where substantial loss of helical structure and gain in sheet structure was detected). This near lack of conformational change observed for globular proteins contrasts with intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) dried in the same manner: the IDPs, which have almost completely unordered structures in solution, exhibited increased amounts of regular (mostly helical) secondary structures when dehydrated, suggesting formation of new intra-protein hydrogen bonds replacing solvent-protein hydrogen bonds, in a process which may mimic interactions that occur when IDPs bind to partner molecules. This study has thus shown that the secondary structures of globular and intrinsically disordered proteins behave very differently upon dehydration, and that films are a potentially useful format for examining dehydrated soluble proteins and assessing IDPs structures.", "AuthorKeywords": ["dehydration", "folding", "globular proteins", "intrinsically disordered proteins", "secondary structure", "synchrotron radiation circular dichroism (SRCD) spectroscopy", "unfolding"], "IndexKeywords": ["Circular Dichroism", "Desiccation", "Hydrogen Bonding", "Intrinsically Disordered Proteins", "Protein Folding"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85013117871", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"]], "AuthorData": {"35742468200": {"Name": "Yoneda J.S.", "AuthorID": "35742468200", "AffiliationID": "60008088", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Physics, Universidade de S\u00e3o Paulo"}, "24605487500": {"Name": "Miles A.J.", "AuthorID": "24605487500", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, Birkbeck College, University of London"}, "7202576274": {"Name": "Wallace B.A.", "AuthorID": "7202576274", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, Birkbeck College, University of London"}, "7202092301": {"Name": "Araujo A.P.U.", "AuthorID": "7202092301", "AffiliationID": "60008088", "AffiliationName": "Instituto de F\u00edsica de S\u00e3o Carlos, Universidade de S\u00e3o Paulo"}}}
