Previous retrospective studies suggest increased surgery-related adverse events (AEs) after presurgical TKI. We report surgical safety from a randomised comparison of CN before or after sunitinib. In-hospital mortality, 30-d readmission rate, and intraoperative and 30-d postoperative AEs according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4 and Clavien-Dindo (CD) were analysed. Patients were randomised 1:1 to immediate CN followed by sunitinib versus sunitinib followed by deferred CN 24 h after the last dose of sunitinib. None of the tumours in the deferred arm became unresectable, and only two patients had a sunitinib-related delay of CN of >2 wk. AEs related to surgery (all grades) in the immediate and deferred arms occurred in 52% and 53% after CN, respectively, although the number of intraoperative surgery-related AEs was higher in the immediate arm. Postoperative AEs (CD \u22653), 30-d readmission, and in-hospital mortality rates were 6.5%, 13%, and 4.3% in the immediate arm and 2.5%, 7.5%, and 2.5% in the deferred arm, respectively. There were no differences in surgery time, blood loss, and hospital stay. Patient summary: Patients with metastatic kidney cancer do not have more surgical complications irrespective of whether they are treated with systemic therapy before or after surgery.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cytoreductive nephrectomy", "Renal cell carcinoma", "Surgical safety"], "IndexKeywords": ["Antineoplastic Agents", "Carcinoma, Renal Cell", "Combined Modality Therapy", "Cytoreduction Surgical Procedures", "Humans", "Kidney Neoplasms", "Nephrectomy", "Sunitinib", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85067279950", "SubjectAreas": [["Urology", "MEDI", "2748"]], "AuthorData": {"55005756000": {"Name": "De Bruijn R.E.", "AuthorID": "55005756000", "AffiliationID": "60015205", "AffiliationName": "The Netherlands Cancer Institute"}, "56639267000": {"Name": "Van Thienen J.V.", "AuthorID": "56639267000", "AffiliationID": "60015205", "AffiliationName": "The Netherlands Cancer Institute"}, "7007139510": {"Name": "Blank C.U.", "AuthorID": "7007139510", "AffiliationID": "60015205", "AffiliationName": "The Netherlands Cancer Institute"}, "7003526080": {"Name": "Haanen J.B.", "AuthorID": "7003526080", "AffiliationID": "60015205", "AffiliationName": "The Netherlands Cancer Institute"}, "7004237921": {"Name": "Bex A.", "AuthorID": "7004237921", "AffiliationID": "60032819, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, The Royal Free Hospital and University College London"}, "35430454700": {"Name": "Mulders P.", "AuthorID": "35430454700", "AffiliationID": "60002573", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, Radboud University Hospital"}, "7004518191": {"Name": "Jewett M.A.", "AuthorID": "7004518191", "AffiliationID": "60027817", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, Princess Margaret Hospital"}, "57204865824": {"Name": "Wagstaff J.", "AuthorID": "57204865824", "AffiliationID": "100326772", "AffiliationName": "Department of Oncology, Cardiff Hospital"}, "7004209598": {"Name": "Van Velthoven R.", "AuthorID": "7004209598", "AffiliationID": "60028724", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, Institut Jules Bordet"}, "35749151000": {"Name": "Wood L.", "AuthorID": "35749151000", "AffiliationID": "60000540, 60023750", "AffiliationName": "Division of Medical Oncology, QEII Health Sciences Center"}, "6604060814": {"Name": "van Melick H.E.", "AuthorID": "6604060814", "AffiliationID": "60025865", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, Saint Antonius Hospital"}, "56014387800": {"Name": "Aarts M.J.", "AuthorID": "56014387800", "AffiliationID": "60007895", "AffiliationName": "Department of Oncology, Maastricht University Medical Center"}, "6506151048": {"Name": "Lattouf J.B.", "AuthorID": "6506151048", "AffiliationID": "60009657", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery Urology, University of Montreal Hospital Center"}, "34572458000": {"Name": "Powles T.", "AuthorID": "34572458000", "AffiliationID": "60032819, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Department of Oncology, The Royal Free Hospital and Queen Mary University"}, "7005938218": {"Name": "De Jong I.J.", "AuthorID": "7005938218", "AffiliationID": "60006027, 60010023", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen"}, "55883918800": {"Name": "Rottey S.", "AuthorID": "55883918800", "AffiliationID": "60068590", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Oncology, Ghent University Hospital"}, "55111143600": {"Name": "Tombal B.", "AuthorID": "55111143600", "AffiliationID": "60012936", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, Cliniques Universitaires Saint-Luc"}, "16069335500": {"Name": "Marreaud S.", "AuthorID": "16069335500", "AffiliationID": "60009434", "AffiliationName": "Department of Statistics, European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer"}, "24340876400": {"Name": "Collette S.", "AuthorID": "24340876400", "AffiliationID": "60009434", "AffiliationName": "Department of Statistics, European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer"}, "7003696478": {"Name": "Collette L.", "AuthorID": "7003696478", "AffiliationID": "60009434", "AffiliationName": "Department of Statistics, European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer"}}}
