Academic and judicial consideration of the right of self-defence in international law has focused on the right as it applies to states (national self-defence). This approach represents only part of the picture, however. Little attention has been paid to how the right of national self-defence relates to, and interacts with, the right of military personnel and their units to defend themselves. Yet, this relationship is crucial to determine when and how a state may defend itself. This article highlights fundamental problems associated with the focus on national self-defence, which results in the fragmentation of international law.
