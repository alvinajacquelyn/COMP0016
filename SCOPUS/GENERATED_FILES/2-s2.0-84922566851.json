The improvement in abnormal visual processing following training and its generalization to visual acuity, as measured on static clinical charts, can be explained by improved sensitivity or processing speed. Crowding, the inability to recognize objects in a clutter, fundamentally limits conscious visual perception. Although it was largely considered absent in the fovea, earlier studies report foveal crowding upon very brief exposures or following spatial manipulations. Here we used GlassesOff's application for iDevices to train foveal vision of young participants. The training was performed at reading distance based on contrast detection tasks under different spatial and temporal constraints using Gabor patches aimed at testing improvement of processing speed. We found several significant improvements in spatio-temporal visual functions including near and also non-trained far distances. A remarkable transfer to visual acuity measured under crowded conditions resulted in reduced processing time of 81 \u20ac.ms, in order to achieve 6/6 acuity. Despite a subtle change in contrast sensitivity, a robust increase in processing speed was found. Thus, enhanced processing speed may lead to overcoming foveal crowding and might be the enabling factor for generalization to other visual functions.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Contrast Sensitivity", "Humans", "Learning", "Pattern Recognition, Visual", "Psychophysics", "Spatio-Temporal Analysis", "Teaching", "Visual Perception", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84922566851", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"54796686900": {"Name": "Lev M.", "AuthorID": "54796686900", "AffiliationID": "60005681", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Medicine, Goldschleger Eye Research Institute, Tel Aviv University"}, "57207515694": {"Name": "Polat U.", "AuthorID": "57207515694", "AffiliationID": "60005681", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Medicine, Goldschleger Eye Research Institute, Tel Aviv University"}, "55871277400": {"Name": "Ludwig K.", "AuthorID": "55871277400", "AffiliationID": "60000762", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Humboldt-Universitat zu"}, "56511326400": {"Name": "Voss S.", "AuthorID": "56511326400", "AffiliationID": "60026245", "AffiliationName": "Visual Perception Laboratory, Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Charite- Universita tsmedizin"}, "6602460323": {"Name": "Sterzer P.", "AuthorID": "6602460323", "AffiliationID": "60026245", "AffiliationName": "Visual Perception Laboratory, Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Charite- Universita tsmedizin"}, "6508200948": {"Name": "Hesselmann G.", "AuthorID": "6508200948", "AffiliationID": "60026245", "AffiliationName": "Visual Perception Laboratory, Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Charite- Universita tsmedizin"}, "6505604248": {"Name": "Gilaie-Dotan S.", "AuthorID": "6505604248", "AffiliationID": "60109771", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience"}}}
