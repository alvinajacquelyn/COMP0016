However, the underlying mechanism of direct lineage transition into iNSCs is largely unknown. In this study, we examined the effect of genetic background on the direct conversion process into an iNSC state. The iNSCs from two different mouse strains exhibited the distinct efficiency of lineage conversion as well as clonal expansion. Furthermore, the expression levels of endogenous NSC markers, silencing of transgenes, and in vitro differentiation potential were also different between iNSC lines from different strains. Therefore, our data suggest that the genetic background of starting cells influences the conversion efficiency as well as reprogramming status of directly converted iNSCs.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cell fate transition", "Direct conversion", "Direct reprogramming", "Genetic backgrounds", "INSCs"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Cell Differentiation", "Cells, Cultured", "Cellular Reprogramming", "Collagen Type I", "Fibroblasts", "Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Microscopy, Fluorescence", "Nestin", "Neural Stem Cells", "Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction", "Transcription Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84959323426", "SubjectAreas": [["Developmental Biology", "BIOC", "1309"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"57193017198": {"Name": "Kim S.M.", "AuthorID": "57193017198", "AffiliationID": "60000142", "AffiliationName": "Department of Animal Biotechnology, Konkuk University"}, "55479978400": {"Name": "Lim K.T.", "AuthorID": "55479978400", "AffiliationID": "60000142", "AffiliationName": "Department of Stem Cell Biology, School of Medicine, Konkuk University"}, "57147133100": {"Name": "Kwak T.H.", "AuthorID": "57147133100", "AffiliationID": "60000142", "AffiliationName": "Department of Stem Cell Biology, School of Medicine, Konkuk University"}, "57203597151": {"Name": "Lee S.C.", "AuthorID": "57203597151", "AffiliationID": "60000142", "AffiliationName": "Department of Stem Cell Biology, School of Medicine, Konkuk University"}, "57146536500": {"Name": "Im J.H.", "AuthorID": "57146536500", "AffiliationID": "60000142", "AffiliationName": "Department of Stem Cell Biology, School of Medicine, Konkuk University"}, "57148502500": {"Name": "Hali S.", "AuthorID": "57148502500", "AffiliationID": "60000142", "AffiliationName": "Department of Stem Cell Biology, School of Medicine, Konkuk University"}, "56937420800": {"Name": "In Hwang S.", "AuthorID": "56937420800", "AffiliationID": "60000142", "AffiliationName": "Department of Stem Cell Biology, School of Medicine, Konkuk University"}, "24166660400": {"Name": "Ko K.", "AuthorID": "24166660400", "AffiliationID": "60000142", "AffiliationName": "KU Open-Innovation Center, Institute of Biomedical Science and Technology, Konkuk University"}, "8356971600": {"Name": "Chung H.M.", "AuthorID": "8356971600", "AffiliationID": "60000142", "AffiliationName": "KU Open-Innovation Center, Institute of Biomedical Science and Technology, Konkuk University"}, "55757783929": {"Name": "Han D.W.", "AuthorID": "55757783929", "AffiliationID": "60000142", "AffiliationName": "KU Open-Innovation Center, Institute of Biomedical Science and Technology, Konkuk University"}, "56454623200": {"Name": "Hwang J.", "AuthorID": "56454623200", "AffiliationID": "60000142", "AffiliationName": "Department of Animal Biotechnology, Konkuk University"}, "55667254800": {"Name": "Lee H.T.", "AuthorID": "55667254800", "AffiliationID": "60000142", "AffiliationName": "Department of Animal Biotechnology, Konkuk University"}, "57221129444": {"Name": "Kim D.", "AuthorID": "57221129444", "AffiliationID": "117099036", "AffiliationName": "Dong-A Socio Holdings Research Center"}, "46062015400": {"Name": "Kim K.P.", "AuthorID": "46062015400", "AffiliationID": "60026166", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, Max Planck Institute for Molecular Biomedicine"}, "7005672005": {"Name": "Sch\u00f6ler H.R.", "AuthorID": "7005672005", "AffiliationID": "60000401", "AffiliationName": "University of M\u00fcnster, Medical Faculty"}, "7404002295": {"Name": "Chung H.J.", "AuthorID": "7404002295", "AffiliationID": "60068698", "AffiliationName": "Animal Biotechnology Division, National Institute of Animal Science, RDA"}, "24166866700": {"Name": "Kim J.B.", "AuthorID": "24166866700", "AffiliationID": "60103153", "AffiliationName": "School of Life Sciences, Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology (UNIST)"}}}
