HyperPP and myotonia are caused by NaV1.4 channel overactivity and overlap clinically. Instead, hypoPP is caused by gating pore currents through the voltage sensing domains (VSDs) of NaV1.4 and seldom co-exists clinically with myotonia. Recessive loss-of-function NaV1.4 mutations have been described in congenital myopathy and myasthenic syndromes. We report two families with the NaV1.4 mutation p.R1451L, located in VSD-IV. Heterozygous carriers in both families manifest with myotonia and/or hyperPP. In contrast, a homozygous case presents with both hypoPP and myotonia, but unlike carriers of recessive NaV1.4 mutations does not manifest symptoms of myopathy or myasthenia. Functional analysis revealed reduced current density and enhanced closed state inactivation of the mutant channel, but no evidence for gating pore currents. The rate of recovery from inactivation was hastened, explaining the myotonia in p.R1451L carriers and the absence of myasthenic presentations in the homozygous proband. Our data suggest that recessive loss-of-function NaV1.4 variants can present with hypoPP without congenital myopathy or myasthenia and that myotonia can present even in carriers of homozygous NaV1.4 loss-of-function mutations.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Animals", "Electrophysiology", "HEK293 Cells", "Heterozygote", "High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing", "Homozygote", "Humans", "Hypokalemic Periodic Paralysis", "Male", "Mutation", "Myotonia", "NAV1.4 Voltage-Gated Sodium Channel", "Pedigree", "Protein Structure, Secondary", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85049212262", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"37109732500": {"Name": "Luo S.", "AuthorID": "37109732500", "AffiliationID": "60073628, 60009860", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, North Huashan Hospital, Fudan University"}, "57203521175": {"Name": "Sun J.", "AuthorID": "57203521175", "AffiliationID": "60073628, 60009860", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Huashan Hospital, Fudan University"}, "57191979923": {"Name": "Song J.", "AuthorID": "57191979923", "AffiliationID": "60073628, 60009860", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Huashan Hospital, Fudan University"}, "56941996200": {"Name": "Lu J.", "AuthorID": "56941996200", "AffiliationID": "60073628, 60009860", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Huashan Hospital, Fudan University"}, "7403564721": {"Name": "Zhao C.", "AuthorID": "7403564721", "AffiliationID": "117003788", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Jing'An District Center Hospital of Shanghai"}, "55754257600": {"Name": "Sampedro Casta\u00f1eda M.", "AuthorID": "55754257600", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Neuromuscular Diseases, Department of Molecular Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "35985840100": {"Name": "Matthews E.", "AuthorID": "35985840100", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Neuromuscular Diseases, Department of Molecular Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "7003734430": {"Name": "Sud R.", "AuthorID": "7003734430", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Neuromuscular Diseases, Department of Molecular Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "15075798500": {"Name": "Hanna M.", "AuthorID": "15075798500", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Neuromuscular Diseases, Department of Molecular Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "6507769109": {"Name": "M\u00e4nnikk\u00f6 R.", "AuthorID": "6507769109", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Neuromuscular Diseases, Department of Molecular Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "8864085200": {"Name": "Qiao K.", "AuthorID": "8864085200", "AffiliationID": "60073628, 60009860", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Electrophysiology, Institute of Neurology, Huashan Hospital, Fudan University"}}}
