Induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology, together with advances in 2D and 3D neuronal differentiation, offers a unique opportunity to overcome this challenge and generate a limitless supply of human neurons for in vitro studies. iPSC-neuron models have been widely employed to model AD and we discuss in this review the progress that has been made to date using patient-derived neurons to recapitulate key aspects of AD pathology and how these models have contributed to a deeper understanding of AD molecular mechanisms, as well as addressing the key challenges posed by using this technology and what progress is being made to overcome these. Finally, we highlight future directions for the use of iPSC-neurons in AD research and highlight the potential value of this technology to neurodegenerative research in the coming years.", "AuthorKeywords": ["3D cerebral organoids", "Alzheimer's disease", "Induced pluripotent stem cells", "Neuronal differentiation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Alzheimer Disease", "Animals", "Batch Cell Culture Techniques", "Cells, Cultured", "Disease Models, Animal", "Humans", "Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells", "Neural Stem Cells", "Organoids", "Tissue Engineering"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85020743827", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"]], "AuthorData": {"53163080800": {"Name": "Arber C.", "AuthorID": "53163080800", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "57194546145": {"Name": "Lovejoy C.", "AuthorID": "57194546145", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "19934657400": {"Name": "Wray S.", "AuthorID": "19934657400", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology"}}}
