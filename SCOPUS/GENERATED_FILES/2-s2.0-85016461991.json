Centrifugal partition chromatography (CPC) is used here, as an alternative to multiple resin chromatography steps, to fractionate component monosaccharides from crude hydrolysed sugar beet pulp pectin. CPC separation of samples, prepared in the stationary phase, was carried out using an ethanol: ammonium sulphate (300 g L\u22121) phase system (0.8:1.8 v:v) in ascending mode. This enabled removal of crude feedstream impurities and separation of monosaccharides into three fractions (L-rhamnose, L-arabinose and D-galactose, and D-galacturonic acid) in a single step. Throughput was improved three-fold by increasing sample injection volume, from 4 to 16% of column volume, with similar separation performance maintained in all cases. Extrusion of the final galacturonic acid fraction increased the eluted solute concentration, reduced the total separation time by 24% and removed the need for further column regeneration. Reproducibility of the separation after extrusion was validated by using multiple stacked injections. Scale-up was performed linearly from a semi-preparative 250 mL column to a preparative 950 mL column with a scale-up ratio of 3.8 applied to mobile phase flow rate and sample injection volume. Throughputs of 9.4 g L\u22121 h\u22121 of total dissolved solids were achieved at the preparative scale with a throughput of 1.9 g L\u22121 h\u22121 of component monosaccharides. These results demonstrate the potential of CPC for both impurity removal and target fractionation within biorefinery separations.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Biorefinery", "Centrifugal partition chromatography", "Monosaccharides", "Scale-up", "Sugar beet pulp"], "IndexKeywords": ["Biorefineries", "Centrifugal partition chromatography", "Monosaccharides", "Scale-up", "Sugar beet pulp", "Beta vulgaris", "Centrifugation", "Chemical Fractionation", "Chromatography, Liquid", "Hexuronic Acids", "Hydrolysis", "Monosaccharides", "Pectins", "Reproducibility of Results"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85016461991", "SubjectAreas": [["Analytical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1602"], ["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Organic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1605"]], "AuthorData": {"56789424600": {"Name": "Ward D.", "AuthorID": "56789424600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "The Advanced Centre for Biochemical Engineering, Department of Biochemical Engineering, University College London"}, "55004882700": {"Name": "C\u00e1rdenas-Fern\u00e1ndez M.", "AuthorID": "55004882700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "The Advanced Centre for Biochemical Engineering, Department of Biochemical Engineering, University College London"}, "7004669230": {"Name": "Lye G.", "AuthorID": "7004669230", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "The Advanced Centre for Biochemical Engineering, Department of Biochemical Engineering, University College London"}, "23984568300": {"Name": "Hewitson P.", "AuthorID": "23984568300", "AffiliationID": "60020623", "AffiliationName": "Advanced Bioprocessing Centre, Department of Mechanical, Aerospace & Civil Engineering, Brunel University London"}, "6602187050": {"Name": "Ignatova S.", "AuthorID": "6602187050", "AffiliationID": "60020623", "AffiliationName": "Advanced Bioprocessing Centre, Department of Mechanical, Aerospace & Civil Engineering, Brunel University London"}, "57163711800": {"Name": "Hamley-Bennett C.", "AuthorID": "57163711800", "AffiliationID": "60030480", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biology and Biochemistry, University of Bath"}, "7007046907": {"Name": "Leak D.", "AuthorID": "7007046907", "AffiliationID": "60030480", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biology and Biochemistry, University of Bath"}, "8672955100": {"Name": "D\u00edaz-Rodr\u00edguez A.", "AuthorID": "8672955100", "AffiliationID": "60020649", "AffiliationName": "GlaxoSmithKline R&D Ltd., Medicines Research Centre"}, "36918216700": {"Name": "Douillet N.", "AuthorID": "36918216700", "AffiliationID": "60020649", "AffiliationName": "GlaxoSmithKline R&D Ltd., Medicines Research Centre"}, "57212545860": {"Name": "Adams J.", "AuthorID": "57212545860", "AffiliationID": "60020649", "AffiliationName": "GlaxoSmithKline R&D Ltd., Medicines Research Centre"}}}
