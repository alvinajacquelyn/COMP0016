Any improper formulation or contamination in the fermentation may change the kinetic model parameters and lead to a process fault. In this work, a square system of parametric nonlinear algebraic equations is formulated and solved symbolically to obtain the kinetic model parameters as an explicit function of measurements, so as to estimate the parameters to detect and diagnose the faults in fermentation processes. A number of scenarios are considered to show the effectiveness of the presented approach. The proposed approach successfully estimates the model parameters and detects the faults in the system.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Fault detection", "fermentation", "multiparametric programming", "parameter estimation"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85049321543", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"]], "AuthorData": {"25655179600": {"Name": "Mid E.C.", "AuthorID": "25655179600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, Centre of Process System Engineering (CPSE), University College London"}, "7005602392": {"Name": "Dua V.", "AuthorID": "7005602392", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, Centre of Process System Engineering (CPSE), University College London"}}}
