Our results show that it does not. The after-image, just like the color itself, depends on the ratio of light of different wavebands reflected from it and its surrounds. Hence, traditional accounts of after-images as being the result of retinal adaptation or the perceptual result of physiological opponency, are inadequate. We propose instead that the color of after-images is generated after colors themselves are generated in the visual brain.", "AuthorKeywords": ["After-images", "Color", "Color constancy", "Vision"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85018922641", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuropsychology and Physiological Psychology", "PSYC", "3206"], ["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"], ["Biological Psychiatry", "NEUR", "2803"], ["Behavioral Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2802"]], "AuthorData": {"7005938062": {"Name": "Zeki S.", "AuthorID": "7005938062", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Neurobiology, University College London"}, "24343136400": {"Name": "Cheadle S.", "AuthorID": "24343136400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Neurobiology, University College London"}, "57214376034": {"Name": "Pepper J.", "AuthorID": "57214376034", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Neurobiology, University College London"}, "36667144700": {"Name": "Mylonas D.", "AuthorID": "36667144700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Neurobiology, University College London"}}}
