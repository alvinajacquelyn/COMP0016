All rights reserved.The objective of this case report is to illustrate the diagnosis and classification of periodontitis according to the 2017 classification system as recommended in the British Society of Periodontology (BSP) implementation plan. We describe two cases in the form of a pair of siblings, who developed periodontitis very early in life. A 19-year-old female was diagnosed with \u2018generalised periodontitis; stage III/grade C; currently unstable\u2019. Her 14-year-old sister was diagnosed with \u2018localised periodontitis; stage II, grade C; currently unstable\u2019. The present case report presents an example for the application of the new classification system and illustrates the importance of a periodontal check for children and adolescents and/or their relatives.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Child", "Female", "Humans", "Periodontal Diseases", "Periodontics", "Periodontitis", "Siblings", "Societies", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85059828487", "SubjectAreas": [["Dentistry (all)", "DENT", "3500"]], "AuthorData": {"56182692200": {"Name": "Walter C.", "AuthorID": "56182692200", "AffiliationID": "60023588", "AffiliationName": "Department of Periodontology, Endodontology and Cariology, University of Basel"}, "7003386333": {"Name": "Chapple I.L.C.", "AuthorID": "7003386333", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "Department of Periodontology, The School of Dentistry, University of Birmingham"}, "9535750500": {"Name": "Milward M.R.", "AuthorID": "9535750500", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "Department of Periodontology, The School of Dentistry, University of Birmingham"}, "7006403752": {"Name": "Dietrich T.", "AuthorID": "7006403752", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "Department of Oral Surgery, The School of Dentistry, University of Birmingham"}, "6507666068": {"Name": "Ower P.", "AuthorID": "6507666068", "AffiliationID": "121951348", "AffiliationName": "Periocourses Ltd"}, "55869687800": {"Name": "Tank M.", "AuthorID": "55869687800", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "7103330591": {"Name": "West N.X.", "AuthorID": "7103330591", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "Periodontology Clinical Trials Group, University of Bristol"}, "35848742100": {"Name": "Needleman I.", "AuthorID": "35848742100", "AffiliationID": "60013985, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Periodontology, Eastman Dental Institute, University College London"}, "7103094094": {"Name": "Hughes F.J.", "AuthorID": "7103094094", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Host Microbial Interactions, Dental Institute, Kings College London"}, "56319112300": {"Name": "Wadia R.", "AuthorID": "56319112300", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "RW Perio and King\u2019s College London"}, "55411744500": {"Name": "Hodge P.J.", "AuthorID": "55411744500", "AffiliationID": "60001490, 60019759", "AffiliationName": "Department of Periodontology, Dental School, University of Glasgow"}, "null": {"Name": null, "AuthorID": null, "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
