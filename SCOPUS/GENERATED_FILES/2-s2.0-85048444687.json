Though viewed sympathetically by a small minority of commentators, the majority verdict has been that Sartre\u2019s ethical rhetoric, his assertion of human freedom as a supreme value, deflates on examination and leaves behind a radical subjectivism indistinguishable from moral nihilism. On the standard construal, Sartre allows nothing to figure as a ground of value save the individual\u2019s bare consciousness of their own power of self-determination, and in consequence the Sartrean subject is required to make a rationally ungrounded choice in favour of some or other arbitrary value, commitment to which is unconditional yet can be maintained only through sheer force of will. Sartre may then be regarded as exemplary of the predicament of late modern ethics, committed to the infinite value of the individual but without any theological or other supporting context for this doctrine, or alternatively, as an object-lesson in the impossibility of upholding a broadly Kantian view of the centrality of individual freedom to morality without the accompanying apparatus of Kant\u2019s pure practical reason and metaphysics of the intelligible. If this judgement is correct, then a cruel irony afflicts Sartre\u2019s philosophical project as a whole, which aims precisely to steer phenomenology in an ethical direction. From his earliest writings, which broach particular topics in theoretical philosophy on account of their perceived practical implications, Sartre regarded philosophical enquiry as addressing the question of how one should lead one\u2019s life, paralleling his treatment in literature of the vicissitudes of human aspiration. Various circumstantial facts help to explain the predominantly negative reception of Sartre\u2019s ethics, above all, the absence of any single published text in which his position receives the kind of detailed exposition and defence with which the phenomenological ontology of Being and Nothingness is equipped. The chief obstacle to a correct appreciation of Sartre\u2019s contribution to moral thought, however, lies in the failure to recognize the nature of the strategy he employs, which is of a kind not currently favoured or even regarded as viable. Sartre\u2019s ethics are grounded in a theoretical, indeed a metaphysical account, not simply of human beings but of Being as such and in general. These metaphysics are moreover highly revisionary, and fiercely anti-naturalistic.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85048444687", "SubjectAreas": [["Arts and Humanities (all)", "ARTS", "1200"]], "AuthorData": {"26032865200": {"Name": "Gardner S.", "AuthorID": "26032865200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Philosophy, University College London"}}}
