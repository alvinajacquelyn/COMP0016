Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.This paper is the first of two linked papers that focus on the work of the Royal Fine Art Commission (RFAC), which, for three quarters of a century, held the mantel of the UK Government\u2019s advisor on design in the built environment for England and Wales. The paper draws on archival and documentary evidence to explore the important work and concerns of the RFAC from its creation in 1924 and its early years, through to the post-war construction boom and into the 1980s and a new less paternalistic era of government. Analysis of the archives is supplemented by what the limited available literature tells us about the RFAC. As the instigator of a national design review service covering England and Wales, the work of the RFAC forms an important context for understanding more recent approaches to design review, both in the UK and internationally, that today form a critical component of contemporary planning practices.", "AuthorKeywords": ["design governance", "design review", "Royal Fine Art Commission"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85012879796", "SubjectAreas": [["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"]], "AuthorData": {"7102234035": {"Name": "Carmona M.", "AuthorID": "7102234035", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "The Bartlett School of Planning, University College London"}, "57193317367": {"Name": "Renninger A.", "AuthorID": "57193317367", "AffiliationID": "60030162", "AffiliationName": "Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation, Columbia University"}}}
