In the earlier work [14], it was shown that a metric in a fixed conformal class is uniquely determined by boundary measurements under two conditions: (1) the metric is conformally transversally anisotropic (CTA), and (2) the transversal manifold is simple. In this paper we will consider geometries satisfying (1) but not (2). The first main result states that the boundary measurements uniquely determine a mixed Fourier transform/attenuated geodesic ray transform (or integral against a more general semiclassical limit measure) of an unknown coefficient. In particular, one obtains uniqueness results whenever the geodesic ray transform on the transversal manifold is injective. The second result shows that the boundary measurements in an infinite cylinder uniquely determine the transversal metric. The first result is proved by using complex geometrical optics solutions involving Gaussian beam quasimodes, and the second result follows from a connection between the Calder\u00f3n problem and Gel'fand's inverse problem for the wave equation and the boundary control method.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Boundary control method", "Calder\u00f3n problem", "Complex geometrical optics solution", "Inverse boundary value problem", "Riemannian manifold"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84991687891", "SubjectAreas": [["Mathematics (all)", "MATH", "2600"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"9249591400": {"Name": "Dos Santos Ferreira D.", "AuthorID": "9249591400", "AffiliationID": "60104289, 60008134, 60001659", "AffiliationName": "Institut \u00c9lie Cartan, UMR 7502, Universit\u00e9 de Lorraine, CNRS, Campus des Aiguillettes"}, "6602606312": {"Name": "Kurylev Y.", "AuthorID": "6602606312", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University College London"}, "6604064173": {"Name": "Lassas M.", "AuthorID": "6604064173", "AffiliationID": "60002952", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics and Statistics, University of Helsinki"}, "8928446300": {"Name": "Salo M.", "AuthorID": "8928446300", "AffiliationID": "60032398", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics and Statistics, University of Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4"}}}
