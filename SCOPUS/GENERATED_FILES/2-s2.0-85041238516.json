To our knowledge, this is the first study to determine whether this seasonality exists in the UK, identify the peak months and describe seasonality by age. The monthly number of UTI consultations (N = 992 803) and nitrofurantoin and trimethoprim prescriptions (N = 1 719 416) during 2008-2015 was extracted from The Health Improvement Network (THIN), a large nationally representative UK dataset of electronic patient records. Negative binomial regression models were fitted to these data to investigate seasonal fluctuations by age group (14-17, 18-24, 25-45, 46-69, 70-84, 85+) and by sex, accounting for a change in the rate of UTI over the study period. A September to November peak in UTI consultation incidence was observed for ages 14-69. This seasonality progressively faded in older age groups and no seasonality was found in individuals aged 85+, in whom UTIs were most common. UTIs were rare in males but followed a similar seasonal pattern than in females. We show strong evidence of an autumnal seasonality for UTIs in individuals under 70 years of age and a lack of seasonality in the very old. These findings should provide helpful information when interpreting surveillance reports and the results of interventions against UTI.", "AuthorKeywords": ["seasonality", "The Health Improvement Network", "Urinary tract infections (UTIs)"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Age Factors", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Anti-Infective Agents, Urinary", "Drug Prescriptions", "Female", "Humans", "Incidence", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Nitrofurantoin", "Referral and Consultation", "Seasons", "Trimethoprim", "United Kingdom", "Urinary Tract Infections", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85041238516", "SubjectAreas": [["Epidemiology", "MEDI", "2713"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"57004670200": {"Name": "Rosello A.", "AuthorID": "57004670200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Health Informatics, Farr Institute of Health Informatics Research, UCL"}, "55307519300": {"Name": "Pouwels K.B.", "AuthorID": "55307519300", "AffiliationID": "60020413, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Outbreak Analysis and Modelling, Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, Imperial College School of Public Health"}, "7006629230": {"Name": "Robotham J.V.", "AuthorID": "7006629230", "AffiliationID": "113770836", "AffiliationName": "Modelling and Economics Unit, National Infection Service, PHE"}, "12765885300": {"Name": "Smieszek T.", "AuthorID": "12765885300", "AffiliationID": "60020413, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Outbreak Analysis and Modelling, Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, Imperial College School of Public Health"}, "35944648500": {"Name": "Hayward A.C.", "AuthorID": "35944648500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Epidemiology and Health Care, UCL"}, "57193661993": {"Name": "Domenech De Cell\u00e8s M.", "AuthorID": "57193661993", "AffiliationID": "60029937, 60106096, 60000905, 60001772", "AffiliationName": "Biostatistics, Biomathematics, Pharmacoepidemiology and Infectious Diseases unit, B2PHI, UMR1181, Inserm, Universit\u00e9 de Versailles Saint Quentin, Institut Pasteur"}, "24923054200": {"Name": "Opatowski L.", "AuthorID": "24923054200", "AffiliationID": "60029937, 60106096, 60000905, 60001772", "AffiliationName": "Biostatistics, Biomathematics, Pharmacoepidemiology and Infectious Diseases unit, B2PHI, UMR1181, Inserm, Universit\u00e9 de Versailles Saint Quentin, Institut Pasteur"}, "55775315400": {"Name": "Van Kleef E.", "AuthorID": "55775315400", "AffiliationID": "60008936, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Tropical Medicine and Global Health, Nuffield Department of Clinical Medicine, University of Oxford"}, "7202260726": {"Name": "Hopkins S.", "AuthorID": "7202260726", "AffiliationID": "113770836", "AffiliationName": "Healthcare Assoc.
