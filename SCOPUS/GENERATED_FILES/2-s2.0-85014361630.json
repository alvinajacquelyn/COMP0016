Among the major elements, Mg/Si ratios ranging from \u00e2 1/40.9-1.1, such as in rocky Solar-System building blocks (or chondrites), to \u00e2 1/41.2-1.3, such as in upper-mantle rocks (or pyrolite), have been proposed. Geophysical evidence for subducted lithosphere deep in the mantle has been interpreted in terms of efficient mixing, and thus homogenous Mg/Si across most of the mantle. However, previous models did not consider the effects of variable Mg/Si on the viscosity and mixing efficiency of lower-mantle rocks. Here, we use geodynamic models to show that large-scale heterogeneity associated with a 20-fold change in viscosity, such as due to the dominance of intrinsically strong (Mg, Fe)SiO 3-bridgmanite in low-Mg/Si domains, is sufficient to prevent efficient mantle mixing, even on large scales. Models predict that intrinsically strong domains stabilize mantle convection patterns, and coherently persist at depths of about 1,000-2,200 km up to the present-day, separated by relatively narrow up-/downwelling conduits of pyrolitic material. The stable manifestation of such bridgmanite-enriched ancient mantle structures (BEAMS) may reconcile the geographical fixity of deep-rooted mantle upwelling centres, and geophysical changes in seismic-Tomography patterns, radial viscosity, rising plumes and sinking slabs near 1,000 km depth. Moreover, these ancient structures may provide a reservoir to host primordial geochemical signatures.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85014361630", "SubjectAreas": [["Earth and Planetary Sciences (all)", "EART", "1900"]], "AuthorData": {"23491568800": {"Name": "Ballmer M.D.", "AuthorID": "23491568800", "AffiliationID": "60025858", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Geophysics, ETH Zurich"}, "8625726600": {"Name": "Houser C.", "AuthorID": "8625726600", "AffiliationID": "60031126", "AffiliationName": "Earth-Life Science Institute, Tokyo Institute of Technology"}, "23034362100": {"Name": "Hernlund J.W.", "AuthorID": "23034362100", "AffiliationID": "60031126", "AffiliationName": "Earth-Life Science Institute, Tokyo Institute of Technology"}, "7003337066": {"Name": "Wentzcovitch R.M.", "AuthorID": "7003337066", "AffiliationID": "60033011, 60030162", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences, Columbia University, Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory"}, "7403255090": {"Name": "Hirose K.", "AuthorID": "7403255090", "AffiliationID": "60031126", "AffiliationName": "Earth-Life Science Institute, Tokyo Institute of Technology"}}}
