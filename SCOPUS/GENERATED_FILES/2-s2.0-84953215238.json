Although some macro effects are known, the underlying mechanisms are still not clear. tDCS in combination with electroencephalography (EEG) could help to understand these mechanisms from a neural point of view. However, simultaneous tDCS-EEG still remains challenging because of the artifacts that affect the recorded signals. In this paper, an automated artifact cancelation method based on adaptive filtering is proposed. Using independent component analysis (ICA), the artifacts were characterized using data from both a phantom and a group of healthy subjects. The resulting filter can successfully remove tDCS-related artifacts during anodal and cathodal stimulations.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Artifacts", "Brain", "Electrodes", "Electroencephalography", "Humans", "Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84953215238", "SubjectAreas": [["Signal Processing", "COMP", "1711"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"], ["Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition", "COMP", "1707"], ["Health Informatics", "MEDI", "2718"]], "AuthorData": {"56647524300": {"Name": "Mancini M.", "AuthorID": "56647524300", "AffiliationID": "60012630", "AffiliationName": "Department of Engineering, University of Rome 'Roma Tre'"}, "54787500100": {"Name": "De Marchis C.", "AuthorID": "54787500100", "AffiliationID": "60012630", "AffiliationName": "Department of Engineering, University of Rome 'Roma Tre'"}, "6602688693": {"Name": "Conforto S.", "AuthorID": "6602688693", "AffiliationID": "60012630", "AffiliationName": "Department of Engineering, University of Rome 'Roma Tre'"}, "6504027566": {"Name": "Pellicciari M.", "AuthorID": "6504027566", "AffiliationID": "60084291", "AffiliationName": "Cognitive Neuroscience Section, IRCCS Centro San Giovanni di Dio Fatebenefratelli"}, "15841746500": {"Name": "Brignani D.", "AuthorID": "15841746500", "AffiliationID": "60084291", "AffiliationName": "Cognitive Neuroscience Section, IRCCS Centro San Giovanni di Dio Fatebenefratelli"}, "55599535400": {"Name": "Mauri P.", "AuthorID": "55599535400", "AffiliationID": "60084291", "AffiliationName": "Cognitive Neuroscience Section, IRCCS Centro San Giovanni di Dio Fatebenefratelli"}, "6701382246": {"Name": "Miniussi C.", "AuthorID": "6701382246", "AffiliationID": "60015300", "AffiliationName": "Neuroscience Section, Department of Clinical and Experimental Sciences, University of Brescia"}}}
