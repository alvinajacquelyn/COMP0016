Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd.Neural tube closure has been studied for many decades, across a range of vertebrates, as a paradigm of embryonic morphogenesis. Neurulation is of particular interest in view of the severe congenital malformations \u2013 \u2018neural tube defects\u2019 \u2013 that result when closure fails. The process of neural tube closure is complex and involves cellular events such as convergent extension, apical constriction and interkinetic nuclear migration, as well as precise molecular control via the non-canonical Wnt/planar cell polarity pathway, Shh/BMP signalling, and the transcription factors Grhl2/3, Pax3, Cdx2 and Zic2. More recently, biomechanical inputs into neural tube morphogenesis have also been identified. Here, we review these cellular, molecular and biomechanical mechanisms involved in neural tube closure, based on studies of various vertebrate species, focusing on the most recent advances in the field.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cell protrusions", "Convergent extension", "Cytoskeleton", "Extracellular matrix", "Morphogenesis", "Neural tube", "Neural tube defects", "Neurulation", "Planar cell polarity", "Proteases", "Spina bifida"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Body Patterning", "Cell Movement", "Cell Polarity", "Embryonic Development", "Fibronectins", "Humans", "Laminin", "Morphogenesis", "Neural Tube", "Neural Tube Defects", "Neurulation", "Proteoglycans", "Risk Factors", "Signal Transduction", "Stress, Mechanical", "Transcription Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85012975343", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Developmental Biology", "BIOC", "1309"]], "AuthorData": {"36167171100": {"Name": "Nikolopoulou E.", "AuthorID": "36167171100", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Newlife Birth Defects Research Centre, Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "37026041900": {"Name": "Galea G.", "AuthorID": "37026041900", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Newlife Birth Defects Research Centre, Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "24725761200": {"Name": "Rolo A.", "AuthorID": "24725761200", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Newlife Birth Defects Research Centre, Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "35587452100": {"Name": "Greene N.", "AuthorID": "35587452100", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Newlife Birth Defects Research Centre, Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "7006634311": {"Name": "Copp A.", "AuthorID": "7006634311", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Newlife Birth Defects Research Centre, Institute of Child Health, University College London"}}}
