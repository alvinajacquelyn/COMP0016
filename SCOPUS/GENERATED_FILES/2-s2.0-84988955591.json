Child Development published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. on behalf of Society for Research in Child Development, Inc.Adolescents\u2019 evaluations of discriminatory race-based humor and their expectations about peer responses to discrimination were investigated in 8th- (Mage = 13.80) and 10th-grade (Mage = 16.11) primarily European-American participants (N = 256). Older adolescents judged race-based humor as more acceptable than did younger adolescents and were less likely to expect peer intervention. Participants who rejected discrimination were more likely to reference welfare/rights and prejudice and to anticipate that peers would intervene. Showing awareness of group processes, adolescents who rejected race-based humor believed that peers who intervened would be more likely to be excluded. They also disapproved of exclusion more than did participants who supported race-based humor. Results expose the complexity of situations involving subtle discrimination. Implications for bullying interventions are discussed.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84988955591", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"]], "AuthorData": {"38361984100": {"Name": "Mulvey K.L.", "AuthorID": "38361984100", "AffiliationID": "60018179", "AffiliationName": "University of South Carolina"}, "50262839800": {"Name": "Palmer S.B.", "AuthorID": "50262839800", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "University of London, UCL Institute of Education"}, "7101975318": {"Name": "Abrams D.", "AuthorID": "7101975318", "AffiliationID": "60010818", "AffiliationName": "University of Kent"}}}
