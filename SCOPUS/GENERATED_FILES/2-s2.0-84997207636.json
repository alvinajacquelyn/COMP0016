Large-scale problems can efficiently be solved with Boundary Element Methods (BEM) of which the Method of Moments (MoM) has found widespread use in the computational electromagnetics community. The framework of integral equations allows for the design of many different formulations for a wide range of scattering problems. Most of them are a clever combination of the basic electric and magnetic field integral operators. In this paper, the open-source library BEM++ will be used as a powerful tool to build different integral equation formulations and preconditioners.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Electric and magnetic fields", "Electromagnetic scattering", "Integral equation formulation", "Integral equation methods", "Method of moments (MOM)", "Open-source libraries", "Scattering problems", "Surface integral equations"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84997207636", "SubjectAreas": [["Instrumentation", "PHYS", "3105"], ["Radiation", "PHYS", "3108"], ["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"]], "AuthorData": {"36680757900": {"Name": "Van'T Wout E.", "AuthorID": "36680757900", "AffiliationID": "60029681", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering, Pontificia Universidad Cat\u00f3lica de Chile"}, "23102173100": {"Name": "Betcke T.", "AuthorID": "23102173100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University College London"}, "57192094932": {"Name": "Scroggs M.", "AuthorID": "57192094932", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University College London"}}}
