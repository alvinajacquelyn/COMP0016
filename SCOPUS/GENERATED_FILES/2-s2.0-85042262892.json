Methods: Two patients with medically refractory SUNCT underwent MVD following beneficial but incomplete response to neuromodulation (occipital nerve stimulation and deep brain stimulation). MRI confirmed neurovascular conflict with the ipsilateral trigeminal nerve in both patients. Results: Although neuromodulation provided significant benefit, it did not deliver complete relief from pain and management required numerous postoperative visits with adjustment of medication and stimulation parameters. Conversely, MVD was successful in eliminating symptoms of SUNCT in both patients with no need for further medical treatment or neuromodulation. Conclusion: Neuromodulation requires expensive hardware and lifelong follow-up and maintenance. These case reports highlight that microvascular decompression may be preferable to neuromodulation in the subset of SUNCT patients with ipsilateral neurovascular conflict.", "AuthorKeywords": ["microvascular decompression", "neuromodulation", "SUNCT", "trigeminal nerve"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Humans", "Male", "Microvascular Decompression Surgery", "SUNCT Syndrome", "Transcutaneous Electric Nerve Stimulation", "Trigeminal Nerve"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85042262892", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"57200722424": {"Name": "Hassan S.", "AuthorID": "57200722424", "AffiliationID": "60020736", "AffiliationName": "Victor Horsley Department of Neurosurgery, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "17136524800": {"Name": "Zrinzo L.", "AuthorID": "17136524800", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Unit of Functional Neurosurgery, Sobell Department of Motor Neuroscience and Movement Disorders, UCL Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "55391746100": {"Name": "Lagrata S.", "AuthorID": "55391746100", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60019953", "AffiliationName": "Headache Group, UCL Institute of Neurology and National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "57200728513": {"Name": "Levy A.", "AuthorID": "57200728513", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60019953", "AffiliationName": "Headache Group, UCL Institute of Neurology and National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "6701699175": {"Name": "Matharu M.", "AuthorID": "6701699175", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60019953", "AffiliationName": "Headache Group, UCL Institute of Neurology and National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}}}
