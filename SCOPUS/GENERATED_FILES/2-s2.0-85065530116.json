MRI offers an in vivo method of measuring structural and functional brain change. The images collected via MRI are processed to measure different anatomical features, such as brain volume, macro- and microstructural changes within white matter and functional brain activity. Structural imaging has demonstrated significant volume loss across multiple white and gray matter regions in HD, particularly within subcortical structures. There also appears to be increasing disorganization of white matter tracts and between-region connectivity with increasing disease progression. Finally, functional changes are thought to represent changes in brain activity underlying compensatory mechanisms in HD. This chapter will provide an overview of the principles of MRI and practicalities associated with using MRI in HD studies, and summarize findings from MRI studies investigating brain structure and function in HD.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Diffusion MRI", "Functional MRI", "Huntington's disease", "Magnetic resonance imaging", "Structural MRI"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Artifacts", "Brain", "Humans", "Huntington Disease", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Neuroimaging", "Research Design"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85065530116", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Medicine", "BIOC", "1313"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"]], "AuthorData": {"57208140593": {"Name": "Johnson E.B.", "AuthorID": "57208140593", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Huntington's Disease Centre, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "56785241700": {"Name": "Gregory S.", "AuthorID": "56785241700", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Huntington's Disease Centre, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology, University College London"}}}
