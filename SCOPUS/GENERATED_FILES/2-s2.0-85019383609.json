However, large-scale production is susceptible to pathogen-mediated destruction particularly in developing economies. Thus, a thorough understanding of the immune system components of food crop species is imperative for research to combat pathogens. Results: Through a comparative genomics approach utilising extant data from 55 species, we describe the innate immune system of the class Malacostraca, which includes all food crop species. We identify 7407 malacostracan genes from 39 gene families implicated in different aspects of host defence and demonstrate dynamic evolution of innate immunity components within this group. Malacostracans have achieved flexibility in recognising infectious agents through divergent evolution and expansion of pathogen recognition receptors genes. Antiviral RNAi, Toll and JAK-STAT signal transduction pathways have remained conserved within Malacostraca, although the Imd pathway appears to lack several key components. Immune effectors such as the antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have unique evolutionary profiles, with many malacostracan AMPs not found in other arthropods. Lastly, we describe four putative novel immune gene families, potentially representing important evolutionary novelties of the malacostracan immune system. Conclusion: Our analyses across the broader Malacostraca have allowed us to not only draw analogies with other arthropods but also to identify evolutionary novelties in immune modulation components and form strong hypotheses as to when key pathways have evolved or diverged. This will serve as a key resource for future immunology research in crustacean food crops.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Arthropoda", "Comparative genomics", "Crustacean", "Evolution", "Innate immunity", "Malacostraca"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Conserved Sequence", "Crustacea", "Evolution, Molecular", "Genomics", "Immunity, Innate", "Signal Transduction"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85019383609", "SubjectAreas": [["Biotechnology", "BIOC", "1305"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"]], "AuthorData": {"57193996849": {"Name": "Lai A.", "AuthorID": "57193996849", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "University of Oxford, Department of Zoology"}, "6507411601": {"Name": "Aboobaker A.", "AuthorID": "6507411601", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "University of Oxford, Department of Zoology"}}}
