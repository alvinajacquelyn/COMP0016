The critical involvement of the superior colliculus (SC)\u2014the central structure in the midbrain network\u2014in visuospatial attention has been shown by four seminal, published studies in monkeys (Macaca mulatta) performing multialternative tasks. However, due to the lack of a mechanistic framework for interpreting behavioral data in such tasks, the nature of the SC's contribution to attention remains unclear. Here we present and validate a novel decision framework for analyzing behavioral data in multialternative attention tasks.Weapply this framework to re-examine the behavioral evidence from these published studies. Our model is a multidimensional extension to signal detection theory that distinguishes between two major classes of attentional mechanisms: those that alter the quality of sensory information or \u201csensitivity,\u201d and those that alter the selective gating of sensory information or \u201cchoice bias.\u201d Model-based simulations and model-based analyses of data from these published studies revealed a converging pattern of results that indicated that choice-bias changes, rather than sensitivity changes, were the primary outcome of SC manipulation. Our results suggest that the SC contributes to attentional performance predominantly by generating a spatial choice bias for stimuli at a selected location, and that this bias operates downstream of forebrain mechanisms that enhance sensitivity. The findings lead to a testable mechanistic framework of how the midbrain and forebrain networks interact to control spatial attention.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Attention mechanisms", "Behavior", "Microstimulation and inactivation", "Midbrain", "Multialternative decisions", "Signal-detection theory"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Attention", "Chickens", "Choice Behavior", "Decision Making", "Female", "Macaca mulatta", "Male", "Photic Stimulation", "Superior Colliculi", "Visual Perception"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85010411082", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"]], "AuthorData": {"24831220600": {"Name": "Sridharan D.", "AuthorID": "24831220600", "AffiliationID": "60014097", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Neuroscience, Indian Institute of Science"}, "14056985700": {"Name": "Steinmetz N.", "AuthorID": "14056985700", "AffiliationID": "60032838", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurobiology, Stanford University School of Medicine"}, "35414618700": {"Name": "Moore T.", "AuthorID": "35414618700", "AffiliationID": "60032838, 60009470", "AffiliationName": "Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Stanford University School of Medicine"}, "7102867840": {"Name": "Knudsen E.", "AuthorID": "7102867840", "AffiliationID": "60032838", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurobiology, Stanford University School of Medicine"}}}
