Shedding new light on an ongoing debate, we argue that the critics have overstated the case against autonomy policies. Our evidence indicates that decentralization has a significant conflict-preventing effect where there is no prior conflict history. In postconflict settings, however, granting autonomy can still be helpful in combination with central power sharing arrangements. Yet, on its own, postconflict autonomy concessions may be too little, too late. Accounting for endogeneity, we also instrument for autonomy in postcolonial states by exploiting that French, as opposed to British, colonial rule rarely relied on decentralized governance. This identification strategy suggests that na\u00efve analysis tends to underestimate the pacifying influence of decentralization.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84928537817", "SubjectAreas": [["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"], ["Political Science and International Relations", "SOCI", "3320"]], "AuthorData": {"6602313667": {"Name": "Cederman L.", "AuthorID": "6602313667", "AffiliationID": "60025858", "AffiliationName": "Department of International Conflict Research, ETH Z\u00fcrich"}, "7003903678": {"Name": "Hug S.", "AuthorID": "7003903678", "AffiliationID": "60004718", "AffiliationName": "D\u00e9partement de Science Politique, Facult\u00e9 des Sciences \u00c9conomiques et Sociales, Universit\u00e9 de Geneve"}, "56607028400": {"Name": "Sch\u00e4del A.", "AuthorID": "56607028400", "AffiliationID": "60004718", "AffiliationName": "D\u00e9partement de Science Politique, Facult\u00e9 des Sciences \u00c9conomiques et Sociales, Universit\u00e9 de Geneve"}, "35270743700": {"Name": "Wucherpfennig J.", "AuthorID": "35270743700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
