Child and Adolescent Mental Health published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of Association for Child and Adolescent Mental HealthBackground: A subset of individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) resemble descriptions of extreme/\u2018pathological\u2019 demand avoidance, displaying obsessive avoidance of everyday demands and requests, strategic or \u2018socially manipulative\u2019 behaviour and sudden changes in mood. Investigating challenging presentations using dimensional description may prove preferable to identifying subgroups. However, there remains an imperative to explore which behavioural traits appear most problematic to inform quantitative investigation. This study provides an in-depth exploration of parent perspectives on maladaptive behaviour in children reported to have an autism spectrum diagnosis and features of extreme/\u2018pathological\u2019 demand avoidance. Method: Parents completed a tailored semistructured interview about their child's behaviour, focusing on difficulties relevant to descriptions of extreme/\u2018pathological\u2019 demand avoidance. The 26 interviews rated as scoring above threshold for \u2018substantial\u2019 features of extreme/\u2018pathological\u2019 demand avoidance on relevant indicators were analysed qualitatively using a general inductive approach. Results: New themes that emerged from these data included attempts by the child to control situations and others\u2019 activities. Avoidance behaviours in this sample could be described as \u2018strategic\u2019 rather than \u2018manipulative\u2019. A range of factors, including a negative emotional response to demands, but also phobias, novelty, and uncertainty, were perceived to play a role in triggering extreme behaviour. Conclusions: These descriptions highlight the importance of systematically measuring noncompliance, attempts to control situations and others' activities, and extreme mood variability in individuals with ASD. These dimensions represent important targets for intervention, given their considerable impact on daily life.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Autism spectrum disorder", "extreme demand avoidance", "meltdowns", "mood variability", "noncompliance", "pathological demand avoidance"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85031330449", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"52264258200": {"Name": "O'Nions E.", "AuthorID": "52264258200", "AffiliationID": "60015879, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "MRC Social, Genetic and Developmental Psychiatry Centre, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London"}, "23091807800": {"Name": "Viding E.", "AuthorID": "23091807800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Developmental Risk & Resilience Unit, Clinical, Educational, and Health Psychology Research Department, Division of Psychology and Language Sciences, University College London"}, "57196045891": {"Name": "Quinlan E.", "AuthorID": "57196045891", "AffiliationID": "60015879, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "MRC Social, Genetic and Developmental Psychiatry Centre, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London"}, "57196045246": {"Name": "Pidgeon C.", "AuthorID": "57196045246", "AffiliationID": "60015879, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "MRC Social, Genetic and Developmental Psychiatry Centre, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London"}, "7004098522": {"Name": "Happ\u00e9 F.", "AuthorID": "7004098522", "AffiliationID": "60015879, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "MRC Social, Genetic and Developmental Psychiatry Centre, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London"}, "57217102828": {"Name": "Floyd C.", "AuthorID": "57217102828", "AffiliationID": "100958037", "AffiliationName": "Central North West London NHS, Pembroke Centre"}, "7201688916": {"Name": "Gould J.", "AuthorID": "7201688916", "AffiliationID": "107937698", "AffiliationName": "The NAS Lorna Wing Centre for Autism"}}}
