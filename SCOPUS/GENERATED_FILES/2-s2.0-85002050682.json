Most anatomic and imaging-based classifications of the normal root recognize and describe the basic components, which include the shape and size of the three aortic sinuses and their three valvar leaflets, as well as the sinutubular junction and proximal ascending aorta. However, the three interposing fibrous interleaflet triangles, which share an intimate relationship with all elements of the root, are often ignored. In consequence, the important role the interleaflet triangles play in determining the function of the normal and congenitally malformed aortic root is underappreciated. Additionally, the subtle asymmetries found in the normal aortic root, such as differences between the sizes of the described components, underlie its hemodynamic efficiency. In this review the authors describe the complex structure of the normal aortic root, contrasting these normal characteristics with those found in the unicuspid and bicuspid variants of congenitally malformed aortic valves. Many of these features are readily recognizable using current imaging modalities and so should become a standard part of the description of aortic valvar disease. The authors believe that this thorough morphologic approach will provide a framework for the re-creation of a more normal aortic root at the time of repair or replacement, thereby improving current outcomes.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Aortic regurgitation", "Aortic root", "Aortic stenosis", "Aortic valve", "Bicuspid aortic valve", "Unicuspid aortic valve"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aortic Valve", "Echocardiography", "Evidence-Based Medicine", "Heart Valve Diseases", "Humans", "Prognosis"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85002050682", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"], ["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"55940194400": {"Name": "Tretter J.T.", "AuthorID": "55940194400", "AffiliationID": "60030440", "AffiliationName": "Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, The Heart Institute"}, "56993933800": {"Name": "Chikkabyrappa S.", "AuthorID": "56993933800", "AffiliationID": "60032105", "AffiliationName": "Division of Pediatric Cardiology, New York University Langone Medical Center"}, "7102622991": {"Name": "Redington A.N.", "AuthorID": "7102622991", "AffiliationID": "60030440", "AffiliationName": "Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, The Heart Institute"}, "16643657100": {"Name": "Spicer D.E.", "AuthorID": "16643657100", "AffiliationID": "60013959", "AffiliationName": "Division of Pediatric Cardiology, University of Florida"}, "55455136800": {"Name": "Mori S.", "AuthorID": "55455136800", "AffiliationID": "60179043", "AffiliationName": "Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, Kobe University Graduate School of Medicine"}, "55574190847": {"Name": "Anderson R.H.", "AuthorID": "55574190847", "AffiliationID": "60026712, 60006222", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Genetic Medicine, Newcastle University"}}}
