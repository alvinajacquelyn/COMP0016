This article investigates science blogging practices to uncover key trends, including bloggers\u2019 self-perceptions of their role. Interviews with seven of the most popular science bloggers revealed them to be driven by intrinsic personal motivations.

A content analysis of 1000 blog posts and comparison with the most popular blogs on the Internet further confirmed this result and additionally identified key factors that affect science blog popularity, including update frequency, topic diversity and the inclusion of non-text elements (especially images and video).", "AuthorKeywords": ["interaction experts/publics", "media and science", "popularization of science", "science and popular culture", "science attitudes and perceptions", "science communication", "science journalism", "science writing"], "IndexKeywords": ["Blogging", "Community Participation", "Information Dissemination", "Motivation", "Science", "Writing"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84962040518", "SubjectAreas": [["Communication", "SOCI", "3315"], ["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"], ["Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)", "ARTS", "1201"]], "AuthorData": {"56863284300": {"Name": "Ranger M.", "AuthorID": "56863284300", "AffiliationID": "60019611", "AffiliationName": "University of the West of England"}, "6506746124": {"Name": "Bultitude K.", "AuthorID": "6506746124", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
