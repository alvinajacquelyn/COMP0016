Uber\u2019s tenacious and highly competitive approach to building markets is identified as a significant challenge to authorities and the limited power they have over Uber (beyond simply refusing access) is acknowledged. Uber\u2019s entry into the delivery of statutory services is identified as a particularly striking development. The case of Uber provides useful insights concerning technological innovation and disruption, but more important is the company\u2019s business model. The analysis enables some findings concerning how authorities can prepare for the \u201cnext\u201d Uber: these include working on preparedness (by conducting futures work, for example); on standing arrangements (such as insisting on an open data model); and on responding to the entry of a challenging provider or service, through the use of experimental legislation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Competition", "Disruption", "Governance", "Innovation", "Regulation", "Uber"], "IndexKeywords": ["Business modeling", "Disruption", "Governance", "National governments", "Private sector involvements", "Regulation", "Technological innovation", "Uber"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85057948975", "SubjectAreas": [["Automotive Engineering", "ENGI", "2203"], ["Transportation", "SOCI", "3313"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"]], "AuthorData": {"8380913400": {"Name": "Cohen T.", "AuthorID": "8380913400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Transport Studies, University College London"}}}
