The inexpensive and non-toxic H-SiO2 particles imparted delicate lotus leaf inspired hierarchical surface nano-morphologies while the fatty acid modification afforded a suitable drop in surface energy. Comparison studies were carried out to explore the effects of fatty acid chain length and pipette as opposed to spray coating deposition methods on the coatings hydrophobicity. It was determined that the longest chain length fatty acid coatings showed enhanced hydrophobic properties due to their extended hydrophobic alkyl chain. A pipette deposited suspension containing H-SiO2 nanoparticles and octadecanoic acid generated a coating with the most favourable average water contact and tilting angles of 142 \u00b1 6\u00b0 and 16 \u00b1 2\u00b0 respectively.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Fatty acid chains", "Hierarchical surfaces", "Hydrophobic alkyl chain", "Hydrophobic properties", "Long chain fatty acid", "Octadecanoic acids", "SiO2 Nanoparticles", "Water contact angle"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85051332030", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"]], "AuthorData": {"57203344268": {"Name": "Heale F.", "AuthorID": "57203344268", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "19337695800": {"Name": "Page K.", "AuthorID": "19337695800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "56217400400": {"Name": "Parkin I.", "AuthorID": "56217400400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "7003437916": {"Name": "Carmalt C.", "AuthorID": "7003437916", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "37562054600": {"Name": "Wixey J.", "AuthorID": "37562054600", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "56435032800": {"Name": "Taylor P.", "AuthorID": "56435032800", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
