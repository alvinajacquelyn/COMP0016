Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.This comparative case study investigated how two intergovernmental organisations without formal health mandates\u2013the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the World Trade Organization (WTO)\u2013have engaged with global health issues. Triangulating insights from key institutional documents, ten semi-structured interviews with senior officials, and scholarly books tracing the history of both organisations, the study identified an evolving and broadened engagement with global health issues in UNDP and WTO. Within WTO, the dominant view was that enhancing international trade is instrumental to improving global health, although the need to resolve tensions between public health objectives and WTO agreements was recognised. For UNDP, interviewees reported that the agency gained prominence in global health for its response to HIV/AIDS in the 1990s and early 2000s. Learning from that experience, the agency has evolved and expanded its role in two respects: it has increasingly facilitated processes to provide global normative direction for global health issues such as HIV/AIDS and access to medicines, and it has expanded its focus beyond HIV/AIDS. Overall, the study findings suggest the need for seeking greater integration among international institutions, closing key global institutional gaps, and establishing a shared global institutional space for promoting action on the broader determinants of health.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Global governance", "social determinants of health", "United Nations Development Programme", "World Health Organization", "World Trade Organization"], "IndexKeywords": ["Anti-Retroviral Agents", "Commerce", "Global Health", "Health Services Accessibility", "HIV Infections", "Humans", "International Agencies", "International Cooperation", "Interviews as Topic", "Policy", "Qualitative Research", "Social Determinants of Health", "United Nations"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85047894926", "SubjectAreas": [["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"49961527800": {"Name": "Gopinathan U.", "AuthorID": "49961527800", "AffiliationID": "60189947", "AffiliationName": "Global Strategy Lab, Dahdaleh Institute for Global Health Research, Faculty of Health and Osgoode Hall Law School, York University"}, "24390281000": {"Name": "Hoffman S.J.", "AuthorID": "24390281000", "AffiliationID": "60031828", "AffiliationName": "Department of Health Research Methods, Evidence, and Impact, McMaster University"}, "56027021800": {"Name": "Watts N.", "AuthorID": "56027021800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Institute for Global Health"}, "56025857200": {"Name": "Lefebvre A.", "AuthorID": "56025857200", "AffiliationID": "60010365", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Medicine, University of British Columbia"}, "56970503900": {"Name": "Cheung A.", "AuthorID": "56970503900", "AffiliationID": "60031004", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Medicine, University of Queensland"}, "7003529676": {"Name": "R\u00f8ttingen J.A.", "AuthorID": "7003529676", "AffiliationID": "60010348", "AffiliationName": "Department of Health Management and Health Economics, Institute of Health and Society, University of Oslo"}}}
