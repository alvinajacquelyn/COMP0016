The results demonstrate that energy barriers to form intrinsic defects, such as Frenkel pairs and Stone-Wales type defects, exceed 3.0 eV and their equilibrium concentrations are likely to be low. Therefore, growth conditions and sample preparation play a crucial role in defect chemistry of black phosphorus. Mono-vacancies (MV) are shown to introduce a shallow acceptor state in the bandgap of BP, but exhibit fast hopping rates at room temperature. Coalescence of MVs into di-vacancies (DV) is energetically favourable and eliminates the band gap states. Thus MVs are not likely to be the main contributor to p-doping in BP. Extrinsic defects are a plausible alternative, with SnP found to be the most promising candidate. Other defects considered include I, O, Fe, Cu, Zn and Ni in surface adsorbed, intercalated and substitutional geometries, respectively. Furthermore, BP was found to be magnetic for isolated MVs and Fe doping, motivating further research in the area of magnetic functionalisation.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Electronic and Geometric Structures", "Equilibrium concentration", "Extrinsic defects", "Functionalisation", "Hybrid density functional", "Intrinsic defects", "Sample preparation", "Structure and properties"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85055598748", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"]], "AuthorData": {"57148416100": {"Name": "Gaberle J.", "AuthorID": "57148416100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "7007118546": {"Name": "Shluger A.", "AuthorID": "7007118546", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}}}
