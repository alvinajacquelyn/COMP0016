However, existing practices fail to fully account for the culturally-dependent spatial relationships between people and their digital devices (i.e. the proxemic relationships). Building on the ideas of proxemic interactions, this workshop is motivated by the concept of 'proxemic mobile collocated interactions', to harness new or existing technologies to create engaging and interactionally relevant experiences. Such approaches would allow devices to not only react to presence and interaction, but also other indicators, such as the interpersonal distance people naturally use in everyday life. The aim of this one-day workshop is to bring together a community of researchers, designers and practitioners who are interested in exploring proxemics and mobile collocated interactions.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Co-located interaction", "Collaboration", "Handheld devices", "Multi-device", "Multi-user", "Proxemics"], "IndexKeywords": ["Co-located", "Collaboration", "Hand held device", "Multi-devices", "Multi-user", "Proxemics"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85014638069", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Human-Computer Interaction", "COMP", "1709"], ["Computer Graphics and Computer-Aided Design", "COMP", "1704"]], "AuthorData": {"56157070100": {"Name": "Porcheron M.", "AuthorID": "56157070100", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "Mixed Reality Laboratory, School of Computer Science, University of Nottingham"}, "16230372800": {"Name": "Lucero A.", "AuthorID": "16230372800", "AffiliationID": "60019160", "AffiliationName": "Mads Clausen Institute, University of Southern Denmark"}, "16239529900": {"Name": "Quigley A.", "AuthorID": "16239529900", "AffiliationID": "60022132", "AffiliationName": "SACHI School of Computer Science, University of St. Andrews"}, "55921115600": {"Name": "Marquardt N.", "AuthorID": "55921115600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Interaction Centre, University College London"}, "13405822300": {"Name": "Clawson J.", "AuthorID": "13405822300", "AffiliationID": "60019647", "AffiliationName": "School of Interactive Computing, Georgia Institute of Technology"}, "7101930949": {"Name": "O'Hara K.", "AuthorID": "7101930949", "AffiliationID": "60098463", "AffiliationName": "Microsoft Research"}}}
