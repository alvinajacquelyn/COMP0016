To achieve this we have provided a background of what biomineralisation entails and why there is a need for biomaterials. Furthermore, we have briefly reviewed some of the in vitro techniques used for the basic understanding of mineralisation events and the prediction of how the materials may behave in vivo. For the latter we have attempted to guide the reader through how the techniques work and how they are used to monitor the biomineralisation process, with focus on integration of the implanted material with its surroundings. The technologies described here are constantly being updated, guided by the complexity in monitoring needs. We therefore advise the reader to update this list regularly.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Biomaterials", "Biomineralization", "Bone", "In vitro", "In vivo", "Tissue engineering"], "IndexKeywords": ["Implanted materials", "In-vitro", "In-vivo", "Mineralisation"], "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85009656107", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"], ["Health Professions (all)", "HEAL", "3600"]], "AuthorData": {"36677771600": {"Name": "Mehrban N.", "AuthorID": "36677771600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "55574192663": {"Name": "Bowen J.", "AuthorID": "55574192663", "AffiliationID": "60012113", "AffiliationName": "The Open University"}}}
