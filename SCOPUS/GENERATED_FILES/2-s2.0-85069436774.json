All rights reserved.Medulloblastoma is the most common malignant pediatric brain tumor. Survival rates range between 50% and 80% depending on histology and other biologic features, metastases, and treatment approach. Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a genetically inherited disorder characterized by dysmorphic features, mental retardation, obesity, and hypogonadism among other features. We describe a 10.5-year-old girl with PWS and previous standard-risk medulloblastoma that relapsed in the pons 3 years after the end of treatment. Diagnosis of relapse was delayed by a preceding varicella infection, an initial clinical/radiologic response to steroids and the unusual location, and was confirmed with a stereotactic biopsy. Second-line therapy was commenced, however, the patient rapidly deteriorated and died. This is the first report of medulloblastoma in a patient with PWS.", "AuthorKeywords": ["childhood cancer", "medulloblastoma", "pontine lesion", "Prader-Willi syndrome", "relapse", "varicella"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85069436774", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Hematology", "MEDI", "2720"], ["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"]], "AuthorData": {"7801594411": {"Name": "Panagopoulou P.", "AuthorID": "7801594411", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Paediatric Oncology, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Sick Children, NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57210111967": {"Name": "Sattar S.", "AuthorID": "57210111967", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Paediatric Oncology, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Sick Children, NHS Foundation Trust"}, "6507690730": {"Name": "Slater O.", "AuthorID": "6507690730", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Paediatric Oncology, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Sick Children, NHS Foundation Trust"}, "56255711900": {"Name": "Aquilina K.", "AuthorID": "56255711900", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Neurosurgery, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Sick Children, NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57217478724": {"Name": "Jan W.", "AuthorID": "57217478724", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Neuroradiology, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Sick Children, NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7003519864": {"Name": "Jacques T.", "AuthorID": "7003519864", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60012662", "AffiliationName": "UCL GOS Institute of Child Health"}}}
