With high repetition rate, low pulse energy laser sources (oscillators) tight focusing is necessary for a robust wave mixing and the efficiency of broadband nonlinear conversion is limited by diffraction as well as spatial and temporal walk-off. Here we demonstrate a miniature third harmonic generator (tripler) with conversion efficiency exceeding 30%, producing 246 fs UV pulses via cascaded second order processes within a single laser beam focus. Designing this highly efficient and ultra compact frequency converter was made possible by full 3-dimentional modelling of propagation of tightly focused, broadband light fields in nonlinear and birefringent media.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85013837082", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"34971417900": {"Name": "Kardas T.", "AuthorID": "34971417900", "AffiliationID": "60013756", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Experimental Physics, Faculty of Physics, University of Warsaw"}, "37023301200": {"Name": "Nejbauer M.", "AuthorID": "37023301200", "AffiliationID": "60030078, 60014383", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Physical Chemistry, Polish Academy of Sciences"}, "8597616000": {"Name": "Wnuk P.", "AuthorID": "8597616000", "AffiliationID": "60029010", "AffiliationName": "Max-Planck-Institut f\u00fcr Quantenoptik"}, "7003710276": {"Name": "Radzewicz C.", "AuthorID": "7003710276", "AffiliationID": "60030078, 60014383", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Physical Chemistry, Polish Academy of Sciences"}, "6602894094": {"Name": "Wasylczyk P.", "AuthorID": "6602894094", "AffiliationID": "60013756", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Experimental Physics, Faculty of Physics, University of Warsaw"}, "6602342410": {"Name": "Resan B.", "AuthorID": "6602342410", "AffiliationID": "60011274", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering, University of Applied Sciences and Arts Northwestern Switzerland"}}}
