Cardiac involvement is the current leading cause of death in FD. A combination of improved enzyme assays, availability of genetic profiling, together withmore organized clinical services for rare diseases, has led to a rapid growth in the prevalence of FD. The earlier andmore frequent diagnosis of asymptomatic individuals before development of the phenotype has focussed attention on early detection of organ involvement and closermonitoring of disease progression. The high cost of enzyme replacement therapy at a time of constraint withinmany health economies, moreover, has challenged clinicians to target treatment effectively. This article provides an outline of FD for the general physician and summarizes the aetiology and pathology of FD, the cardiovascular consequences thereof,modalities used in diagnosis and then discusses current indications for treatment, including pharmacotherapy and device implantation.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Cardiovascular Diseases", "Disease Progression", "Enzyme Replacement Therapy", "Fabry Disease", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Tomography, Emission-Computed, Single-Photon"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85059495800", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"57191835191": {"Name": "Baig S.", "AuthorID": "57191835191", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University of Birmingham"}, "57204113851": {"Name": "Vijapurapu R.", "AuthorID": "57204113851", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University of Birmingham"}, "57189931631": {"Name": "Steeds R.P.", "AuthorID": "57189931631", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University of Birmingham"}, "57188682858": {"Name": "Alharbi F.", "AuthorID": "57188682858", "AffiliationID": "116418080", "AffiliationName": "Central Military Laboratory and Blood Bank"}, "57190741709": {"Name": "Nordin S.", "AuthorID": "57190741709", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}, "57202314649": {"Name": "Moon J.", "AuthorID": "57202314649", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}, "37561681400": {"Name": "Kozor R.", "AuthorID": "37561681400", "AffiliationID": "60121699, 60025709", "AffiliationName": "Sydney Medical School, University of Sydney"}, "7003606384": {"Name": "Bembi B.", "AuthorID": "7003606384", "AffiliationID": "105157228", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Rare Diseases, AMC Hospital of Udine"}, "6603191797": {"Name": "Geberhiwot T.", "AuthorID": "6603191797", "AffiliationID": "60012191", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Rare Diseases, Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham"}}}
