It is subject to systematic review every five years and, in 2017, an ISO Working Group was set up to review the standard. This working group took the decision to survey the views of stakeholders including publishers, libraries, and others. This article reports on the global survey that was undertaken, describing the questions and answers about which the committee sought opinions. It also sought details on the respondents to provide context. The replies are summarised in chart form with conclusions and an appraisal of the key issues, which suggest that whilst respondents are supportive of expanding the ways in which the ISSN is deployed, they are less convinced of the need for more ISSNs for any given title. They are split on the need for the structure of the ISSN to be revised but there is strong support for the notion of a \u201cFamily ISSN\u201d that would describe resources that are linked through, for example, title changes or geography or language. The article notes the next steps to be taken.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Identifiers", "ISSN", "Linked open data", "Revision of ISO standards", "Serials", "Usage studies"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85065248380", "SubjectAreas": [["Library and Information Sciences", "SOCI", "3309"]], "AuthorData": {"55979899600": {"Name": "B\u00e9quet G.", "AuthorID": "55979899600", "AffiliationID": "122504548", "AffiliationName": "Centre International de l\u2019ISSN"}, "57192818045": {"Name": "Akeroyd J.", "AuthorID": "57192818045", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Information Studies, University College London"}}}
