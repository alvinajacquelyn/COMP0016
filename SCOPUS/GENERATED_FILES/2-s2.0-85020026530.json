As the performance of the method strongly depends on the quality of the atlas database composed of multiple sets of aligned MR, CT and segmented images, we also propose a robust way of registering atlas MR and CT images, which combines structure-guided registration, and CT and MR image synthesis. We first evaluated the proposed framework in terms of segmentation and CT synthesis accuracy on 15 subjects with prostate cancer. The segmentations obtained with the proposed method were compared using the Dice score coefficient (DSC) to the manual segmentations. Mean DSCs of 0.73, 0.90, 0.77 and 0.90 were obtained for the prostate, bladder, rectum and femur heads, respectively. The mean absolute error (MAE) and the mean error (ME) were computed between the reference CTs (non-rigidly aligned to the MRs) and the pseudo CTs generated with the proposed method. The MAE was on average 45.7\u00b14.6 HU and the ME -1.6\u00b17.7 HU. We then performed a dosimetric evaluation by re-calculating plans on the pseudo CTs and comparing them to the plans optimised on the reference CTs. We compared the cumulative dose volume histograms (DVH) obtained for the pseudo CTs to the DVH obtained for the reference CTs in the planning target volume (PTV) located in the prostate, and in the organs at risk at different DVH points. We obtained average differences of -0.14% in the PTV for D98%, and between -0.14% and 0.05% in the PTV, bladder, rectum and femur heads for Dmean and D2%. Overall, we demonstrate that the proposed framework is able to automatically generate accurate pseudo CT images and segmentations in the pelvic region, potentially bypassing the need for CT scan for accurate RTP.", "AuthorKeywords": ["atlas-based methods", "image synthesis", "MRI-only RTP", "pseudo CT", "segmentation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Atlas-based methods", "Dose-volume histograms", "Image synthesis", "Information propagation", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)", "Planning target volumes", "Radiotherapy treatment planning", "X-ray computed tomography", "Image Processing, Computer-Assisted", "Joints", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Radiometry", "Radiotherapy Planning, Computer-Assisted", "Tomography, X-Ray Computed"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85020026530", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiological and Ultrasound Technology", "HEAL", "3614"], ["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"55887379000": {"Name": "Burgos N.", "AuthorID": "55887379000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Translational Imaging Group, CMIC, University College London"}, "36613715800": {"Name": "Presles B.", "AuthorID": "36613715800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Translational Imaging Group, CMIC, University College London"}, "24376919100": {"Name": "Modat M.", "AuthorID": "24376919100", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dementia Research Centre, Institute of Neurology, UCL"}, "6602233595": {"Name": "Ourselin S.", "AuthorID": "6602233595", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dementia Research Centre, Institute of Neurology, UCL"}, "54395497700": {"Name": "Jorge Cardoso M.", "AuthorID": "54395497700", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dementia Research Centre, Institute of Neurology, UCL"}, "57015403200": {"Name": "Guerreiro F.", "AuthorID": "57015403200", "AffiliationID": "60032724", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiotherapy, University Medical Center Utrecht"}, "8757124700": {"Name": "McClelland J.", "AuthorID": "8757124700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Image Computing, University College London"}, "55887467300": {"Name": "Nill S.", "AuthorID": "55887467300", "AffiliationID": "60010337, 60017166", "AffiliationName": "Joint Department of Physics, Institute of Cancer Research, Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust (ICR/RMH)"}, "6701862795": {"Name": "Oelfke U.", "AuthorID": "6701862795", "AffiliationID": "60010337, 60017166", "AffiliationName": "Joint Department of Physics, Institute of Cancer Research, Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust (ICR/RMH)"}, "7004428943": {"Name": "Dearnaley D.", "AuthorID": "7004428943", "AffiliationID": "60010337", "AffiliationName": "Academic Urology Unit, ICR/RMH"}, "7004981356": {"Name": "DeSouza N.", "AuthorID": "7004981356", "AffiliationID": "60010337", "AffiliationName": "CRUK Centre for Cancer Imaging, ICR/RMH"}, "6602341416": {"Name": "Knopf A.C.", "AuthorID": "6602341416", "AffiliationID": "60006027, 60010023", "AffiliationName": "University of Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen, Department of Radiation Oncology"}}}
