Published by Elsevier Inc.Background Depression has been associated with impaired nitric oxide (NO)-mediated vasodilation and vascular dysregulation (VD). Whether depression and NO levels will disturb retinal haemodynamics is not clear. Objectives and methods Associations between the retinal vasculature, diastolic ocular perfusion pressure (DOPP) as measure of hypoperfusion, NO metabolites (NOx) and depression symptoms were assessed. Chronic VD risk markers [depression symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire/PHQ-9 \u2265 10) and 24 h pulse pressure] were determined in a bi-ethnic cohort (n = 313; 48.6 \u00b1 9 years; 53.9% men). At 3 year follow-up, retinal vessel calibre and retinopathy signs were quantified from digital images. Salivary NOx was obtained pre- and post-flicker light-induced provocation (FLIP). DOPP was defined as diastolic blood pressure minus intraocular pressure. Results Chronic VD risk was evident in Blacks opposed to acute risk in Whites (P < 0.05). At follow-up, retinopathy (Blacks 60.4%/Whites 39.6%), lower pre-FLIP (\u03bcM) and higher post-FLIP NOx (changes from baseline, %), arteriolar narrowing and wider venular calibre values were evident in Blacks compared to Whites, independent of confounders. A wider venular calibre, an index of stroke risk, was associated with chronic depression symptoms [cut point 248 MU: Area under the curve 0.61 (95% CI: 0.51, 0.72); 71% sensitivity; 55% specificity] as well as with hypoperfusion in the Blacks. In this group, arteriolar narrowing was associated with hypoperfusion; and attenuated arteriolar dilation with increased post-FLIP NOx responses. Conclusions Chronic depression symptoms may alter NO regulation and facilitate VD. NO-mediated vasoconstriction presumably impeded perfusion, retinal haemodynamics and -remodelling; potentiating stroke risk in Blacks.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Depression", "Ethnicity", "Hypoperfusion", "NOx", "Pulse pressure", "Retina"], "IndexKeywords": ["African Continental Ancestry Group", "Blood Pressure", "Depression", "European Continental Ancestry Group", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Nitrates", "Nitric Oxide", "Nitrites", "Retinal Diseases", "Retinal Vessels", "Saliva", "Stroke", "Vascular Remodeling"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84960927117", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Physiology", "BIOC", "1314"], ["Clinical Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1308"], ["Cancer Research", "BIOC", "1306"]], "AuthorData": {"6603640259": {"Name": "Malan L.", "AuthorID": "6603640259", "AffiliationID": "60029714", "AffiliationName": "Hypertension in Africa Research Team (HART), North-West University"}, "8502496600": {"Name": "Hamer M.", "AuthorID": "8502496600", "AffiliationID": "60000891", "AffiliationName": "National Centre for Sport and Exercise Medicine, Loughborough University"}, "7003310265": {"Name": "Von K\u00e4nel R.", "AuthorID": "7003310265", "AffiliationID": "60010987, 60020486", "AffiliationName": "Department Neurology, Inselspital, Bern University Hospital, University of Bern"}, "35518988000": {"Name": "Malan N.T.", "AuthorID": "35518988000", "AffiliationID": "60029714", "AffiliationName": "Hypertension in Africa Research Team (HART), North-West University"}, "7003349164": {"Name": "Schlaich M.P.", "AuthorID": "7003349164", "AffiliationID": "60087991, 60030929, 60031806", "AffiliationName": "School of Medicine and Pharmacology, Royal Perth Hospital Unit, Faculty of Medicine, Dentistry Health Sciences, University Western Australia"}, "23028660200": {"Name": "Reimann M.", "AuthorID": "23028660200", "AffiliationID": "60025676, 60018353", "AffiliationName": "Autonomic and Neuroendocrinological Laboratory Dresden, University Hospital Carl Gustav Carus, Technische Universit\u00e4t Dresden"}, "7004927714": {"Name": "Frasure-Smith N.", "AuthorID": "7004927714", "AffiliationID": "60002494, 60009507, 60009657, 60013278", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, School of Nursing, McGill University, Department of Psychiatry, University of Montreal, Centre de Recherche Centre Hospitalier de l'Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al, Montreal Heart Institute Research Center"}, "7201789930": {"Name": "Lambert G.W.", "AuthorID": "7201789930", "AffiliationID": "60012932, 60033409, 60019578", "AffiliationName": "Baker IDI Heart and Diabetes Institute, Central Clinical School, Monash University"}, "7003267488": {"Name": "Vilser W.", "AuthorID": "7003267488", "AffiliationID": "109626239", "AffiliationName": "Imedos Systems UG"}, "7103106766": {"Name": "Harvey B.H.", "AuthorID": "7103106766", "AffiliationID": "60029714", "AffiliationName": "Center of Excellence for Pharmaceutical Sciences, Division of Pharmacology, School for Pharmacy, North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus"}, "6507646096": {"Name": "Steyn F.", "AuthorID": "6507646096", "AffiliationID": "60029714", "AffiliationName": "Statistical Consultation Services, North-West University"}}}
