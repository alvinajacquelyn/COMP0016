Herein, the distribution of explosive analytes from controlled detonations of aluminised ammonium nitrate and an RDX-based explosive composition were established by systematically sampling sites positioned around each firing. This is the first experimental study to produce evidence that the post-blast residue mass can distribute according to an approximate inverse-square law model, while also demonstrating for the first time that distribution trends can vary depending on individual analytes. Furthermore, by incorporating blast-wave overpressure measurements, high-speed imaging for fireball volume recordings, and monitoring of environmental conditions, it was determined that the principle factor affecting all analyte dispersals was the wind direction, with other factors affecting specific analytes to varying degrees. The dispersal mechanism for explosive residue is primarily the smoke cloud, a finding which in itself has wider impacts on the environment and fundamental detonation theory.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Detonation", "Dispersal", "Explosive", "Particle", "Residue"], "IndexKeywords": ["Approximate inverse", "Dispersal", "Environmental conditions", "Explosive devices", "Explosive residues", "High speed imaging", "Residue", "Spatial distribution patterns"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84969847989", "SubjectAreas": [["Environmental Engineering", "ENVI", "2305"], ["Environmental Chemistry", "ENVI", "2304"], ["Waste Management and Disposal", "ENVI", "2311"], ["Pollution", "ENVI", "2310"], ["Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis", "ENVI", "2307"]], "AuthorData": {"55537651900": {"Name": "Abdul-Karim N.", "AuthorID": "55537651900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "7005826606": {"Name": "Blackman C.", "AuthorID": "7005826606", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "36947932100": {"Name": "Karu K.", "AuthorID": "36947932100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "55192818500": {"Name": "Gill P.", "AuthorID": "55192818500", "AffiliationID": "60004407", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Defence Chemistry, Cranfield University"}}}
