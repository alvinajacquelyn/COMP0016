TiO2 as transition metal oxide has been widely used as active layer for the fabrication of a variety of multistate memory nanostructure devices. However, progress in their technological development has been inhibited by the lack of a thorough understanding of the underlying switching mechanisms. Here, we employed high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) combined with two-dimensional energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (2D EDX) to provide a novel, nanoscale view of the mechanisms involved. Our results suggest that the switching mechanism involves redistribution of both Ti and O ions within the active layer combined with an overall loss of oxygen that effectively render conductive filaments. Our study shows evidence of titanium movement in a 10 nm TiO2 thin-film through direct EDX mapping that provides a viable starting point for the improvement of the robustness and lifetime of TiO2-based resistive random access memory (RRAM).", "AuthorKeywords": ["energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy", "memristors", "resistive memory", "resistive switching", "thin films", "titanium dioxide"], "IndexKeywords": ["Energy dispersive X ray spectroscopy", "High-angle annular dark fields", "Nanostructure devices", "Resistive memory", "Resistive random access memory (rram)", "Resistive switching", "Technological development", "Transition-metal oxides"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84982698652", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"]], "AuthorData": {"55884178000": {"Name": "Carta D.", "AuthorID": "55884178000", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "Nano Group, Southampton Nanofabrication Centre, Department of Electronics and Computer Science, University of Southampton"}, "25931831500": {"Name": "Salaoru I.", "AuthorID": "25931831500", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "Nano Group, Southampton Nanofabrication Centre, Department of Electronics and Computer Science, University of Southampton"}, "9335478200": {"Name": "Khiat A.", "AuthorID": "9335478200", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "Nano Group, Southampton Nanofabrication Centre, Department of Electronics and Computer Science, University of Southampton"}, "54882406000": {"Name": "Regoutz A.", "AuthorID": "54882406000", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "Nano Group, Southampton Nanofabrication Centre, Department of Electronics and Computer Science, University of Southampton"}, "15766131500": {"Name": "Prodromakis T.", "AuthorID": "15766131500", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "Nano Group, Southampton Nanofabrication Centre, Department of Electronics and Computer Science, University of Southampton"}, "6602164057": {"Name": "Mitterbauer C.", "AuthorID": "6602164057", "AffiliationID": "60002220", "AffiliationName": "FEI Company"}, "7201807805": {"Name": "Harrison N.M.", "AuthorID": "7201807805", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Imperial College London"}}}
