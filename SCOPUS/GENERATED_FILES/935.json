Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) is an emerging medical imaging technique which can produce tomographic images of impedance changes with non-invasive surface electrodes. We report EIT imaging of impedance changes in rat somatosensory cerebral cortex with a resolution of 2. ms and <. 200. \u03bcm during evoked potentials using epicortical arrays with 30 electrodes. Images were validated with local field potential recordings and current source-sink density analysis. Our results demonstrate that EIT can image neural activity in a volume 7. \u00d7. 5. \u00d7. 2. mm in somatosensory cerebral cortex with reduced invasiveness, greater resolution and imaging volume than other methods. Modeling indicates similar resolutions are feasible throughout the entire brain so this technique, uniquely, has the potential to image functional connectivity of cortical and subcortical structures.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Brain Waves", "Electric Impedance", "Electrodes, Implanted", "Electroencephalography", "Evoked Potentials, Somatosensory", "Female", "Image Processing, Computer-Assisted", "Microelectrodes", "Models, Neurological", "Rats", "Rats, Sprague-Dawley", "Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted", "Somatosensory Cortex", "Tomography", "Touch Perception"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84941953255", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"]], "AuthorData": {"26040428500": {"Name": "Aristovich K.Y.", "AuthorID": "26040428500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Bioengineering, University College London, Malet Place Engineering Building"}, "55200499500": {"Name": "Packham B.C.", "AuthorID": "55200499500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Bioengineering, University College London, Malet Place Engineering Building"}, "22980364300": {"Name": "Koo H.", "AuthorID": "22980364300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Bioengineering, University College London, Malet Place Engineering Building"}, "56180639400": {"Name": "Santos G.S.d.", "AuthorID": "56180639400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Bioengineering, University College London, Malet Place Engineering Building"}, "57205935474": {"Name": "Holder D.S.", "AuthorID": "57205935474", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Bioengineering, University College London, Malet Place Engineering Building"}, "57204026204": {"Name": "McEvoy A.", "AuthorID": "57204026204", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, University College London Hospitals"}}}
