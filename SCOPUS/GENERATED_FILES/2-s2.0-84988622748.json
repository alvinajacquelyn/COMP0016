Despite its widespread acceptance this paper asserts that there are conceptual limitations that emerge when applying the theory to the policing of crowd events. This paper contends that this problem with PJT is a result of specific assumptions that are highlighted by two studies using a novel experimental approach. Study 1 systematically manipulated the social categories used to describe crowd participants subjected to police coercion. The experiment demonstrates how these social categories dramatically affected participants\u2019 perceptions of the same police action and that it was participants\u2019 relational identification with the police, rather than a superordinate category, that mediated the association between judgements of procedural fairness and intentions to cooperate. In Study 2, using a quasi-experimental design, we then replicated and extended these findings by demonstrating how perceptions of procedural fairness are also influenced by levels of in-group identification. The paper concludes by exploring the implications of the data for reconceptualising the social psychological processes mediating these judgements and impacts of police legitimacy.", "AuthorKeywords": ["crowds", "policing", "Procedural justice", "social identity"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84988622748", "SubjectAreas": [["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"], ["Law", "SOCI", "3308"]], "AuthorData": {"57063256000": {"Name": "Radburn M.", "AuthorID": "57063256000", "AffiliationID": "60116344, 60012070", "AffiliationName": "Leeds University Business School, University of Leeds"}, "57202908505": {"Name": "Robinson M.", "AuthorID": "57202908505", "AffiliationID": "60116344, 60012070", "AffiliationName": "Leeds University Business School, University of Leeds"}, "7003750851": {"Name": "Stott C.", "AuthorID": "7003750851", "AffiliationID": "60030210", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, Keele University"}, "30367516400": {"Name": "Bradford B.", "AuthorID": "30367516400", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Criminology, University of Oxford"}}}
