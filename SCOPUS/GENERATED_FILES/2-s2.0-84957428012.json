The cellular transcriptome is dynamic and can change depending on environmental factors, disease state and cellular context. The human brain has perhaps the most diverse transcriptome profile that is enriched for many species of RNA, including antisense transcripts. Antisense transcripts are produced when both the plus and minus strand of the DNA helix are transcribed at a particular locus. This results in an RNA transcript that has a partial or complete overlap with an intronic or exonic region of the sense transcript. While antisense transcription is known to occur at some level in most organisms, this review focuses specifically on antisense transcription in the brain and how regulation of genes by antisense transcripts can contribute to functional aspects of the healthy and diseased brain. First, we discuss different techniques that can be used in the identification and quantification of antisense transcripts. This is followed by examples of antisense transcription and modes of regulatory function that have been identified in the brain.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Antisense transcripts", "Human brain", "RNA-Seq", "Transcriptome"], "IndexKeywords": ["Brain", "DNA, Antisense", "Humans", "RNA, Antisense", "Transcriptome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84957428012", "SubjectAreas": [["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"]], "AuthorData": {"55530992700": {"Name": "Mills J.", "AuthorID": "55530992700", "AffiliationID": "60028333", "AffiliationName": "School of Biotechnology and Biomolecular Sciences, University of New South Wales"}, "55894641800": {"Name": "Chen B.", "AuthorID": "55894641800", "AffiliationID": "60028333", "AffiliationName": "School of Biotechnology and Biomolecular Sciences, University of New South Wales"}, "6602088325": {"Name": "Janitz M.", "AuthorID": "6602088325", "AffiliationID": "60028333", "AffiliationName": "School of Biotechnology and Biomolecular Sciences, University of New South Wales"}, "6602616244": {"Name": "Ueberham U.", "AuthorID": "6602616244", "AffiliationID": "60008042", "AffiliationName": "Paul-Flechsig-Institute for Brain Research, School of Medicine, University of Leipzig"}, "16427260600": {"Name": "Arendt T.", "AuthorID": "16427260600", "AffiliationID": "60008042", "AffiliationName": "Paul-Flechsig-Institute for Brain Research, School of Medicine, University of Leipzig"}}}
