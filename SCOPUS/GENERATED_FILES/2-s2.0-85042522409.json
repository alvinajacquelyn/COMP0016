In dairy production within low and middle income countries (LMICs), there is a significant biosensing challenge in detecting sexually transmitted infection (STI) pathogens during animal husbandry, due in part to difficulties associated with the limited infrastructure for veterinary medicine. Here we demonstrate low-cost, multiplexed, and sample-to-answer paper-origami tests for the detection of three bovine infectious reproductive diseases in semen samples, collected at a test site in rural India. Pathogen DNA from one viral pathogen, bovine herpes virus-1 (BoHV-1), and two bacteria (Brucella and Leptospira) was extracted, amplified (using loop-mediated isothermal amplification, LAMP), and detected fluorescently, enabling <1 pg (\u223c from 115 to 274 copies per reaction) of target genomic DNA to be measured. Data was collected as a fluorescence signal either visually, using a low-cost hand-held torch, or digitally with a mobile-phone camera. Limits of detection and sensitivities of the paper-origami device for the three pathogens were also evaluated using pathogen-inoculated semen samples and were as few as 50 Leptospira organisms, 50 CFU Brucella, and 1 TCID50 BoHV-1. Semen samples from elite bulls at a germplasm center were also tested in double-blind tests, as a demonstrator for a low-cost, user-friendly point-of-care sensing platform, for in-the-field resource-limited regions. The sensors showed excellent levels of sensitivity and specificity, and for the first time a demonstrated ability of the application of paper microfluidics devices for the diagnosis multiple infectious diseases from semen samples.", "AuthorKeywords": ["diagnosis", "infectious disease", "microfluidics", "nucleic-acid based tests", "paper"], "IndexKeywords": ["Infectious disease", "Loop mediated isothermal amplifications", "Low and middle income countries", "Microfluidics devices", "Mobile phone cameras", "Sensitivity and specificity", "Sexually transmitted infections", "Veterinary diagnosis", "Animals", "Brucella abortus", "Brucellosis, Bovine", "Cattle", "Cattle Diseases", "DNA, Bacterial", "DNA, Viral", "Herpesviridae Infections", "Herpesvirus 1, Bovine", "Leptospira", "Leptospirosis", "Limit of Detection", "Microfluidics", "Molecular Diagnostic Techniques", "Paper", "Semen"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85042522409", "SubjectAreas": [["Bioengineering", "CENG", "1502"], ["Instrumentation", "PHYS", "3105"], ["Process Chemistry and Technology", "CENG", "1508"], ["Fluid Flow and Transfer Processes", "CENG", "1507"]], "AuthorData": {"24330188600": {"Name": "Yang Z.", "AuthorID": "24330188600", "AffiliationID": "60001490", "AffiliationName": "Division of Biomedical Engineering, School of Engineer, University of Glasgow"}, "36524139500": {"Name": "Xu G.", "AuthorID": "36524139500", "AffiliationID": "60001490", "AffiliationName": "Division of Biomedical Engineering, School of Engineer, University of Glasgow"}, "25825387900": {"Name": "Reboud J.", "AuthorID": "25825387900", "AffiliationID": "60001490", "AffiliationName": "Division of Biomedical Engineering, School of Engineer, University of Glasgow"}, "55154841200": {"Name": "Cooper J.M.", "AuthorID": "55154841200", "AffiliationID": "60001490", "AffiliationName": "Division of Biomedical Engineering, School of Engineer, University of Glasgow"}, "57194978251": {"Name": "Ali S.A.", "AuthorID": "57194978251", "AffiliationID": "60005564", "AffiliationName": "Division of Bacteriology, Indian Veterinary Research Institute"}, "57202541730": {"Name": "Kaur G.", "AuthorID": "57202541730", "AffiliationID": "60005564", "AffiliationName": "Division of Bacteriology, Indian Veterinary Research Institute"}, "35481861000": {"Name": "Chaudhuri P.", "AuthorID": "35481861000", "AffiliationID": "60005564", "AffiliationName": "Division of Bacteriology, Indian Veterinary Research Institute"}, "6505773149": {"Name": "McGiven J.", "AuthorID": "6505773149", "AffiliationID": "60005564", "AffiliationName": "Division of Biotechnology, Indian Veterinary Research Institute"}, "57194975332": {"Name": "Boby N.", "AuthorID": "57194975332", "AffiliationID": "60110447", "AffiliationName": "FAO/WHO Collaborating Centre for Brucellosis, OIE Brucellosis Reference Laboratory, Department of Bacteriology, Animal and Plant Health Agency"}, "7404235540": {"Name": "Gupta P.K.", "AuthorID": "7404235540", "AffiliationID": "60110447", "AffiliationName": "FAO/WHO Collaborating Centre for Brucellosis, OIE Brucellosis Reference Laboratory, Department of Bacteriology, Animal and Plant Health Agency"}}}
