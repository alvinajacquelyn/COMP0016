In this article we study the distribution of M(\u03c7)/q as one varies over characters modulo q, where q is prime, and investigate the location of N\u03c7. We show that the distribution of M(\u03c7)/q converges weakly to a universal distribution , uniformly throughout most of the possible range, and get (doubly exponential decay) estimates for \u2019s tail. Almost all \u03c7 for which M(\u03c7) is large are odd characters that are 1-pretentious. Now, M(\u03c7) \u2265 |n\u2264q/2 \u03c7(n)| = (|2 \u2212 \u03c7(2)|/\u03c0)q |L(1, \u03c7)|, and one knows how often the latter expression is large, which has been how earlier lower bounds on were mostly proved. We show, though, that for most \u03c7 with M(\u03c7) large, N\u03c7 is bounded away from q/2, and the value of M(\u03c7) is little larger than (q/\u03c0)|L(1, \u03c7)|.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Distribution of character sums", "Distribution of Dirichlet L-functions", "Pretentious multiplicative functions", "Random multiplicative functions"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85047764060", "SubjectAreas": [["Mathematics (all)", "MATH", "2600"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"26530882700": {"Name": "Bober J.", "AuthorID": "26530882700", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "Heilbronn Institute for Mathematical Research, School of Mathematics, University of Bristol"}, "6504682727": {"Name": "Goldmakher L.", "AuthorID": "6504682727", "AffiliationID": "60021497", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics and Statistics, Bronfman Science Center, Williams College"}, "7004522820": {"Name": "Granville A.", "AuthorID": "7004522820", "AffiliationID": "60009507", "AffiliationName": "D\u00e9partement de math\u00e9matiques et de statistique, Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al"}, "35799808400": {"Name": "Koukoulopoulos D.", "AuthorID": "35799808400", "AffiliationID": "60009507", "AffiliationName": "D\u00e9partement de math\u00e9matiques et de statistique, Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al"}}}
