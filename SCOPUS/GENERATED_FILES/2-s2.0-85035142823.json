One key question facing policymakers is the role of natural gas both during the transition towards, and in the achievement of, a future low-carbon energy system. Here we assess a range of possible futures for the UK, and find that gas is unlikely to act as a cost-effective \u2018bridge\u2019 to a decarbonised UK energy system. There is also limited scope for gas in power generation after 2030 if the UK is to meet its emission reduction targets, in the absence of carbon capture and storage (CCS). Without CCS, a 'second dash for gas\u2019 while providing short-term gains in reducing emissions, is unlikely to be the most cost-effective way to reduce emissions, and could result in stranded assets and compromise the UK's decarbonisation ambitions. In such a case, gas use in 2050 is estimated at only 10% of its 2010 level. However, with significant CCS deployment by 2050, natural gas could remain at 50\u201360% of the 2010 level, primarily in the industrial (including hydrogen production) and power generation sectors.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Climate policy", "Decarbonisation", "Energy systems", "Gas as a bridge", "Natural gas"], "IndexKeywords": ["Carbon capture and storages (CCS)", "Climate policy", "Decarbonisation", "Emission reduction targets", "Energy systems", "Low-carbon energy systems", "Reducing emissions", "Short-term gains"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85035142823", "SubjectAreas": [["Energy (all)", "ENER", "2100"], ["Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law", "ENVI", "2308"]], "AuthorData": {"55365170700": {"Name": "McGlade C.", "AuthorID": "55365170700", "AffiliationID": "119818678", "AffiliationName": "UK Energy Research Centre"}, "36792192100": {"Name": "Pye S.", "AuthorID": "36792192100", "AffiliationID": "60025160", "AffiliationName": "MaREI Centre, Environmental Research Institute, University College Cork"}, "7004909341": {"Name": "Ekins P.", "AuthorID": "7004909341", "AffiliationID": "119818678", "AffiliationName": "UK Energy Research Centre"}, "7102745096": {"Name": "Bradshaw M.", "AuthorID": "7102745096", "AffiliationID": "119818678", "AffiliationName": "UK Energy Research Centre"}, "57209845046": {"Name": "Watson J.", "AuthorID": "57209845046", "AffiliationID": "60017317", "AffiliationName": "SPRU, University of Sussex"}}}
