Materials and Methods: Local ethics committee approved the study, with patient informed written consent. On day 2 after successful primary angioplasty for STEMI, 53 patients were prospectively enrolled; 40 patients (mean age, 60 years) completed study. Two sets of cardiac magnetic resonance (MR) images were obtained on same day 6 hours apart. Basal, midcavity, and apical sections were obtained with each sequence. Interobserver, intraobserver, and interimage variability (1 minus intraclass correlation coefficient) and agreement (Bland-Altman method) were assessed. Results: Size of myocardial edema significantly differed. Mean size of myocardium at risk was similar between T2-weighted STIR (18.2 g) and T2 mapping (17.3 g) (P =.54). Mean size differed between T2-weighted STIR (18.2 g) and ACUT2E (14.0 g) (P =.01) and between T2-weighted STIR (18.2 g) and EGE (14.2 g) (P =.003). T2 mapping and EGE had best agreement (interobserver bias: T2-weighted STIR, -0.9 [mean difference] \u00b1 9.6 [standard deviation]; ACUT2E, -2.5 \u00b1 6.9; T2 mapping, -3.8 \u00b1 4.7; EGE, -5.3 \u00b1 5.9; interimage bias: T2-weighted STIR, 1.5 6 5.8; ACUT2E, -0.8 \u00b1 4.9; T2 mapping, 3.1 \u00b1 4.0; EGE, 1.1 \u00b1 4.9; intraobserver bias: T2-weighted STIR, 1.4 6 5.8; ACUT2E, 0.6 \u00b1 4.7; T2 mapping, 2.2 \u00b1 3.1; EGE, 1.7 6 2.9). Variability was lowest for T2 mapping (intraobserver, 0.05; interobserver, 0.09; interimage, 0.1) followed by EGE (intraobserver, 0.03; interobserver, 0.14; interimage, 0.14), with improved detection of territory of IRA versus ACUT2E (intraobserver, 0.11; interobserver, 0.22; interimage, 0.12) and T2-weighted STIR (intraobserver, 0.1; interobserver, 0.32; interimage, 0.1). Conclusion: Cardiac MR methods to detect and quantify infarct myocardial edema are not interchangeable; T2 mapping is the most reproducible method, followed by EGE, ACUT2E, and T2-weighted STIR.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Contrast Media", "Edema, Cardiac", "Female", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Cine", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Myocardial Infarction", "Myocardium", "Organometallic Compounds", "Reproducibility of Results", "Risk Assessment"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84926475838", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"46461927400": {"Name": "McAlindon E.J.", "AuthorID": "46461927400", "AffiliationID": "60020650, 60171204, 60031070", "AffiliationName": "Bristol Heart Institute, University of Bristol, Bristol NIHR Cardiovascular Biomedical Research Unit"}, "55059328200": {"Name": "Lawton C.B.", "AuthorID": "55059328200", "AffiliationID": "60020650, 60171204, 60031070", "AffiliationName": "Bristol Heart Institute, University of Bristol, Bristol NIHR Cardiovascular Biomedical Research Unit"}, "9635925300": {"Name": "Manghat N.", "AuthorID": "9635925300", "AffiliationID": "60020650, 60171204, 60031070", "AffiliationName": "Bristol Heart Institute, University of Bristol, Bristol NIHR Cardiovascular Biomedical Research Unit"}, "24338061400": {"Name": "Hamilton M.C.K.", "AuthorID": "24338061400", "AffiliationID": "60020650, 60171204, 60031070", "AffiliationName": "Bristol Heart Institute, University of Bristol, Bristol NIHR Cardiovascular Biomedical Research Unit"}, "18534251300": {"Name": "Bucciarelli-Ducci C.", "AuthorID": "18534251300", "AffiliationID": "60020650, 60171204, 60031070", "AffiliationName": "Bristol Heart Institute, University of Bristol, Bristol NIHR Cardiovascular Biomedical Research Unit"}, "6507534594": {"Name": "Pufulete M.", "AuthorID": "6507534594", "AffiliationID": "60020650, 60171204, 60031070", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Trial and Evaluation Unit, University of Bristol, Bristol NIHR Cardiovascular Biomedical Research Unit"}, "55474575800": {"Name": "Harris J.M.", "AuthorID": "55474575800", "AffiliationID": "60020650, 60171204, 60031070", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Trial and Evaluation Unit, University of Bristol, Bristol NIHR Cardiovascular Biomedical Research Unit"}, "7403231345": {"Name": "Moon J.C.", "AuthorID": "7403231345", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Heart Hospital"}, "14061632000": {"Name": "Weale P.J.", "AuthorID": "14061632000", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Siemens Healthcare"}}}
