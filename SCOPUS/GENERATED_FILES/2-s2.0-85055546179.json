This paper presents an analysis of the surface topographical properties of the worn and unworn condylar surfaces on a small cohort of both wear simulated and retrieved prostheses of varying designs. A number of measurement points were taken on each prostheses in a mixture of worn and unworn areas through the use of focus-variation microscopy (FVM), a non-contact method of surface measurement. Surface areal parameters were extracted from this data to analyse and search for patterns within the data. It was found that in general, worn implant surfaces appear to show smoother, less peak dominated surfaces than unworn area. It was also found that wear simulated and retrieved implants display similar characteristics of surface topography. In addition, variation was noted between different designs of TKR device, with posterior stabilised designs found to be peak dominated and cruciate retaining type implants being valley dominated.", "AuthorKeywords": ["biometrology", "focus variation microscopy", "surface measurement", "total knee replacement"], "IndexKeywords": ["Biometrology", "Elective surgeries", "Focus variation", "Measurement points", "Noncontact methods", "Retrieved implant", "Topographical properties", "Total knee replacement"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85055546179", "SubjectAreas": [["Instrumentation", "PHYS", "3105"], ["Process Chemistry and Technology", "CENG", "1508"], ["Surfaces, Coatings and Films", "MATE", "2508"], ["Materials Chemistry", "MATE", "2505"]], "AuthorData": {"57204417606": {"Name": "Holland M.", "AuthorID": "57204417606", "AffiliationID": "60032343", "AffiliationName": "EPSRC Future Metrology Hub, University of Huddersfield"}, "57209211832": {"Name": "Fleming L.", "AuthorID": "57209211832", "AffiliationID": "60032343", "AffiliationName": "EPSRC Future Metrology Hub, University of Huddersfield"}, "56423296300": {"Name": "Walton K.", "AuthorID": "56423296300", "AffiliationID": "60032343", "AffiliationName": "EPSRC Future Metrology Hub, University of Huddersfield"}, "54790602700": {"Name": "Bills P.", "AuthorID": "54790602700", "AffiliationID": "60032343", "AffiliationName": "EPSRC Future Metrology Hub, University of Huddersfield"}, "57192315916": {"Name": "Cerquiglini A.", "AuthorID": "57192315916", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "London Implant Retrieval Centre, University College London"}, "6506962865": {"Name": "Hothi H.", "AuthorID": "6506962865", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "London Implant Retrieval Centre, University College London"}, "24597673100": {"Name": "Hart A.", "AuthorID": "24597673100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "London Implant Retrieval Centre, University College London"}, "8281611700": {"Name": "Skinner J.", "AuthorID": "8281611700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "London Implant Retrieval Centre, University College London"}}}
