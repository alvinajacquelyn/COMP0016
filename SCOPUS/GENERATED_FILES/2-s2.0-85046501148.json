For many applied purposes, however, the detection of false reports about someone\u2019s intention merits attention. Based on the verbal deception detection paradigm, we explored whether true statements on intentions were more detailed and more specific than false statements on intentions, particularly when instructed to be as specific as possible. Method: Participants (n = 222) lied or told the truth about their upcoming travel plans either providing \u2018as much information as possible\u2019 (standard instructions) or being \u2018as specific as possible\u2019 (i.e., mentioning times, locations, places; specific instructions), resulting in four conditions (truthful vs. deceptive intention by standard vs. specific instructions). We collected data via a custom-made web app and performed automated verbal content analysis of participants\u2019 written answers. Findings: We did not find a significant difference in the specificity of participants\u2019 statements. The instruction to be as specific as possible promoted more specific information but did not help to discern honest from deceptive flying intentions. Conclusion: The experiment reported here attempted to demonstrate automated verbal deception detection of intentions. The difficulty in capturing genuine intentions, and the non-intrusive, non-interactive questioning approach might explain the null findings and raise questions for further research. We conclude with suggestions for a novel framework on semi-interactive information elicitation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Airport screening", "Deception detection", "Deceptive intentions", "Information protocol", "Reality Monitoring"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85046501148", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychology (all)", "PSYC", "3200"]], "AuthorData": {"56518219900": {"Name": "Kleinberg B.", "AuthorID": "56518219900", "AffiliationID": "60002483", "AffiliationName": "University of Amsterdam"}, "7004860356": {"Name": "Arntz A.", "AuthorID": "7004860356", "AffiliationID": "60002483", "AffiliationName": "University of Amsterdam"}, "6602849119": {"Name": "Verschuere B.", "AuthorID": "6602849119", "AffiliationID": "60002483", "AffiliationName": "University of Amsterdam"}, "6504717695": {"Name": "Nahari G.", "AuthorID": "6504717695", "AffiliationID": "60002765", "AffiliationName": "Bar-Ilan University"}}}
