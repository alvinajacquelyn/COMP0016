The majority of neonatal seizures are acute symptomatic seizures. In term infants hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy is the most common underlying factor, typically with onset in the first 24\u202fh of life. Other causes include stroke, hemorrhages, infections and errors of metabolism. Epilepsy syndromes with onset in the neonatal period include self-limiting familial and non-familial neonatal seizures, early myoclonic encephalopathy and early infantile epileptic encephalopathy with burst suppression pattern (Ohtahara syndrome). Due to the broad differential diagnosis the initial investigations should concentrate on the common etiologies, which require prompt specific treatment and include blood glucose, electrolytes, blood gas analysis, infection screening, cerebral ultrasound scanning and electroencephalography (EEG). The clinical diagnosis of neonatal seizures is unreliable and around 50\u201370% of the seizures are only electrographically presented. Therefore, in this situation EEG is absolutely necessary to confirm the diagnosis of suspicious clinical symptoms and to determine electrographic seizures and this also correlates with the prognosis. Phenobarbital remains the drug of choice in the treatment of neonates achieving clinical control in 40\u201360% of cases. The choice of second line antiepileptic drugs (AED) varies considerably and include levetiracetam, phenytoin with midazolam and lignocaine; however, both phenobarbital and phenytoin can increase electroclinical dissociation. If seizures are refractory to treatment and/or the EEG shows suggestive background abnormalities, an early attempt at treatment with pyridoxine, pyridoxal-5-phosphate and folic acid is indicated. The prognosis of neonatal seizures is mainly determined by the etiology. There is increasing evidence that both electroclinical and purely electrographic seizures have equivalent adverse effects on neurodevelopmental outcome.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Acute symptomatic seizures", "Amplitude-integrated electroencephalography", "Antiepileptic drugs", "Electroencephalogram", "Epilepsy"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85061034146", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"6602252366": {"Name": "Pressler R.M.", "AuthorID": "6602252366", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Neuroscience Unit, Institute of Child Health UCL"}}}
