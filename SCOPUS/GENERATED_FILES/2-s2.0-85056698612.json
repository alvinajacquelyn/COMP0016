This debate concluded with a suggestion that sociolinguistic methods offer an alternative analytic lens for evaluating CST. We demonstrate here that the utility of sociolinguistic methods in CST is not limited to critique, but also presents an important tool for development and delivery. Methods: Following a scoping review of the use of role play and simulated interaction in CST for healthcare professionals, we consider the use of the specific sociolinguistic approach of conversation analysis (CA), which has been applied to the study of health communication in a wide range of settings, as well as to the development of training. Discussion: Role play and simulated interaction have been criticised by both clinicians and sociolinguists for a lack of authenticity as compared to real life interactions. However they contain a number of aspects which healthcare professionals report finding particularly useful: the need to think on one's feet in real time, as in actual interaction with patients; the ability to receive feedback on the simulation; and the ability to watch and reflect on how others approach the same simulation task in real time. Since sociolinguistic approaches can help to identify inauthenticity in role play and simulation, they can also be used to improve authenticity. Analysis of real-life interactions using sociolinguistic methods, and CA in particular, can identify actual interactional practices that are used by particular patient groups. These practices can then be used to inform the training of actors simulating patients. In addition, the emphasis of CA on talk as joint activity means that proper account can be taken of the way in which simulated interaction is co-constructed between simulator and trainee. Summary: We suggest that as well as identifying potential weaknesses in current role play and simulation practice, conversation analysis offers the potential to enhance and develop the authenticity of these training methods.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Communications skills training", "Conversation analysis", "Role play", "Simulated interaction", "Simulated patient"], "IndexKeywords": ["Attitude of Health Personnel", "Communication", "Education, Medical, Continuing", "Health Personnel", "Humans", "Interpersonal Relations", "Language", "Patient Simulation", "Physician-Patient Relations", "Process Assessment (Health Care)", "Program Development", "Role Playing"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85056698612", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"]], "AuthorData": {"6603635031": {"Name": "Pilnick A.", "AuthorID": "6603635031", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "School of Sociology and Social Policy, University of Nottingham"}, "57103599600": {"Name": "Trusson D.", "AuthorID": "57103599600", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Mental Health, University of Nottingham"}, "57203917835": {"Name": "Beeke S.", "AuthorID": "57203917835", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Language and Cognition Research Department, University College London"}, "57195671320": {"Name": "O'Brien R.", "AuthorID": "57195671320", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "School of Health Sciences, University of Nottingham"}, "40461295900": {"Name": "Goldberg S.", "AuthorID": "40461295900", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "School of Health Sciences, University of Nottingham"}, "7101978681": {"Name": "Harwood R.H.", "AuthorID": "7101978681", "AffiliationID": "60025016", "AffiliationName": "Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust"}}}
