In order to predict how people would perceive an acoustic environment, it is central to identify its underlying acoustic properties. This was the purpose of the present study. Three successive experiments were conducted. With the aid of 30 university students, the first experiment mapped the underlying dimensions of perceived similarity among 50 acoustic environments, using a visual sorting task of their spectrograms. Three dimensions were identified: (1) Distinguishable-Indistinguishable sound sources, (2) Background-Foreground sounds, and (3) Intrusive-Smooth sound sources. The second experiment was aimed to validate the results from Experiment 1 by a listening experiment. However, a majority of the 10 expert listeners involved in Experiment 2 used a qualitatively different approach than the 30 university students in Experiment 1. A third experiment was conducted in which 10 more expert listeners performed the same task as per Experiment 2, with spliced audio signals. Nevertheless, Experiment 3 provided a statistically significantly worse result than Experiment 2. These results suggest that information about the meaning of the recorded sounds could be retrieved in the spectrograms, and that the meaning of the sounds may be captured with the aid of holistic features of the acoustic environment, but such features are still unexplored and further in-depth research is needed in this field.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Acoustic environment", "Listening experiment", "PCA", "Perceived similarity", "Soundscape"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85022341600", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychology (all)", "PSYC", "3200"]], "AuthorData": {"55557756700": {"Name": "Aletta F.", "AuthorID": "55557756700", "AffiliationID": "60033316", "AffiliationName": "WAVES Research Group, Department of Information Technology, Ghent University"}, "55485135500": {"Name": "Kang J.", "AuthorID": "55485135500", "AffiliationID": "60001881", "AffiliationName": "Acoustics Group, School of Architecture, University of Sheffield"}, "7006410315": {"Name": "Axelsson \u00d6.", "AuthorID": "7006410315", "AffiliationID": "60028378", "AffiliationName": "G\u00f6sta Ekman Laboratory, Department of Psychology, Stockholm University"}}}
