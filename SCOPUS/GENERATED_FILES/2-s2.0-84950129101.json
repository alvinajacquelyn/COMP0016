This disproof procedure attempts to infer the existence of a countermodel to an entailment by comparing computable model summaries, a.k.a. bases (modified from earlier work), of its antecedent and consequent. Our method is sound and terminating, but necessarily incomplete. Experiments with the implementation of our disproof procedure indicate that it can correctly identify a substantial proportion of the invalid entailments that arise in practice, at reasonably low time cost. Accordingly, it can be used, e.g., to improve the output of theorem provers by returning \u201cno\u201d answers in addition to \u201cyes\u201d and \u201cunknown\u201d answers to entailment questions, and to speed up proof search or automated theory exploration by filtering out invalid entailments.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Base pairs", "Computable models", "Program Verification", "Proof search", "Separation logic", "Speed up", "Theorem provers", "Time cost"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84950129101", "SubjectAreas": [["Theoretical Computer Science", "MATH", "2614"], ["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"]], "AuthorData": {"6603688854": {"Name": "Brotherston J.", "AuthorID": "6603688854", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dept. of Computer Science, University College London"}, "8338765000": {"Name": "Gorogiannis N.", "AuthorID": "8338765000", "AffiliationID": "60014105", "AffiliationName": "Dept. of Computer Science, Middlesex University London"}}}
