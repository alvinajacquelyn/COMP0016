Materials and Methods: We prospectively enrolled 15 consecutive patients (6 women, 63.2 \u00b1 13.4 years) with rectal cancer, who underwent pretreatment andmidtreatment 3-T magnetic resonance imaging. Treatment protocol consisted of neoadjuvant CRTwith oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracile. Texture analysis using a filtration-histogram technique was performed using a commercial research software algorithm (TexRAD Ltd, Somerset, England, United Kingdom) on unenhanced axial T2w images by manually delineating a region of interest around the tumor outline for the largest cross-sectional area. The technique selectively filters and extracts textures at different anatomic scales followed by quantification of the histogram using kurtosis, entropy, skewness, and mean value of positive pixels. After CRT, all patients underwent complete surgical resection and the surgical specimen served as the gold standard. Results: Six patients showed pathological complete response (pCR), and 4 patients, partial response (PR). Five patients were classified as nonresponders (NRs). Pretreatment medium texture-scale quantified as kurtosiswas significantly lower in the pCRsubgroup in comparison with the PR+ NR subgroup (P = 0.01). Midtreatment kurtosis without filtration was significantly higher in pCR in comparison with PR + NR (P = 0.045). The change in kurtosis between midtreatment and pretreatment images was significantly lower in the PR + NR subgroup compared with the pCR subgroup (P = 0.038). Pretreatment area under the receiver operating characteristic curves, to discriminate between pCR and PR + NR, was significantly higher for kurtosis (0.907, P < 0.001) compared with all other parameters. The optimal cutoff value for pretreatment kurtosis was 0.19 or less. Using this value, the sensitivity and specificity for pCR prediction were 100% and 77.8%, respectively. Conclusion: Texture parameters derived from T2w images of rectal cancer have the potential to act as imaging biomarkers of tumoral response to neoadjuvant CRT.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Imaging biomarkers", "Magnetic resonance imaging", "Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy", "Rectal cancer", "Texture analysis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Biomarkers, Tumor", "Chemoradiotherapy", "Female", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Neoadjuvant Therapy", "Prospective Studies", "Rectal Neoplasms", "ROC Curve", "Sensitivity and Specificity", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84925272116", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"18534836600": {"Name": "De Cecco C.", "AuthorID": "18534836600", "AffiliationID": "60023222", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology and Radiological Science, Medical University of South Carolina"}, "36097706000": {"Name": "Ciolina M.", "AuthorID": "36097706000", "AffiliationID": "60032350", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiological Sciences, Oncology, and Pathology, University of Rome Sapienza-Polo Pontino"}, "55387537100": {"Name": "Rengo M.", "AuthorID": "55387537100", "AffiliationID": "60032350", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiological Sciences, Oncology, and Pathology, University of Rome Sapienza-Polo Pontino"}, "18340271400": {"Name": "Laghi A.", "AuthorID": "18340271400", "AffiliationID": "60032350", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiological Sciences, Oncology, and Pathology, University of Rome Sapienza-Polo Pontino"}, "54956241500": {"Name": "Meinel F.", "AuthorID": "54956241500", "AffiliationID": "60000291", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Clinical Radiology, Ludwig-Maximilians-University Hospital"}, "8556612100": {"Name": "Ganeshan B.", "AuthorID": "8556612100", "AffiliationID": "60100018", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Imaging Sciences Centre, Brighton and Sussex Medical School"}, "6505552891": {"Name": "Musio D.", "AuthorID": "6505552891", "AffiliationID": "60032350", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiotherapy, University of Rome Sapienza"}, "55316015400": {"Name": "De Felice F.", "AuthorID": "55316015400", "AffiliationID": "60032350", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiotherapy, University of Rome Sapienza"}, "6602671082": {"Name": "Raffetto N.", "AuthorID": "6602671082", "AffiliationID": "60032350", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiotherapy, University of Rome Sapienza"}, "7004832297": {"Name": "Tombolini V.", "AuthorID": "7004832297", "AffiliationID": "60032350", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiotherapy, University of Rome Sapienza"}}}
