All rights reserved.The intercalation of the anions of diclofenac (Dic), naproxen (Nap), and valproic acid (Val) into three hydroxy double salts (HDSs) has been explored in this work. Experiments were performed with [Co1.2Zn3.8(OH)8](NO3)2\u00b72H2O (CoZn-NO3), [Ni2Zn3(OH)8](NO3)2\u00b72H2O (NiZn-NO3) and [Zn5(OH)8](NO3)2\u00b72H2O (Zn-NO3). It proved possible to intercalate diclofenac and naproxen into all three HDSs. In contrast, Val could be intercalated into CoZn-NO3 but when it was reacted with Zn-NO3 the HDS structure was destroyed, and the product comprised ZnO. Successful intercalation was verified by X-ray diffraction, IR spectroscopy, and elemental microanalysis. Molecular dynamics simulations showed the Dic and Nap ions to arrange themselves in an \"X\" shape in the interlayer space, forming a bilayer. Val was found to adopt a position with its aliphatic groups parallel to the HDS layer, again in a bilayer. In situ time resolved X-ray diffraction experiments revealed that intercalation of Dic and Nap into CoZn-NO3 and Zn-NO3 is mechanistically complex, with a number of intermediate phases observed. In contrast, the intercalation of all three guests into NiZn-NO3 and of Val into CoZn-NO3 are simple one step reactions proceeding directly from the starting material to the product. The HDS-drug composites were found to have sustained release profiles.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Drug delivery systems", "Hydroxy double salt", "In situ diffraction", "Intercalation", "Molecular dynamics"], "IndexKeywords": ["Drug delivery system", "Elemental microanalysis", "Functional performance", "Hydroxy double salts", "In-situ diffraction", "In-situ time-resolved x-ray diffraction", "Intercalation mechanisms", "Molecular dynamics simulations"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84962591601", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Ceramics and Composites", "MATE", "2503"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"], ["Inorganic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1604"], ["Materials Chemistry", "MATE", "2505"]], "AuthorData": {"56040141600": {"Name": "Kaassis A.Y.A.", "AuthorID": "56040141600", "AffiliationID": "60016379, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "7406083266": {"Name": "Williams G.R.", "AuthorID": "7406083266", "AffiliationID": "60016379, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "57210738625": {"Name": "Xu S.M.", "AuthorID": "57210738625", "AffiliationID": "60021843", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Chemical Resource Engineering, Beijing University of Chemical Technology"}, "57113046700": {"Name": "Guan S.", "AuthorID": "57113046700", "AffiliationID": "60021843", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Chemical Resource Engineering, Beijing University of Chemical Technology"}, "57199095509": {"Name": "Evans D.G.", "AuthorID": "57199095509", "AffiliationID": "60021843", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Chemical Resource Engineering, Beijing University of Chemical Technology"}, "57207710154": {"Name": "Wei M.", "AuthorID": "57207710154", "AffiliationID": "60021843", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Chemical Resource Engineering, Beijing University of Chemical Technology"}}}
