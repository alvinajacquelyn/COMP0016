Methods A total of 181 European Pediatric Surgeons' Association members (91% senior) from 48 countries completed an online questionnaire. Main Results Prenatal: 93% respondents work in centers with prenatal diagnosis facilities, and 27% in centers offering in utero surgery. Prenatal counseling is performed by 86% respondents, 22% of whom see >10 cases per year. Risk of single pre-/postnatal complications is deemed low (<5%) by more than 60% of respondents. Eighty-six percent respondents do not offer pregnancy termination for prenatally diagnosed CPAM. Fetal hydrops is the most frequent indication for termination (87%), followed by parental willingness (52%). Prenatal surgery is an option for 44% respondents, preferring thoracoamniotic shunt (82%). Postnatal: 75% respondents operate on asymptomatic patients, 18% before 6 months of age, 62% between 6 and 12 months of age, and 20% after 12 months of age. Risk of infection (86%), cancer (63%), and symptoms development (62%) are indications for surgery in asymptomatic CPAM. Sixty-three percent prefer a thoracotomy. Lobectomy is the preferred procedure (58% respondents). Motivations against surgery include lesion <1 cm (64%), risk of postoperative complications (37%), and lack of evidence favoring surgery (27%). Seventeen percent respondents have seen at least one patient with CPAM with lung cancer, in 89% of the cases within the CPAM. Of all the respondents, 83% and 22% offered dedicated follow-up and genetic screening, respectively. Conclusion Current pre- and postnatal management of CPAM lacks uniformity, particularly for surgical indication, timing, and approach. Efforts should be made toward standardization. Risk of CPAM-associated cancer is not clear.", "AuthorKeywords": ["congenital lung anomalies", "observation", "postnatal", "prenatal", "surgery"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cystic Adenomatoid Malformation of Lung, Congenital", "Europe", "Female", "Fetal Therapies", "Health Care Surveys", "Humans", "Infant, Newborn", "Postnatal Care", "Practice Patterns, Physicians'", "Pregnancy", "Prenatal Care", "Prenatal Diagnosis"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85024487576", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"]], "AuthorData": {"7004052737": {"Name": "Morini F.", "AuthorID": "7004052737", "AffiliationID": "60017905", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical and Surgical Neonatology, Bambino Gesu Children's Hospital IRCCS"}, "7006120288": {"Name": "Conforti A.", "AuthorID": "7006120288", "AffiliationID": "60017905", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical and Surgical Neonatology, Bambino Gesu Children's Hospital IRCCS"}, "7003559399": {"Name": "Bagolan P.", "AuthorID": "7003559399", "AffiliationID": "60017905", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical and Surgical Neonatology, Bambino Gesu Children's Hospital IRCCS"}, "7003624486": {"Name": "Zani A.", "AuthorID": "7003624486", "AffiliationID": "60030319", "AffiliationName": "Division of General and Thoracic Surgery, Hospital for Sick Children"}, "7007034902": {"Name": "Pierro A.", "AuthorID": "7007034902", "AffiliationID": "60030319", "AffiliationName": "Division of General and Thoracic Surgery, Hospital for Sick Children"}, "55409357600": {"Name": "Van Heurn E.", "AuthorID": "55409357600", "AffiliationID": "60001157, 60001997", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatric Surgery, AMC/VUMC"}, "7102181886": {"Name": "Eaton S.", "AuthorID": "7102181886", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Surgery, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Trust"}, "56000309600": {"Name": "Puri P.", "AuthorID": "56000309600", "AffiliationID": "112740561", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Surgery, National Children's Research Centre"}, "7005746997": {"Name": "Rintala R.", "AuthorID": "7005746997", "AffiliationID": "60021365", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Surgery, Hospital for Children and Adolescents"}, "7003769857": {"Name": "Lukac M.", "AuthorID": "7003769857", "AffiliationID": "60069693", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neonatal Surgery, University Children's Hospital"}, "7004658320": {"Name": "Kuebler J.F.", "AuthorID": "7004658320", "AffiliationID": "60024052", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatric Surgery, Hannover Medical School"}, "43561373600": {"Name": "Friedmacher F.", "AuthorID": "43561373600", "AffiliationID": "60020035", "AffiliationName": "National Children's Research Centre, Our Lady's Children's Hospital"}, "6701675712": {"Name": "Wijnen R.", "AuthorID": "6701675712", "AffiliationID": "60015627, 60032114", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatric Surgery, Sophia Children's Hospital, Erasmus MC"}, "7101686384": {"Name": "Tovar J.A.", "AuthorID": "7101686384", "AffiliationID": "60028162", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatric Surgery, Hospital Universitario la Paz"}}}
