We used correlation, Fourier, and wavelet analyses methods to examine the temporal fine structures and relationships between the time profiles in each wave band. We found that the time profiles of the microwaves, hard X-rays, and type III radio bursts vary quasi-periodically with a common period of 40 \u2013 50 s. The average amplitude of the variations is high, above 30 % of the background flux level, and reaches 80 % after the flare maximum. We did not find this periodicity in either the thermal X-ray flux component or in the source size dynamics. Our findings indicate that the detected periodicity is probably associated with periodic dynamics in the injection of non-thermal electrons, which can be produced by periodic modulation of magnetic reconnection.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Corona, Radio emission", "Flares, Energetic particles", "Flares, Impulsive phase", "Magnetic reconnection, Observational signatures", "Radio bursts, Microwave (mm, cm)", "Radio bursts, Type III", "X-Ray bursts, Association with flares"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84981194163", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"8872194400": {"Name": "Kupriyanova E.", "AuthorID": "8872194400", "AffiliationID": "60070886, 60021331", "AffiliationName": "Central Astronomical Observatory at Pulkovo of the RAS"}, "12767931400": {"Name": "Kashapova L.", "AuthorID": "12767931400", "AffiliationID": "60069972", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Solar\u2013Terrestrial Physics SB RAS"}, "26435468500": {"Name": "Reid H.", "AuthorID": "26435468500", "AffiliationID": "60001490", "AffiliationName": "SUPA School of Physics and Astronomy, University of Glasgow"}, "6603527507": {"Name": "Myagkova I.", "AuthorID": "6603527507", "AffiliationID": "60007457", "AffiliationName": "Skobeltsyn Institute of Nuclear Physics, Lomonosov Moscow State University"}}}
