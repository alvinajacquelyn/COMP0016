Elevated levels of the FXN antisense transcript (FAST-1) have previously been detected in FRDA. To investigate the effects of FAST-1 on the FXN gene expression, we first stably overexpressed FAST-1 in non-FRDA cell lines and then we knocked down FAST-1 in FRDA fibroblast cells. We observed decreased FXN expression in each FAST-1 overexpressing cell type compared to control cells. We also found that FAST-1 overexpression is associated with both CCCTC-Binding Factor (CTCF) depletion and heterochromatin formation at the 5\u2032UTR of the FXN gene. We further showed that knocking down FAST-1 in FRDA fibroblast cells significantly increased FXN expression. Our results indicate that FAST-1 can act in trans in a similar manner to the cis-acting FAST-1 overexpression that has previously been identified in FRDA fibroblasts. The effects of stably transfected FAST-1 expression on CTCF occupancy and heterochromatin formation at the FXN locus suggest a direct role for FAST-1 in the FRDA molecular disease mechanism. Our findings also support the hypothesis that inhibition of FAST-1 may be a potential approach for FRDA therapy.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Cells, Cultured", "Friedreich Ataxia", "Gene Expression Regulation", "Humans", "Iron-Binding Proteins", "RNA, Antisense"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85056979686", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"57204738985": {"Name": "Mikaeili H.", "AuthorID": "57204738985", "AffiliationID": "60020623, 60166873", "AffiliationName": "Division of Biosciences, Department of Life Sciences, College of Health & Life Sciences, and Synthetic Biology Theme, Institute of Environment, Health & Societies, Brunel University London"}, "54950699800": {"Name": "Sandi M.", "AuthorID": "54950699800", "AffiliationID": "60020623, 60166873", "AffiliationName": "Division of Biosciences, Department of Life Sciences, College of Health & Life Sciences, and Synthetic Biology Theme, Institute of Environment, Health & Societies, Brunel University London"}, "57205258355": {"Name": "Bayot A.", "AuthorID": "57205258355", "AffiliationID": "60001772, 60008134", "AffiliationName": "Mitochondrial Biology Group, CNRS UMR 3691, Departement of Cell Biology and Infection, Institut Pasteur"}, "6603954575": {"Name": "Al-Mahdawi S.", "AuthorID": "6603954575", "AffiliationID": "60020623, 60166873", "AffiliationName": "Division of Biosciences, Department of Life Sciences, College of Health & Life Sciences, and Synthetic Biology Theme, Institute of Environment, Health & Societies, Brunel University London"}, "7003641050": {"Name": "Pook M.A.", "AuthorID": "7003641050", "AffiliationID": "60020623, 60166873", "AffiliationName": "Division of Biosciences, Department of Life Sciences, College of Health & Life Sciences, and Synthetic Biology Theme, Institute of Environment, Health & Societies, Brunel University London"}}}
