Increased fronto-temporal theta coherence and failure of its stimulus-specific modulation have been reported in schizophrenia, but the psychological correlates and underlying neural mechanisms remain elusive. Mice lacking the putative schizophrenia risk gene GRIA1 (Gria1 \u2013/\u2013 ), which encodes GLUA1, show strongly impaired spatial working memory and elevated selective attention owing to a deficit in stimulus-specific short-term habituation. A failure of short-term habituation has been suggested to cause an aberrant assignment of salience and thereby psychosis in schizophrenia. We recorded hippocampal\u2013prefrontal coherence while assessing spatial working memory and short-term habituation in these animals, wildtype (WT) controls, and Gria1 \u2013/\u2013 mice in which GLUA1 expression was restored in hippocampal subfields CA2 and CA3. We found that beta (20\u201330 Hz) and low-gamma (30\u201348 Hz) frequency coherence could predict working memory performance, whereas\u2014surprisingly\u2014theta (6\u201312 Hz) coherence was unrelated to performance and largely unaffected by genotype in this task. In contrast, in novel environments, theta coherence specifically tracked exploration-related attention in WT mice, but was strongly elevated and unmodulated in Gria1-knockouts, thereby correlating with impaired short-term habituation. Strikingly, reintroduction of GLUA1 selectively into CA2/CA3 restored abnormal short-term habituation, theta coherence, and hippocampal and prefrontal theta oscillations. Although local oscillations and coherence in other frequency bands (beta, gamma), and theta-gamma cross-frequency coupling also showed dependence on GLUA1, none of them correlated with short-term habituation. Therefore, sustained elevation of hippocampal\u2013prefrontal theta coherence may underlie a failure in regulating novelty-related selective attention leading to aberrant salience, and thereby represents a mechanistic link between GRIA1 and schizophrenia.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Attention", "Behavior, Animal", "Female", "Hippocampus", "Male", "Memory Disorders", "Memory, Short-Term", "Mice", "Mice, Knockout", "Receptors, AMPA", "Schizophrenia", "Spatial Memory"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85064544508", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"], ["Biological Psychiatry", "NEUR", "2803"]], "AuthorData": {"56037543800": {"Name": "Bygrave A.M.", "AuthorID": "56037543800", "AffiliationID": "60005248", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Johns Hopkins University"}, "56084401900": {"Name": "Jahans-Price T.", "AuthorID": "56084401900", "AffiliationID": "60002634", "AffiliationName": "Department of Experimental Psychology, University of Oxford"}, "18438980500": {"Name": "Wolff A.R.", "AuthorID": "18438980500", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "26642885900": {"Name": "Bannerman D.M.", "AuthorID": "26642885900", "AffiliationID": "60002634", "AffiliationName": "Department of Experimental Psychology, University of Oxford"}, "37034229300": {"Name": "K\u00e4tzel D.", "AuthorID": "37034229300", "AffiliationID": "60010586", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Applied Physiology, Ulm University"}, "7006451604": {"Name": "Kullmann D.M.", "AuthorID": "7006451604", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "56271290400": {"Name": "Sprengel R.", "AuthorID": "56271290400", "AffiliationID": "60016908", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Anatomy and Cell Biology, Heidelberg University"}}}
