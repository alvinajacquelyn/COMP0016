These basis functions are particularly convenient in the numerical implementation because they reduce the degree of the Kernel singularity. Recently, a nonconforming implementation of the TE-EFIE discretized with discontinuous piecewise linear basis functions has been successfully developed with the testing procedure done over small surface entities attached to the boundary of the object, inside the body under analysis. In this paper we present a novel nonconforming discretization of the TE-EFIE based on discontinuous piecewise linear basis functions with a testing procedure that relies only on line integrals. This allows for an easier and more efficient computation of the impedance matrix elements while preserving the improved far-field accuracy observed for sharp edged objects in the previous surface-tested TE-EFIE implementation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Accuracy", "Impedance", "Integral equations", "Kernel", "Method of moments", "Surface impedance", "Testing"], "IndexKeywords": ["Accuracy", "Electric field integral equation", "Impedance matrix elements", "Kernel", "Method of moments (MOM)", "Nonconforming discretization", "Numerical implementation", "Surface impedances"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84955441639", "SubjectAreas": [["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"], ["Instrumentation", "PHYS", "3105"], ["Radiation", "PHYS", "3108"]], "AuthorData": {"56404677400": {"Name": "Sekulic I.", "AuthorID": "56404677400", "AffiliationID": "60007592", "AffiliationName": "Department of Signal Theory and Communications, Universitat Polit\u00e8cnica de Catalunya"}, "6602087365": {"Name": "Ubeda E.", "AuthorID": "6602087365", "AffiliationID": "60007592", "AffiliationName": "Department of Signal Theory and Communications, Universitat Polit\u00e8cnica de Catalunya"}, "7006933058": {"Name": "Rius J.", "AuthorID": "7006933058", "AffiliationID": "60007592", "AffiliationName": "Department of Signal Theory and Communications, Universitat Polit\u00e8cnica de Catalunya"}}}
