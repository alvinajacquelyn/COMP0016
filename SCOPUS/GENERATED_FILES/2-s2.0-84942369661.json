We implement an optimization routine based on the genetic algorithm to perform a heuristic search for discrete wavelength combinations that can provide accurate concentration information when benchmarked against the gold standard of 121 wavelengths. The results indicate that it is possible to significantly reduce the number of measurement wavelengths used in conjunction with spectroscopic algorithms and still achieve a high performance in estimating changes in concentrations of oxyhemoglobin, deoxyhemoglobin, and oxidized cytochrome c oxidase. While the use of a 3-wavelength combination leads to mean recovery errors of up to 10%, these errors drop to less than 4% with 4 or 5 wavelengths and to even less than 2% with 8 wavelengths.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Cerebral tissues", "Cytochrome c oxidase", "Deoxyhemoglobin", "Heuristic search", "Hypoxia-ischemia", "Optimal wavelength", "Optimization routine", "Oxidized cytochrome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84942369661", "SubjectAreas": [["Biotechnology", "BIOC", "1305"], ["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"]], "AuthorData": {"16021240300": {"Name": "Arifler D.", "AuthorID": "16021240300", "AffiliationID": "60004305", "AffiliationName": "Middle East Technical University, Northern Cyprus Campus"}, "55695070200": {"Name": "Zhu T.", "AuthorID": "55695070200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "56560005400": {"Name": "Madaan S.", "AuthorID": "56560005400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "6507301690": {"Name": "Tachtsidis I.", "AuthorID": "6507301690", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}}}
