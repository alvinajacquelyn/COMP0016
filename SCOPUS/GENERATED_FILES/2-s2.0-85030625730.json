As with previous extensions of Kleene Algebra, characterizing the free model is crucial in order to develop the foundations of the theory and potential applications. For CKA, this has been an open question for a few years and this paper makes an important step towards an answer. We present a new automaton model and a Kleene-like theorem that relates a relaxed version of CKA to series-parallel pomset languages, which are a natural candidate for the free model. There are two substantial differences with previous work: from expressions to automata, we use Brzozowski derivatives, which enable a direct construction of the automaton; from automata to expressions, we provide a syntactic characterization of the automata that denote valid CKA behaviours.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Automata", "Brzozowski derivatives", "Concurrency", "Kleene theorem", "Pomsets", "Series-rational expressions"], "IndexKeywords": ["Automata", "Concurrency", "Kleene theorem", "Pomsets", "Rational expressions"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": null, "EID": "2-s2.0-85030625730", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"]], "AuthorData": {"57114668000": {"Name": "Kapp\u00e9 T.", "AuthorID": "57114668000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "56189147600": {"Name": "Brunet P.", "AuthorID": "56189147600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "23398564400": {"Name": "Silva A.", "AuthorID": "23398564400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "6507161816": {"Name": "Zanasi F.", "AuthorID": "6507161816", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "7801349236": {"Name": "Luttik B.", "AuthorID": "7801349236", "AffiliationID": "60032882", "AffiliationName": "Eindhoven University of Technology"}}}
