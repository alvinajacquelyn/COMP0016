However, it remains unclear how and when the brain processes topological structures to guide future behaviour during everyday life. Using fMRI in humans and a simulation of London (UK), here we show that, specifically when new streets are entered during navigation of the city, right posterior hippocampal activity indexes the change in the number of local topological connections available for future travel and right anterior hippocampal activity reflects global properties of the street entered. When forced detours require re-planning of the route to the goal, bilateral inferior lateral prefrontal activity scales with the planning demands of a breadth-first search of future paths. These results help shape models of how hippocampal and prefrontal regions support navigation, planning and future simulation.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Brain", "Female", "Functional Neuroimaging", "Hippocampus", "Humans", "London", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Prefrontal Cortex", "Spatial Behavior", "Spatial Navigation", "Spatial Processing", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85016001246", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"36646044100": {"Name": "Javadi A.H.", "AuthorID": "36646044100", "AffiliationID": "60010818", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, University of Kent"}, "55443068100": {"Name": "Emo B.", "AuthorID": "55443068100", "AffiliationID": "60085003, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Bartlett School of Architecture and Design, University College London"}, "41561357600": {"Name": "Howard L.R.", "AuthorID": "41561357600", "AffiliationID": "60103674", "AffiliationName": "Aging and Cognition Research Group, German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE)"}, "57190404164": {"Name": "Zisch F.E.", "AuthorID": "57190404164", "AffiliationID": "60085003, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Bartlett School of Architecture and Design, University College London"}, "6603575074": {"Name": "Spiers H.J.", "AuthorID": "6603575074", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychology and Language Sciences, Department of Experimental Psychology, UCL Institute of Behavioural Neuroscience, University College London"}, "56209013700": {"Name": "Yu Y.", "AuthorID": "56209013700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Centre for Advanced Biomedical Imaging, University College London"}, "57197237030": {"Name": "Knight R.", "AuthorID": "57197237030", "AffiliationID": "60032760", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, University of Hertfordshire"}, "57193708189": {"Name": "Pinelo Silva J.", "AuthorID": "57193708189", "AffiliationID": "60000237", "AffiliationName": "Department of Architecture and Interior Design, University of Bahrain 840"}}}
