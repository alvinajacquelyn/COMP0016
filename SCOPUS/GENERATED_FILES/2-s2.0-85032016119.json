Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a neuromuscular disease caused by low levels of SMN protein, whose role in pathogenesis remains unclear. Here, we identified in vivo and in vitro translation defects that are cell autonomous and SMN dependent. By determining in parallel the in vivo transcriptome and translatome in SMA mice, we observed a robust decrease in translation efficiency arising during early stages of disease. We provide a catalogue of RNAs with altered translation efficiency, identifying ribosome biology and translation as central processes affected by SMN depletion. This was further supported by a decrease in the number of ribosomes in SMA motor neurons in vivo. Overall, our findings suggest ribosome biology as an important, yet largely overlooked, factor in motor neuron degeneration. Bernab\u00f2 et al. analyzed translation in a mouse model of spinal muscular atrophy and identified translation defects that arise early in pathogenesis, are cell autonomous, and are accompanied by a low number of axonal ribosomes in diseased nerves. Their findings highlight ribosome biology as a central hallmark of the disease.", "AuthorKeywords": ["motor neuron disease", "neurodegeneration", "polysomal profiling", "ribosome", "SMN", "spinal muscular atrophy", "translatome"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Cells, Cultured", "Mice", "Motor Neurons", "Muscular Atrophy, Spinal", "Polyribosomes", "Protein Biosynthesis", "Proteome", "Survival of Motor Neuron 1 Protein", "Transcriptome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85032016119", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"6507047329": {"Name": "Bernab\u00f2 P.", "AuthorID": "6507047329", "AffiliationID": "60021199", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Biophysics, CNR Unit at Trento"}, "57196152803": {"Name": "Perenthaler E.", "AuthorID": "57196152803", "AffiliationID": "60021199", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Biophysics, CNR Unit at Trento"}, "55216533800": {"Name": "Mattedi F.", "AuthorID": "55216533800", "AffiliationID": "60021199", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Biophysics, CNR Unit at Trento"}, "6506475463": {"Name": "Viero G.", "AuthorID": "6506475463", "AffiliationID": "60021199", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Biophysics, CNR Unit at Trento"}, "35369172900": {"Name": "Tebaldi T.", "AuthorID": "35369172900", "AffiliationID": "60015986", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Integrative Biology, University of Trento"}, "42361882800": {"Name": "Zuccotti P.", "AuthorID": "42361882800", "AffiliationID": "60015986", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Integrative Biology, University of Trento"}, "57015566900": {"Name": "Potrich V.", "AuthorID": "57015566900", "AffiliationID": "60015986", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Integrative Biology, University of Trento"}, "7102299460": {"Name": "Quattrone A.", "AuthorID": "7102299460", "AffiliationID": "60015986", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Integrative Biology, University of Trento"}, "24450026200": {"Name": "Groen E.J.N.", "AuthorID": "24450026200", "AffiliationID": "60110825, 60027272", "AffiliationName": "Edinburgh Medical School: Biomedical Sciences, University of Edinburgh"}, "57193706869": {"Name": "Lane F.M.", "AuthorID": "57193706869", "AffiliationID": "60110825, 60027272", "AffiliationName": "Edinburgh Medical School: Biomedical Sciences, University of Edinburgh"}, "8276392500": {"Name": "Newbery H.J.", "AuthorID": "8276392500", "AffiliationID": "60110825, 60027272", "AffiliationName": "Edinburgh Medical School: Biomedical Sciences, University of Edinburgh"}, "57191495385": {"Name": "Shorrock H.K.", "AuthorID": "57191495385", "AffiliationID": "60110825, 60027272", "AffiliationName": "Edinburgh Medical School: Biomedical Sciences, University of Edinburgh"}, "6603180454": {"Name": "Gillingwater T.H.", "AuthorID": "6603180454", "AffiliationID": "60110825, 60027272", "AffiliationName": "Edinburgh Medical School: Biomedical Sciences, University of Edinburgh"}, "55716808400": {"Name": "Zhou H.", "AuthorID": "55716808400", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dubowitz Neuromuscular Centre, Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, University College London 30"}, "7102038246": {"Name": "Muntoni F.", "AuthorID": "7102038246", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dubowitz Neuromuscular Centre, Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, University College London 30"}}}
