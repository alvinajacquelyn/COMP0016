Here we tested whether sleep alters the subjective value associated with objects located in spatial clusters that were navigated to in a large-scale virtual town. We found that sleep enhances a generalization of the value of high-value objects to the value of locally clustered objects, resulting in an impaired memory for the value of high-valued objects. Our results are consistent with (a) spatial context helping to bind items together in long-term memory and serve as a basis for generalizing across memories and (b) sleep mediating memory effects on salient/reward-related items. # 2015 Javadi et al.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Female", "Generalization (Psychology)", "Humans", "Male", "Retention (Psychology)", "Reward", "Sleep", "Spatial Memory", "Spatial Navigation", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84946095267", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuropsychology and Physiological Psychology", "PSYC", "3206"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"]], "AuthorData": {"36646044100": {"Name": "Javadi A.", "AuthorID": "36646044100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Behavioural Neuroscience, Department of Experimental Psychology, University College London"}, "56940566600": {"Name": "Tolat A.", "AuthorID": "56940566600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Behavioural Neuroscience, Department of Experimental Psychology, University College London"}, "6603575074": {"Name": "Spiers H.", "AuthorID": "6603575074", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Behavioural Neuroscience, Department of Experimental Psychology, University College London"}}}
