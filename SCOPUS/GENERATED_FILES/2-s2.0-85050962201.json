The proposed scheme is distinguished by its simplicity, low computational complexity, high accuracy and performance independent of the number of subcarriers and compression factor. The presented results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed scheme by comparing its complexity and performance to other estimation schemes.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Compression factor", "Estimation schemes", "High-accuracy", "Low computational complexity", "Non-orthogonal", "Orthogonality", "Robust channel estimation", "Spectral efficiencies"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85050962201", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"57151150900": {"Name": "Ghannam H.", "AuthorID": "57151150900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, University College London"}, "7003497031": {"Name": "Darwazeh I.", "AuthorID": "7003497031", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, University College London"}}}
