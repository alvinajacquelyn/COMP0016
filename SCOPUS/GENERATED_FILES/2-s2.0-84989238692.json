Methods: A full-thickness cartilage defect was surgically produced in 12 adult sheep, in the bearing region of the lateral femoral condyle. The animals were randomized into 4 groups (n=3): no treatment of the defect (G1); filling with fresh AM (G2); with cryopreserved AM previously cultivated with BM-MSCs (G3); with cryopreserved AM alone (G4). Postoperatively, the full load was possible. At two months, the animals were euthanized. The quality of the new synthesized tissue was evaluated with the macroscopic, by using International Cartilage Repair Society (ICRS) scale, and histological analyses, by using O'Driscoll scale. Results: The control samples showed an ICRS grade III (abnormal); while the samples of Groups 2, 3 and 4 reported a grade II (similar to healthy cartilage). The mean value of O'Driscoll scale in the control group (3.3) was significantly lower compared to the treatment groups (G2: 10.7; G3: 8; G4: 11.3) (P <0.05). No significant differences were found between the experimental groups. Conclusion: AM could be a suitable material for the management of articular cartilage defects. Stem cells within AM demonstrated to be able to differentiate in chondrocytes in vivo. Fresh AM, cryopreserved AM and cryopreserved AM previously cultivated with BM-MSCs showed similar regenerative properties.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Amniotic membrane", "Cartilage repair", "Placenta", "Stem cell", "Tissue engineering"], "IndexKeywords": ["Amnion", "Animals", "Cartilage, Articular", "Cryopreservation", "Femur", "Membranes", "Mesenchymal Stem Cell Transplantation", "Mesenchymal Stromal Cells", "Proteoglycans", "Sheep", "Wound Healing"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84989238692", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (miscellaneous)", "MEDI", "2701"]], "AuthorData": {"57191369588": {"Name": "Garcia D.", "AuthorID": "57191369588", "AffiliationID": "60025844", "AffiliationName": "Orthopaedic Surgery Department, Hospital Universitario Puerta de Hierro"}, "55308310300": {"Name": "Longo U.G.", "AuthorID": "55308310300", "AffiliationID": "60005308", "AffiliationName": "University Campus Bio-Medico of Rome"}, "24802487100": {"Name": "Loppini M.", "AuthorID": "24802487100", "AffiliationID": "60005308", "AffiliationName": "University Campus Bio-Medico of Rome"}, "7004909863": {"Name": "Denaro V.", "AuthorID": "7004909863", "AffiliationID": "60005308", "AffiliationName": "University Campus Bio-Medico of Rome"}, "7103086266": {"Name": "Vaquero J.", "AuthorID": "7103086266", "AffiliationID": "60033237", "AffiliationName": "Orthopaedic Surgery Department, Hospital Universitario Gregorio Mara\u00f1\u00f3n"}, "7003392220": {"Name": "Forriol F.", "AuthorID": "7003392220", "AffiliationID": "60014037", "AffiliationName": "University San Pablo \u2013 CEU, Campus de Montepr\u00edncipe, Boadilla del Monte"}, "35229756200": {"Name": "Khan W.S.", "AuthorID": "35229756200", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60024067", "AffiliationName": "University College London Institute of Orthopaedics and Musculoskeletal Sciences, Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital"}}}
