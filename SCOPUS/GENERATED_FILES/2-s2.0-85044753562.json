The dual strategy model suggests that people reason using different approaches to processing statistical information. The dual-source model suggests that people reason probabilistically using both statistical information and some intuition about logical form. Each model suggests that people have different approaches to processing information while making inferences. The following studies examined whether these different forms of information processing were equally present during reasoning. Participants were given a series of problems designed to distinguish counterexample from statistical reasoners. They were then given a series of MP or AC inferences for which identical statistical information was provided. Results show that MP inferences were considered to be deductively valid more often than equivalent AC inferences. The effect of logical form was independent of reasoning strategy, and of relatively equivalent size for both counterexample and statistical reasoners. The second study examined explicitly probabilistic inferences, and showed smaller effects of logical form and of reasoning strategy, although with a complex set of interactions. These results show that understanding the way that people use information when making inferences requires a multidimensional approach.", "AuthorKeywords": ["conditional reasoning", "dual source", "dual strategy", "Reasoning"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85044753562", "SubjectAreas": [["Experimental and Cognitive Psychology", "PSYC", "3205"]], "AuthorData": {"6701671135": {"Name": "Markovits H.", "AuthorID": "6701671135", "AffiliationID": "60027863", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al"}, "55802524200": {"Name": "Brisson J.", "AuthorID": "55802524200", "AffiliationID": "60027863", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al"}, "56003611700": {"Name": "de Chantal P.", "AuthorID": "56003611700", "AffiliationID": "60027863", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al"}, "46161708800": {"Name": "Singmann H.", "AuthorID": "46161708800", "AffiliationID": "60012614", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Psychology, University of Zurich"}}}
