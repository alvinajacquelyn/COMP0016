Some of the many advantages of online mapping include the fast information dissemination to the public, the interactivity between the users and the map interface, as well as the frequent and easy database updates. However, the theme of these maps may entail privacy risks at times. Such examples include the crime mapping initiatives where crime information is considered as private and sensitive. With respect to privacy disclosure risks, this study employs a survey design to investigate the public\u2019s perception of location privacy when information about crimes is being displayed on public maps. Participants from the London Borough of Camden were recruited and their views were analysed by means of a questionnaire accompanied by mapping material (n = 201). Participants expressed a clear concern when practical implications related to the crime maps were revealed to them. Further, the majority of participants, if given the choice, would opt for a medium-risk protection method in terms of risk of privacy violation. Lastly, in regards to the impact that different visualizations may have on local crime perception the study revealed that the current police.uk cartographic technique creates the perception of more unsafe neighbourhoods than an alternative hot routes density map.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Confidentiality", "Location privacy", "Public perception and crime mapping"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84923420135", "SubjectAreas": [["Law", "SOCI", "3308"]], "AuthorData": {"55756293800": {"Name": "Kounadi O.", "AuthorID": "55756293800", "AffiliationID": "60002963", "AffiliationName": "Doctoral College GIScience Department of Geoinformatics \u2013 Z_GIS, University of Salzburg"}, "57208260074": {"Name": "Leitner M.", "AuthorID": "57208260074", "AffiliationID": "60007566", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography and Anthropology, Louisiana State University"}, "7006388124": {"Name": "Bowers K.", "AuthorID": "7006388124", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Security and Crime Science, University College London"}}}
