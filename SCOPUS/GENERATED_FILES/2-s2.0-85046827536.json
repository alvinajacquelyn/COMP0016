Our cases appear to be the first reported use of apixaban as prophylaxis against thromboembolism in NS. We report our systematic review of the existing literature on direct-acting oral anticoagulant (DOAC) use in NS, and discuss theoretical issues relevant to their therapeutic use in this clinical scenario. We searched electronic databases such as OVID, EMBASE, PubMed, and CENTRAL, DARE. The search to identify studies and the application of inclusion and exclusion criteria was performed in duplicate independently. We identified 1 pilot randomized study, 3 case reports, and 3 conference proceedings abstracts relating to DOAC use in NS. These reports all pertain to the treatment of clinically evident thrombosis in NS with rivaroxaban, edoxaban, and dabigatran rather than prophylaxis against thrombosis. Although the existing literature on DOAC use in NS is limited, initial preliminary experience appears promising.", "AuthorKeywords": ["anticoagulation", "DOAC", "nephrotic", "thrombosis"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85046827536", "SubjectAreas": [["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"], ["Nephrology", "MEDI", "2727"]], "AuthorData": {"9243776400": {"Name": "Sexton D.J.", "AuthorID": "9243776400", "AffiliationID": "60011149", "AffiliationName": "Trinity Health Kidney Center, Tallaght Hospital"}, "24470888000": {"Name": "de Freitas D.G.", "AuthorID": "24470888000", "AffiliationID": "60000718, 60000050", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nephrology and Kidney Transplantation, Beaumont Hospital, Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland"}, "26643059400": {"Name": "Little M.A.", "AuthorID": "26643059400", "AffiliationID": "60011149", "AffiliationName": "Trinity Health Kidney Center, Tallaght Hospital"}, "56872536600": {"Name": "McHugh T.", "AuthorID": "56872536600", "AffiliationID": "60000718, 60000050", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nephrology and Kidney Transplantation, Beaumont Hospital, Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland"}, "7101620159": {"Name": "Magee C.", "AuthorID": "7101620159", "AffiliationID": "60000718, 60000050", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nephrology and Kidney Transplantation, Beaumont Hospital, Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland"}, "7101742691": {"Name": "Conlon P.J.", "AuthorID": "7101742691", "AffiliationID": "60000718, 60000050", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nephrology and Kidney Transplantation, Beaumont Hospital, Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland"}, "11639106300": {"Name": "O'Seaghdha C.M.", "AuthorID": "11639106300", "AffiliationID": "60000718, 60000050", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nephrology and Kidney Transplantation, Beaumont Hospital, Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland"}}}
