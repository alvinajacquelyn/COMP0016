To speed up computations, in shear-driven concentrated suspensions, often found in rheometric contexts, it is common to consider only lubrication. We show that, although this approximation may provide acceptable results in shear-driven periodic suspensions, for bidisperse suspensions where the particles are exposed to an external force, it can produce physically unreasonable results. We suggest that this problem could be mitigated by a careful choice of particle pairs on which lubrication interactions should be included.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Anomalous effects", "Bidisperse suspension", "Concentrated suspension", "Exposed to", "External force", "Long ranges", "Particle pair", "Stokesian dynamics"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85049991375", "SubjectAreas": [["Computational Mechanics", "ENGI", "2206"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Mechanics of Materials", "ENGI", "2211"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"], ["Fluid Flow and Transfer Processes", "CENG", "1507"]], "AuthorData": {"57014522000": {"Name": "Townsend A.", "AuthorID": "57014522000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University College London"}, "35104042400": {"Name": "Wilson H.", "AuthorID": "35104042400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University College London"}}}
