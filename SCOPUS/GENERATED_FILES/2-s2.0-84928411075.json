Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the European Society of Cardiology.Aim: Antipsychotics increase the risk of stroke. Their effect on myocardial infarction remains uncertain because people prescribed and not prescribed antipsychotic drugs differ in their underlying vascular risk making between-person comparisons difficult to interpret. The aim of our study was to investigate this association using the self-controlled case series design that eliminates between-person confounding effects. Methods and results: All the patients with a first recorded myocardial infarction and prescription for an antipsychotic identified in the Clinical Practice Research Datalink linked to the Myocardial Ischaemia National Audit Project were selected for the self-controlled case series. The incidence ratio of myocardial infarction during risk periods following the initiation of antipsychotic use relative to unexposed periods was estimated within individuals. A classical case-control study was undertaken for comparative purposes comparing antipsychotic exposure among cases and matched controls. We identified 1546 exposed cases for the self-controlled case series and found evidence of an association during the first 30 days after the first prescription of an antipsychotic, for first-generation agents [incidence rate ratio (IRR) 2.82, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.0-3.99] and second-generation agents (IRR: 2.5, 95% CI: 1.18-5.32). Similar results were found for the case-control study for new users of first- (OR: 3.19, 95% CI: 1.9-5.37) and second-generation agents (OR: 2.55, 95% CI: 0.93-7.01) within 30 days of their myocardial infarction. Conclusion: We found an increased risk of myocardial infarction in the period following the initiation of antipsychotics that was not attributable to differences between people prescribed and not prescribed antipsychotics.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Antipsychotic agents", "Case-control study", "Myocardial infarction", "Self-controlled case series"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Antipsychotic Agents", "Case-Control Studies", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Mental Disorders", "Middle Aged", "Myocardial Infarction", "Risk Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84928411075", "SubjectAreas": [["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"54384760200": {"Name": "Brauer R.", "AuthorID": "54384760200", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Non-Communicable Disease Epidemiology, Faculty of Epidemiology and Population Health, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "7003651182": {"Name": "Smeeth L.", "AuthorID": "7003651182", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Non-Communicable Disease Epidemiology, Faculty of Epidemiology and Population Health, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "15029865900": {"Name": "Douglas I.", "AuthorID": "15029865900", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Non-Communicable Disease Epidemiology, Faculty of Epidemiology and Population Health, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "24467192000": {"Name": "Anaya-Izquierdo K.", "AuthorID": "24467192000", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, Faculty of Epidemiology and Population Health, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "7006508725": {"Name": "Timmis A.", "AuthorID": "7006508725", "AffiliationID": "60172638, 60159931", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health Research Biomedical Research Unit, Barts Health"}, "54902667300": {"Name": "Denaxas S.C.", "AuthorID": "54902667300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, Clinical Epidemiology, University College London"}, "7004642497": {"Name": "Hemingway H.", "AuthorID": "7004642497", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, Clinical Epidemiology, University College London"}, "7005063892": {"Name": "Farrington C.P.", "AuthorID": "7005063892", "AffiliationID": "60012113", "AffiliationName": "Department of Statistics, Open University"}, "7004395702": {"Name": "Whitaker H.", "AuthorID": "7004395702", "AffiliationID": "60012113", "AffiliationName": "Department of Statistics, Open University"}}}
