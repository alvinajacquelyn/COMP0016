All rights reserved.Combining place and fiction my recent project London Short Stories takes well-known institutions, epochs and lifestyles from a series of sites across the city and renders them fantastic in a string of architectural short stories. The medium is an intersection of paper assemblages and text, occupying a liminal territory where familiar characters find themselves in unexpected environments and places transform into active protagonists. The short stories explore whether narrative retains any relevance to modern architecture and urban design and if so, how meaning and symbolism can be incorporated into the built environment, offering us ways to reinvent ourselves and especially our perspectives on new environments. The urban designs depict a vision of the city that is immoral, anarchic, and unscientific.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85065286404", "SubjectAreas": [["Social Sciences (all)", "SOCI", "3300"], ["Engineering (all)", "ENGI", "2200"], ["Arts and Humanities (all)", "ARTS", "1200"]], "AuthorData": {"56069471600": {"Name": "Lim C.J.", "AuthorID": "56069471600", "AffiliationID": "60085003", "AffiliationName": "UCL's Bartlett School of Architecture"}}}
