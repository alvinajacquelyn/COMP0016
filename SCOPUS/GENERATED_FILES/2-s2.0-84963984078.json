Optical band gaps are influenced by the identity of both the organic and inorganic component. Density functional theory calculations show optical excitation leads to exciton separation between inorganic and organic components. Using UV-vis, photoluminescence, and X-ray photoemission spectroscopies, we have determined the materials' frontier energy levels and show their suitability for photovoltaic device fabrication by use of electron- and hole-transport materials such as TiO2 and spiro-OMeTAD respectively. Such organic/inorganic hybrid materials promise greater electronic tunability than the inflexible methylammonium lead iodide structure through variation of both the metal and organic components.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84963984078", "SubjectAreas": [["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"], ["Inorganic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1604"]], "AuthorData": {"35374769700": {"Name": "Travis W.", "AuthorID": "35374769700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "24923462200": {"Name": "Knapp C.", "AuthorID": "24923462200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "57188864018": {"Name": "Kafourou P.", "AuthorID": "57188864018", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "57188865799": {"Name": "Song X.", "AuthorID": "57188865799", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "57188865847": {"Name": "Sharif Z.", "AuthorID": "57188865847", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "7005206877": {"Name": "Cockcroft J.", "AuthorID": "7005206877", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "24477074800": {"Name": "Bronstein H.", "AuthorID": "24477074800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "8227436900": {"Name": "Palgrave R.", "AuthorID": "8227436900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "56545348200": {"Name": "Savory C.", "AuthorID": "56545348200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Kathleen Lonsdale Materials Chemistry, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "56872913700": {"Name": "Ganose A.", "AuthorID": "56872913700", "AffiliationID": "60104663", "AffiliationName": "Diamond Light Source Ltd., Diamond House, Harwell Science and Innovation Campus"}, "16647397400": {"Name": "Scanlon D.", "AuthorID": "16647397400", "AffiliationID": "60104663", "AffiliationName": "Diamond Light Source Ltd., Diamond House, Harwell Science and Innovation Campus"}}}
