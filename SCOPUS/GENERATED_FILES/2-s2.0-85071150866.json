Several studies have recently applied both models to increase sensitivity to biological changes, however, it remains uncertain how these measures are associated. Here we show that cortical distributions of DTI and NODDI are associated depending on the choice of b-value, a factor reflecting strength of diffusion weighting gradient. We analyzed a combination of high, intermediate and low b-value data of multi-shell diffusion-weighted MRI (dMRI) in healthy 456 subjects of the Human Connectome Project using NODDI, DTI and a mathematical conversion from DTI to NODDI. Cortical distributions of DTI and DTI-derived NODDI metrics were remarkably associated with those in NODDI, particularly when applied highly diffusion-weighted data (b-value = 3000 sec/mm2). This was supported by simulation analysis, which revealed that DTI-derived parameters with lower b-value datasets suffered from errors due to heterogeneity of cerebrospinal fluid fraction and partial volume. These findings suggest that high b-value DTI redundantly parallels with NODDI-based cortical neurite measures, but the conventional low b-value DTI is hard to reasonably characterize cortical microarchitecture.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Diffusion Tensor Imaging", "Female", "Gray Matter", "Humans", "Male", "Neurites", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85071150866", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"57200560605": {"Name": "Fukutomi H.", "AuthorID": "57200560605", "AffiliationID": "60119317", "AffiliationName": "Department of Diagnostic Imaging and Nuclear Medicine, Kyoto University Graduate School of Medicine"}, "36087140400": {"Name": "Autio J.A.", "AuthorID": "36087140400", "AffiliationID": "60016648", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory for Brain Connectomics Imaging, RIKEN Center for Biosystems Dynamics Research"}, "55735941400": {"Name": "Hayashi T.", "AuthorID": "55735941400", "AffiliationID": "60016648", "AffiliationName": "RIKEN Compass to Healthy Life Research Complex Program, Integrated Innovation Building (IIB)"}, "37036794900": {"Name": "Akasaka T.", "AuthorID": "37036794900", "AffiliationID": "60119317", "AffiliationName": "Department of Diagnostic Imaging and Nuclear Medicine, Kyoto University Graduate School of Medicine"}, "7403304369": {"Name": "Fujimoto K.", "AuthorID": "7403304369", "AffiliationID": "60119317", "AffiliationName": "Department of Diagnostic Imaging and Nuclear Medicine, Kyoto University Graduate School of Medicine"}, "56949390900": {"Name": "Yamamoto T.", "AuthorID": "56949390900", "AffiliationID": "60119317", "AffiliationName": "Department of Diagnostic Imaging and Nuclear Medicine, Kyoto University Graduate School of Medicine"}, "55503811700": {"Name": "Okada T.", "AuthorID": "55503811700", "AffiliationID": "60119317", "AffiliationName": "Department of Diagnostic Imaging and Nuclear Medicine, Kyoto University Graduate School of Medicine"}, "7101898163": {"Name": "Togashi K.", "AuthorID": "7101898163", "AffiliationID": "60119317", "AffiliationName": "Department of Diagnostic Imaging and Nuclear Medicine, Kyoto University Graduate School of Medicine"}, "23984503800": {"Name": "Glasser M.F.", "AuthorID": "23984503800", "AffiliationID": "60022756", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Washington University School of Medicine"}, "7004290044": {"Name": "Van Essen D.C.", "AuthorID": "7004290044", "AffiliationID": "60022756", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Washington University School of Medicine, Campus Box 8108"}, "56435199300": {"Name": "Murata K.", "AuthorID": "56435199300", "AffiliationID": "109662655", "AffiliationName": "Siemens Healthcare K.K."}, "36088339000": {"Name": "Zhang H.", "AuthorID": "36088339000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Image Computing and Department of Computer Science, University College London"}}}
