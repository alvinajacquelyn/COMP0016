In this paper, we propose a quantitative approach to help answer this question, inspired by theories developed within the fields of architecture and population health. The method extracts a rich set of metrics of urban form and well-being from openly accessible datasets. Using linear regression analysis, we identify a model which can explain 30% of the variance of well-being when applied to Greater London, UK. Outcomes of this research can inform the discussion on how to design cities which foster the wellbeing of their residents.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Open Data", "Quantitative Analysis", "Urban Form", "Well-being"], "IndexKeywords": ["Greater London", "Open datum", "Population health", "Quantitative approach", "Urban form", "Well being"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85011092674", "SubjectAreas": [["Earth-Surface Processes", "EART", "1904"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Modeling and Simulation", "MATH", "2611"], ["Computer Graphics and Computer-Aided Design", "COMP", "1704"], ["Information Systems", "COMP", "1710"]], "AuthorData": {"57189302919": {"Name": "Venerandi A.", "AuthorID": "57189302919", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "55936820200": {"Name": "Quattrone G.", "AuthorID": "55936820200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "7003753918": {"Name": "Capra L.", "AuthorID": "7003753918", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
