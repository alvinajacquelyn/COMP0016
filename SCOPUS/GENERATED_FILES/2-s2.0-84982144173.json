Arid and semiarid deserts ecosystems approximately characterize one-third of the Earth's land surface but play an unsung role in the carbon cycling, considering the huge potentials of such CO2 absorption to expand insights to the long-sought missing CO2 sink and the naturally unneglectable turbulence in temperature sensitivities of soil respiration it produced. \"Nanodeserts\" as a reconciled concept not only indicate a conjecture in nanotechnology to enhance quasi-photosynthetic CO2 absorption, but also aim to present to the desert researchers a better understanding of the footprints of abiotic CO2 transport, conversion, and assignment in the soil-groundwater system beneath deserts. Meanwhile, nanodeserts allow a stable temperature sensitivity of soil respiration in deserts by largely reducing the CO2 release above the deserts surface and highlighting the abiotic CO2 fixation beneath deserts. This may be no longer a novelty in the future.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84982144173", "SubjectAreas": [["Polymers and Plastics", "MATE", "2507"]], "AuthorData": {"57190665753": {"Name": "Wang W.", "AuthorID": "57190665753", "AffiliationID": "60117377, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Desert and Oasis Ecology, Xinjiang Institute of Ecology and Geography, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "57219219985": {"Name": "Chen X.", "AuthorID": "57219219985", "AffiliationID": "60117377, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Desert and Oasis Ecology, Xinjiang Institute of Ecology and Geography, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "56703567800": {"Name": "Zhang Y.", "AuthorID": "56703567800", "AffiliationID": "60028876", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Inha University"}, "57161055100": {"Name": "Yu J.", "AuthorID": "57161055100", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Environmental Change Institute, University of Oxford"}, "35253704700": {"Name": "Ma T.", "AuthorID": "35253704700", "AffiliationID": "60009512", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemical Engineering, University of Adelaide"}, "55925162500": {"Name": "Lv Z.", "AuthorID": "55925162500", "AffiliationID": "60102083, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "High Performance Computing Center, Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "57214899781": {"Name": "Zhang J.", "AuthorID": "57214899781", "AffiliationID": "60082199", "AffiliationName": "College of Energy and Mechanical Engineering, Shanghai University of Electric Power"}, "57203148967": {"Name": "Zeng F.", "AuthorID": "57203148967", "AffiliationID": "60005465", "AffiliationName": "Center for Robotics, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China"}, "57190277178": {"Name": "Zou H.", "AuthorID": "57190277178", "AffiliationID": "60006106", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science and Technology, Huaqiao University"}}}
