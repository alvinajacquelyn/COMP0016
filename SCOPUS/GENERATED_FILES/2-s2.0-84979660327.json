{"Title": "Spinal disease in myeloma: Cohort analysis at a specialist spinal surgery centre indicates benefit of early surgical augmentation or bracing", "Year": 2016, "Source": "BMC Cancer", "Volume": "16", "Issue": 1, "Art.No": null, "PageStart": null, "PageEnd": null, "CitedBy": 7, "DOI": "10.1186/s12885-016-2495-7", "Link": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84979660327&origin=inward", "Abstract": "\u00a9 2016 The Author(s).Background: Multiple myeloma osteolytic disease affecting the spine results in vertebral compression fractures. These are painful, result in kyphosis, and impact respiratory function and quality of life. We explore the impact of time to presentation on the efficacy of spinal treatment modalities. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 183 patients with spinal myeloma presenting to our service over a 2 year period. Results: Median time from multiple myeloma diagnosis to presentation at our centre was 195 days. Eighty-four patients (45.9 %) were treated with balloon kyphoplasty and the remainder with a thoracolumbar-sacral orthosis as per our published protocol. Patients presenting earlier than 195 days from diagnosis had significant improvements in patient reported outcome measures: EuroQol 5-Dimensions (p < 0.001), Oswestry Disability Index (p < 0.001), and Visual Analogue Pain Score (p < 0.001) at follow-up, regardless of treatment. Patients presenting after 195 days, however, only experienced benefit following balloon kyphoplasty, with no significant benefit from non-operative management. Conclusion: Vertebral augmentation and thoracolumbar bracing improve patient reported outcome scores in patients with spinal myeloma. However, delay in treatment negatively impacts clinical outcome, particularly if managed non-operatively. It is important to screen and treat patients with MM and back pain early to prevent deformity and improve quality of life.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Multiple myeloma", "Outcome scores", "Thoracolumbar bracing", "Vertebral augmentation", "Vertebral fracture"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Back Pain", "Braces", "Female", "Fractures, Compression", "Humans", "Kyphoplasty", "Kyphosis", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Multiple Myeloma", "Osteolysis", "Pain Management", "Pain Measurement", "Patient Reported Outcome Measures", "Quality of Life", "Radiography", "Retrospective Studies", "Spinal Fractures", "Time Factors", "Time-to-Treatment", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84979660327", "SubjectAreas": [["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Cancer Research", "BIOC", "1306"]], "AuthorData": {"35302751600": {"Name": "Malhotra K.", "AuthorID": "35302751600", "AffiliationID": "60024067", "AffiliationName": "Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital, Spinal Deformity Unit, Department of Spinal Surgery"}, "8235889100": {"Name": "Butler J.S.", "AuthorID": "8235889100", "AffiliationID": "60024067", "AffiliationName": "Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital, Spinal Deformity Unit, Department of Spinal Surgery"}, "56538368700": {"Name": "Selvadurai S.", "AuthorID": "56538368700", "AffiliationID": "60024067", "AffiliationName": "Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital, Spinal Deformity Unit, Department of Spinal Surgery"}, "56133107700": {"Name": "Molloy S.", "AuthorID": "56133107700", "AffiliationID": "60024067", "AffiliationName": "Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital, Spinal Deformity Unit, Department of Spinal Surgery"}, "25926760100": {"Name": "Yu H.M.", "AuthorID": "25926760100", "AffiliationID": "60005206", "AffiliationName": "The Second Affiliated Hospital of Fujian Medical University, Department of Orthopaedics"}, "6602503855": {"Name": "D'Sa S.", "AuthorID": "6602503855", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "University College London Hospitals, Department of Clinical Haematology"}, "22136212200": {"Name": "Rabin N.", "AuthorID": "22136212200", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "University College London Hospitals, Department of Clinical Haematology"}, "7102064249": {"Name": "Yong K.", "AuthorID": "7102064249", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "University College London Hospitals, Department of Clinical Haematology"}, "8626788300": {"Name": "Kyriakou C.", "AuthorID": "8626788300", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "The Royal Free Hospital, Department of Clinical Haematology"}}}
