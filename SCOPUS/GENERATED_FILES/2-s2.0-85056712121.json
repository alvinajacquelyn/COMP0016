We performed a novel assessment of measuring the effects of the anti-inflammatory agent celecoxib by analyzing simultaneously the different neural populations (neurons, astrocytes, and microglia cells) in SNL and non-SNL areas. Rats were subjected to 1 hour of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and treated with celecoxib 1 and 24 hours after ischemia. Infarct volume measurements and triple immunostaining of neurons (neuronal nuclear antigen), microglia (ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule 1), and astroglia were performed after 12 and 48 hours of reperfusion. Motor response was tested by standard behavioral assays at 3, 12, 24, and 48 hours. Confocal analysis revealed that the percentage of SNL areas, microglia densities, and glial activation increased at 48 hours of reperfusion. Celecoxib treatment improved the neurologic deficit, reduced the infarct volume by 50% after 48 hours of reperfusion, and resulted in a reduced percentage of SNL areas and microglia and astroglia reactivity after 48 hours of reperfusion. This study proves, for the first time, that celecoxib presents postischemic neuroprotective effects in a transient MCAO model, prevents or delays the presence of SNL areas, and reduces glial activation.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Astrocytes", "Celecoxib", "Disease Models, Animal", "Infarction, Middle Cerebral Artery", "Male", "Nervous System Diseases", "Neuroglia", "Neurons", "Neuroprotective Agents", "Rats", "Rats, Sprague-Dawley", "Reperfusion Injury", "Stroke"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85056712121", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Medicine", "BIOC", "1313"], ["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"]], "AuthorData": {"57189376721": {"Name": "Santos-Galdiano M.", "AuthorID": "57189376721", "AffiliationID": "109888907", "AffiliationName": "\u00c1rea de Biolog\u00eda Celular, Instituto de Biomedicina"}, "57202568554": {"Name": "P\u00e9rez-Rodr\u00edguez D.", "AuthorID": "57202568554", "AffiliationID": "109888907", "AffiliationName": "\u00c1rea de Biolog\u00eda Celular, Instituto de Biomedicina"}, "56150728300": {"Name": "Anuncibay-Soto B.", "AuthorID": "56150728300", "AffiliationID": "60020657", "AffiliationName": "Universidad de Le\u00f3n, Neural Therapies SL, Edificio Institutos de Investigaci\u00f3n"}, "57193685452": {"Name": "Font-Belmonte E.", "AuthorID": "57193685452", "AffiliationID": "109888907", "AffiliationName": "\u00c1rea de Biolog\u00eda Celular, Instituto de Biomedicina"}, "57193679937": {"Name": "Ugidos I.", "AuthorID": "57193679937", "AffiliationID": "109888907", "AffiliationName": "\u00c1rea de Biolog\u00eda Celular, Instituto de Biomedicina"}, "56250640300": {"Name": "Fern\u00e1ndez-L\u00f3pez A.", "AuthorID": "56250640300", "AffiliationID": "109888907", "AffiliationName": "\u00c1rea de Biolog\u00eda Celular, Instituto de Biomedicina"}, "7006210327": {"Name": "P\u00e9rez-Garc\u00eda C.", "AuthorID": "7006210327", "AffiliationID": "122019019", "AffiliationName": "Departamento de Medicina, Cirug\u00eda y Anatom\u00eda Veterinaria"}}}
