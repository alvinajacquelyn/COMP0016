This research aims to define, test, and validate evaluation metrics for software tools designed to support the processes associated with the definition, management, and implementation of these models.Methodology The proposed framework builds on previous research that focused on obtaining agreement on the essential requirements in this area. A set of 50 conformance criteria were defined based on the 20 functional requirements agreed by that consensus and applied to evaluate the currently available tools.Results Of the 11 initiative developing tools for clinical information modeling identified, 9 were evaluated according to their performance on the evaluation metrics. Results show that functionalities related to management of data types, specifications, metadata, and terminology or ontology bindings have a good level of adoption. Improvements can be made in other areas focused on information modeling and associated processes. Other criteria related to displaying semantic relationships between concepts and communication with terminology servers had low levels of adoption.Conclusions The proposed evaluation metrics were successfully tested and validated against a representative sample of existing tools. The results identify the need to improve tool support for information modeling and software development processes, especially in those areas related to governance, clinician involvement, and optimizing the technical validation of testing processes. This research confirmed the potential of these evaluation metrics to support decision makers in identifying the most appropriate tool for their organization.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Archetypes", "Clinical information modeling tools", "Delphi study", "Detailed clinical models", "Electronic health record", "Qualitative research", "Semantic interoperability"], "IndexKeywords": ["Delphi Technique", "Electronic Health Records", "Evaluation Studies as Topic", "Health Information Interoperability", "Humans", "Medical Informatics", "Models, Theoretical", "Qualitative Research", "Semantics", "Surveys and Questionnaires"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84994796604", "SubjectAreas": [["Health Informatics", "MEDI", "2718"]], "AuthorData": {"55786129600": {"Name": "Moreno-Conde A.", "AuthorID": "55786129600", "AffiliationID": "60033267", "AffiliationName": "Technological Innovation Group, Virgen del Roc\u00edo University Hospital"}, "56107739200": {"Name": "Kalra D.", "AuthorID": "56107739200", "AffiliationID": "113989564", "AffiliationName": "European Institute for Health Records (EuroRec)"}, "56728848400": {"Name": "Moreno-Conde J.", "AuthorID": "56728848400", "AffiliationID": "60033267", "AffiliationName": "Technological Innovation Group, Virgen del Roc\u00edo University Hospital"}, "24332533000": {"Name": "Parra-Calder\u00f3n C.L.", "AuthorID": "24332533000", "AffiliationID": "60033267", "AffiliationName": "Technological Innovation Group, Virgen del Roc\u00edo University Hospital"}, "7101675663": {"Name": "Austin T.", "AuthorID": "7101675663", "AffiliationID": "116366039", "AffiliationName": "Helicon Health Ltd."}}}
