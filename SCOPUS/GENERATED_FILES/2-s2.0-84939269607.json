This is thought to arise as a consequence of abnormalities in both the physiological drive for food and the rewarding properties of food. Although a number of mouse models for PWS exist, the underlying variables dictating maladaptive feeding remain unknown. Here, feeding behaviour in a mouse model in which the imprinting centre (IC) of the syntenic PWS interval has been deleted (PWSICdel mice) is characterised. It is demonstrated that PWSICdel mice show hyperghrelinaemia and increased consumption of food both following overnight fasting and when made more palatable with sucrose. However, hyperphagia in PWSICdel mice was not accompanied by any changes in reactivity to the hedonic properties of palatable food (sucrose or saccharin), as measured by lick-cluster size. Nevertheless, overall consumption by PWSICdel mice for non-caloric saccharin in the licking test was significantly reduced. Combined with converging findings from a continuous reinforcement schedule, these data indicate that PWSICdel mice show a marked heightened sensitivity to the calorific value of food. Overall, these data indicate that any impact of the rewarding properties of food on the hyperphagia seen in PWSICdel mice is driven primarily by calorie content and is unlikely to involve hedonic processes. This has important implications for understanding the neural systems underlying the feeding phenotype of PWS and the contribution of imprinted genes to abnormal feeding behaviour more generally.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Hyperphagia", "Lick-cluster analysis", "Palatability", "Prader-Willi syndrome"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Anxiety", "Apathy", "Conditioning, Operant", "Disease Models, Animal", "Eating", "Energy Intake", "Female", "Food Preferences", "Ghrelin", "Hyperphagia", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Transgenic", "Motivation", "Phenotype", "Prader-Willi Syndrome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84939269607", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"]], "AuthorData": {"7404982198": {"Name": "Davies J.R.", "AuthorID": "7404982198", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "School of Medicine, Cardiff University"}, "6601955799": {"Name": "Humby T.", "AuthorID": "6601955799", "AffiliationID": "60170432, 60023998", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, Cardiff University"}, "55930259200": {"Name": "Furby H.", "AuthorID": "55930259200", "AffiliationID": "60170432, 60023998", "AffiliationName": "School of Biosciences, Cardiff University"}, "7103040673": {"Name": "Wilkinson L.S.", "AuthorID": "7103040673", "AffiliationID": "60170432, 60023998", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, Cardiff University"}, "7003521903": {"Name": "Isles A.R.", "AuthorID": "7003521903", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "School of Medicine, Cardiff University"}, "7201792016": {"Name": "Dwyer D.M.", "AuthorID": "7201792016", "AffiliationID": "60028333", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, University of New South Wales"}, "12798631700": {"Name": "Garfield A.S.", "AuthorID": "12798631700", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Integrative Physiology, University of Edinburgh"}, "55808072394": {"Name": "Wells T.", "AuthorID": "55808072394", "AffiliationID": "60170432, 60023998", "AffiliationName": "School of Biosciences, Cardiff University"}}}
