The electrons within the peaks are created by the photoionisation of neutrals in the upper atmosphere by the solar HeII 30.4 nm line. Here, we present some case studies of photoelectron spectra observed by the ASPERA-4 instrument aboard Venus Express with corresponding ion data. In the first case study, we observe photoelectron peaks in the sunlit ionosphere, indicating relatively local production. In the second case study, we observe broadened peaks in the sunlit ionosphere near the terminator, which indicate scattering processes between a more remote production region and the observation point. In the third case study, we present the first observation of ionospheric photoelectrons in the induced magnetotail of Venus, which we suggest is due to the spacecraft being located at that time on a magnetic field line connected to the dayside ionosphere at lower altitudes. Simultaneously, low energy ions are observed moving away from Venus. In common with observations at Mars and at Titan, these imply a possible role for the relatively energetic electrons in producing an ambipolar electric field which enhances ion escape.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Escape", "Ionosphere", "Photoelectrons", "Solar wind", "Venus"], "IndexKeywords": ["Ambipolar electric fields", "Electron energy spectrum", "Energetic electron", "Escape", "Magnetic field line", "Photoelectron peaks", "Photoelectron spectrum", "Venus"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84937976631", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"35085463100": {"Name": "Tsang S.M.E.", "AuthorID": "35085463100", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60162133", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Planetary Sciences at UCL"}, "7103145751": {"Name": "Coates A.J.", "AuthorID": "7103145751", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60162133", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Planetary Sciences at UCL"}, "55224172000": {"Name": "Jones G.H.", "AuthorID": "55224172000", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60162133", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Planetary Sciences at UCL"}, "7005925341": {"Name": "Frahm R.A.", "AuthorID": "7005925341", "AffiliationID": "60011533", "AffiliationName": "Southwest Research Institute"}, "7004684422": {"Name": "Winningham J.D.", "AuthorID": "7004684422", "AffiliationID": "60011533", "AffiliationName": "Southwest Research Institute"}, "8763143900": {"Name": "Barabash S.", "AuthorID": "8763143900", "AffiliationID": "60004855", "AffiliationName": "Swedish Institute of Space Physics"}, "24519122100": {"Name": "Lundin R.", "AuthorID": "24519122100", "AffiliationID": "60004855", "AffiliationName": "Swedish Institute of Space Physics"}, "7402999169": {"Name": "Fedorov A.", "AuthorID": "7402999169", "AffiliationID": "60123782", "AffiliationName": "Centre d'Etude Spatiale des Rayonnements"}}}
