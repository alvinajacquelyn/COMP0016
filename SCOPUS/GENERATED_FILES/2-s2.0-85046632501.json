These solutions allow sophisticated tasks to be performed on a per-packet basis, without relying on sampling or passive trace analysis, by leveraging the processing power available on servers. Although advances in packet capture have enabled intercepting packets from network cards at high rates, bottlenecks can still arise in the monitoring process as a result of concurrent access to shared processor resources, variations of the traffic skew, and unbalanced packet-rate spikes. In this paper we present an adaptive traffic monitoring approach that copes with emerging bottlenecks by timely detecting changes in the operational conditions and reconfiguring monitoring-related operations for subsets of traffic flows. Our solution performs responsive adaptations at the time scale of milliseconds and does not require a significant amount of resources. To demonstrate the capabilities of our approach we implemented it as part of a generic packet-processing pipeline and show that lossless traffic monitoring can be achieved for a wide range of conditions.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Commodity hardware", "Concurrent access", "Monitoring process", "Operational conditions", "Packet processing", "Processing power", "Processor resources", "Traffic monitoring"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85046632501", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"], ["Information Systems and Management", "DECI", "1802"], ["Control and Optimization", "MATH", "2606"], ["Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality", "ENGI", "2213"]], "AuthorData": {"57190031604": {"Name": "Tangari G.", "AuthorID": "57190031604", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "14010012200": {"Name": "Charalambides M.", "AuthorID": "14010012200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "36184239500": {"Name": "Tuncer D.", "AuthorID": "36184239500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "7003707235": {"Name": "Pavlou G.", "AuthorID": "7003707235", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}}}
