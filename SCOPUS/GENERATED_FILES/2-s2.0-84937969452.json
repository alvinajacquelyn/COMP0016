Inasmuch as the dolls\u2019 house may be the reproduction of domestic ideals on a minute scale and an educational model prompting girls to become good housewives, this article argues that it is also a means and space to express imagination, creativity, and agency. Including a short history of the development of dolls\u2019 houses, this article considers how the image of the dolls\u2019 house is significant in the depiction of a perfect domestic world through the examination of selected dolls\u2019 house stories in the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth century and adult women\u2019s autobiographical recollections of dolls\u2019 house play in their Victorian childhood. Secondly, the article also examines some lesser-known children\u2019s fiction set inside the dolls\u2019 house or in a miniature world, such as Edith Nesbit\u2019s The Magic City (1910) and offers a close reading of Doris Davey\u2019s My Dolly\u2019s Home (1921), to discuss how literary representations of dolls\u2019 houses and depictions of children\u2019s adventures into miniature worlds juxtapose size contrasts and provoke readers\u2019 unconscious anxieties about the boundaries between imagination and reality.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Dolls\u2019 houses", "Miniature", "Miniaturization", "My Dolly\u2019s Home"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84937969452", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["Linguistics and Language", "SOCI", "3310"]], "AuthorData": {"56384789900": {"Name": "Chen N.", "AuthorID": "56384789900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of English, University College London"}}}
