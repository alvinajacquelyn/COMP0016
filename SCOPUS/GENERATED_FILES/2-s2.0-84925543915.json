Autosomal recessive inheritance in a gene encoding a mitochondrially targeted protein was assumed; the only variants which satisfied these criteria were c.1882C>T (p.Arg628Cys) and c.1915G>A (p.Glu639Lys) in the CLPB gene, encoding a heat shock protein/chaperonin responsible for disaggregating mitochondrial and cytosolic proteins. Functional studies, including quantitative PCR (qPCR) and Western blot, support pathogenicity of these mutations. Furthermore, molecular modelling suggests that the mutations disrupt interactions between subunits so that the CLPB hexamer cannot form or is unstable, thus impairing its role as a protein disaggregase. We conclude that accumulation of protein aggregates underlies the development of cataracts and nephrocalcinosis in CLPB deficiency, which is a novel genetic cause of 3-methylglutaconic aciduria. A common mitochondrial cause for 3-methylglutaconic aciduria appears to be disruption of the architecture of the mitochondrial membranes, as in Barth syndrome (tafazzin deficiency), Sengers syndrome (acylglycerol kinase deficiency) and MEGDEL syndrome (impaired remodelling of the mitochondrial membrane lipids because of SERAC1 mutations). We now propose that perturbation of the mitochondrial membranes by abnormal protein aggregates leads to 3-methylglutaconic aciduria in CLPB deficiency.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Cataract", "Cells, Cultured", "DNA Mutational Analysis", "Endopeptidase Clp", "Exome", "Female", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Heredity", "Humans", "Kidney Diseases, Cystic", "Male", "Metabolism, Inborn Errors", "Mitochondrial Diseases", "Mitochondrial Membranes", "Models, Molecular", "Mutation", "Nephrocalcinosis", "Pedigree", "Phenotype", "Protein Aggregation, Pathological", "Protein Conformation", "Risk Factors", "Siblings", "Structure-Activity Relationship"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84925543915", "SubjectAreas": [["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Genetics (clinical)", "MEDI", "2716"]], "AuthorData": {"56012894800": {"Name": "Kanabus M.", "AuthorID": "56012894800", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Genetics and Genomic Medicine, UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "35332697000": {"Name": "Shahni R.", "AuthorID": "35332697000", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Genetics and Genomic Medicine, UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "7005146428": {"Name": "Heales S.", "AuthorID": "7005146428", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Chemistry Department, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}, "35400640400": {"Name": "Rahman S.", "AuthorID": "35400640400", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Metabolic Department, Great Ormond Street Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7007078986": {"Name": "Saldanha J.W.", "AuthorID": "7007078986", "AffiliationID": "60023477", "AffiliationName": "Division of Mathematical Biology, National Institute for Medical Research"}, "56497461300": {"Name": "Murphy E.", "AuthorID": "56497461300", "AffiliationID": "60020736", "AffiliationName": "Charles Dent Metabolic Unit, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "16402494600": {"Name": "Plagnol V.", "AuthorID": "16402494600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Genetics Institute"}, "57213848770": {"Name": "Hoff W.V.", "AuthorID": "57213848770", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Nephrology, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
