They arise in the mathematical modeling of asymmetric superdiffusion processes in heterogeneous media. The well-posedness of the formulations and sharp regularity pickup of the variational solutions are established. A novel finite element method (FEM) is developed, which employs continuous piecewise linear finite elements and \"shifted\" fractional powers for the trial and test space, respectively. The new approach has a number of distinct features: it allows the derivation of optimal error estimates in both the L2(D) and H1(D) norms; and on a uniform mesh, the stiffness matrix of the leading term is diagonal and the resulting linear system is well conditioned. Further, in the Riemann-Liouville case, an enriched FEM is proposed to improve the convergence. Extensive numerical results are presented to verify the theoretical analysis and robustness of the numerical scheme.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Finite element method", "Fractional convection-diffusion equation", "Optimal error estimates", "Variational formulation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Caputo derivatives", "Convection-diffusion equations", "Heterogeneous media", "Numerical results", "Optimal error estimate", "Petrov Galerkin finite elements", "Variational formulation", "Variational solutions"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84960896122", "SubjectAreas": [["Numerical Analysis", "MATH", "2612"], ["Computational Mathematics", "MATH", "2605"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"8268296700": {"Name": "Jin B.", "AuthorID": "8268296700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "7003806023": {"Name": "Lazarov R.", "AuthorID": "7003806023", "AffiliationID": "60020547", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, Texas A and M University"}, "55649851300": {"Name": "Zhou Z.", "AuthorID": "55649851300", "AffiliationID": "60030162", "AffiliationName": "Department of Applied Physics and Applied Mathematics, Columbia University"}}}
