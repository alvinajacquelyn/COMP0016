Such films have been demonstrably difficult to synthesise by established means. The synthetic route devised here affords great control over the functional, physical and chemical properties of the end product. A superhydrophobic PDMS thin film is deposited on a glass substrate by aerosol-assisted chemical vapour deposition (AACVD), then gold nanoparticles are incorporated by swelling the polymer film in a dispersion of the nanoparticles in toluene, which diffuse into the polymer and become embedded upon drying. Characterisation of the nanoparticles and resultant composite films are carried out using electron microscopy (SEM and TEM), UV-visible spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and water droplet contact angle measurements.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Aerosol-assisted chemical vapour depositions", "Glass substrates", "Gold Nanoparticles", "Nanocomposite thin films", "Physical and chemical properties", "Superhydrophobic", "Superhydrophobicity", "Synthesis procedure"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84962033935", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"]], "AuthorData": {"57188638209": {"Name": "Dixon S.", "AuthorID": "57188638209", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "55659162000": {"Name": "Peveler W.", "AuthorID": "55659162000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "55511810300": {"Name": "Noor N.", "AuthorID": "55511810300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "51160971600": {"Name": "Bear J.", "AuthorID": "51160971600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "56217400400": {"Name": "Parkin I.", "AuthorID": "56217400400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}}}
