The solution is based on the Green's function for the homogeneous wave equation expressed in the spatial frequency domain or k-space. The temporal convolution integral is solved analytically, and the remaining integrals are expressed in the form of the spatial Fourier transform. This allows the acoustic pressure for all spatial positions to be calculated in a single step using two fast Fourier transforms. The model is demonstrated through several numerical examples, including single element rectangular and spherically focused bowl transducers, and multi-element linear and hemispherical arrays.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Acoustic pressures", "Continuous wave source", "Convolution integrals", "Phased array transducers", "Single frequency", "Spatial Fourier Transform", "Spatial frequency domains", "Spatial positions"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85041305665", "SubjectAreas": [["Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)", "ARTS", "1201"], ["Acoustics and Ultrasonics", "PHYS", "3102"]], "AuthorData": {"16200175900": {"Name": "Treeby B.", "AuthorID": "16200175900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "56043355700": {"Name": "Wise E.", "AuthorID": "56043355700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "7403198742": {"Name": "Cox B.", "AuthorID": "7403198742", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "57200442410": {"Name": "Budisky J.", "AuthorID": "57200442410", "AffiliationID": "60083321", "AffiliationName": "IT4Innovations Centre of Excellence, Faculty of Information Technology, Brno University of Technology"}, "13408713400": {"Name": "Jaros J.", "AuthorID": "13408713400", "AffiliationID": "60083321", "AffiliationName": "IT4Innovations Centre of Excellence, Faculty of Information Technology, Brno University of Technology"}}}
