These difficulties are underexplored in personality disorder (PD) despite their prevalence. Furthermore, little evidence exists regarding how these factors relate to adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and attachment. Method: Fifty-three participants with a diagnosis of PD completed measures including childhood abuse/neglect, invalidation, early warmth, self-compassion, shame, self-criticism, FSC, and anxious/avoidant attachment. Results: Self-compassion was predicted uniquely by low early warmth; self-inadequacy by invalidation and abuse; and FSC by multiple ACEs. FSC and self-compassion were significantly correlated with self-criticism and shame, but not with one another. Conclusions: Low self-compassion and high FSC appear to be distinct problems, substantiating physiological models proposing distinct threat and soothing systems. Results are consistent with theories positing that low self-compassion has distinct origins to shame, self-criticism, and FSC.", "AuthorKeywords": ["child abuse", "child neglect", "compassion", "personality disorders", "self-compassion", "self-criticism"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Adverse Childhood Experiences", "Child Abuse", "Empathy", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Personality Disorders", "Personality Inventory", "Psychometrics", "Reactive Attachment Disorder", "Risk Factors", "Self Care", "Self Concept", "Self-Assessment", "Shame", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85062346026", "SubjectAreas": [["Clinical Psychology", "PSYC", "3203"]], "AuthorData": {"56008036900": {"Name": "Naismith I.", "AuthorID": "56008036900", "AffiliationID": "60052106", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Universidad de los Andes"}, "57195404115": {"Name": "Zarate Guerrero S.", "AuthorID": "57195404115", "AffiliationID": "60052106", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Universidad de los Andes"}, "56211921000": {"Name": "Feigenbaum J.", "AuthorID": "56211921000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London"}}}
