Clinical risk varies according to a number of factors, including recipient/donor CMV serostatus. Current dogma suggests risk is greatest in seropositive recipient (R+)/seronegative donor (D-) transplants and is exacerbated by T-cell depletion. We hypothesized that in the setting of reduced-intensity T-cell-depleted conditioning, recipient-derived CMV-specific T cells escaping deletion may contribute significantly to CMV-specific immunity and might therefore also influence chimerism status. We evaluated105 recipients of alemtuzumab-based reduced-intensity HSCT and collated details on CMV infection episodes and T-cell chimerism. We used CMV-specific HLA multimers to enumerate CMV-specific T-cell numbers and select cells to assess chimerism status in a subset of R+/D- and R+/seropositive donor patients. We show that in R+/D- patients, CMV-specific T cells are exclusively of recipient origin, can protect against recurrent CMV infections, and significantly influence the chimerism status toward recipients. The major findings were replicated in a separate validation cohort. T-cell depletion in the R+/D- setting may actually, therefore, foster more rapid reconstitution of protective antiviral immunity by reducing graft-vs-host directed alloreactivity and the associated elimination of the recipient T-cell compartment. Finally, conversion to donor chimerism after donor lymphocytes is associated with clinically occult transition to donor-derived immunity.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Allografts", "Cytomegalovirus", "Cytomegalovirus Infections", "Female", "Graft vs Host Disease", "Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation", "Humans", "Immunity, Cellular", "Lymphocyte Depletion", "Male", "Transplantation Chimera"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84921689850", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"], ["Hematology", "MEDI", "2720"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"35757123400": {"Name": "Sellar R.S.", "AuthorID": "35757123400", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, University College London Hospital"}, "56201356600": {"Name": "Vargas F.A.", "AuthorID": "56201356600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, University College London Cancer Institute"}, "25639732500": {"Name": "Henry J.Y.", "AuthorID": "25639732500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, University College London Cancer Institute"}, "12762916100": {"Name": "Quezada S.A.", "AuthorID": "12762916100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, University College London Cancer Institute"}, "35416735200": {"Name": "Peggs K.S.", "AuthorID": "35416735200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, University College London Cancer Institute, Paul O'Gorman Building"}, "56493150000": {"Name": "Charrot S.", "AuthorID": "56493150000", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, University College London Hospital"}, "56179054100": {"Name": "Thomson K.J.", "AuthorID": "56179054100", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, University College London Hospital"}, "6603005910": {"Name": "Verfuerth S.", "AuthorID": "6603005910", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, Royal Free Hospital"}, "56145395800": {"Name": "Beaton B.", "AuthorID": "56145395800", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, Royal Free Hospital"}, "6701831494": {"Name": "Chakraverty R.", "AuthorID": "6701831494", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, Royal Free Hospital"}, "7202865272": {"Name": "Mackinnon S.", "AuthorID": "7202865272", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, Royal Free Hospital"}}}
