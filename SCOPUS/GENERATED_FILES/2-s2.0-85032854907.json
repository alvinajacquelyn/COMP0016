Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.African trypanosomes are responsible for significant levels of disease in both humans and animals. The protozoan parasites are free-living flagellates, usually transmitted by arthropod vectors, including the tsetse fly. In the mammalian host they live in the bloodstream and, in the case of human-infectious species, later invade the central nervous system. Diagnosis of the disease requires the positive identification of parasites in the bloodstream. This can be particularly challenging where parasite numbers are low, as is often the case in peripheral blood. Enriching parasites from body fluids is an important part of the diagnostic pathway. As more is learned about the physicochemical properties of trypanosomes, this information can be exploited through use of different microfluidic-based approaches to isolate the parasites from blood or other fluids. Here, we discuss recent advances in the use of microfluidics to separate trypanosomes from blood and to isolate single trypanosomes for analyses including drug screening.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Concentration ramping", "Diagnosis", "Dielectrophoresis", "DLD", "Drug testing", "Isolation", "Microfluidics", "Optical trap", "Separation", "Trypanosomes"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85032854907", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Immunology and Microbiology (all)", "IMMU", "2400"], ["Microbiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2726"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"7202188382": {"Name": "Barrett M.P.", "AuthorID": "7202188382", "AffiliationID": "60001490, 60105832", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Centre for Molecular Parasitology, Institute of Infection, Immunity and Inflammation, College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow"}, "57193492823": {"Name": "Regnault C.", "AuthorID": "57193492823", "AffiliationID": "60001490, 60105832", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Centre for Molecular Parasitology, Institute of Infection, Immunity and Inflammation, College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow"}, "55154841200": {"Name": "Cooper J.M.", "AuthorID": "55154841200", "AffiliationID": "60001490", "AffiliationName": "Division of Biomedical Engineering, School of Engineering, University of Glasgow"}, "56524480300": {"Name": "Hochstetter A.", "AuthorID": "56524480300", "AffiliationID": "60001490", "AffiliationName": "Division of Biomedical Engineering, School of Engineering, University of Glasgow"}, "43861377300": {"Name": "Holm S.H.", "AuthorID": "43861377300", "AffiliationID": "60029170", "AffiliationName": "Division of Solid State Physics and Nano Lund, Lund University"}, "15761797000": {"Name": "Beech J.P.", "AuthorID": "15761797000", "AffiliationID": "60029170", "AffiliationName": "Division of Solid State Physics and Nano Lund, Lund University"}, "7003633618": {"Name": "Tegenfeldt J.O.", "AuthorID": "7003633618", "AffiliationID": "60029170", "AffiliationName": "Division of Solid State Physics and Nano Lund, Lund University"}}}
