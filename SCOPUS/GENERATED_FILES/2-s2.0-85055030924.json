The precursors were prepared by coprecipitation and characterized by XRD and TGA. The mixed metal oxides derived after calcination at 600 \u00b0C were characterized by XRD, N2 adsorption, H2-TPR and XPS. Moreover, in situ XAFS measurements over selected mixed metal oxides were performed. Such investigations under relevant reaction conditions are rare, while a comprehensive understanding of the involved active species may facilitate a knowledge-based catalyst optimization. The activity of the CoAlOx (Co/Al = 3/1, mol.%) catalyst varied depending on the loading of Mn or Fe (0.0575, 0.0821, 0.1150, 0.1725, 0.2300, mol.%). In the investigated series, Mn0.1725Co3AlOx reached the highest activity with T50 of about 305 and 376 \u00b0C under N2O/N2 and N2O,NO,O2/N2 feed, respectively. In situ X-ray absorption experiments over Mn0.1725Co3AlOx suggested that MnxCoyO4 spinels undergo reduction to CoO and MnO upon heating up to 600 \u00b0C in He. Under N2O/He conditions, initial reoxidation of cobalt species began at 350 \u00b0C. The lower activity obtained for Fe0.1725Co3AlOx is explained by the fact that the majority of Fe was not incorporated into the Co3O4 structure but instead formed less reactive iron oxide clusters.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cobalt", "Hydrotalcite-like compounds", "In situ XAFS", "Mixed metal oxides", "N2O decomposition"], "IndexKeywords": ["Catalyst optimization", "Catalytic decomposition", "Coal hydrotalcite-like compounds", "Hydrotalcite-like compound", "Iron oxide cluster", "Mixed metal oxide", "N2O decomposition", "Situ XAFS"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85055030924", "SubjectAreas": [["Catalysis", "CENG", "1503"], ["Environmental Science (all)", "ENVI", "2300"], ["Process Chemistry and Technology", "CENG", "1508"]], "AuthorData": {"57211565320": {"Name": "Jab\u0142o\u0144ska M.", "AuthorID": "57211565320", "AffiliationID": "60016653", "AffiliationName": "Center for, Automotive Catalytic Systems Aachen \u2013 ACA, RWTH Aachen University"}, "24503622700": {"Name": "Palkovits R.", "AuthorID": "24503622700", "AffiliationID": "60016653", "AffiliationName": "Center for, Automotive Catalytic Systems Aachen \u2013 ACA, RWTH Aachen University"}, "57202450063": {"Name": "Ar\u00e1n M.A.", "AuthorID": "57202450063", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "8889480300": {"Name": "Beale A.M.", "AuthorID": "8889480300", "AffiliationID": "60023254", "AffiliationName": "Research Complex at Harwell, Rutherford Appleton Laboratories"}, "55691870100": {"Name": "Delahay G.", "AuthorID": "55691870100", "AffiliationID": "60103239", "AffiliationName": "Institut Charles Gerhardt de Montpellier"}, "6508392309": {"Name": "Petitto C.", "AuthorID": "6508392309", "AffiliationID": "60103239", "AffiliationName": "Institut Charles Gerhardt de Montpellier"}, "6602724152": {"Name": "Nocu\u0144 M.", "AuthorID": "6602724152", "AffiliationID": "60017351", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Material Science and Ceramics, AGH University of Science and Technology"}}}
