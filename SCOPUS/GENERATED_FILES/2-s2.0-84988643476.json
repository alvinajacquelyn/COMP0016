The objective is to learn a model to predict the class labels of individual instances. This paradigm presents very different applications, specially concerning anonymous data. Two different iterative strategies are proposed to deal with this type of problems, both based on optimising the class membership of the instances using the estimated pattern distribution per bag and the label proportions. Discriminant analysis is reformulated to deal with non-crisp class memberships. A thorough set of experiments is conducted to test: (1) the performance gap between these approaches and the fully supervised setting, (2) the potential advantages of optimising class memberships by our proposals, and (3) the influence of factors such as the bag size and the number of classes of the problem in the performance.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Classification", "Discriminant analysis", "Label proportions", "Weakly supervised learning"], "IndexKeywords": ["Class labels", "Iterative strategy", "Learning paradigms", "Number of class", "Performance gaps", "Training data", "Weakly supervised learning", "Weighting scheme"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84988643476", "SubjectAreas": [["Theoretical Computer Science", "MATH", "2614"], ["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"]], "AuthorData": {"35068542300": {"Name": "P\u00e9rez-Ortiz M.", "AuthorID": "35068542300", "AffiliationID": "60086940", "AffiliationName": "Department of Quantitative Methods, Universidad Loyola Andaluc\u00eda"}, "23666156200": {"Name": "Carbonero-Ruz M.", "AuthorID": "23666156200", "AffiliationID": "60086940", "AffiliationName": "Department of Quantitative Methods, Universidad Loyola Andaluc\u00eda"}, "23473354200": {"Name": "Guti\u00e9rrez P.", "AuthorID": "23473354200", "AffiliationID": "60003138", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science and Numerical Analysis, University of C\u00f3rdoba"}, "6603240334": {"Name": "Herv\u00e1s-Mart\u00ednez C.", "AuthorID": "6603240334", "AffiliationID": "60003138", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science and Numerical Analysis, University of C\u00f3rdoba"}}}
