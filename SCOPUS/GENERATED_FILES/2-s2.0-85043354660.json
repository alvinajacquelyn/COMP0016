This is, to a large extent, based on short-term studies that are designed to detect the immediate and strongest biodiversity responses to a threatening process. What few long-term studies are available, although typically focused on single species, report outcomes that often diverge significantly from the short-term species responses. Here, we report the results of an 18-year survey of an amphibian community exposed to both climate warming and the emergence of lethal chytridiomycosis. Our study shows that the impacts of infectious disease are ongoing but restricted to two out of nine species that form the community, despite the fact all species can become infected with the fungus. Climate warming appears to be affecting four out of the nine species, but the response of three of these is an increase in abundance. Our study supports a decreasing role of infectious disease on the community, and an increasing and currently positive effect of climate warming. We caution that if the warming trends continue, the net positive effect will turn negative as amphibian breeding habitat becomes unavailable as water bodies dry, a pattern that already may be underway.", "AuthorKeywords": ["amphibian monitoring", "chytridiomycosis", "climate change", "global amphibian declines", "wildlife diseases"], "IndexKeywords": ["Amphibians", "Animal Diseases", "Animals", "Biodiversity", "Chytridiomycota", "Climate Change", "Mycoses", "Spain"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85043354660", "SubjectAreas": [["Global and Planetary Change", "ENVI", "2306"], ["Environmental Chemistry", "ENVI", "2304"], ["Ecology", "ENVI", "2303"], ["Environmental Science (all)", "ENVI", "2300"]], "AuthorData": {"34567498400": {"Name": "Bosch J.", "AuthorID": "34567498400", "AffiliationID": "116758123", "AffiliationName": "Centro de Investigaci\u00f3n, Seguimiento y Evaluaci\u00f3n, Parque Nacional de la Sierra de Guadarrama"}, "39862849500": {"Name": "Fern\u00e1ndez-Beaskoetxea S.", "AuthorID": "39862849500", "AffiliationID": "60015098", "AffiliationName": "Museo Nacional de Ciencias Naturales-CSIC"}, "7004349656": {"Name": "Carrascal L.M.", "AuthorID": "7004349656", "AffiliationID": "60015098", "AffiliationName": "Museo Nacional de Ciencias Naturales-CSIC"}, "7005973727": {"Name": "Garner T.W.J.", "AuthorID": "7005973727", "AffiliationID": "60005453, 60009498", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Zoology, Zoological Society of London"}}}
