The purpose of this study was to analyse the immune response to the four murine subunits of retinol binding protein-3 (RBP-3) to identify pathogenic epitopes to investigate the presence of intramolecular epitope spreading during the persistent inflammation phase observed in this model of EAU. Recombinant murine subunits of the RBP-3 protein were purified and used to immunize C57BL/6J mice to induce EAU. An overlapping peptide library was used to screen RBP-3 subunit 3 for immunogenicity and pathogenicity. Disease phenotype and characterization of pathogenic subunits and peptides was undertaken by topical endoscopic fundal imaging, immunohistochemistry, proliferation assays and flow cytometry. RBP-3 subunits 1, 2 and 3 induced EAU in the C57BL/6J mice, with subunit 3 eliciting the most destructive clinical disease. Within subunit 3 we identified a novel uveitogenic epitope, 629-643. The disease induced by this peptide was comparable to that produced by the uveitogenic 1-20 peptide. Following immunization, peptide-specific responses by CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell subsets were detected, and cells from both populations were present in the retinal inflammatory infiltrate. Intramolecular epitope spreading between 629-643 and 1-20 was detected in mice with clinical signs of disease. The 629-643 RBP-3 peptide is a major uveitogenic peptide for the induction of EAU in C57BL/6J mice and the persistent clinical disease induced with one peptide leads to epitope spreading.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Autoimmunity", "Chronic inflammation", "Epitope spreading", "Retina", "Uveitis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Autoimmune Diseases", "CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes", "CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes", "Cell Proliferation", "Cells, Cultured", "Disease Models, Animal", "Epitope Mapping", "Epitopes", "Eye Proteins", "Female", "Humans", "Lymphocyte Activation", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Peptide Fragments", "Phenotype", "Retina", "Retinitis", "Retinol-Binding Proteins", "Severity of Illness Index", "Uvea", "Uveitis"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84941745631", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"]], "AuthorData": {"12805342500": {"Name": "Boldison J.", "AuthorID": "12805342500", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "School of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, University of Bristol"}, "7103296976": {"Name": "Dick A.", "AuthorID": "7103296976", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "Academic Unit of Ophthalmology, School of Clinical Sciences, University of Bristol"}, "7102339443": {"Name": "Nicholson L.", "AuthorID": "7102339443", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "Academic Unit of Ophthalmology, School of Clinical Sciences, University of Bristol"}, "13612883900": {"Name": "Khera T.", "AuthorID": "13612883900", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "Academic Unit of Ophthalmology, School of Clinical Sciences, University of Bristol"}, "57197345814": {"Name": "Copland D.", "AuthorID": "57197345814", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "Academic Unit of Ophthalmology, School of Clinical Sciences, University of Bristol"}, "56780194200": {"Name": "Stimpson M.", "AuthorID": "56780194200", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "Academic Unit of Ophthalmology, School of Clinical Sciences, University of Bristol"}, "56647597500": {"Name": "Crawford G.", "AuthorID": "56647597500", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "Academic Unit of Ophthalmology, School of Clinical Sciences, University of Bristol"}}}
