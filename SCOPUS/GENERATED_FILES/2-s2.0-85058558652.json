Here we resolve this conflict by establishing the feasibility of surface code quantum computing using solid-state spins, or \u2018data qubits\u2019, that are widely separated from one another. We use a second set of \u2018probe\u2019 spins that are mechanically separate from the data qubits and move in and out of their proximity. The spin dipole\u2013dipole interactions give rise to phase shifts; measuring a probe\u2019s total phase reveals the collective parity of the data qubits along the probe\u2019s path. Using a protocol that balances the systematic errors due to imperfect device fabrication, our detailed simulations show that substantial misalignments can be handled within fault-tolerant operations. We conclude that this simple \u2018orbital probe\u2019 architecture overcomes many of the difficulties facing solid-state quantum computing, while minimising the complexity and offering qubit densities that are several orders of magnitude greater than other systems.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Device fabrications", "Dipole interaction", "Fault tolerant operations", "Fault-tolerant architectures", "Impurity atoms", "Orders of magnitude", "Quantum Computing", "Solid-state quantum computing"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85058558652", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Science (miscellaneous)", "COMP", "1701"], ["Statistical and Nonlinear Physics", "PHYS", "3109"], ["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"], ["Computational Theory and Mathematics", "COMP", "1703"]], "AuthorData": {"57200134788": {"Name": "O\u2019gorman J.", "AuthorID": "57200134788", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials, University of Oxford"}, "55697450300": {"Name": "Nickerson N.H.", "AuthorID": "55697450300", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Imperial College London"}, "7201771061": {"Name": "Benjamin S.C.", "AuthorID": "7201771061", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials, University of Oxford"}, "57201014812": {"Name": "Ross P.", "AuthorID": "57201014812", "AffiliationID": "60175883", "AffiliationName": "London Centre for Nanotechnology"}, "55613970800": {"Name": "Morton J.J.L.", "AuthorID": "55613970800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}}}
