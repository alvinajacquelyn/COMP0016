Different superficial velocities of fluidizing gas are defined to investigate the hydrodynamics of the fluidized beds and the consequent influence on the yield fractional distribution of end-products. Heat conduction inside particles is considered indirectly through modifying the rate constants of biomass reaction scheme. The simulation results show that superficial velocity has to be designed carefully based on balancing the char-removal efficiency and biomass heating up rate; compared to the experimental data, the modified reaction scheme can be employed to describe the intra-particle heat penetration, qualitatively, but the accuracy of predicting the end-product yields needs to be improved.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Biomass fast pyrolysis", "Fluidized bed reactor", "Intra-particle heat penetration"], "IndexKeywords": ["Biomass pyrolysis", "Bubbling fluidized bed reactor", "Fast pyrolysis", "Fluidized bed reactors", "Fractional distribution", "Heat penetration", "Removal efficiencies", "Superficial velocity"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85027949650", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"], ["Fuel Technology", "ENER", "2103"], ["Energy Engineering and Power Technology", "ENER", "2102"]], "AuthorData": {"55371224000": {"Name": "Dong N.", "AuthorID": "55371224000", "AffiliationID": "60073563", "AffiliationName": "School of Energy and Power Engineering, Northeast Dianli University"}, "55515943100": {"Name": "Wang Q.", "AuthorID": "55515943100", "AffiliationID": "60073563", "AffiliationName": "School of Energy and Power Engineering, Northeast Dianli University"}, "7102436109": {"Name": "Luo K.", "AuthorID": "7102436109", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}}}
