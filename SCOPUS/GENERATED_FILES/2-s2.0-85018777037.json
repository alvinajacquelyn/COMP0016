This agent, which we name \u2018Cy-droplet\u2019, has the following novel features. It comprises a highly volatile perfluorocarbon for easy versatile activation, and a near-infrared optically absorbing dye chosen to absorb light at a wavelength with good tissue penetration. It is manufactured via a \u2018microbubble condensation\u2019 method. The phase-transition of Cy-droplets can be optically triggered by pulsed-laser illumination, inducing photoacoustic signal and forming stable gas bubbles that are visible with echo-ultrasound in situ. Alternatively, Cy-droplets can be converted to microbubble contrast agents upon acoustic activation with clinical ultrasound. Potentially all modes offer extravascular contrast enhancement because of the sub-micron initial size. Such versatility of acoustic and optical \u2018triggerability\u2019 can potentially improve multi-modality imaging, molecularly targeted imaging and controlled drug release.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Droplet", "Microbubble", "Multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT)", "Optical/acoustic vaporisation", "Phase-change contrast agent", "Photoacoustic", "Ultrasound"], "IndexKeywords": ["Contrast agent", "Controlled drug release", "Micro-bubble", "Microbubble contrast agents", "Multi-modality imaging", "Optoacoustic tomography", "Photo-acoustic imaging", "Photoacoustic signals"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85018777037", "SubjectAreas": [["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"], ["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"56500921400": {"Name": "Lin S.", "AuthorID": "56500921400", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Bioengineering, Imperial College London"}, "56904066600": {"Name": "Stanziola A.", "AuthorID": "56904066600", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Bioengineering, Imperial College London"}, "35346143000": {"Name": "Tang M.X.", "AuthorID": "35346143000", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Bioengineering, Imperial College London"}, "56198982700": {"Name": "Shah A.", "AuthorID": "56198982700", "AffiliationID": "60017166, 60010337", "AffiliationName": "Joint Department of Physics and CRUK Cancer Imaging Centre, The Institute of Cancer Research and The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7005776040": {"Name": "Bamber J.", "AuthorID": "7005776040", "AffiliationID": "60017166, 60010337", "AffiliationName": "Joint Department of Physics and CRUK Cancer Imaging Centre, The Institute of Cancer Research and The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust"}, "25627985300": {"Name": "Hern\u00e1ndez-Gil J.", "AuthorID": "25627985300", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Imperial College London"}, "56029461700": {"Name": "Harriss B.I.", "AuthorID": "56029461700", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Imperial College London"}, "7101727059": {"Name": "Long N.", "AuthorID": "7101727059", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Imperial College London"}, "7401741749": {"Name": "Matsunaga T.O.", "AuthorID": "7401741749", "AffiliationID": "60010065", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Imaging, University of Arizona"}}}
