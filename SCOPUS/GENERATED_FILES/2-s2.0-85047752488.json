Objective: We sought to determine nephrologists\u2019 and allied health care providers\u2019 perceptions on management of sex hormone status in women with CKD. Methods: An anonymous, Internet-based survey was sent to nephrology society members from Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom, and the Canadian Association of Nephrology Nurses and Technologists (February-November 2015). We assessed reported perceptions and management of sex hormone status in women with CKD. Results: One hundred seventy-five nephrologists (21% response rate) and 121 allied health care providers (30%; 116 nurses, 5 pharmacists) responded. Sixty-eight percent of nephrologists and 46% of allied providers were between the ages of 30 and 50 years, and 38% of nephrologists and 89% of allied workers were female. Ninety-five percent of nephrologists agreed that kidney function impacts sex hormone status, although only a minority of nephrologists reported often discussing fertility (35%, female vs male nephrologists, P =.06) and menstrual irregularities with their patients (15%, female vs male nephrologists,P =.02). Transplant nephrologists reported discussing fertility more often than did nontransplant nephrologists (53% vs 30%, P =.03). Physicians were more likely to report discussing fertility (33% vs 7.5%, P <.001) and menstrual irregularities (15% vs 9%, P =.04) with patients than allied health care providers. Forty-three percent of physicians reported uncertainty about the role for postmenopausal hormone therapy in women with CKD. Conclusion: Nephrologists and allied health care providers recognize an impact of CKD on sex hormones in women but report not frequently discussing sex hormone\u2013related issues with patients. Our international survey highlights an important knowledge gap in nephrology.", "AuthorKeywords": ["chronic kidney disease", "estradiol", "hormone therapy", "nephrologist", "sex hormone", "survey", "women"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85047752488", "SubjectAreas": [["Nephrology", "MEDI", "2727"]], "AuthorData": {"56597543800": {"Name": "Ramesh S.", "AuthorID": "56597543800", "AffiliationID": "60002306", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Medicine, University of Calgary"}, "36441202300": {"Name": "James M.T.", "AuthorID": "36441202300", "AffiliationID": "60002306", "AffiliationName": "Department of Community Health Sciences, University of Calgary"}, "6603151204": {"Name": "Holroyd-Leduc J.M.", "AuthorID": "6603151204", "AffiliationID": "60002306", "AffiliationName": "Department of Community Health Sciences, University of Calgary"}, "23971672900": {"Name": "Wilton S.B.", "AuthorID": "23971672900", "AffiliationID": "60002306", "AffiliationName": "Department of Community Health Sciences, University of Calgary"}, "7402715449": {"Name": "Ahmed S.B.", "AuthorID": "7402715449", "AffiliationID": "101502824", "AffiliationName": "Alberta Kidney Disease Network"}, "7006603647": {"Name": "Seely E.W.", "AuthorID": "7006603647", "AffiliationID": "60009982", "AffiliationName": "Harvard University"}, "57198363448": {"Name": "Wheeler D.C.", "AuthorID": "57198363448", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60032819", "AffiliationName": "Royal Free Hospital, University College London"}}}
