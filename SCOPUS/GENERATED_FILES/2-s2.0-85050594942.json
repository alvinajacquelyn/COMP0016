Brazil is one of the leaders in the use of renewable energy, pioneering new biofuel technologies and presenting an electricity matrix based on hydroelectric power. Due to its vast territory, Brazil presents a high heterogeneity regarding natural resources availability and socioeconomic conditions, resulting in regions with different electricity supply and demand profiles. Hydropower, biomass and wind power account respectively for 61.40%, 8.77% and 6.71% of the Brazilian total installed capacity. However, the high dependence on hydroelectricity exposes the country to risks associated with variations on the hydrological regimes. The renewable alternatives to hydroelectricity in the country - biomass and wind power - can increase the reliability of the system and the choice of the optimal power mix is a challenge. This study analyzes the optimal Brazilian electricity mix based on a portfolio model considering regional supply and demand characteristics. The main drivers to analyze the problem are the generation and transmission costs and the regional supply and demand. At an aggregate level, the results show that bioelectricity is the most economical option among the thermal sources. The results motivate the analysis of land use for biomass crops, the development of new technologies to increase the harvest productivity and establishment of policies to attract investments on bioelectricity.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Brazilian electricity sector", "electricity generation", "portfolio theory", "renewable sources"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85050594942", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"]], "AuthorData": {"57209811408": {"Name": "de Oliveira L.", "AuthorID": "57209811408", "AffiliationID": "60008088", "AffiliationName": "Polytechnic School of the University of Sao Paulo"}, "57202976132": {"Name": "de Oliveira Ribeiro C.", "AuthorID": "57202976132", "AffiliationID": "60008088", "AffiliationName": "Polytechnic School of the University of Sao Paulo"}, "55550091300": {"Name": "Rego E.", "AuthorID": "55550091300", "AffiliationID": "60008088", "AffiliationName": "Polytechnic School of the University of Sao Paulo"}, "26636031400": {"Name": "Tomei J.", "AuthorID": "26636031400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute for Sustainable Resources, University College London"}}}
