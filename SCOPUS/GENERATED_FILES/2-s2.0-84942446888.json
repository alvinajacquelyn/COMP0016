Reduction in the abundance of amyloid fibril precursor proteins arrests amyloid deposition and halts disease progression in all forms of amyloidosis including TTR type. Our previous demonstration that circulating serum amyloid P component (SAP) is efficiently depleted by administration of a specific small molecule ligand compound, that non-covalently crosslinks pairs of SAP molecules, suggested that TTR may be also amenable to this approach. We first confirmed that chemically crosslinked human TTR is rapidly cleared from the circulation in mice. In order to crosslink pairs of TTR molecules, promote their accelerated clearance and thus therapeutically deplete plasma TTR, we prepared a range of bivalent specific ligands for the thyroxine binding sites of TTR. Non-covalently bound human TTR-ligand complexes were formed that were stable in vitro and in vivo, but they were not cleared from the plasma of mice in vivo more rapidly than native uncomplexed TTR. Therapeutic depletion of circulating TTR will require additional mechanisms.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Amyloidosis", "Crosslinking", "Plasma clearance", "Transthyretin"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Binding Sites", "Cross-Linking Reagents", "Humans", "Ligands", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Models, Molecular", "Piperidines", "Prealbumin", "Protein Structure, Quaternary", "Thyroxine"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84942446888", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"7003800223": {"Name": "Patrizia Mangione P.", "AuthorID": "7003800223", "AffiliationID": "60015197", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Medicine, Institute of Biochemistry, University of Pavia"}, "6507358503": {"Name": "Ellmerich S.", "AuthorID": "6507358503", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Wolfson Drug Discovery Unit, Centre for Amyloidosis and Acute Phase Proteins, Division of Medicine, University College London, Royal Free Campus"}, "7006438238": {"Name": "Bellotti V.", "AuthorID": "7006438238", "AffiliationID": "60015197", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Medicine, Institute of Biochemistry, University of Pavia"}, "6506416476": {"Name": "Kolstoe S.", "AuthorID": "6506416476", "AffiliationID": "60025475", "AffiliationName": "School of Biological Sciences, University of Portsmouth"}, "7401448110": {"Name": "Wood S.P.", "AuthorID": "7401448110", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Wolfson Drug Discovery Unit, Centre for Amyloidosis and Acute Phase Proteins, Division of Medicine, University College London, Royal Free Campus"}, "7003350511": {"Name": "Tennent G.A.", "AuthorID": "7003350511", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Wolfson Drug Discovery Unit, Centre for Amyloidosis and Acute Phase Proteins, Division of Medicine, University College London, Royal Free Campus"}, "56848974700": {"Name": "Pepys M.B.", "AuthorID": "56848974700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Wolfson Drug Discovery Unit, Centre for Amyloidosis and Acute Phase Proteins, Division of Medicine, University College London, Royal Free Campus"}, "35493762000": {"Name": "Taylor G.W.", "AuthorID": "35493762000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Wolfson Drug Discovery Unit, Centre for Amyloidosis and Acute Phase Proteins, Division of Medicine, University College London, Royal Free Campus"}, "35236556400": {"Name": "Deroo S.", "AuthorID": "35236556400", "AffiliationID": "60000145", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory for Structure and Function of Biological Membranes, Center for Structural Biology and Bioinformatics, Universite Libre de Bruxelles"}, "7403375239": {"Name": "Robinson C.V.", "AuthorID": "7403375239", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Chemistry Research Laboratory, University of Oxford"}, "55574239993": {"Name": "Smith M.D.", "AuthorID": "55574239993", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Chemistry Research Laboratory, University of Oxford"}, "6603424028": {"Name": "Broadbridge R.J.", "AuthorID": "6603424028", "AffiliationID": "115015025", "AffiliationName": "Peptide Protein Research Ltd"}, "56632327200": {"Name": "Council C.E.", "AuthorID": "56632327200", "AffiliationID": "115015025", "AffiliationName": "Peptide Protein Research Ltd"}, "56872570500": {"Name": "Thurston J.R.", "AuthorID": "56872570500", "AffiliationID": "115015025", "AffiliationName": "Peptide Protein Research Ltd"}, "56518259200": {"Name": "Steadman V.A.", "AuthorID": "56518259200", "AffiliationID": "105527392", "AffiliationName": "Selcia Ltd"}, "56872728500": {"Name": "Vong A.K.", "AuthorID": "56872728500", "AffiliationID": "105527392", "AffiliationName": "Selcia Ltd"}, "7005954385": {"Name": "Swain C.J.", "AuthorID": "7005954385", "AffiliationID": "113022876", "AffiliationName": "Cambridge MedChem Consulting"}}}
