Slamming wave impacts were found to be close to the aft end of the short centre bow. These occurred at time intervals of over 3 encountered modal wave periods, with longer intervals in smaller seas and for shorter modal periods. Slams were only detected in wave heights exceeding 1.5 m at full scale. Slam loads in 4 m seas were mostly about 25% of the hull weight but some reached 132% of the hull weight. Slam durations were generally about 0.35 s at full scale. Slam induced bending was found to reach 11% of the product of hull weight and length. Simulation of slamming within a time domain seakeeping computation showed slightly higher median relative velocities at the slam instant than was observed in the model tests.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Catamaran", "Fast ferry", "Random seas", "Wave slamming"], "IndexKeywords": ["Catamaran", "Fast ferries", "Random sea", "Relative velocity", "Time interval", "Wave impacts", "Wave piercing catamaran", "Wave slamming"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85014682926", "SubjectAreas": [["Environmental Engineering", "ENVI", "2305"], ["Ocean Engineering", "ENGI", "2212"]], "AuthorData": {"35600466300": {"Name": "Davis M.", "AuthorID": "35600466300", "AffiliationID": "60015356", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering and ICT, University of Tasmania"}, "36154336700": {"Name": "French B.", "AuthorID": "36154336700", "AffiliationID": "60015356", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering and ICT, University of Tasmania"}, "25925551300": {"Name": "Thomas G.", "AuthorID": "25925551300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}}}
