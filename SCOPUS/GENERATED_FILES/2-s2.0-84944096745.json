However, habitat loss outside PAs will continue to affect habitats and species, and PAs may displace human activities into areas that might be even more important for species persistence. Here we measure the expected contribution of PA expansion strategies to Aichi target 12 by estimating the extent of suitable habitat available for all terrestrial mammals, with and without additional protection (the latter giving the counterfactual outcome), under different socio-economic scenarios and consequent land-use change to 2020. We found that expanding PAs to achieve representation targets for ecoregions under a Business-as-usual socio-economic scenario will result in a worse prognosis than doing nothing for more than 50% of the world\u2019s terrestrial mammals. By contrast, targeting protection towards threatened species can increase the suitable habitat available to over 60% of terrestrial mammals. Even in the absence of additional protection, an alternative socio-economic scenario, adopting progressive changes in human consumption, leads to positive outcomes for mammals globally and to the largest improvements for wide-ranging species.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Convention on Biological Diversity", "Counterfactual", "Habitat loss", "Protected areas", "Sustainable Development Goals"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Biodiversity", "Conservation of Natural Resources", "Ecosystem", "Endangered Species", "Human Activities", "Humans", "Mammals", "Models, Economic", "Models, Theoretical", "Socioeconomic Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84944096745", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"]], "AuthorData": {"26647965400": {"Name": "Visconti P.", "AuthorID": "26647965400", "AffiliationID": "60111356", "AffiliationName": "World Conservation Monitoring Centre"}, "7801529646": {"Name": "Bakkenes M.", "AuthorID": "7801529646", "AffiliationID": "60004840", "AffiliationName": "PBL, Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency"}, "55509629100": {"Name": "Smith R.J.", "AuthorID": "55509629100", "AffiliationID": "60010818", "AffiliationName": "Durrell Institute of Conservation and Ecology, School of Anthropology and Conservation, University of Kent"}, "56517745500": {"Name": "Sykes R.E.", "AuthorID": "56517745500", "AffiliationID": "60010818", "AffiliationName": "Durrell Institute of Conservation and Ecology, School of Anthropology and Conservation, University of Kent"}, "23566616300": {"Name": "Joppa L.", "AuthorID": "23566616300", "AffiliationID": "60021726", "AffiliationName": "Microsoft Research"}}}
