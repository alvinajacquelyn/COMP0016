Sapacitabine is a novel orally administered nucleoside analogue that has shown encouraging activity in unrandomised early-stage trials. We randomised 143 untreated patients with AML or with high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (>10% marrow blasts) between sapacitibine and low-dose ara-C (LDAC) in our 'Pick a Winner' trial design. At the planned interim analysis there was no difference between LDAC and sapacitibine in terms of remission rate (CR/CRi, 27% vs 16% hazard ratio (HR) 1.98(0.90-4.39) P=0.09), relapse-free survival (10% vs 14% at 2 years, HR 0.73(0.33-1.61) P=0.4) or overall survival (OS; 12% vs 11% at 2 years, HR 1.24(0.86-1.78) P=0.2). Sapacitibine was well tolerated, apart from more grade 3/4 diarrhoea. On the basis of these findings sapacitibine did not show sufficient evidence of benefit over LDAC for the trial to be continued.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols", "Arabinonucleosides", "Cytarabine", "Cytosine", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Humans", "Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Neoplasm Staging", "Prognosis", "Remission Induction", "Survival Rate"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84930575627", "SubjectAreas": [["Hematology", "MEDI", "2720"], ["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Cancer Research", "BIOC", "1306"]], "AuthorData": {"7103199592": {"Name": "Burnett A.K.", "AuthorID": "7103199592", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, School of Medicine, Cardiff University"}, "7005927424": {"Name": "Hills R.K.", "AuthorID": "7005927424", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, School of Medicine, Cardiff University"}, "7201812899": {"Name": "Russell N.", "AuthorID": "7201812899", "AffiliationID": "60025016", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, Nottingham University Hospital NHS Trust"}, "6602521198": {"Name": "Panoskaltsis N.", "AuthorID": "6602521198", "AffiliationID": "60031535", "AffiliationName": "Northwick Park Hospital"}, "7005296444": {"Name": "Khwaja A.", "AuthorID": "7005296444", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "University College London Hospitals, 1st Floor Central"}, "6503935743": {"Name": "Hemmaway C.", "AuthorID": "6503935743", "AffiliationID": "60007937", "AffiliationName": "Queen's Hospital, Rom Valley Way"}, "6507420720": {"Name": "Cahalin P.", "AuthorID": "6507420720", "AffiliationID": "60019602", "AffiliationName": "Blackpool Victoria Hospital"}, "16549136400": {"Name": "Clark R.E.", "AuthorID": "16549136400", "AffiliationID": "60023925", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, Royal Liverpool University Hospital"}, "34968370000": {"Name": "Milligan D.", "AuthorID": "34968370000", "AffiliationID": "60024356", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, Birmingham Heartlands Hospital"}}}
