Zygotic knockout of Srsf3 results in embryo arrest at the blastocyst stage. However, SRSF3 is also present in oocytes, suggesting that it might be critical as a maternally inherited factor. Here we identify SRSF3 as an essential regulator of alternative splicing and of transposable elements to maintain transcriptome integrity in mouse oocyte. Using 3D time-lapse confocal live imaging, we show that conditional deletion of Srsf3 in fully grown germinal vesicle oocytes substantially compromises the capacity of germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD), and consequently entry into meiosis. By combining single cell RNA-seq, and oocyte micromanipulation with steric blocking antisense oligonucleotides and RNAse-H inducing gapmers, we found that the GVBD defect in mutant oocytes is due to both aberrant alternative splicing and derepression of B2 SINE transposable elements. Together, our study highlights how control of transcriptional identity of the maternal transcriptome by the RNA-binding protein SRSF3 is essential to the development of fertilized-competent oocytes.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85048778770", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"16230088500": {"Name": "Do D.V.", "AuthorID": "16230088500", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physiology, Development and Neuroscience, University of Cambridge"}, "8137496900": {"Name": "Strauss B.", "AuthorID": "8137496900", "AffiliationID": "60028377, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Trust/Cancer Research UK Gurdon Institute, University of Cambridge"}, "21834149500": {"Name": "Lee C.", "AuthorID": "21834149500", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physiology, Development and Neuroscience, University of Cambridge"}, "57200130119": {"Name": "Harrison A.", "AuthorID": "57200130119", "AffiliationID": "60028377, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Trust/Cancer Research UK Gurdon Institute, University of Cambridge"}, "57208229285": {"Name": "Butler R.", "AuthorID": "57208229285", "AffiliationID": "60028377, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Trust/Cancer Research UK Gurdon Institute, University of Cambridge"}, "57189656851": {"Name": "Surani M.A.", "AuthorID": "57189656851", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physiology, Development and Neuroscience, University of Cambridge"}, "35955483600": {"Name": "Cukuroglu E.", "AuthorID": "35955483600", "AffiliationID": "60031198", "AffiliationName": "Computational and Systems Biology, Genome Institute of Singapore"}, "22934026700": {"Name": "G\u00f6ke J.", "AuthorID": "22934026700", "AffiliationID": "60031198", "AffiliationName": "Computational and Systems Biology, Genome Institute of Singapore"}, "11738843900": {"Name": "Macaulay I.", "AuthorID": "11738843900", "AffiliationID": "60105122", "AffiliationName": "Earlham Institute"}, "24460864900": {"Name": "Wee K.B.", "AuthorID": "24460864900", "AffiliationID": "60023202", "AffiliationName": "Biomolecular Function Discovery Division, Bioinformatics Institute"}, "56608562100": {"Name": "Hu T.X.", "AuthorID": "56608562100", "AffiliationID": "60026124, 60008380", "AffiliationName": "EMBL European Bioinformatics Institute, Wellcome Genome Campus"}, "56011236900": {"Name": "Igor R.D.L.M.", "AuthorID": "56011236900", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "57202589026": {"Name": "Jernej U.", "AuthorID": "57202589026", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "13103737300": {"Name": "Marioni J.", "AuthorID": "13103737300", "AffiliationID": "60005517", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Wellcome Genome Campus"}, "6507652534": {"Name": "Dietmann S.", "AuthorID": "6507652534", "AffiliationID": "60031101, 60105833", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Trust Medical Research Council Stem Cell Institute, University of Cambridge"}, "8639561200": {"Name": "Smith C.W.J.", "AuthorID": "8639561200", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemistry, University of Cambridge"}}}
