KGaA, WeinheimThe challenge of continuous printing in high-efficiency large-area organic solar cells is a key limiting factor for their widespread adoption. A materials design concept for achieving large-area, solution-coated all-polymer bulk heterojunction solar cells with stable phase separation morphology between the donor and acceptor is presented. The key concept lies in inhibiting strong crystallization of donor and acceptor polymers, thus forming intermixed, low crystallinity, and mostly amorphous blends. Based on experiments using donors and acceptors with different degree of crystallinity, the results show that microphase separated donor and acceptor domain sizes are inversely proportional to the crystallinity of the conjugated polymers. This methodology of using low crystallinity donors and acceptors has the added benefit of forming a consistent and robust morphology that is insensitive to different processing conditions, allowing one to easily scale up the printing process from a small-scale solution shearing coater to a large-scale continuous roll-to-roll (R2R) printer. Large-area all-polymer solar cells are continuously roll-to-roll slot die printed with power conversion efficiencies of 5%, with combined cell area up to 10 cm2. This is among the highest efficiencies realized with R2R-coated active layer organic materials on flexible substrate.", "AuthorKeywords": ["all-polymer solar cells", "in situ X-ray scattering", "organic solar cells", "roll-to-roll processing", "X-ray diffraction"], "IndexKeywords": ["All-Polymer Solar Cells", "Degree of crystallinity", "Microphase separated", "Polymer bulk heterojunctions", "Power conversion efficiencies", "Processing condition", "Roll-to-roll processing", "Situ x-ray scatterings"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85014605031", "SubjectAreas": [["Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment", "ENER", "2105"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"]], "AuthorData": {"56287853200": {"Name": "Gu X.", "AuthorID": "56287853200", "AffiliationID": "60007027", "AffiliationName": "School of Polymers and High Performance Materials, University of Southern Mississippi"}, "57077138400": {"Name": "Zhou Y.", "AuthorID": "57077138400", "AffiliationID": "60012708", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, Stanford University"}, "56779624300": {"Name": "Gu K.", "AuthorID": "56779624300", "AffiliationID": "60012708", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, Stanford University"}, "37098817900": {"Name": "Kurosawa T.", "AuthorID": "37098817900", "AffiliationID": "60012708", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, Stanford University"}, "37116115600": {"Name": "Schroeder B.C.", "AuthorID": "37116115600", "AffiliationID": "60105356, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Materials Research Institute and School of Biological and Chemical Sciences, Queen Mary University of London"}, "55001821100": {"Name": "Molina-Lopez F.", "AuthorID": "55001821100", "AffiliationID": "60012708", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, Stanford University"}, "23065783000": {"Name": "Bao Z.", "AuthorID": "23065783000", "AffiliationID": "60012708", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, Stanford University"}, "26429006600": {"Name": "Yan H.", "AuthorID": "26429006600", "AffiliationID": "60023012, 60025590", "AffiliationName": "Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource, SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory"}, "25928096300": {"Name": "Tassone C.J.", "AuthorID": "25928096300", "AffiliationID": "60023012, 60025590", "AffiliationName": "Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource, SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory"}, "7006556112": {"Name": "Toney M.F.", "AuthorID": "7006556112", "AffiliationID": "60023012, 60025590", "AffiliationName": "Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource, SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory"}, "56073015300": {"Name": "Guo Y.", "AuthorID": "56073015300", "AffiliationID": "60014966", "AffiliationName": "College of Chemistry, Peking University"}, "7403490483": {"Name": "Zhao D.", "AuthorID": "7403490483", "AffiliationID": "60014966", "AffiliationName": "College of Chemistry, Peking University"}, "56493248300": {"Name": "Li Y.", "AuthorID": "56493248300", "AffiliationID": "60008592, 60128609", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry and Hong Kong Branch of Chinese National Engineering Research Center for Tissue Restoration & Reconstruction, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"}, "7405571313": {"Name": "Lin H.", "AuthorID": "7405571313", "AffiliationID": "60008592, 60128609", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry and Hong Kong Branch of Chinese National Engineering Research Center for Tissue Restoration & Reconstruction, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"}, "36672239000": {"Name": "Yan H.", "AuthorID": "36672239000", "AffiliationID": "60008592, 60128609", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry and Hong Kong Branch of Chinese National Engineering Research Center for Tissue Restoration & Reconstruction, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"}, "7501643592": {"Name": "Wang C.", "AuthorID": "7501643592", "AffiliationID": "60007174", "AffiliationName": "Advanced Light Source, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory"}, "6507604409": {"Name": "Mannsfeld S.C.B.", "AuthorID": "6507604409", "AffiliationID": "60018353", "AffiliationName": "Center for Advancing Electronics Dresden, Dresden University of Technology"}}}
