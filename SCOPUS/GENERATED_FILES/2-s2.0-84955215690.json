Companies are now advertising prenatal testing for aneuploidy via the Internet. Objectives: The aim of this systematic review of websites advertising non-invasive prenatal testing for aneuploidy was to explore the nature of the information being provided to potential users. Methods: We systematically searched two Internet search engines for relevant websites using the following terms: 'prenatal test', 'antenatal test', 'non-invasive test', 'noninvasive test', 'cell-free fetal DNA', 'cffDNA', 'Down syndrome test' or 'trisomy test'. We examined the first 200 websites identified through each search. Relevant web-based text was examined, and key topics were identified, tabulated and counted. To analyse the text further, we used thematic analysis. Main results: Forty websites were identified. Whilst a number of sites provided balanced, accurate information, in the majority supporting evidence was not provided to underpin the information and there was inadequate information on the need for an invasive test to definitely diagnose aneuploidy. Conclusions: The information provided on many websites does not comply with professional recommendations. Guidelines are needed to ensure that companies offering prenatal testing via the Internet provide accurate and comprehensible information.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Aneuploidy", "Direct-to-Consumer Advertising", "Female", "Humans", "Internet", "Pregnancy", "Prenatal Diagnosis"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84955215690", "SubjectAreas": [["Obstetrics and Gynecology", "MEDI", "2729"], ["Genetics (clinical)", "MEDI", "2716"]], "AuthorData": {"6701334715": {"Name": "Skirton H.", "AuthorID": "6701334715", "AffiliationID": "60024779", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Health and Human Sciences, Plymouth University"}, "25721940200": {"Name": "Goldsmith L.", "AuthorID": "25721940200", "AffiliationID": "60024779", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Health and Human Sciences, Plymouth University"}, "55552886800": {"Name": "Jackson L.", "AuthorID": "55552886800", "AffiliationID": "60024779", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Health and Human Sciences, Plymouth University"}, "22135567300": {"Name": "Lewis C.", "AuthorID": "22135567300", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60018207", "AffiliationName": "Genetics and Genomic Medicine, UCL Institute of Child Health and Great Ormond Street Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7006741537": {"Name": "Chitty L.S.", "AuthorID": "7006741537", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60018207", "AffiliationName": "Genetics and Genomic Medicine, UCL Institute of Child Health and Great Ormond Street Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
