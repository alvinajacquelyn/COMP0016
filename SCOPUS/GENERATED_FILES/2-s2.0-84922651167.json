LDLR) gene. FH manifests as highly elevated low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels and consequently accelerated atherosclerosis. Modern pharmacological therapies for FH are insufficiently efficacious to prevent premature cardiovascular disease, can cause significant adverse effects and can be expensive. Genetic therapies for FH have been mooted since the mid 1990s but gene replacement strategies using viral vectors have so far been unsuccessful. Other strategies involve knocking down the expression of Apolipoprotein B100 (APOB100) and the protease PCSK9 which designates LDLR for degradation. The antisense oligonucleotide mipomersen, which knocks down APOB100, is currently marketed (with restrictions) in the USA, but is not approved in Europe due to its adverse effects. To address this problem, we have devised a novel therapeutic concept, APO-skip, which is based on modulation of APOB splicing, and which has the potential to deliver a cost-effective, efficacious and safe therapy for FH.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Antisense oligonucleotides", "Apolipoprotein B", "Familial hypercholesterolaemia", "Genetic therapy", "LDL receptor"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Anticholesteremic Agents", "Cholesterol", "Genetic Therapy", "Humans", "Hypercholesterolemia", "Receptors, LDL"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84922651167", "SubjectAreas": [["Physiology", "BIOC", "1314"], ["Molecular Medicine", "BIOC", "1313"], ["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"]], "AuthorData": {"36185394100": {"Name": "Khoo B.", "AuthorID": "36185394100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Endocrinology, Division of Medicine, University College London"}}}
