Such transducers offer the benefits of rapid volumetric imaging, but can cause substantial measurement distortion in electromagnetic tracking sensors, which are commonly used to enable 3-D navigation. In this paper, we describe the design, development, and validation of a 3-D-ultrasound-guided transrectal prostate biopsy system that employs high-Accuracy optical tracking to localize the ultrasound probe and prostate targets in 3-D physical space. Methods: The accuracy of the system was validated by evaluating the targeted needle placement error after inserting a biopsy needle to sample planned targets in a phantom using standard 2-D ultrasound guidance versus real-Time 3-D guidance provided by the new system. Results: The overall mean needle-segment-To-Target distance error was 3.6 \u00b1 4.0 mm and mean needle-To-Target distance was 3.2 \u00b1 2.4 mm. Conclusion: A significant increase in needle placement accuracy was observed when using the 3-D guidance system compared with visual targeting of invisible (virtual) lesions using a standard B-mode ultrasound-guided biopsy technique.", "AuthorKeywords": ["image registration", "Image-guided interventions", "prostate cancer", "tracking", "transrectal biopsy"], "IndexKeywords": ["Electromagnetic tracking", "Equipment manufacturers", "Image-guided Intervention", "Prostate cancers", "Transrectal ultrasound", "Ultrasound guidance", "Ultrasound guided", "Volumetric Imaging", "Endoscopic Ultrasound-Guided Fine Needle Aspiration", "Endosonography", "Equipment Design", "Equipment Failure Analysis", "Humans", "Image Enhancement", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Interventional", "Male", "Phantoms, Imaging", "Prostatic Neoplasms", "Reproducibility of Results", "Sensitivity and Specificity"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85017583807", "SubjectAreas": [["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"]], "AuthorData": {"24512208500": {"Name": "Hu Y.", "AuthorID": "24512208500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Centre for Medical Image Computing, Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "7006920406": {"Name": "Clarkson M.J.", "AuthorID": "7006920406", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Centre for Medical Image Computing, Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "57037694400": {"Name": "Thompson S.A.", "AuthorID": "57037694400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Centre for Medical Image Computing, Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "35464300200": {"Name": "Hawkes D.J.", "AuthorID": "35464300200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Centre for Medical Image Computing, Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "7005201740": {"Name": "Barratt D.C.", "AuthorID": "7005201740", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Centre for Medical Image Computing, Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "35336774700": {"Name": "Kasivisvanathan V.", "AuthorID": "35336774700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Surgical and Interventional Sciences, University College London"}, "37038344200": {"Name": "Simmons L.A.M.", "AuthorID": "37038344200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Surgical and Interventional Sciences, University College London"}, "57114379700": {"Name": "Shah T.T.", "AuthorID": "57114379700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Surgical and Interventional Sciences, University College London"}, "8147855500": {"Name": "Ahmed H.U.", "AuthorID": "8147855500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Surgical and Interventional Sciences, University College London"}, "7004667094": {"Name": "Emberton M.", "AuthorID": "7004667094", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Surgical and Interventional Sciences, University College London"}, "7402982572": {"Name": "Moore C.M.", "AuthorID": "7402982572", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Surgical and Interventional Sciences, University College London"}, "57220423487": {"Name": "Punwani S.", "AuthorID": "57220423487", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Centre for Medical Imaging, Division of Medicine, University College London"}}}
