On page 29, in the subsection Evolution of allele frequencies within a single deme, there was an error in this sentence: Then, we computed the heterozygosity Ht within the deme and compared it with the expected heterozygosity given by the formula (Formula presented.) where H0 is the initial density at time 0. The sentence should have stated \u201c\u2026 where H0 is the initial heterozygosity at time 0.\u201d In the legends of Figures 2 and 4, the text \u201cPairwise FSTwithin\u201d should have been \u201cPairwise genetic distance D within\u201d.
