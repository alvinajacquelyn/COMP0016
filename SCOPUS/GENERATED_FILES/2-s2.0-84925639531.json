Astrocytes normally play a decisive role in mechanical and metabolic support of neurons, but in the spinal cord they cause injury, exerting well-known detrimental effects that contribute to glial scar formation and inhibition of axon outgrowth. Cell transplantation is considered a promising approach for replacing damaged cells and promoting neuroprotective and neuroregenerative repair, but the effects of the grafted cells on local tissue and the regenerative properties of endogenous neural stem cells in the injured spinal cord are largely unknown. During the last 2 decades cumulative evidence from diverse animal models has indicated that reactive astrocytes in synergy with transplanted cells could be beneficial for injury in multiple ways, including neuroprotection and axonal growth. In this review, we specifically focus on the dual opposing roles of reactive astrocytes in SCI and how they contribute to the creation of a permissive environment when combined with transplanted cells as the influential components for a local regenerative niche. Modulation of reactive astrocyte function might represent an extremely attractive new therapy to enhance the functional outcomes in patients.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Glia", "Induced pluripotent stem cells", "Neural differentiation", "Neural stem cell", "Spinal cord injury", "Stem cell transplantation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Astrocytes", "Humans", "Nerve Regeneration", "Spinal Cord Injuries", "Stem Cell Transplantation", "Stem Cells"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84925639531", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Medicine", "BIOC", "1313"], ["Developmental Biology", "BIOC", "1309"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"6506568612": {"Name": "Lukovic D.", "AuthorID": "6506568612", "AffiliationID": "60012334", "AffiliationName": "CABIMER (Centro Andaluz de Biolog\u00eda Molecular y Medicina Regenerativa), Avda.
