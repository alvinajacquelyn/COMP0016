All rights reserved.Extinction is easy to explain in the abstract. It is what happens when a species cannot cope with changed natural selective pressures and mortality begins to consistently outpace recruitment. Depending on the gap, the path to extinction may be long or short, but the history of life shows that most species eventually take it. Again, speaking abstractly, the geologic record reveals more than enough natural selective (environmental) change to explain the frequency of extinction.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85067521637", "SubjectAreas": [["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Social Sciences (all)", "SOCI", "3300"]], "AuthorData": {"7404357977": {"Name": "Klein R.G.", "AuthorID": "7404357977", "AffiliationID": "60029278", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anthropology, University of Chicago"}}}
