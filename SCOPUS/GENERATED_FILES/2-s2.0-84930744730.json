The aim was to establish whether these were being performed in line with recommendations from published guidelines and whether this represented the most cost-effective use of these tests in informing prescribing decisions of the CCR5 antagonist drug, maraviroc. The cost of these assays within the UK was covered by commercial funding until April 2013 which has subsequently been withdrawn. Furthermore, all healthcare settings are under increasing cost constraints and hence establishing the real utility and appropriate use of these tests is of vital importance.", "AuthorKeywords": ["AIDS", "antiretroviral therapy", "CCR5 antagonist", "diagnosis", "Europe", "HIV", "maraviroc", "treatment", "tropism testing"], "IndexKeywords": ["CCR5 Receptor Antagonists", "Cyclohexanes", "DNA, Viral", "Drug Prescriptions", "Female", "Genotype", "HIV Infections", "HIV-1", "Humans", "London", "Male", "Medical Audit", "Practice Patterns, Physicians'", "Retrospective Studies", "RNA, Viral", "Sequence Analysis, DNA", "Triazoles", "Viral Tropism"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84930744730", "SubjectAreas": [["Dermatology", "MEDI", "2708"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"56675542000": {"Name": "Wyatt H.", "AuthorID": "56675542000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Medical School, University College London"}, "56208651900": {"Name": "Herman O.", "AuthorID": "56208651900", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Department of Virology, Royal Free Hospital"}, "9037576800": {"Name": "Macartney M.", "AuthorID": "9037576800", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Department of Virology, Royal Free Hospital"}, "56600502900": {"Name": "Conibear T.", "AuthorID": "56600502900", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Department of Virology, Royal Free Hospital"}, "16303537300": {"Name": "Garcia-Diaz A.", "AuthorID": "16303537300", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Department of Virology, Royal Free Hospital"}, "55434411800": {"Name": "Booth C.", "AuthorID": "55434411800", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Department of Virology, Royal Free Hospital"}, "7102450098": {"Name": "McCormick A.", "AuthorID": "7102450098", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Department of Virology, Royal Free Hospital"}, "14325176900": {"Name": "Irish D.", "AuthorID": "14325176900", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Department of Virology, Royal Free Hospital"}, "7201998521": {"Name": "Webster D.P.", "AuthorID": "7201998521", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Department of HIV Medicine, Royal Free Hospital"}, "7501658889": {"Name": "Smith C.", "AuthorID": "7501658889", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "55574223038": {"Name": "Johnson M.", "AuthorID": "55574223038", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Department of HIV Medicine, Royal Free Hospital"}}}
