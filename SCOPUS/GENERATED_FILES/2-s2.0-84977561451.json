HNF1B was first identified as a disease gene for diabetes (MODY5) in 1997, and its involvement in renal disease was subsequently noted through clinical observations in pedigrees affected by MODY5. Since then, a whole spectrum of associated phenotypes have been reported, including genital malformations, autism, epilepsy, gout, hypomagnesaemia, primary hyperparathyroidism, liver and intestinal abnormalities and a rare form of kidney cancer. The most commonly identified mutation, in approximately 50 % of patients, is an entire gene deletion occurring in the context of a 17q12 chromosomal microdeletion that also includes several other genes. Some of the associated phenotypes, especially the neurologic ones, appear to occur only in the context of this microdeletion and thus may not be directly linked to HNF1B. Here we review the spectrum of associated phenotypes and discuss potential implications for clinical management.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Autism", "Cystic kidney", "Genital malformation", "Gout", "HNF1B", "Hypomagnesemia", "Renal dysplasia", "Renal malformation", "TCF2"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Disease Models, Animal", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 1-beta", "Humans", "Mice, Transgenic", "Mutation", "Phenotype", "Prognosis", "Urogenital Abnormalities"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84977561451", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Nephrology", "MEDI", "2727"]], "AuthorData": {"6602980434": {"Name": "Bockenhauer D.", "AuthorID": "6602980434", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}, "24923458300": {"Name": "Jaureguiberry G.", "AuthorID": "24923458300", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Child Health"}}}
