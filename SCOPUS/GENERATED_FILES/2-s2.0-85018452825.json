We present this unusual case of an embedded ring after an insect bite on the patient's ring finger. The patient had worn the ring for the previous 5 years without removing it and did not report any discomfort or traumatic injury. We discuss this case in the context of previously reported cases of an embedded ring, a rare presentation in itself, highlighting the key differences in both this patient's aetiology and the risk factors associated with the presentation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Digit", "Embedded", "Erosion", "Ring"], "IndexKeywords": ["Female", "Finger Injuries", "Foreign Bodies", "Humans", "Insect Bites and Stings", "Jewelry", "Middle Aged"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85018452825", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Dermatology", "MEDI", "2708"]], "AuthorData": {"57131136400": {"Name": "Langridge B.J.", "AuthorID": "57131136400", "AffiliationID": "60029950", "AffiliationName": "University College London Medical School"}, "36990378700": {"Name": "Ramman S.", "AuthorID": "36990378700", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57213359666": {"Name": "Toft N.J.", "AuthorID": "57213359666", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
