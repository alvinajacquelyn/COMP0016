All rights reserved.Nano-sized, semi-crystalline niobium pentoxide (Nb2O5) was synthesized in a single step via a continuous hydrothermal process. The nanomaterial was characterized using a range of analytical techniques including powder X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy. The \"as-prepared\" Nb2O5 nanomaterial was investigated as negative electrode for a lithium-ion battery and was shown to be stable during electrochemical cycling (98.6 % capacity retention after 800 cycles) and showed promising high rate performance, with a specific capacity of 43 mAh g-1 at an applied current of 10,000 mA g-1 (in the wide potential range of 0.05 to 3 V vs Li/Li+). Scan rate tests were used to investigate the proportion of stored charge from diffusion-limited processes and that from surface effects, which showed that at higher currents, charge storage from the latter was dominant.", "AuthorKeywords": ["anode", "continuous hydrothermal synthesis", "high power", "niobium", "pseudocapacitance"], "IndexKeywords": ["Continuous hydrothermal synthesis", "Diffusion-limited process", "Electrochemical cycling", "High power", "High-rate performance", "Hydrothermal process", "Powder X ray diffraction", "Pseudocapacitance"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84962323691", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"], ["Electrochemistry", "CHEM", "1603"]], "AuthorData": {"55226279200": {"Name": "L\u00fcbke M.", "AuthorID": "55226279200", "AffiliationID": "60030743, 60025710", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Materials Research and Engineering (IMRE), ASTAR (Agency for Science, Technology and Research)"}, "56559457100": {"Name": "Johnson I.", "AuthorID": "56559457100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London, Christopher Ingold Laboratories"}, "6603926697": {"Name": "Darr J.", "AuthorID": "6603926697", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London, Christopher Ingold Laboratories"}, "36005012700": {"Name": "Sumboja A.", "AuthorID": "36005012700", "AffiliationID": "60030743, 60025710", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Materials Research and Engineering (IMRE), ASTAR (Agency for Science, Technology and Research)"}, "55820974500": {"Name": "Liu Z.", "AuthorID": "55820974500", "AffiliationID": "60030743, 60025710", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Materials Research and Engineering (IMRE), ASTAR (Agency for Science, Technology and Research)"}, "13805905800": {"Name": "Brett D.", "AuthorID": "13805905800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electrochemical Innovation Lab, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "24178516700": {"Name": "Shearing P.", "AuthorID": "24178516700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electrochemical Innovation Lab, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}}}
