The reasons for this are not fully understood and it is clear further development is required to realise the flexibility and power of this ionisation method and geometry. Here we report the build of a new AP-TM-MALDI-MSI ion source with plasma ionisation enhancement. This novel ion source is used to analyse a selection of increasingly complex systems from molecular standards to murine brain tissue sections. Significant enhancement of detected ion intensity is observed in both positive and negative ion mode in all systems, with up to 2000 fold increases observed for a range of tissue endogenous species. The substantial improvements conferred by the plasma enhancement are then employed to demonstrate the acquisition of proof of concept tissue images, with high quality spectra obtained down to 10 \u00d7 10 \u03bcm pixel size.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Atmospheric pressure MALDI MS", "Mass spectrometry imaging", "Matrix assisted laser desorption ionisation mass spectrometry", "Plasma assisted ionisation", "Transmission mode MALDI MS"], "IndexKeywords": ["MALDI-MS", "Mass-spectrometry imaging", "Matrix assisted laser desorption", "Molecular standards", "Plasma enhancement", "Plasma ionisation", "Potential benefits", "Pressure transmission", "Animals", "Atmospheric Pressure", "Brain Chemistry", "Equipment Design", "Mice", "Plasma Gases", "Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85056996137", "SubjectAreas": [["Analytical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1602"], ["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Environmental Chemistry", "ENVI", "2304"], ["Spectroscopy", "CHEM", "1607"]], "AuthorData": {"55581190300": {"Name": "Steven R.", "AuthorID": "55581190300", "AffiliationID": "60010785", "AffiliationName": "National Centre of Excellence in Mass Spectrometry Imaging (NiCE-MSI), Analytical Science Division, National Physical Laboratory (NPL)"}, "56878567400": {"Name": "Dexter A.", "AuthorID": "56878567400", "AffiliationID": "60010785", "AffiliationName": "National Centre of Excellence in Mass Spectrometry Imaging (NiCE-MSI), Analytical Science Division, National Physical Laboratory (NPL)"}, "53164472200": {"Name": "Murta T.", "AuthorID": "53164472200", "AffiliationID": "60010785", "AffiliationName": "National Centre of Excellence in Mass Spectrometry Imaging (NiCE-MSI), Analytical Science Division, National Physical Laboratory (NPL)"}, "56247575100": {"Name": "Green F.", "AuthorID": "56247575100", "AffiliationID": "60010785", "AffiliationName": "National Centre of Excellence in Mass Spectrometry Imaging (NiCE-MSI), Analytical Science Division, National Physical Laboratory (NPL)"}, "55857060400": {"Name": "Robinson K.", "AuthorID": "55857060400", "AffiliationID": "60010785", "AffiliationName": "National Centre of Excellence in Mass Spectrometry Imaging (NiCE-MSI), Analytical Science Division, National Physical Laboratory (NPL)"}, "57214510255": {"Name": "Gilmore I.", "AuthorID": "57214510255", "AffiliationID": "60010785", "AffiliationName": "National Centre of Excellence in Mass Spectrometry Imaging (NiCE-MSI), Analytical Science Division, National Physical Laboratory (NPL)"}, "12243335000": {"Name": "Bunch J.", "AuthorID": "12243335000", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Imperial Collage London, Faculty of Medicine, Department of Surgery & Cancer"}, "57169472300": {"Name": "Shaw M.", "AuthorID": "57169472300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Touch Lab, Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "6603799300": {"Name": "Takats Z.", "AuthorID": "6603799300", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Imperial Collage London, Faculty of Medicine, Department of Surgery & Cancer"}}}
