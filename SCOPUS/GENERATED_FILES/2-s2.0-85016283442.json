In this work we investigated the fate of two rhodamine B labeled polymeric nanoparticles (Z-ave <250 nm) of opposite surface charge in different areas of the brain after intranasal administration in rats. A preliminary screening was carried out to select the suitable positive (chitosan/poly-l-lactide-co-glycolide) nanocarrier through photon correlation spectroscopy and turbiscan. Physico-chemical and technological characterizations of poly-l-lactide-co-glycolide (negative) and chitosan/poly-l-lactide-co-glycolide (positive) fluorescent labeled nanoparticles were performed. The animals were allocated to three groups receiving negative and positive polymeric nanoparticles via single intranasal administration or no treatment. The localization of both nanocarriers in different brain areas was detected using fluorescent microscopy. Our data revealed that both nanocarriers reach the brain and are able to persist in the brain up to 48 h after intranasal administration. Surface charge influenced the involved pathways in their translocation from the nasal cavity to the central nervous system. The positive charge of nanoparticles slows down brain reaching and the trigeminal pathway is involved, while the olfactory pathway may be responsible for the transport of negatively charged nanoparticles, and systemic pathways are not excluded.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Brain", "Chitosan", "Fluorescent microscopy", "In vivo study", "Intranasal delivery", "Nanoparticles", "PLGA", "Rats"], "IndexKeywords": ["Central nervous systems", "Fluorescent microscopy", "In-vivo", "Innovative strategies", "Intranasal", "PLGA", "Polymeric nanoparticles", "Technological characterizations", "Administration, Intranasal", "Animals", "Biological Transport", "Brain", "Chitosan", "Drug Carriers", "Fluorescent Dyes", "Male", "Microscopy, Fluorescence", "Nanoparticles", "Nose", "Olfactory Pathways", "Polyglactin 910", "Rats", "Rats, Wistar", "Rhodamines", "Static Electricity"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85016283442", "SubjectAreas": [["Biotechnology", "BIOC", "1305"], ["Surfaces and Interfaces", "PHYS", "3110"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"], ["Colloid and Surface Chemistry", "CENG", "1505"]], "AuthorData": {"57202277156": {"Name": "Bonaccorso A.", "AuthorID": "57202277156", "AffiliationID": "60010146", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Drug Delivery Technology, Department of Drug Science, University of Catania"}, "23135190600": {"Name": "Musumeci T.", "AuthorID": "23135190600", "AffiliationID": "60010146", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Drug Delivery Technology, Department of Drug Science, University of Catania"}, "7005051263": {"Name": "Puglisi G.", "AuthorID": "7005051263", "AffiliationID": "60010146", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Drug Delivery Technology, Department of Drug Science, University of Catania"}, "6602552158": {"Name": "Serapide M.", "AuthorID": "6602552158", "AffiliationID": "60010146", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomedical and Biotechnological Science, University of Catania"}, "55988198300": {"Name": "Pellitteri R.", "AuthorID": "55988198300", "AffiliationID": "60020665, 60021199", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neurological Sciences, CNR, Section of Catania"}, "7004524463": {"Name": "Uchegbu I.", "AuthorID": "7004524463", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL, School of Pharmacy, University College London"}}}
