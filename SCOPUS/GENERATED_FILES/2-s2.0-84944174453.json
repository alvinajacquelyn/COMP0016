To gain insights into isolated/nonsyndromic USH2A retinopathy, we screened USH2A in 186 probands with recessive retinal disease and no hearing complaint in childhood (discovery cohort) and in 84 probands with recessive retinal disease (replication cohort). Detailed phenotyping, including retinal imaging and audiological assessment, was performed in individuals with two likely disease-causing USH2A variants. Further genetic testing, including screening for a deep-intronic disease-causing variant and large deletions/duplications, was performed in those with one likely disease-causing change. Overall, 23 of 186 probands (discovery cohort) were found to harbour two likely disease-causing variants in USH2A. Some of these variants were predominantly associated with nonsyndromic retinal degeneration ('retinal disease-specific'); these included the common c.2276 G>T, p.(Cys759Phe) mutation and five additional variants: c.2802 T>G, p.(Cys934Trp); c.10073 G>A, p.(Cys3358Tyr); c.11156 G>A, p.(Arg3719His); c.12295-3 T>A; and c.12575 G>A, p.(Arg4192His). An allelic hierarchy was observed in the discovery cohort and confirmed in the replication cohort. In nonsyndromic USH2A disease, retinopathy was consistent with retinitis pigmentosa and the audiological phenotype was variable. USH2A retinopathy is a common cause of nonsyndromic recessive retinal degeneration and has a different mutational spectrum to that observed in Usher syndrome. The following model is proposed: the presence of at least one 'retinal disease-specific' USH2A allele in a patient with USH2A-related disease results in the preservation of normal hearing. Careful genotype-phenotype studies such as this will become increasingly important, especially now that high-throughput sequencing is widely used in the clinical setting.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Alleles", "DNA Mutational Analysis", "Exons", "Extracellular Matrix Proteins", "Female", "Genetic Testing", "Genotype", "Humans", "Introns", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Mutation", "Pedigree", "Phenotype", "Retinal Diseases", "Retinitis Pigmentosa", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "Usher Syndromes"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84944174453", "SubjectAreas": [["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Genetics (clinical)", "MEDI", "2716"]], "AuthorData": {"23479778800": {"Name": "Lenassi E.", "AuthorID": "23479778800", "AffiliationID": "60021479", "AffiliationName": "Eye Hospital, University Medical Centre"}, "57089333900": {"Name": "Li Z.", "AuthorID": "57089333900", "AffiliationID": "60024285", "AffiliationName": "Ocular Genetics, Singapore Eye Research Institute"}, "12794101700": {"Name": "Saihan Z.", "AuthorID": "12794101700", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60016691, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, Moorfields Eye Hospital, University College of London"}, "56573251100": {"Name": "Moore A.T.", "AuthorID": "56573251100", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60016691, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, Moorfields Eye Hospital, University College of London"}, "7202946936": {"Name": "Webster A.R.", "AuthorID": "7202946936", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60016691, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, Moorfields Eye Hospital, University College of London"}, "23570185300": {"Name": "Vincent A.", "AuthorID": "23570185300", "AffiliationID": "60030319, 60016849", "AffiliationName": "Hospital for Sick Children, Department of Ophthalmology and Vision Sciences, University of Toronto"}, "34770601700": {"Name": "H\u00e9on E.", "AuthorID": "34770601700", "AffiliationID": "60030319, 60016849", "AffiliationName": "Hospital for Sick Children, Department of Ophthalmology and Vision Sciences, University of Toronto"}, "7005763709": {"Name": "Coffey A.J.", "AuthorID": "7005763709", "AffiliationID": "60005517", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute"}, "7102712349": {"Name": "Steel K.P.", "AuthorID": "7102712349", "AffiliationID": "60005517", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute"}, "54901914500": {"Name": "Steele-Stallard H.B.", "AuthorID": "54901914500", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "7003541560": {"Name": "Bitner-Glindzicz M.", "AuthorID": "7003541560", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "7006701361": {"Name": "Luxon L.M.", "AuthorID": "7006701361", "AffiliationID": "60020736", "AffiliationName": "National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}}}
