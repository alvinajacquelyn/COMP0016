This technique made it possible to assess changes in metabolic activity in clinical applications, such as the study of severe brain injury and disorders of consciousness. Objective: We assessed the possibility of creating functional MRI activity maps, which could estimate the relative levels of activity in FDG-PET cerebral metabolic maps. If no metabolic absolute measures can be extracted, our approach may still be of clinical use in centers without access to FDG-PET. It also overcomes the problem of recognizing individual networks of independent component selection in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) resting state analysis. Methods: We extracted resting state fMRI functional connectivity maps using independent component analysis and combined only components of neuronal origin. To assess neuronality of components a classification based on support vector machine (SVM) was used. We compared the generated maps with the FDG-PET maps in 16 healthy controls, 11 vegetative state/unresponsive wakefulness syndrome patients and four locked-in patients. Results: The results show a significant similarity with \u03c1 = 0.75 \u00b1 0.05 for healthy controls and \u03c1 = 0.58 \u00b1 0.09 for vegetative state/unresponsive wakefulness syndrome patients between the FDG-PET and the fMRI based maps. FDG-PET, fMRI neuronal maps, and the conjunction analysis show decreases in frontoparietal and medial regions in vegetative patients with respect to controls. Subsequent analysis in locked-in syndrome patients produced also consistent maps with healthy controls. Conclusions: The constructed resting state fMRI functional connectivity map points toward the possibility for fMRI resting state to estimate relative levels of activity in a metabolic map.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Disorders of consciousness", "FDG-PET", "fMRI", "ICA", "Metabolism", "Resting state"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Brain", "Brain Mapping", "Consciousness Disorders", "Female", "Fluorodeoxyglucose F18", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Positron-Emission Tomography", "Radiopharmaceuticals", "Rest"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84956780680", "SubjectAreas": [["Behavioral Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2802"]], "AuthorData": {"10640027600": {"Name": "Soddu A.", "AuthorID": "10640027600", "AffiliationID": "60010884", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, Brain and Mind Institute, Western University"}, "7202331220": {"Name": "G\u00f3mez F.", "AuthorID": "7202331220", "AffiliationID": "60104911", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, Universidad Central de Colombia"}, "55376736100": {"Name": "Heine L.", "AuthorID": "55376736100", "AffiliationID": "60000964", "AffiliationName": "GIGA-Research and Cyclotron Research Centre, University of Li\u00e8ge"}, "23492220700": {"Name": "Di Perri C.", "AuthorID": "23492220700", "AffiliationID": "60000964", "AffiliationName": "GIGA-Research and Cyclotron Research Centre, University of Li\u00e8ge"}, "36879853300": {"Name": "Bahri M.A.", "AuthorID": "36879853300", "AffiliationID": "60000964", "AffiliationName": "GIGA-Research and Cyclotron Research Centre, University of Li\u00e8ge"}, "26429255700": {"Name": "Bruno M.A.", "AuthorID": "26429255700", "AffiliationID": "60000964", "AffiliationName": "GIGA-Research and Cyclotron Research Centre, University of Li\u00e8ge"}, "7403135552": {"Name": "Phillips C.", "AuthorID": "7403135552", "AffiliationID": "60000964", "AffiliationName": "GIGA-Research and Cyclotron Research Centre, University of Li\u00e8ge"}, "24467199800": {"Name": "Demertzi A.", "AuthorID": "24467199800", "AffiliationID": "60015622, 60120341", "AffiliationName": "Brain and Spine Institute, Institut du Cerveau et de la Moelle \u00e9pini\u00e8re (ICM), H\u00f4pital Piti\u00e9-Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re"}, "24764550200": {"Name": "Chatelle C.", "AuthorID": "24764550200", "AffiliationID": "60000964", "AffiliationName": "GIGA-Research and Cyclotron Research Centre, University of Li\u00e8ge"}, "37097989200": {"Name": "Schrouff J.", "AuthorID": "37097989200", "AffiliationID": "60000964", "AffiliationName": "GIGA-Research and Cyclotron Research Centre, University of Li\u00e8ge"}, "57195594466": {"Name": "Thibaut A.", "AuthorID": "57195594466", "AffiliationID": "60000964", "AffiliationName": "GIGA-Research and Cyclotron Research Centre, University of Li\u00e8ge"}, "55248279200": {"Name": "Charland-Verville V.", "AuthorID": "55248279200", "AffiliationID": "60000964", "AffiliationName": "GIGA-Research and Cyclotron Research Centre, University of Li\u00e8ge"}, "6507966650": {"Name": "Noirhomme Q.", "AuthorID": "6507966650", "AffiliationID": "60114826", "AffiliationName": "Brain Innovation B.V."}, "7101864276": {"Name": "Salmon E.", "AuthorID": "7101864276", "AffiliationID": "60000964", "AffiliationName": "GIGA-Research and Cyclotron Research Centre, University of Li\u00e8ge"}, "7004546122": {"Name": "Laureys S.", "AuthorID": "7004546122", "AffiliationID": "60016829", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, University Hospital of Li\u00e8ge"}, "7202447133": {"Name": "Voss H.U.", "AuthorID": "7202447133", "AffiliationID": "60007997", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Weill Cornell Medical College"}, "7003678095": {"Name": "Schiff N.D.", "AuthorID": "7003678095", "AffiliationID": "60007997", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Weill Cornell Medical College"}, "22987043300": {"Name": "Vanhaudenhuyse A.", "AuthorID": "22987043300", "AffiliationID": "60016829", "AffiliationName": "Department of Algology and Palliative Care, University Hospital of Li\u00e8ge"}, "24468959500": {"Name": "Tshibanda J.F.L.", "AuthorID": "24468959500", "AffiliationID": "60016829", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, University Hospital of Li\u00e8ge"}}}
