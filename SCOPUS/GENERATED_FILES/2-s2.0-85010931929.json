The optimized plasma-treated HfSe2 field effect transistors showed a high on/off ratio improvement of four orders of magnitude, from 27 to 105, a field effect mobility increase from 2.16 to 3.04 cm2 V-1 s-1, a subthreshold swing improvement from 30.6 to 4.8 V dec-1, and a positive threshold voltage shift between depletion mode and enhancement mode, from -7.02 to 11.5 V. The plasma-treated HfSe2 photodetector also demonstrates a reasonable photoresponsivity from the visible to the near-infrared region of light.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Enhancement modes", "Field-effect mobilities", "Near infrared region", "Orders of magnitude", "Oxygen plasma treatments", "Photoresponsivity", "Subthreshold swing", "Threshold voltage shifts"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85010931929", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"]], "AuthorData": {"56591208300": {"Name": "Kang M.", "AuthorID": "56591208300", "AffiliationID": "60003780", "AffiliationName": "Manufacturing Engineering Team, Memory Division, Samsung Electronics Co."}, "36838604200": {"Name": "Rathi S.", "AuthorID": "36838604200", "AffiliationID": "60007511", "AffiliationName": "College of Information and Communication Engineering, Sungkyunkwan Advanced Institute of Nanotechnology (SAINT), Sungkyunkwan University"}, "35327155100": {"Name": "Lee I.", "AuthorID": "35327155100", "AffiliationID": "60007511", "AffiliationName": "College of Information and Communication Engineering, Sungkyunkwan Advanced Institute of Nanotechnology (SAINT), Sungkyunkwan University"}, "56591829700": {"Name": "Li L.", "AuthorID": "56591829700", "AffiliationID": "60007511", "AffiliationName": "College of Information and Communication Engineering, Sungkyunkwan Advanced Institute of Nanotechnology (SAINT), Sungkyunkwan University"}, "56590942800": {"Name": "Khan M.A.", "AuthorID": "56590942800", "AffiliationID": "60007511", "AffiliationName": "College of Information and Communication Engineering, Sungkyunkwan Advanced Institute of Nanotechnology (SAINT), Sungkyunkwan University"}, "56591421400": {"Name": "Lim D.", "AuthorID": "56591421400", "AffiliationID": "60007511", "AffiliationName": "College of Information and Communication Engineering, Sungkyunkwan Advanced Institute of Nanotechnology (SAINT), Sungkyunkwan University"}, "57157643900": {"Name": "Lee Y.", "AuthorID": "57157643900", "AffiliationID": "60007511", "AffiliationName": "College of Information and Communication Engineering, Sungkyunkwan Advanced Institute of Nanotechnology (SAINT), Sungkyunkwan University"}, "35462113800": {"Name": "Park J.", "AuthorID": "35462113800", "AffiliationID": "60007511", "AffiliationName": "College of Information and Communication Engineering, Sungkyunkwan Advanced Institute of Nanotechnology (SAINT), Sungkyunkwan University"}, "56499702500": {"Name": "Kim G.H.", "AuthorID": "56499702500", "AffiliationID": "60007511", "AffiliationName": "College of Information and Communication Engineering, Sungkyunkwan Advanced Institute of Nanotechnology (SAINT), Sungkyunkwan University"}, "56240222600": {"Name": "Jun C.", "AuthorID": "56240222600", "AffiliationID": "60003780", "AffiliationName": "Manufacturing Engineering Team, Memory Division, Samsung Electronics Co."}, "7202777409": {"Name": "Yun S.J.", "AuthorID": "7202777409", "AffiliationID": "60001558", "AffiliationName": "ICT Components and Materials Technology Research Division, Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute"}, "17436687200": {"Name": "Youn D.H.", "AuthorID": "17436687200", "AffiliationID": "60001558", "AffiliationName": "ICT Components and Materials Technology Research Division, Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute"}}}
