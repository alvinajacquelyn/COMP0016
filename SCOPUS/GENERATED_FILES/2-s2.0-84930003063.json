Since the completion of both the Human Genome Project and the International HapMap project, the development of pharmacogenomics has been greatly facilitated. However, progress in translating pharmacogenomics into clinical practice, especially in paediatric medicine, is unexpectedly slow. Many challenges from different areas remain. This paper discusses the existing applications and the limitations to the implementation of paediatric pharmacogenomics, as well as possible solutions for overcoming these limitations and challenges.", "AuthorKeywords": ["children", "genetic test", "individualized medicine", "pharmacogenomics"], "IndexKeywords": ["Child", "Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System", "Ethics, Medical", "Humans", "Pediatrics", "Pharmaceutical Preparations", "Pharmacogenetics", "Precision Medicine", "Translational Medical Research"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84930003063", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"56108179400": {"Name": "Sing C.", "AuthorID": "56108179400", "AffiliationID": "60006541", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Safe Medication Practice and Research, Department of Pharmacology and Pharmacy, University of Hong Kong"}, "14520953400": {"Name": "Cheung C.", "AuthorID": "14520953400", "AffiliationID": "60006541", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Safe Medication Practice and Research, Department of Pharmacology and Pharmacy, University of Hong Kong"}, "7102513915": {"Name": "Wong I.", "AuthorID": "7102513915", "AffiliationID": "60006541", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Safe Medication Practice and Research, Department of Pharmacology and Pharmacy, University of Hong Kong"}}}
