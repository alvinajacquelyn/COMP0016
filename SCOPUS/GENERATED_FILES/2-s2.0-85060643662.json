European Journal of Cancer Care Published by John Wiley & Sons LtdObjective: Increasing numbers of patients face the psychosocial challenge of a diagnosis of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) caused by human papillomavirus (HPV). We explored the psychosocial impact of an HPV-OSCC diagnosis for patients and their partners. Methods: In-depth interviews were conducted with patients (n = 20) and a subset of their partners (n = 12), identified through medical records at two UK hospitals. Interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed using thematic Framework Analysis. Results: Only 12/20 patients interviewed (and five partners) were aware of their HPV status and the main analysis focused on this sub-sample. In discussing the cause of their cancer, patients and their partners talked about not wanting to know; whether they disclosed the cause of their cancer to others; their reactions to being diagnosed with HPV; the prognosis information they were given and the questions they had about HPV. Most concerns were cancer-related rather than HPV-related, but some patients (n = 3) described feelings of embarrassment and perceived stigma about HPV. Conclusion: Some patients and partners who are told HPV is the cause of their OSCC have questions about HPV and seek further information. Concerns and uncertainties about the sexually transmitted nature of HPV need to be addressed by health professionals.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Attitude to Health", "Disclosure", "Emotions", "Female", "Humans", "Information Seeking Behavior", "Interviews as Topic", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Oropharyngeal Neoplasms", "Papillomavirus Infections", "Patient Education as Topic", "Patient Satisfaction", "Prognosis", "Sexual Partners", "Squamous Cell Carcinoma of Head and Neck", "Stereotyping", "Surveys and Questionnaires"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85060643662", "SubjectAreas": [["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"]], "AuthorData": {"56003410500": {"Name": "Dodd R.", "AuthorID": "56003410500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Behavioural Science and Health, University College London"}, "16300728600": {"Name": "Forster A.", "AuthorID": "16300728600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Behavioural Science and Health, University College London"}, "6508131110": {"Name": "Marlow L.", "AuthorID": "6508131110", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Behavioural Science and Health, University College London"}, "57191898211": {"Name": "Waller J.", "AuthorID": "57191898211", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Behavioural Science and Health, University College London"}}}
