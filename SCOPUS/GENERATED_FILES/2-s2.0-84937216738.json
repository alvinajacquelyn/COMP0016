Patients who do not respond adequately depend on the use of corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive medication, but these may have serious side effects. Clinical observations suggest that ephedrine can diminish, postpone or even prevent the need for immunosuppressive therapy when added to acetylcholinesterase inhibitors or low-dose prednisone. In the Netherlands, ephedrine is not licensed for MG nor is reimbursement guaranteed. MG is a rare condition, and ephedrine might be indicated only in a subset of patients. Thus, randomised controlled trials comparing large groups are difficult to conduct. We, therefore, aim to aggregate data from a small series of n-of-1 trials (also known as single patient trials) to assess the effect of ephedrine as add-on treatment for MG. Methods and analysis: Single-centre, placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomised, multiple crossover n-of-1 studies in 4 adult patients with generalised MG who show inadequate improvement on pyridostigmine and/or immunosuppressive drugs. Each n-of-1 trial has 3 cycles of two 5-day intervention periods. Treatment: 25 mg ephedrine or placebo, twice daily. Main outcome measure: Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis (QMG) test. Statistical analysis: fixed effects linear model for QMG for all patients combined. Secondary outcome measures: Clinical: effects on MG-Composite and MG-Activities of Daily Living (MG-ADL) scales; QMG at individual level; adverse events. Acceptability of trial design: number of patients eligible and enrolled; number of treatment cycles completed; patients' and caregivers' experiences. Ethics and dissemination: This study was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of Leiden University Medical Center, No. P14.108. Results of the trial will be reported in a peer-reviewed publication. Regulatory stakeholders will comment on the suitability of the trial for market authorisation and reimbursement purposes.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Activities of Daily Living", "Adult", "Attitude of Health Personnel", "Attitude to Health", "Central Nervous System Stimulants", "Clinical Protocols", "Cross-Over Studies", "Double-Blind Method", "Ephedrine", "Humans", "Myasthenia Gravis", "Off-Label Use", "Patient Selection", "Prospective Studies", "Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84937216738", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"56515278000": {"Name": "Vrinten C.", "AuthorID": "56515278000", "AffiliationID": "60013243, 60001997", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Genetics, EMGO Institute for Health and Care Research, VU University Medical Center"}, "7006738831": {"Name": "Cornel M.", "AuthorID": "7006738831", "AffiliationID": "60013243, 60001997", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Genetics, EMGO Institute for Health and Care Research, VU University Medical Center"}, "56725461700": {"Name": "Weinreich S.", "AuthorID": "56725461700", "AffiliationID": "60013243, 60001997", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Genetics, EMGO Institute for Health and Care Research, VU University Medical Center"}, "26532870700": {"Name": "Lipka A.", "AuthorID": "26532870700", "AffiliationID": "60015618", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Leiden University Medical Center"}, "7004442654": {"Name": "Verschuuren J.", "AuthorID": "7004442654", "AffiliationID": "60015618", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Leiden University Medical Center"}, "54935415500": {"Name": "Van Zwet E.", "AuthorID": "54935415500", "AffiliationID": "60015618", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Statistics and Bioinformatics, Leiden University Medical Center"}, "7004228582": {"Name": "Schimmel K.", "AuthorID": "7004228582", "AffiliationID": "60015618", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Pharmacy and Toxicology, Leiden University Medical Center"}, "56725271300": {"Name": "Kuijpers M.", "AuthorID": "56725271300", "AffiliationID": "119888344", "AffiliationName": "Department of Care, Section Pharmaceutical Care, National Health Care Institute"}, "7102518222": {"Name": "Hekster Y.", "AuthorID": "7102518222", "AffiliationID": "60002573", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacy, Radboud University Medical Center"}}}
