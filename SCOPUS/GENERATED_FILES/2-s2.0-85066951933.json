Two frequently used incidence assays are the Sedia HIV-1 LAg-Avidity EIA (LAg) and the Bio-Rad avidity incidence (BRAI) assays with a mean duration of recent infection (MDRI) of 130 and 240 days for subtype B infections, respectively. Little is known about how these assays perform with recombinant HIV-1 strains. We evaluated the concordance of these assays in a population infected mainly with HIV-1 CRF06_cpx. Material/Methods Remnant serum samples (n = 288) collected from confirmed, newly-diagnosed HIV-positive persons from Estonia in 2013 were tested. Demographic and clinical data were extracted from clinical databases. LAg was performed according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol and BRAI testing was done using a validated protocol. Samples with LAg-pending or BRAI-invalid results were reclassified as recent if they were from persons with viral loads <1000 copies/mL or were reclassified as long-term if presenting with AIDS. Results In total 325 new HIV infections were diagnosed in 2013 in Estonia. Of those 276 persons were tested with both LAg and BRAI. Using assay results only, the recency rate was 44% and 70% by LAg and BRAI, respectively. The majority of samples (92%) recent by LAg were recent by BRAI. Similarly, 89% of samples long-term by BRAI were long-term by LAg. After clinical information was included in the analysis, the recency rate was 44% and 62% for LAg and BRAI, respectively. The majority of samples (86%) recent by LAg were recent by BRAI and 91% of long-term infections by BRAI were long-term by LAg. Conclusions Comparison of LAg and BRAI results in this mostly CRF06_cpx-infected population showed good concordance for incidence classification. Our finding of a higher recency rate with BRAI in this population is likely related to the longer MDRI for this assay.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Antibody Affinity", "Epitopes", "Estonia", "Female", "HIV Antibodies", "HIV Antigens", "HIV Infections", "HIV Seropositivity", "HIV-1", "Humans", "Incidence", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Reproducibility of Results", "Serologic Tests", "Viral Load"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85066951933", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"26641182700": {"Name": "Huik K.", "AuthorID": "26641182700", "AffiliationID": "60027053, 60006577", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Retrovirology Section, HIV Dynamics and Replication Program, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health"}, "57188715681": {"Name": "Soodla P.", "AuthorID": "57188715681", "AffiliationID": "60068856", "AffiliationName": "Department of Microbiology, Institute of Biomedicine and Translational Medicine, University of Tartu"}, "36519515300": {"Name": "Pauskar M.", "AuthorID": "36519515300", "AffiliationID": "60068856", "AffiliationName": "Department of Microbiology, Institute of Biomedicine and Translational Medicine, University of Tartu"}, "55850874000": {"Name": "J\u00f5geda E.", "AuthorID": "55850874000", "AffiliationID": "60068856", "AffiliationName": "Department of Microbiology, Institute of Biomedicine and Translational Medicine, University of Tartu"}, "55850856100": {"Name": "Kallas E.", "AuthorID": "55850856100", "AffiliationID": "60068856", "AffiliationName": "Department of Microbiology, Institute of Biomedicine and Translational Medicine, University of Tartu"}, "57188718604": {"Name": "Rajasaar H.", "AuthorID": "57188718604", "AffiliationID": "60068856", "AffiliationName": "Department of Microbiology, Institute of Biomedicine and Translational Medicine, University of Tartu"}, "26640967200": {"Name": "Avi R.", "AuthorID": "26640967200", "AffiliationID": "60068856", "AffiliationName": "Department of Microbiology, Institute of Biomedicine and Translational Medicine, University of Tartu"}, "55891721400": {"Name": "Lutsar I.", "AuthorID": "55891721400", "AffiliationID": "60068856", "AffiliationName": "Department of Microbiology, Institute of Biomedicine and Translational Medicine, University of Tartu"}, "52164312300": {"Name": "Michele Owen S.", "AuthorID": "52164312300", "AffiliationID": "60021658", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory Branch, Division of HIV/HIV AIDS Prevention, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"}, "55334103600": {"Name": "Luo W.", "AuthorID": "55334103600", "AffiliationID": "60021658", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory Branch, Division of HIV/HIV AIDS Prevention, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"}, "6603652786": {"Name": "Masciotra S.", "AuthorID": "6603652786", "AffiliationID": "60021658", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory Branch, Division of HIV/HIV AIDS Prevention, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"}, "55415921900": {"Name": "Murphy G.", "AuthorID": "55415921900", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "Virus Reference Department, Public Health England"}, "null": {"Name": null, "AuthorID": null, "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
