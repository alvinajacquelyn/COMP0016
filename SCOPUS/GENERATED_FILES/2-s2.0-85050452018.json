We also investigated whether associations differed by age, gender and caregiving characteristics. Methods Data on 9,421 participants aged 16+ from three waves (2009\u20132012) of the UK Household Longitudinal Study were used. Body mass index, waist circumference and percentage body fat were assessed. Caregiving and caregiving characteristics (hours per week, number of people cared for, co-resident caregiving and combining working and caregiving) was available from the prior wave. Gender-stratified associations between caregiving/caregiving characteristics with adiposity were tested. Covariates included caregiver\u2019s health, socioeconomic position, parenthood and partnerships. Results Caregiving was associated with higher adiposity for women but not men. Younger women caregivers had particularly higher levels of adiposity. Men combining part-time paid work with caregiving had higher levels of adiposity than men working full-time and not caregiving. Women aged 16\u201344 or 65+ had particularly high levels of adiposity when combining full-time work and caregiving, compared to full-time work alone. Conclusion The health of caregivers should be a public health priority, particularly for younger women and those combining paid work with caregiving responsibilities.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adiposity", "Adolescent", "Adult", "Age Factors", "Body Mass Index", "Caregivers", "Employment", "Female", "Humans", "Longitudinal Studies", "Male", "Obesity", "Sex Factors", "United Kingdom", "Waist Circumference", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85050452018", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"54410939600": {"Name": "Lacey R.E.", "AuthorID": "54410939600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "6507035657": {"Name": "McMunn A.", "AuthorID": "6507035657", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "7101663246": {"Name": "Webb E.", "AuthorID": "7101663246", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}}}
