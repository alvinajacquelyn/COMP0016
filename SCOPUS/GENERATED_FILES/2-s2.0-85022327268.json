Nowadays, Ti surfaces can be functionalized in order to provide potentially beneficial additional properties. In this review, we summarize different surface modifications of Ti implants, focusing on biological relevance and the biological issues targeted by each specific approach. We first define the historical relevance of Ti as an implantable material, the osseointegration process, and the main complications related to it before describing the biological rationale which motivates Ti surface modification in implantable devices. Then, we explore a variety of physical and chemical modifications feasible on Ti surfaces. Thereafter, we focus on inorganic and organic coatings being developed for implantable Ti devices that are currently under investigation. Finally, we summarize the surface-modification approaches clinically available or undergoing clinical trials.", "AuthorKeywords": ["bone", "coatings", "implants", "osseointegration", "tissue engineering", "titanium"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85022327268", "SubjectAreas": [["Biomaterials", "MATE", "2502"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"]], "AuthorData": {"23666972700": {"Name": "Civantos A.", "AuthorID": "23666972700", "AffiliationID": "60028902", "AffiliationName": "Polymer Functionalization Group, Institute of Polymer Science and Technology, ICTP-CSIC"}, "57202133769": {"Name": "Mart\u00ednez-Campos E.", "AuthorID": "57202133769", "AffiliationID": "60028902", "AffiliationName": "Polymer Functionalization Group, Institute of Polymer Science and Technology, ICTP-CSIC"}, "7006122909": {"Name": "Ramos V.", "AuthorID": "7006122909", "AffiliationID": "113188834", "AffiliationName": "Noricum S.L., San Sebasti\u00e1n de Los Reyes"}, "7004507412": {"Name": "Elvira C.", "AuthorID": "7004507412", "AffiliationID": "60028902", "AffiliationName": "Polymer Functionalization Group, Institute of Polymer Science and Technology, ICTP-CSIC"}, "7007173412": {"Name": "Gallardo A.", "AuthorID": "7007173412", "AffiliationID": "60028902", "AffiliationName": "Polymer Functionalization Group, Institute of Polymer Science and Technology, ICTP-CSIC"}, "24491769100": {"Name": "Abarrategi A.", "AuthorID": "24491769100", "AffiliationID": "60107285", "AffiliationName": "Haematopoietic Stem Cell Laboratory, Francis Crick Institute"}}}
