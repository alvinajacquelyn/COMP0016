One of the benefits of the model is that it can tolerate inaccuracy in the absorption and scattering distributions that are used in the construction of the forward model to some extent. In this paper, we employ the recently proposed Bayesian approximation error approach to fDOT for compensating for the modeling errors caused by the inaccurately known optical properties of the target in combination with the normalized Born approximation model. The approach is evaluated using a simulated test case with different amount of error in the optical properties. The results show that the Bayesian approximation error approach improves the tolerance of fDOT imaging against modeling errors caused by inaccurately known absorption and scattering of the target.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bayesian methods", "Fluorescence diffuse optical tomography", "Image reconstruction techniques", "Inverse problems", "Tomography"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84958521926", "SubjectAreas": [["Analysis", "MATH", "2603"], ["Modeling and Simulation", "MATH", "2611"], ["Discrete Mathematics and Combinatorics", "MATH", "2607"], ["Control and Optimization", "MATH", "2606"]], "AuthorData": {"37057621700": {"Name": "Mozumder M.", "AuthorID": "37057621700", "AffiliationID": "60103673", "AffiliationName": "Department of Applied Physics, University of Eastern Finland"}, "8283868000": {"Name": "Tarvainen T.", "AuthorID": "8283868000", "AffiliationID": "60103673", "AffiliationName": "Department of Applied Physics, University of Eastern Finland"}, "7005759823": {"Name": "Arridge S.", "AuthorID": "7005759823", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "7005049501": {"Name": "Kaipio J.P.", "AuthorID": "7005049501", "AffiliationID": "60005686", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University of Auckland"}, "57211534054": {"Name": "D'Andrea C.", "AuthorID": "57211534054", "AffiliationID": "60023256, 60102151", "AffiliationName": "Center for Nanoscience and Technology, Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia, Dept of Physics, Politecnico di Milano"}, "6601968005": {"Name": "Kolehmainen V.", "AuthorID": "6601968005", "AffiliationID": "60103673", "AffiliationName": "University of Eastern Finland, Department of Applied Physics"}}}
