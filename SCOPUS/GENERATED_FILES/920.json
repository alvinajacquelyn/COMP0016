Generally, BA10 is thought to contain two or three subregions that subserve broad functions such as multitasking, social cognition, attention, and episodic memory. However, there is a substantial debate about the functional and structural heterogeneity of this large frontal region. Previous connectivity-based parcellation studies have identified two or three subregions in the human frontal pole. Here, we used diffusion tensor imaging to assess structural connectivity of BA10 in 35 healthy subjects and delineated subregions based on this connectivity. This allowed us to determine the correspondence of structurally based subregions with the scheme previously defined functionally. Three subregions could be defined in each subject. However, these three subregions were not spatially consistent between subjects. Therefore, we accepted a solution with two subregions that encompassed the lateral and medial frontal pole. We then examined resting-state functional connectivity of the two subregions and found significant differences between their connectivities. The medial cluster was connected to nodes of the default-mode network, which is implicated in internally focused, self-related thought, and social cognition. The lateral cluster was connected to nodes of the executive control network, associated with directed attention and working memory. These findings support the concept that there are two major anatomical subregions of the frontal pole related to differences in functional connectivity.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Anatomy", "BA10", "Diffusion MRI", "Frontal lobe", "White matter"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Brain Mapping", "Cerebral Cortex", "Cognition", "Diffusion Tensor Imaging", "Female", "Frontal Lobe", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Neural Pathways", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84940601553", "SubjectAreas": [["Anatomy", "MEDI", "2702"], ["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Histology", "MEDI", "2722"]], "AuthorData": {"34973306400": {"Name": "Moayedi M.", "AuthorID": "34973306400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology, University College London"}, "55861346800": {"Name": "Davis K.", "AuthorID": "55861346800", "AffiliationID": "60006377, 60002401, 60014468", "AffiliationName": "Division of Brain, Imaging and Behaviour-Systems Neuroscience, Toronto Western Research Institute, Toronto Western Hospital, University Health Network"}, "6507244605": {"Name": "Salomons T.", "AuthorID": "6507244605", "AffiliationID": "60012197", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology and Clinical Language Science, University of Reading"}, "55888299300": {"Name": "Dunlop K.", "AuthorID": "55888299300", "AffiliationID": "60014468", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, University Health Network"}, "6603105710": {"Name": "Downar J.", "AuthorID": "6603105710", "AffiliationID": "60014468", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, University Health Network"}}}
