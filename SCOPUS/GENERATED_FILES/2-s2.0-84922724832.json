The Euler (or gradient) principle, then, states that the capital to be allocated to each component of the portfolio has to be calculated as an expectation conditional to a rare event, which can be challenging to evaluate in practice. We exploit the copula-dependence within the portfolio risks to design a Sequential Monte Carlo Samplers based estimate to the marginal conditional expectations involved in the problem, showing its efficiency through a series of computational examples.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Capital allocation", "Copula models", "Euler allocation", "Risk management", "Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC)"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84922724832", "SubjectAreas": [["Statistics and Probability", "MATH", "2613"], ["Economics and Econometrics", "ECON", "2002"], ["Statistics, Probability and Uncertainty", "DECI", "1804"]], "AuthorData": {"56515215000": {"Name": "Targino R.", "AuthorID": "56515215000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "55764426800": {"Name": "Peters G.", "AuthorID": "55764426800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "36932735100": {"Name": "Shevchenko P.", "AuthorID": "36932735100", "AffiliationID": "60029470", "AffiliationName": "CSIRO"}}}
