The design is normally based on loads derived from complex computer fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. Dimensioning and design explosion loads for topsides are defined based on probabilistic models of loads, which take into account installation and environmental uncertainties. Design standards and functional specifications from platform operators require that structural safety be implemented and inherent structural robustness documented during the design phase of topsides. This paper presents a reliability-based robustness assessment method for structures designed using accidental limit states to resist hydrocarbon explosion loads. The applicability of the new method is demonstrated by calculation of probability of damage and structural robustness of explosion-resisting walls designed for topsides of offshore platforms.", "AuthorKeywords": ["accidental limit state design", "hydrocarbon explosions", "structural robustness", "structural safety"], "IndexKeywords": ["Accidental limit state", "Computer fluid dynamics", "Environmental uncertainty", "Functional specification", "Robustness assessment", "Structural resistance", "Structural robustness", "Structural safety"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84941181956", "SubjectAreas": [["Ocean Engineering", "ENGI", "2212"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"]], "AuthorData": {"35084878300": {"Name": "Czujko J.", "AuthorID": "35084878300", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Nowatec E&C Co.
