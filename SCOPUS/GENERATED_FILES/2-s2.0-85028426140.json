A configuration interaction calculation is first performed to yield the potential energy curves of the lowest eight singlet and triplet states of CH+. Scattering calculations are then performed to yield vibrationally-resolved electronic excitations to the lowest three bound states, namely the a , A and the b . Electron impact dissociation cross sections are obtained from the assumption that all electronic excitations above the dissociation threshold result in dissociation. Bound states of CH and resonance positions and widths of Feshbach resonances in the e-CH+ system are also calculated at the CH+ equilibrium bond length 2.137 a0.", "AuthorKeywords": ["electron-molecule collisions", "Franck-Condon factors", "impact dissociation", "R-matrix", "resonances"], "IndexKeywords": ["Configuration-interaction calculations", "Electron impact dissociation", "Electron-impact excitation", "Electron-molecule collisions", "Franck-Condon factors", "R matrices", "Resonance positions and widths", "Singlet and triplet state"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85028426140", "SubjectAreas": [["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"]], "AuthorData": {"8708418400": {"Name": "Chakrabarti K.", "AuthorID": "8708418400", "AffiliationID": "60033822", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, Scottish Church College"}, "26530511700": {"Name": "Dora A.", "AuthorID": "26530511700", "AffiliationID": "113404518", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, North Orissa University"}, "57212594531": {"Name": "Ghosh R.", "AuthorID": "57212594531", "AffiliationID": "60000912", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, Indian Institute of Engineering Science and Technology"}, "9234341800": {"Name": "Choudhury B.S.", "AuthorID": "9234341800", "AffiliationID": "60000912", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, Indian Institute of Engineering Science and Technology"}, "7101645601": {"Name": "Tennyson J.", "AuthorID": "7101645601", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}}}
