This article examines Nudge strategies to increase registration as a deceased organ donor among minority ethnic groups based on 22 focus groups that were held with Black and South Asian minority ethnic groups in London, UK. The article identifies ways in which minority ethnic groups\u2019 habitus appears to limit awareness and knowledge of the system of organ donation and shapes attitudes to registration, with the varying influence of faith/culture and trust in the system reflecting differences in prior contexts and experience. This questions a key requirement of Nudge in terms of its libertarian dimension and suggests that focusing on the immediate choice context and neglecting individuals\u2019 prior dispositions may not achieve desired outcomes for socially heterogeneous populations.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Behavioural theory", "choices", "decision-making", "ethnicity", "organ donation", "qualitative"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84938598842", "SubjectAreas": [["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"]], "AuthorData": {"7403025385": {"Name": "Morgan M.", "AuthorID": "7403025385", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "King\u2019s College London"}, "55531638100": {"Name": "Deedat S.", "AuthorID": "55531638100", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "King\u2019s College London"}, "36240503300": {"Name": "Kenten C.", "AuthorID": "36240503300", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "King\u2019s College London"}}}
