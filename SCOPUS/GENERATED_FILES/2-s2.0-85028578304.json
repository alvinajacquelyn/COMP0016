We further categorized individuals with insomnia into different insomnia subgroups to examine whether the risk of anxiety and depression varies by subtype. Methods Participants were identified from National Health Insurance enrollees in Taiwan during 2002\u20132009. The study included 19,273 subjects with insomnia and 38,546 matched subjects without insomnia. All subjects did not have previous diagnosis of insomnia, sleep apnea, anxiety, or depression. Results Compared with non-insomniacs, insomniacs had a higher risk of developing anxiety only [adjusted hazard ratio (HR) = 8.83, 95% CI = 7.59\u201310.27], depression only (adjusted HR = 8.48, 95% CI = 6.92\u201310.39), and both anxiety and depression (adjusted HR = 17.98, 95% CI = 12.65\u201325.56). When breaking down the insomnia subgroups, individuals with a relapse of insomnia (adjusted HR = 10.42\u201326.80) had the highest risk of anxiety only, depression only, and both anxiety and depression, followed by persistent insomnia (adjusted HR = 9.82\u201318.98), then remitted insomnia (adjusted HR = 4.50\u20138.27). All three insomnia subgroups had a greater four-year cumulative incidence rate than the non-insomnia group for anxiety only, depression only, and both anxiety and depression (p < 0.0001). Conclusion Our findings reinforce the clinical predictor role of insomnia in the future onset of anxiety or/and depression. Awareness of insomnia and treatment of insomnia should be recommended at clinics, and patterns of insomnia should be monitored to help treatment and control of subsequent psychiatric disorders. Future research with comprehensive data collection is needed to identify factors that contribute to different insomnia subtypes.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Anxiety", "Depression", "Insomnia", "Longitudinal", "Subtype"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Anxiety", "Depression", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Humans", "Incidence", "Longitudinal Studies", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Proportional Hazards Models", "Retrospective Studies", "Risk Factors", "Sleep Apnea Syndromes", "Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders", "Socioeconomic Factors", "Taiwan", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85028578304", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"55124160100": {"Name": "Chen P.", "AuthorID": "55124160100", "AffiliationID": "60073387, 60012256", "AffiliationName": "Department of Family Medicine, Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital, Kaohsiung Medical University"}, "36113816100": {"Name": "Huang C.", "AuthorID": "36113816100", "AffiliationID": "60011234", "AffiliationName": "Department of Social Work, Chia Nan University of Pharmacy and Science"}, "55251608700": {"Name": "Weng S.", "AuthorID": "55251608700", "AffiliationID": "60012256", "AffiliationName": "Department of Healthcare Administration and Medical Informatics, Kaohsiung Medical University"}, "7405591652": {"Name": "Wu M.", "AuthorID": "7405591652", "AffiliationID": "60011234", "AffiliationName": "Center of General Education, Chia Nan University of Pharmacy and Science"}, "55444526400": {"Name": "Ho C.", "AuthorID": "55444526400", "AffiliationID": "60011234", "AffiliationName": "Department of Hospital and Health Care Administration, Chia Nan University of Pharmacy and Science"}, "56005706800": {"Name": "Wang J.", "AuthorID": "56005706800", "AffiliationID": "60090111", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Research, Chi-Mei Medical Center"}, "9275183000": {"Name": "Hsu Y.", "AuthorID": "9275183000", "AffiliationID": "60011234", "AffiliationName": "Department of Hospital and Health Care Administration, Chia Nan University of Pharmacy and Science"}, "10039894200": {"Name": "Tsai W.", "AuthorID": "10039894200", "AffiliationID": "60012256", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Laboratory Science and Biotechnology, Kaohsiung Medical University"}}}
