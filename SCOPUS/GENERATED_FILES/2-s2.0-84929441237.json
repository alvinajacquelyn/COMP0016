Recently, the way people perceive their travel has been analyzed with transportation-oriented scales of subjective well-being, and particularly the satisfaction with travel scale. However, studies analyzing the link between travel mode choice (i.e., decision utility) and travel satisfaction (i.e., experienced utility) are limited. In this paper we will focus on the relation between mode choice and travel satisfaction for leisure trips (with travel-related attitudes and the built environment as explanatory variables) of study participants in urban and suburban neighborhoods in the city of Ghent, Belgium. It is shown that the built environment and travel-related attitudes\u2014both important explanatory variables of travel mode choice\u2014and mode choice itself affect travel satisfaction. Public transit users perceive their travel most negatively, while active travel results in the highest levels of travel satisfaction. Surprisingly, suburban dwellers perceive their travel more positively than urban dwellers, for all travel modes.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Residential location", "Travel behavior", "Travel mode choice", "Travel satisfaction", "Travel-related attitudes"], "IndexKeywords": ["Residential locations", "Travel behaviors", "Travel mode choices", "Travel satisfaction", "Travel-related attitudes"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84929441237", "SubjectAreas": [["Civil and Structural Engineering", "ENGI", "2205"], ["Development", "SOCI", "3303"], ["Transportation", "SOCI", "3313"]], "AuthorData": {"54787558100": {"Name": "De Vos J.", "AuthorID": "54787558100", "AffiliationID": "60033316", "AffiliationName": "Geography Department, Ghent University"}, "16835690400": {"Name": "Van Acker V.", "AuthorID": "16835690400", "AffiliationID": "60002483", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urban Studies, University of Amsterdam"}, "6602186586": {"Name": "Witlox F.", "AuthorID": "6602186586", "AffiliationID": "60033316", "AffiliationName": "Geography Department, Ghent University"}, "7005183095": {"Name": "Mokhtarian P.L.", "AuthorID": "7005183095", "AffiliationID": "60019647", "AffiliationName": "Civil and Environmental Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology"}, "6603601123": {"Name": "Schwanen T.", "AuthorID": "6603601123", "AffiliationID": "60175816", "AffiliationName": "School of Geography and the Environment, University of Oxford"}}}
