The 2009 L\u2019Aquila earthquake cast a long shadow in terms of the aftermath of the (ultimately unsuccessful) prosecution of members of the National Major Risks Commission for providing misleading information on seismic risk. The trial involved some serious issues of trust in government and science, but it also stimulated the authorities to look more closely at building public warning systems. Recovery solutions applied to L\u2019Aquila were not followed in the aftermath of the later central Apennine earthquakes, which returned to models that had been current in 1980, particularly those involving growth poles. While emergency response remains Italy\u2019s forte, there is little progress in insuring people against natural perils. How to achieve the transition from response to prevention remains a largely unanswered question.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Civil protection", "counter-disaster legislation", "earthquakes", "natural disasters", "post-earthquake reconstruction"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85052579357", "SubjectAreas": [["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"], ["Political Science and International Relations", "SOCI", "3320"]], "AuthorData": {"7402830661": {"Name": "Alexander D.", "AuthorID": "7402830661", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Risk and Disaster Reduction, University College London"}}}
