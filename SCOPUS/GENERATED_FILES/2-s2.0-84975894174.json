This is called region effect and exists in InSAR coherence map. When coherence value is used as a parameter to filter the phase noise, the result will be highly affected by this region effect. In this paper, we propose a new method of filtering InSAR phase noise using a split-window model. The idea of this method is to incorporate several filters into the model. Different filters will be used when dealing with phase noise locates in different coherence regions. The over-filtering or under-filtering caused by the coherence region effect can be eliminated in this method. As an example to demonstrate the superiority of this method, we incorporated an improved Goldstein filter and empirical mode decomposition filter into the current model. They were included to control phase noise level in the low- and high-coherence regions, respectively. The quantitative results obtained using a COnstellation of small Satellites for the Mediterranean basin Observation (COSMO-SkyMed) image pair over Kilauea volcano in Hawaiian demonstrate the advantages of the newly developed split-window model in filtering different types of noise.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Coherence maps", "Current modeling", "Empirical Mode Decomposition", "Interferometric phase", "Interferometric synthetic aperture radars", "Kilauea volcano", "Mediterranean basin", "Quantitative result"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84975894174", "SubjectAreas": [["Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)", "EART", "1901"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"48461511700": {"Name": "Liu G.", "AuthorID": "48461511700", "AffiliationID": "60019499", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of Digital Earth Sciences, Institute of Remote Sensing and Digital Earth, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "55760765100": {"Name": "Song R.", "AuthorID": "55760765100", "AffiliationID": "60027363", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Remote Sensing and Digital Earth, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "56415384100": {"Name": "Guo H.", "AuthorID": "56415384100", "AffiliationID": "60019499", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of Digital Earth Sciences, Institute of Remote Sensing and Digital Earth, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "56498283700": {"Name": "Han C.", "AuthorID": "56498283700", "AffiliationID": "60019499", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of Digital Earth Sciences, Institute of Remote Sensing and Digital Earth, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "6603340841": {"Name": "Perski Z.", "AuthorID": "6603340841", "AffiliationID": "60028049", "AffiliationName": "Polish Geological Institute, National Research Institute"}, "7005113488": {"Name": "Yue H.", "AuthorID": "7005113488", "AffiliationID": "108196888", "AffiliationName": "National Remote Sensing Center of China"}, "16306767500": {"Name": "Fan J.", "AuthorID": "16306767500", "AffiliationID": "112791582", "AffiliationName": "China Aero Geophysical Survey and Remote Sensing Centre for Land and Resources"}}}
