Different concentrations of PCBM were studied in this paper. When a low concentration (5 mg/ml, 10 mg/ml or 15 mg/ml) of PCBM was used, the PCBM-CH3NH3PbI3 transition layer provided efficient electron collection. With the increase of the concentration of PCBM, a thicker PCBM layer was formed in the bulk heterojunction. Such a thick PCBM resulted in rough perovskite morphology and low photo-carrier collection efficiency. SEM images and metallographic microscope images confirmed that the PCBM upper layer gradually covered grain boundaries of perovskite films with the increase of the PCBM concentration. On the other hand, low concentrations of PCBM improved the light absorption and crystallinity of CH3NH3PbI3 films. The PCBM/perovskite heterojunction exhibited a high UV responsivity of 0.18 AW-1 and a response time less than 123 ms. This research provides a way to improve the quality of perovskite films and the performance of perovskite photodetectors.", "AuthorKeywords": ["PCBM-CH3NH3PbI3 heterojunction", "Photodetector", "Solvent engineering", "Stable"], "IndexKeywords": ["Bulk heterojunction", "Electron collections", "Grain-boundary defects", "Heterojunction photodetectors", "Metallographic microscope", "Solution-processed", "Solvent engineering", "Stable"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85044133798", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Biomaterials", "MATE", "2502"], ["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Materials Chemistry", "MATE", "2505"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"55733853200": {"Name": "Wang Y.", "AuthorID": "55733853200", "AffiliationID": "60005465", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Electronic Thin Films and Integrated Devices, School of Optoelectronic Information, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC)"}, "56990540700": {"Name": "Zhang T.", "AuthorID": "56990540700", "AffiliationID": "60005465", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Electronic Thin Films and Integrated Devices, School of Optoelectronic Information, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC)"}, "57219324275": {"Name": "Zhang P.", "AuthorID": "57219324275", "AffiliationID": "60005465", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Electronic Thin Films and Integrated Devices, School of Optoelectronic Information, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC)"}, "57192198429": {"Name": "Liu D.", "AuthorID": "57192198429", "AffiliationID": "60005465", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Electronic Thin Films and Integrated Devices, School of Optoelectronic Information, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC)"}, "57194348444": {"Name": "Ji L.", "AuthorID": "57194348444", "AffiliationID": "60005465", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Electronic Thin Films and Integrated Devices, School of Optoelectronic Information, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC)"}, "57196065167": {"Name": "Chen H.", "AuthorID": "57196065167", "AffiliationID": "60005465", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Electronic Thin Films and Integrated Devices, School of Optoelectronic Information, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC)"}, "57216471973": {"Name": "Chen Z.D.", "AuthorID": "57216471973", "AffiliationID": "60015941", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, Center for Nanoscale Science & Engineering, University of Kentucky"}, "10141185300": {"Name": "Wu J.", "AuthorID": "10141185300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "54079892300": {"Name": "Li S.", "AuthorID": "54079892300", "AffiliationID": "60005465", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Electronic Thin Films and Integrated Devices, School of Optoelectronic Information, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC)"}}}
