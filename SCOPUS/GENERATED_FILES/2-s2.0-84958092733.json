The reactions are performed under mild conditions, employing a small-bite-angle bis-phosphine ligand, allowing for good functional group tolerance with high stereospecificity. Amino aldehydes derived from glycine, alanine, valine, leucine, phenylalanine, isoleucine, serine, tryptophan, methionine, and cysteine were successfully employed, as was an enantiomerically enriched \u03b1-OMTM-aldehyde derived from phenyllactic acid. The synthetic utility of the \u03b1-amino enone products is demonstrated in a short enantioselective synthesis of the natural product sphingosine.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Amino aldehydes", "Chiral aldehyde", "Enantioselective synthesis", "Natural products", "Phosphine ligands", "Protecting group", "Stereospecificity", "Synthetic utility"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84958092733", "SubjectAreas": [["Catalysis", "CENG", "1503"], ["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Colloid and Surface Chemistry", "CENG", "1505"]], "AuthorData": {"37761546900": {"Name": "Hooper J.F.", "AuthorID": "37761546900", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Chemistry Research Laboratory, University of Oxford"}, "57114145700": {"Name": "Seo S.", "AuthorID": "57114145700", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Chemistry Research Laboratory, University of Oxford"}, "25625690400": {"Name": "Truscott F.R.", "AuthorID": "25625690400", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Chemistry Research Laboratory, University of Oxford"}, "57114531400": {"Name": "Neuhaus J.D.", "AuthorID": "57114531400", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Chemistry Research Laboratory, University of Oxford"}, "7102967977": {"Name": "Willis M.C.", "AuthorID": "7102967977", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Chemistry Research Laboratory, University of Oxford"}}}
