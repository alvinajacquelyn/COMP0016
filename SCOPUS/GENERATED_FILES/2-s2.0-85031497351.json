Methods: Fourteen abdominal imaging experts from the European Society of Gastrointestinal and Abdominal Radiology (ESGAR) participated in a consensus meeting, organised according to an adaptation of the RAND-UCLA Appropriateness Method. Two independent (non-voting) Chairs facilitated the meeting. 246 items were scored (comprising 229 items from the previous 2012 consensus and 17 additional items) and classified as \u2018appropriate\u2019 or \u2018inappropriate\u2019 (defined by \u2265 80 % consensus) or uncertain (defined by OpenSPiltSPi 80 % consensus). Results: Consensus was reached for 226 (92 %) of items. From these recommendations regarding hardware, patient preparation, imaging sequences and acquisition, criteria for MR imaging evaluation and reporting structure were constructed. The main additions to the 2012 consensus include recommendations regarding use of diffusion-weighted imaging, criteria for nodal staging and a recommended structured report template. Conclusions: These updated expert consensus recommendations should be used as clinical guidelines for primary staging and restaging of rectal cancer using MRI. Key Points: \u2022 These guidelines present recommendations for staging and reporting of rectal cancer. \u2022 The guidelines were constructed through consensus amongst 14 pelvic imaging experts. \u2022 Consensus was reached by the experts for 92 % of the 246 items discussed. \u2022 Practical guidelines for nodal staging are proposed. \u2022 A structured reporting template is presented.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cancer rectal neoplasms", "Magnetic resonance imaging", "Staging", "Standards", "Structured reporting"], "IndexKeywords": ["Congresses as Topic", "Consensus", "Europe", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Neoplasm Staging", "Radiology", "Rectal Neoplasms", "Societies, Medical"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85031497351", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"6602873920": {"Name": "Beets-Tan R.G.H.", "AuthorID": "6602873920", "AffiliationID": "60015205", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, The Netherlands Cancer Institute"}, "36522132000": {"Name": "Lambregts D.M.J.", "AuthorID": "36522132000", "AffiliationID": "60015205", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, The Netherlands Cancer Institute"}, "36509019100": {"Name": "Maas M.", "AuthorID": "36509019100", "AffiliationID": "60015205", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, The Netherlands Cancer Institute"}, "8540723900": {"Name": "Bipat S.", "AuthorID": "8540723900", "AffiliationID": "60001157", "AffiliationName": "Academic Medical Centre"}, "7102180889": {"Name": "Stoker J.", "AuthorID": "7102180889", "AffiliationID": "60001157", "AffiliationName": "Academic Medical Centre"}, "7003440281": {"Name": "Barbaro B.", "AuthorID": "7003440281", "AffiliationID": "60029431", "AffiliationName": "Catholic University School of Medicine"}, "8569359000": {"Name": "Curvo-Semedo L.", "AuthorID": "8569359000", "AffiliationID": "60019112", "AffiliationName": "Coimbra University Hospitals"}, "7004007185": {"Name": "Fenlon H.M.", "AuthorID": "7004007185", "AffiliationID": "60019449", "AffiliationName": "Mater Misericordiae University Hospital"}, "7003622367": {"Name": "Gollub M.J.", "AuthorID": "7003622367", "AffiliationID": "60009343", "AffiliationName": "Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center"}, "22957891500": {"Name": "Gourtsoyianni S.", "AuthorID": "22957891500", "AffiliationID": "60005518", "AffiliationName": "Guy\u2019s & St Thomas\u2019 NHS FT"}, "55642708000": {"Name": "Halligan S.", "AuthorID": "55642708000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Imaging, University College London"}, "57203543924": {"Name": "Taylor S.A.", "AuthorID": "57203543924", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Imaging, University College London"}, "6602421665": {"Name": "Torkzad M.R.", "AuthorID": "6602421665", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Imaging, University College London"}, "7005592724": {"Name": "Hoeffel C.", "AuthorID": "7005592724", "AffiliationID": "60020540", "AffiliationName": "Reims University Hospital"}, "57221297771": {"Name": "Kim S.H.", "AuthorID": "57221297771", "AffiliationID": "60081368, 60015143", "AffiliationName": "Inje University Haeundae Paik Hospital"}, "18340271400": {"Name": "Laghi A.", "AuthorID": "18340271400", "AffiliationID": "60032350", "AffiliationName": "Sapienza - University of Rome"}, "55484896000": {"Name": "Maier A.", "AuthorID": "55484896000", "AffiliationID": "60011394", "AffiliationName": "Medical University of Vienna"}, "9737184000": {"Name": "Rafaelsen S.R.", "AuthorID": "9737184000", "AffiliationID": "60033419", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Cancer Centre, Vejle Hospital"}, "56781177300": {"Name": "Blomqvist L.", "AuthorID": "56781177300", "AffiliationID": "60019295, 60012311", "AffiliationName": "Karolinska University Hospital and Karolinska Institutet"}}}
