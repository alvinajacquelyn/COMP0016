All rights reserved. No commercial use is permitted unless otherwise expressly granted.Pre-mRNA splicing is an essential process in eukaryotic cells where the transcribed intronic sequences are removed, prior to translation into protein. PRPF31 is a ubiquitously expressed splicing factor, which AIDS in the assembly of the macromolecular spliceosome. Mutations in PRPF31 cause autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa (adRP), a form of retinal degeneration that causes progressive visual impairment. Interestingly, mutations in PRPF31 are non-penetrant, with some mutation carriers being phenotypically unaffected. In this review, the gene organisation, protein structure and biological function of PRPF31 are discussed, and the mechanisms of non-penetrance in PRPF31-associated adRP are discussed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["general", "genetics", "neurodegeneration"], "IndexKeywords": ["Eye Proteins", "Genetic Markers", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Heredity", "Humans", "Mutation", "Penetrance", "Phenotype", "Retina", "Retinitis Pigmentosa", "Vision, Ocular"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85026668664", "SubjectAreas": [["Pathology and Forensic Medicine", "MEDI", "2734"]], "AuthorData": {"35084178400": {"Name": "Rose A.", "AuthorID": "35084178400", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Imperial College"}, "56894640600": {"Name": "Bhattacharya S.", "AuthorID": "56894640600", "AffiliationID": "60013148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genetics, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "57204540167": {"Name": "Luo R.", "AuthorID": "57204540167", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Imperial College"}, "57195267439": {"Name": "Radia U.", "AuthorID": "57195267439", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Imperial College"}}}
