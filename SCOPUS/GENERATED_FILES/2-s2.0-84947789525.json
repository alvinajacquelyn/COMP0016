A conceptual AHA framework proposed by the European Innovation Partnership on Active and Healthy Ageing Reference Site Network includes several items such as functioning (individual capability and underlying body systems), well-being, activities and participation, and diseases (including noncommunicable diseases, frailty, mental and oral health disorders). The instruments proposed to assess the conceptual framework of AHA have common applicability and availability attributes. The approach includes core and optional domains/instruments depending on the needs and the questions. A major common domain is function, as measured by the World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0 (WHODAS 2.0). WHODAS 2.0 can be used across all diseases and healthy individuals. It covers many of the AHA dimensions proposed by the Reference Site network. However, WHODAS 2.0 does not include all dimensions proposed for AHA assessment. The second common domain is health-related quality of life (HRQoL). A report of the AHA questionnaire in the form of a spider net has been proposed to facilitate usual comparisons across individuals and groups of interest.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Active and healthy ageing", "EQ-5D", "Questionnaire", "SF-12", "WHODAS 2.0"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Concept Formation", "Disability Evaluation", "Europe", "Geriatric Assessment", "Humans", "Quality of Life", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "United States"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84947789525", "SubjectAreas": [["Nursing (all)", "NURS", "2900"], ["Health Policy", "MEDI", "2719"], ["Geriatrics and Gerontology", "MEDI", "2717"]], "AuthorData": {"55156315400": {"Name": "Farrell J.", "AuthorID": "55156315400", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety"}, "56463699000": {"Name": "Nogues M.", "AuthorID": "56463699000", "AffiliationID": "114002416", "AffiliationName": "MACVIA-LR, Contre les Maladies Chroniques pour un Vieillissement Actif en Languedoc-Roussillon"}, "null": {"Name": null, "AuthorID": null, "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
