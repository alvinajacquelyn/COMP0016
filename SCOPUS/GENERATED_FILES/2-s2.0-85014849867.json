This paper reports the development of a suite of tools to measure and value community severance, undertaken as a part of the Street Mobility and Network Accessibility research project. The tools include participatory mapping, spatial analysis, a video survey, street audits, a health and neighbourhood mobility survey, and a valuation tool based on a stated preference survey. They were tested in the area around Finchley Road, a busy arterial road in North London. The study found that Finchley Road is an unpleasant place for pedestrians due to high traffic levels, air and noise pollution, and the lack and poor quality of pedestrian crossing facilities. This has a negative impact on the mobility and accessibility of local residents and, to some extent, on their health and wellbeing. The analysis showed coherence between the findings from the different measurement tools applied individually, but also revealed interconnections between factors which contribute to severance, demonstrating that overall the suite is reliable for assessing community severance in urban areas. Overall, the paper provides a multidisciplinary approach to developing standardised methods to measure a negative impact of transport that is still relatively unknown.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Community severance", "Measurement", "Motorisedtraffic", "Pedestrians", "Roads", "Space syntax", "Tools"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85014849867", "SubjectAreas": [["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"], ["Transportation", "SOCI", "3313"], ["Environmental Science (all)", "ENVI", "2300"]], "AuthorData": {"7005836049": {"Name": "Mindell J.S.", "AuthorID": "7005836049", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Health and Social Surveys Research Group, Epidemiology and Public Health, UCL"}, "57189729018": {"Name": "Stockton J.", "AuthorID": "57189729018", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Health and Social Surveys Research Group, Epidemiology and Public Health, UCL"}, "35363010600": {"Name": "Scholes S.", "AuthorID": "35363010600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Health and Social Surveys Research Group, Epidemiology and Public Health, UCL"}, "24079709800": {"Name": "Anciaes P.R.", "AuthorID": "24079709800", "AffiliationID": "60176024", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Transport Studies, Civil, Environmental and Geomatic Engineering, UCL"}, "57208009043": {"Name": "Jones P.", "AuthorID": "57208009043", "AffiliationID": "60176024", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Transport Studies, Civil, Environmental and Geomatic Engineering, UCL"}, "57142297200": {"Name": "Dhanani A.", "AuthorID": "57142297200", "AffiliationID": "60085003", "AffiliationName": "Space Syntax Lab, The Bartlett School of Architecture, UCL"}, "57173841200": {"Name": "Vaughan L.", "AuthorID": "57173841200", "AffiliationID": "60085003", "AffiliationName": "Space Syntax Lab, The Bartlett School of Architecture, UCL"}, "6602429978": {"Name": "Haklay M.", "AuthorID": "6602429978", "AffiliationID": "60176024", "AffiliationName": "Extreme Citizen Science (ExCiteS) Research Group, Civil, Environmental and Geomatic Engineering, UCL"}, "57204340273": {"Name": "Groce N.", "AuthorID": "57204340273", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Leonard Cheshire Disability and Inclusive Development Centre, Epidemiology & Public Health, UCL"}, "null": {"Name": null, "AuthorID": null, "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
