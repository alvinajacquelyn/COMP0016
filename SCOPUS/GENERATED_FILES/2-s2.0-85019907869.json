Recently, remarkable progress has been made, but to date all proposed syntheses account separately for the pyrimidine and purine ribonucleotides; no divergent synthesis from common precursors has been proposed. Moreover, the prebiotic syntheses of pyrimidine and purine nucleotides that have been demonstrated operate under mutually incompatible conditions. Here, we tackle this mutual incompatibility by recognizing that the 8-oxo-purines share an underlying generational parity with the pyrimidine nucleotides. We present a divergent synthesis of pyrimidine and 8-oxo-purine nucleotides starting from a common prebiotic precursor that yields the \u03b2-ribo-stereochemistry found in the sugar phosphate backbone of biological nucleic acids. The generational relationship between pyrimidine and 8-oxo-purine nucleotides suggests that 8-oxo-purine ribonucleotides may have played a key role in primordial nucleic acids prior to the emergence of the canonical nucleotides of biology.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Furans", "Oxazoles", "Pentoses", "Phosphorylation", "Prebiotics", "Purine Nucleotides", "Purines", "Pyrimidines", "Ribonucleotides", "Stereoisomerism", "Sugars", "Thiones"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85019907869", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"37115927200": {"Name": "Stairs S.", "AuthorID": "37115927200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "55165377700": {"Name": "Nikmal A.", "AuthorID": "55165377700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "35486695400": {"Name": "B\u01d4ar D.", "AuthorID": "35486695400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "14631029600": {"Name": "Powner M.", "AuthorID": "14631029600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "57212274950": {"Name": "Zheng S.", "AuthorID": "57212274950", "AffiliationID": "60009982", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, Harvard University"}, "7005554745": {"Name": "Szostak J.", "AuthorID": "7005554745", "AffiliationID": "60029929, 60009470", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Biology, Center for Computational and Integrative Biology, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Massachusetts General Hospital"}}}
