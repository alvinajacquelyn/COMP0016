Methods - A systematic literature review of studies published in the past 8 years reporting periprocedural stroke/death after carotid endarterectomy (CEA) and carotid stenting (CAS) related to the time between qualifying neurological symptoms and intervention was performed. Pooled estimates of periprocedural risk for patients treated within 0 to 48 hours, 0 to 7 days, and 0 to 15 days were derived with proportional meta-analyses and reported separately for patients with stroke and transient ischemic attack as index events. Results - Of 47 studies included, 35 were on CEA, 7 on CAS, and 5 included both procedures. The pooled risk of periprocedural stroke was 3.4% (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.6-4.3) after CEA and 4.8% (95% CI, 2.5-7.8) after CAS performed <15 days; stroke/death rates were 3.8% and 6.9% after CEA and CAS, respectively. Pooled periprocedural stroke risk was 3.3% (95% CI, 2.1-4.6) after CEA and 4.8% (95% CI, 2.5-7.8) after CAS when performed within 0 to 7 days. In hyperacute surgery (<48 hours), periprocedural stroke risk after CEA was 5.3% (95% CI, 2.8-8.4) but with relevant risk differences among patients treated after transient ischemic attack (2.7%; 95% CI, 0.5-6.9) or stroke (8.0%; 95% CI, 4.6-12.2) as index. Conclusions - CEA within 15 days from stroke/transient ischemic attack can be performed with periprocedural stroke risk <3.5%. CAS within the same period may carry a stroke risk of 4.8%. Similar periprocedural risks occur after CEA and CAS performed earlier, within 0 to 7 days. Carotid revascularization can be safely performed within the first week (0-7 days) after symptom onset.", "AuthorKeywords": ["carotid stenosis", "endarterectomy", "meta-analysis", "stents", "stroke"], "IndexKeywords": ["Carotid Stenosis", "Early Medical Intervention", "Endarterectomy, Carotid", "Humans", "Risk Assessment", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84948121678", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"], ["Advanced and Specialized Nursing", "NURS", "2902"]], "AuthorData": {"55816707200": {"Name": "De Rango P.", "AuthorID": "55816707200", "AffiliationID": "109598343", "AffiliationName": "Unit of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery, Department of Surgical and Biomedical Sciences, Hospital S.M.
