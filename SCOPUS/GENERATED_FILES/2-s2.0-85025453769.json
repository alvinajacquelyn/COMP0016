FCANs are used for relatively minor offenses, are issued \u2018on the spot\u2019, and provide an alternative to the time consuming process of arresting an alleged offender and taking them to the police station for processing. Despite their use in NSW for over 20 years, this study is the first to evaluate their impact on crime. Methods: We use data provided by the NSW Bureau of Crime Statistics and Research, and the Australian Bureau of Statistics. We specify a general dynamic panel data model estimated via the Arellano and Bond (Rev Econ Stud 58:277\u2013297, 1991) estimator, specifically the first-differenced twostep generalised method of moments (GMM) estimator. Results: For property crime as a whole, in both the short- and long-run, we find no significant relationship between the use of FCANS and levels of offending. However, when offending rates are disaggregated into 11 sub-categories, we find that in the short-run an increase in the use of FCANs leads to statistically significant decreases in the rate of crime for five of the sub-categories offenses considered (break and enter dwelling; motor vehicle theft; steal from motor vehicle; steal from retail store and; steal from dwelling). The long-run results are largely consistent with the short-run results in terms of their signs and statistical significance, suggesting that the effects persist. Conclusions: The empirical analysis presented in this paper suggests that the use of FCANs is an effective and potentially efficient policing strategy for a subset of property offenses, in that offenders can be processed at lower cost and long-run rates of certain crimes reduced.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Deterrence", "Econometric", "Field Court Attendance Notices", "Modelling", "Offending", "Stealing"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85025453769", "SubjectAreas": [["Pathology and Forensic Medicine", "MEDI", "2734"], ["Law", "SOCI", "3308"]], "AuthorData": {"22941333700": {"Name": "Manning M.", "AuthorID": "22941333700", "AffiliationID": "60008950", "AffiliationName": "ANU Centre for Social Research and Methods, The Australian National University"}, "53163151000": {"Name": "Ambrey C.L.", "AuthorID": "53163151000", "AffiliationID": "60031004", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Social Science Research, University of Queensland"}, "23034397900": {"Name": "Fleming C.M.", "AuthorID": "23034397900", "AffiliationID": "60189515", "AffiliationName": "Griffith Business School"}, "8894355600": {"Name": "Johnson S.D.", "AuthorID": "8894355600", "AffiliationID": "60090044, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Jill Dando Institute of Crime Security Science, University College London"}}}
