A valid method of computing the surface wave excitation efficiency is presented firstly. Then the maximum excitation efficiency and corresponding aperture height as a function of surface reactance is obtained. Even including the reflection wave power, the maximum excitation efficiency can reach \u223c95% when the surface reactance (Xs) is j250\u03c9. These results are useful for selecting a suitable surface reactance Xs and designing a high efficient surface wave aperture transducer.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84953744804", "SubjectAreas": [["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"56404995900": {"Name": "Wan J.", "AuthorID": "56404995900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "56404794400": {"Name": "Wu C.", "AuthorID": "56404794400", "AffiliationID": "112571276", "AffiliationName": "Xi'An Institute of Space Radio Technology"}, "7102473419": {"Name": "Tong K.F.", "AuthorID": "7102473419", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}}}
