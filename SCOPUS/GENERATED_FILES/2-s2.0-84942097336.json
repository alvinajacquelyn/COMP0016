While data from the front line setting suggest bendamustine is superior to melphalan, there is no information defining optimal bendamustine dose in multiply-treated patients. We report a multi-centre randomized two-stage phase 2 trial simultaneously assessing deliverability and activity of two doses of bendamustine (60 mg/m2 vs. 100 mg/m2) days 1 and 8, thalidomide (100 mg) days 1\u201321 and low dose dexamethasone (20 mg) days 1, 8, 15 and 22 of a 28-d cycle. Ninety-four relapsing patients were treated on trial, with a median three prior treatment lines. A pre-planned interim deliverability and activity assessment led to closure of the 100 mg/m2 arm due to excess cytopenias, and led to amendment of entry criteria for cytopenias. Non-haematological toxicities including thromboembolism and neurotoxicity were infrequent. In the 60 mg/m2 arm, treatment was deliverable in 61\u00b71% subjects and the partial response rate was 46\u00b73% in the study eligible population, with 7\u00b75 months progression-free survival. This study demonstrates bendamustine at 60 mg/m2 twice per month with thalidomide and dexamethasone is deliverable for repeated cycles in heavily pre-treated myeloma patients and has substantial clinical activity.", "AuthorKeywords": ["bendamustine", "dosing", "myeloma", "phase 2", "relapsed-refractory"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols", "Dexamethasone", "Disease-Free Survival", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Multiple Myeloma", "Nitrogen Mustard Compounds", "Survival Rate", "Thalidomide"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84942097336", "SubjectAreas": [["Hematology", "MEDI", "2720"]], "AuthorData": {"7004419633": {"Name": "Schey S.", "AuthorID": "7004419633", "AffiliationID": "60021923", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, King's College Hospital"}, "36867911300": {"Name": "Orti G.", "AuthorID": "36867911300", "AffiliationID": "60021923", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, King's College Hospital"}, "57217781287": {"Name": "Brown S.R.", "AuthorID": "57217781287", "AffiliationID": "60023959, 60012070", "AffiliationName": "Leeds Institute of Clinical Trials Research, University of Leeds"}, "56601311800": {"Name": "Tillotson A.L.", "AuthorID": "56601311800", "AffiliationID": "60023959, 60012070", "AffiliationName": "Leeds Institute of Clinical Trials Research, University of Leeds"}, "56601196100": {"Name": "Sherratt D.", "AuthorID": "56601196100", "AffiliationID": "60023959, 60012070", "AffiliationName": "Leeds Institute of Clinical Trials Research, University of Leeds"}, "56601191400": {"Name": "Flanagan L.", "AuthorID": "56601191400", "AffiliationID": "60023959, 60012070", "AffiliationName": "Leeds Institute of Clinical Trials Research, University of Leeds"}, "24306070600": {"Name": "Gregory W.", "AuthorID": "24306070600", "AffiliationID": "60023959, 60012070", "AffiliationName": "Leeds Institute of Clinical Trials Research, University of Leeds"}, "7102064249": {"Name": "Yong K.", "AuthorID": "7102064249", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London Cancer Institute"}, "13205626600": {"Name": "Williams C.", "AuthorID": "13205626600", "AffiliationID": "60025016", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Clinical Haematology, Nottingham University Hospitals"}, "17340387000": {"Name": "Davies F.", "AuthorID": "17340387000", "AffiliationID": "60017166", "AffiliationName": "Haemato-Oncology Unit, Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust"}, "56814258400": {"Name": "Morgan G.", "AuthorID": "56814258400", "AffiliationID": "60017166", "AffiliationName": "Haemato-Oncology Unit, Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7003577472": {"Name": "Cavenagh J.", "AuthorID": "7003577472", "AffiliationID": "60004093", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, St Bartholomew's Hospital"}, "24823929200": {"Name": "Cook G.", "AuthorID": "24823929200", "AffiliationID": "60020454", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, St James's University Hospital"}, "7403191653": {"Name": "Cook M.", "AuthorID": "7403191653", "AffiliationID": "60012191", "AffiliationName": "Queen Elizabeth Hospital"}, "8645054000": {"Name": "Morris C.", "AuthorID": "8645054000", "AffiliationID": "60029738", "AffiliationName": "The Queens University Belfast"}, "6701386105": {"Name": "Cavet J.", "AuthorID": "6701386105", "AffiliationID": "60028784", "AffiliationName": "Haematology and Transplant Unit, Christie NHS Foundation Trust"}, "null": {"Name": null, "AuthorID": null, "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
