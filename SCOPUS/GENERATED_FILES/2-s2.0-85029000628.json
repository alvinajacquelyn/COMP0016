We aimed to assess associations of various forms of psychosocial adversity and cumulative adversity in childhood, with multiple CVD risk factors in mid-life. Methods: Participants were from the MRC National Survey of Health and Development. Childhood psychosocial risk factors were reported prospectively by parents from 1950-1957, and retrospectively by participants at mean age 43 years in 1989. CVD risk factors were assessed at mean age 60-64 years in 2006-2011. Associations of a summary score of total psychosocial adversity and CVD risk in adulthood were assessed. Results: There was no consistent evidence that cumulative psychosocial adversity, nor any specific form of psychosocial adversity in childhood, was associated with CVD risk factors in late adulthood. There was some evidence that parental death in the first 15 years was associated with higher SBP (Beta: 0.23, 95% confidence interval: 0.06 to 0.40, P=0.01) and DBP (Beta: 0.15, 95% confidence interval: -0.01 to 0.32, P=0.07). Conclusions: We found no evidence that exposure to greater psychosocial adversity, or specific forms of psychosocial adversity during childhood is associated with adult CVD risk factors. Further large population studies are needed to clarify whether parental death is associated with higher systolic and diastolic blood pressure.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Adversity", "Cardiovascular disease", "Childhood", "Psychosocial"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cardiovascular Diseases", "Female", "Health Surveys", "Humans", "Life Change Events", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Prospective Studies", "Risk Factors", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85029000628", "SubjectAreas": [["Health Policy", "MEDI", "2719"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"55576669200": {"Name": "Anderson E.L.", "AuthorID": "55576669200", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "School of Social and Community Medicine, University of Bristol, Oakfield House, Oakfield Grove"}, "7102452820": {"Name": "Lawlor D.A.", "AuthorID": "7102452820", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "School of Social and Community Medicine, University of Bristol, Oakfield House, Oakfield Grove"}, "55770838500": {"Name": "Fraser A.", "AuthorID": "55770838500", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "School of Social and Community Medicine, University of Bristol, Oakfield House, Oakfield Grove"}, "14630195700": {"Name": "Howe L.D.", "AuthorID": "14630195700", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "School of Social and Community Medicine, University of Bristol, Oakfield House, Oakfield Grove"}, "55421334900": {"Name": "Caleyachetty R.", "AuthorID": "55421334900", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Applied Health Research, University of Birmingham"}, "7005374676": {"Name": "Stafford M.", "AuthorID": "7005374676", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Unit for Lifelong Health and Ageing, University College London"}, "8329745200": {"Name": "Kuh D.", "AuthorID": "8329745200", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Unit for Lifelong Health and Ageing, University College London"}, "57204025615": {"Name": "Hardy R.", "AuthorID": "57204025615", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Unit for Lifelong Health and Ageing, University College London"}}}
