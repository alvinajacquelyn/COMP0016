However, the open-circuit voltage (Voc) of most cells remains low, and such a high Voc deficit, along with defect spectroscopy studies, suggest that recombination via deep trap states may be a limiting factor. A comprehensive study of all the intrinsic defects in Sb2Se3 is warranted-in this article, we calculate the formation energies and transition levels of these defects using hybrid Density Functional Theory. Our results demonstrate that cation-anion antisite defects have low formation energies, and possess multiple mid-gap transition levels, making them the most likely candidates for previously observed trap states, and possible recombination centres. Suppressing these dominant defects will be crucial for future cell development-thus we also present potential methods to counteract their detrimental effects and allow further improvement in efficiencies.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Antimony selenide", "Defect spectroscopy", "Formation energies", "Hybrid density functional theory", "Optoelectronic properties", "Potential methods", "Recombination centres", "Solar cell efficiencies"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85064969819", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment", "ENER", "2105"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"]], "AuthorData": {"56545348200": {"Name": "Savory C.N.", "AuthorID": "56545348200", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175885", "AffiliationName": "Thomas Young Centre, University College"}, "16647397400": {"Name": "Scanlon D.O.", "AuthorID": "16647397400", "AffiliationID": "60104663", "AffiliationName": "Diamond Light Source Ltd., Diamond House, Harwell Science and Innovation Campus"}}}
