X-ray crystallographic analyses of 2a and 3a have confirmed the stereoisomeric relationship of these products and the regiospecific polyhedral expansion that follows the formal transfer of the hydride to the coordinated alkyne ligand in HOs3(CO)9(\u03bc-C7H4NS)(\u03b72-DEAD). The significant structural differences between the two isomers, as revealed by the solid-state structures, derives from the regiospecific cleavage of one of the three Os-Os bonds in the intermediate alkenyl cluster Os3(CO)9(\u03bc-C7H4NS)(\u03b71-EtO2CCCHCO2Et), which follows hydride transfer to the coordinated alkyne ligand in the pi compound HOs3(CO)9(\u03bc-C7H4NS)(\u03b72-DEAD). Control experiments confirm the reversibility of the reaction leading to the formation of 2a and 3a. Whereas heating either isomer in refluxing THF or benzene affords a binary mixture containing 2a and 3a, thermolysis in refluxing toluene leads to the activation of the alkenyl ligand and formation of the new cluster Os3(CO)9(\u03bc-C7H4NS)(\u03bc3-EtO2CCCH2) (4). 4 was independently synthesized from 1a and ethyl propiolate at room temperature. The computed mechanisms that account for the formation of 2a and 3a are presented, along with the mechanism for the reaction of 1a with ethyl propiolate to give 4.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Alkyne activations", "Control experiments", "Diethyl acetylenedicarboxylate", "Ethyl propiolate", "Hydride transfers", "Solid-state structures", "Structural differences", "X-ray crystallographic analysis"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85031121785", "SubjectAreas": [["Inorganic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1604"]], "AuthorData": {"35759236100": {"Name": "Mahid Uddin K.", "AuthorID": "35759236100", "AffiliationID": "60029276", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Jahangirnagar University"}, "57216229367": {"Name": "Chowdhury M.A.H.", "AuthorID": "57216229367", "AffiliationID": "60029276", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Jahangirnagar University"}, "57196037389": {"Name": "Kamal Hossain M.", "AuthorID": "57196037389", "AffiliationID": "60029276", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Jahangirnagar University"}, "24366466600": {"Name": "Ghosh S.", "AuthorID": "24366466600", "AffiliationID": "60029276", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Jahangirnagar University"}, "7006918410": {"Name": "Kabir S.E.", "AuthorID": "7006918410", "AffiliationID": "60029276", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Jahangirnagar University"}, "7005072839": {"Name": "Tocher D.A.", "AuthorID": "7005072839", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "7103239169": {"Name": "Richmond M.G.", "AuthorID": "7103239169", "AffiliationID": "60024438", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of North Texas"}}}
