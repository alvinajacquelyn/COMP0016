Most existing systems require an interaction with the device, for example they may require the user to input his/her mood state at regular intervals. In this paper we seek to answer whether mobile phones can be used to unobtrusively monitor individuals affected by depressive mood disorders by analyzing only their mobility patterns from GPS traces. In order to get ground-Truth measurements, we have developed a smartphone application that periodically collects the locations of the users and the answers to daily questionnaires that quantify their depressive mood. We demonstrate that there exists a significant correlation between mobility trace characteristics and the depressive moods. Finally, we present the design of models that are able to successfully predict changes in the depressive mood of individuals by analyzing their movements.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Depression", "GPS Traces", "Mobile Sensing", "Spatial Statistics"], "IndexKeywords": ["Depression", "GPS traces", "Individual behavior", "Mobile sensing", "Mobility pattern", "Smart-phone applications", "Spatial statistics", "Unobtrusive monitoring"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84960941653", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"], ["Hardware and Architecture", "COMP", "1708"], ["Software", "COMP", "1712"]], "AuthorData": {"36967933900": {"Name": "Canzian L.", "AuthorID": "36967933900", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "University of Birmingham"}, "9743656700": {"Name": "Musolesi M.", "AuthorID": "9743656700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
