Purpose: To evaluate the comparative efficacy and harms of LTBI treatment regimens aimed at preventing active TB among adults and children. Data Sources: PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science from indexing to 8 May 2017; clinical trial registries; and conference abstracts. No language restrictions were applied. Study Selection: Randomized controlled trials that evaluated human LTBI treatments and recorded at least 1 of 2 prespecified end points (hepatotoxicity and prevention of active TB). Data Extraction: 2 investigators independently extracted data from eligible studies and assessed study quality according to a standard protocol. Data Synthesis: The network meta-analysis of 8 new and 53 previously included studies showed that isoniazid regimens of 6 months (odds ratio [OR], 0.65 [95% credible interval {CrI}, 0.50 to 0.83]) or 12 to 72 months (OR, 0.50 [CrI, 0.41 to 0.62]), rifampicin-only regimens (OR, 0.41 [CrI, 0.19 to 0.85]), rifampicin-isoniazid regimens of 3 to 4 months (OR, 0.53 [CrI, 0.36 to 0.78]), rifampicin-isoniazid-pyrazinamide regimens (OR, 0.35 [CrI, 0.19 to 0.61]), and rifampicin-pyrazinamide regimens (OR, 0.53 [CrI, 0.33 to 0.84]) were efficacious compared with placebo. Evidence existed for efficacy of weekly rifapentine-isoniazid regimens compared with no treatment (OR, 0.36 [CrI, 0.18 to 0.73]). No conclusive evidence showed that HIV status altered treatment efficacy. Limitation: Evidence was sparse for many comparisons and hepatotoxicity outcomes, and risk of bias was high or unknown for many studies. Conclusion: Evidence exists for the efficacy and safety of 6-month isoniazid monotherapy, rifampicin monotherapy, and combination therapies with 3 to 4 months of isoniazid and rifampicin.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Antitubercular Agents", "Chemical and Drug Induced Liver Injury", "Child", "Drug Combinations", "Humans", "Isoniazid", "Latent Tuberculosis", "Network Meta-Analysis", "Pyrazinamide", "Rifampin"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85027445727", "SubjectAreas": [["Internal Medicine", "MEDI", "2724"]], "AuthorData": {"6505927242": {"Name": "Zenner D.", "AuthorID": "6505927242", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "Tuberculosis Section, Respiratory Diseases Department, Public Health England"}, "23024135900": {"Name": "Beer N.", "AuthorID": "23024135900", "AffiliationID": "60014991", "AffiliationName": "European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control"}, "57202571746": {"Name": "Van Der Werf M.J.", "AuthorID": "57202571746", "AffiliationID": "60014991", "AffiliationName": "European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control"}, "15073716700": {"Name": "Harris R.J.", "AuthorID": "15073716700", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "Statistics, Modelling and Bioinformatics Department, Public Health England"}, "55201612700": {"Name": "Stagg H.R.", "AuthorID": "55201612700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Global Health, University College London"}, "57195311478": {"Name": "Lipman M.C.", "AuthorID": "57195311478", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Respiratory Medicine, Department of Medicine, Royal Free London National Health Service Foundation Trust"}}}
