Methods and analysis The study will evaluate the Rapid fFN 10Q System (Hologic, Marlborough, Massachusetts, USA) which quantifies fFN in a vaginal swab. In QUIDS part 2, we will perform a prospective cohort study in at least eight UK consultant-led maternity units, in women with symptoms of preterm labour at 22 +0 to 34 +6 weeks gestation to externally validate a prognostic model developed in QUIDS part 1. The effects of quantitative fFN on anxiety will be assessed, and acceptability of the test and prognostic model will be evaluated in a subgroup of women and clinicians (n=30). The sample size is 1600 women (with estimated 96-192 events of preterm delivery within 7 days of testing). Clinicians will be informed of the qualitative fFN result (positive/negative) but be blinded to quantitative fFN result. Research midwives will collect outcome data from the maternal and neonatal clinical records. The final validated prognostic model will be presented as a mobile or web-based application. Ethics and dissemination The study is funded by the National Institute of Healthcare Research Health Technology Assessment (HTA 14/32/01). It has been approved by the West of Scotland Research Ethics Committee (16/WS/0068).", "AuthorKeywords": ["cervix", "diagnostic test", "fetal fibronectin", "pregnancy", "preterm birth"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Cervix Uteri", "Decision Support Techniques", "Female", "Fibronectins", "Humans", "Infant, Newborn", "Models, Theoretical", "Obstetric Labor, Premature", "Predictive Value of Tests", "Pregnancy", "Premature Birth", "Prognosis", "Prospective Studies", "United Kingdom", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85056994579", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"26021552100": {"Name": "Stock S.J.", "AuthorID": "26021552100", "AffiliationID": "60089711, 60031806", "AffiliationName": "School of Women's and Infants' Health, University of Western Australia"}, "57204764656": {"Name": "Wotherspoon L.M.", "AuthorID": "57204764656", "AffiliationID": "60010973, 60028299, 60027272", "AffiliationName": "Tommy's Centre for Maternal and Fetal Health, University of Edinburgh, MRC Centre for Reproductive Health, Queen's Medical Research Institute"}, "7402489769": {"Name": "Norman J.", "AuthorID": "7402489769", "AffiliationID": "60010973, 60028299, 60027272", "AffiliationName": "Tommy's Centre for Maternal and Fetal Health, University of Edinburgh, MRC Centre for Reproductive Health, Queen's Medical Research Institute"}, "25959861600": {"Name": "Boyd K.A.", "AuthorID": "25959861600", "AffiliationID": "60001490", "AffiliationName": "Health Economics and Health Technology Assessment, Institute of Health and Wellbeing, University of Glasgow"}, "16053411900": {"Name": "Morris R.K.", "AuthorID": "16053411900", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "School of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Birmingham"}, "57204760804": {"Name": "Hodgetts Morton V.", "AuthorID": "57204760804", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "School of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Birmingham"}, "12243276900": {"Name": "Dorling J.", "AuthorID": "12243276900", "AffiliationID": "60030816", "AffiliationName": "Neonatal Unit, Queen's Medical Centre"}, "57220617020": {"Name": "Jackson L.", "AuthorID": "57220617020", "AffiliationID": "60190225", "AffiliationName": "Neonatal Unit, Royal Hospital for Children Glasgow"}, "15062452200": {"Name": "Chandiramani M.", "AuthorID": "15062452200", "AffiliationID": "60018662, 60111785", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery and Cancer, Reproductive Biology, Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, Queen Charlotte's and Chelsea Hospital"}, "7402605276": {"Name": "David A.L.", "AuthorID": "7402605276", "AffiliationID": "60029950", "AffiliationName": "University College London Medical School London"}, "24833485700": {"Name": "Khalil A.", "AuthorID": "24833485700", "AffiliationID": "60029329", "AffiliationName": "St. George's Medical School, University of London"}, "35378370800": {"Name": "Shennan A.", "AuthorID": "35378370800", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Maternal and Fetal Research Unit, King's College London"}, "7004073834": {"Name": "Lavender T.", "AuthorID": "7004073834", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "School of Nursing, Midwifery and Social Work, University of Manchester"}, "57204348002": {"Name": "Khan K.", "AuthorID": "57204348002", "AffiliationID": "60022109", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Primary Care and Public Health, Queen Mary University of London"}, "57204758959": {"Name": "Harper-Clarke S.", "AuthorID": "57204758959", "AffiliationID": "121671574", "AffiliationName": "Patient and Public Involvement Representative"}, "35885117500": {"Name": "Mol B.", "AuthorID": "35885117500", "AffiliationID": "60019578", "AffiliationName": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Monash University"}, "57202407113": {"Name": "Riley R.D.", "AuthorID": "57202407113", "AffiliationID": "60030210", "AffiliationName": "Research Institute for Primary Care and Health Sciences, Keele University"}, "57204092626": {"Name": "Norrie J.", "AuthorID": "57204092626", "AffiliationID": "60110825, 60027272", "AffiliationName": "Edinburgh Clinical Trials Unit, University of Edinburgh"}}}
