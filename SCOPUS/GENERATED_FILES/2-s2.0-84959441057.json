However, the complexity, diversity, and in-creasing number of digital appliances in ubiquitous com-puting ecologies make it increasingly difficult to: (1) dis-cover which appliances are controllable; (2) select a par-ticular appliance from the large number available; (3) view information about its status; and (4) control the ap-pliance in a pertinent manner. To mitigate these problems we contribute proxemic-aware controls, which exploit the spatial relationships between a person's handheld de-vice and all surrounding appliances to create a dynamic appliance control interface. Specifically, a person can discover and select an appliance by the way one orients a mobile device around the room, and then progressively view the appliance's status and control its features in in-creasing detail by simply moving towards it. We illus-trate proxemic-aware controls of assorted appliances through various scenarios. We then provide a generalized conceptual framework that informs future designs of proxemic-aware controls.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Control of appliances", "Mobile interaction", "Proxemic-inter-action", "Ubiquitous computing"], "IndexKeywords": ["Appliance controls", "Conceptual frameworks", "Future designs", "Handhelds", "Mobile interaction", "Proxemic-inter-action", "Spatial relationships"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84959441057", "SubjectAreas": [["Information Systems", "COMP", "1710"], ["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"], ["Human-Computer Interaction", "COMP", "1709"]], "AuthorData": {"54795447600": {"Name": "Ledo D.", "AuthorID": "54795447600", "AffiliationID": "60002306", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University of Calgary"}, "7402294419": {"Name": "Greenberg S.", "AuthorID": "7402294419", "AffiliationID": "60002306", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University of Calgary"}, "55921115600": {"Name": "Marquardt N.", "AuthorID": "55921115600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Interaction Centre, University College London"}, "18233691700": {"Name": "Boring S.", "AuthorID": "18233691700", "AffiliationID": "60030840", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University of Copenhagen"}}}
