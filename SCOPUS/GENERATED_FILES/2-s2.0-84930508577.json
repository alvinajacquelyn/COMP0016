All rights reserved.Background. Corticosteroid withdrawal (CW) after pediatric kidney transplantation potentially improves growth while avoiding metabolic and other adverse events. We have recently reported the results of a 196 subject randomized controlled trial comparing early CW (tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), daclizumab, and corticosteroids until day 4) with tacrolimus, MMF, and corticosteroid continuation (CC). At 6 months, CW subjects showed better growth with no adverse impact on acute rejection or graft survival (Am J Transplant 2010; 10: 828-836). This 2-year investigator-driven follow-up study aimed to determine whether improved growth persisted in the longer term. Methods. Data regarding growth, graft outcomes and adverse events were collected at 1 year (113 patients) and 2 years (106 patients) after transplantation. The primary endpoint, longitudinal growth calculated as delta height standard deviation score, was analyzed using a mixed model repeated measures model. Results. Corticosteroid withdrawal subjects grew better at 1 year (difference in adjusted mean change, 0.25; 95% confidence interval, 0.10, 0.40; P = 0.001). At 2 years, growth remained numerically better in CW subjects (0.20 (-0.01, 0.41); P = 0.06), and significantly better in prepubertal subjects (0.50 (0.16, 0.84); P = 0.004). Bacterial and viral infection was significantly more common in CW subjects at 1 year only. Corticosteroid withdrawal and CC subjects received similar exposure to both tacrolimus and MMF at 1 and 2 years. No significant difference in patient or graft survival, rejection, estimated glomerular filtration rate, or other adverse events was detected. Conclusion. Early CW effectively and safely improves growth up to 2 years after transplantation, particularly in prepubertal children.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adrenal Cortex Hormones", "Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized", "Child", "Child Development", "Child, Preschool", "Drug Administration Schedule", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Graft Rejection", "Graft Survival", "Humans", "Immunoglobulin G", "Immunosuppressive Agents", "Kidney Transplantation", "Male", "Mycophenolic Acid", "Tacrolimus"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84930508577", "SubjectAreas": [["Transplantation", "MEDI", "2747"]], "AuthorData": {"7102172274": {"Name": "Webb N.J.A.", "AuthorID": "7102172274", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Human Development, Faculty of Medical and Human Sciences, University of Manchester"}, "56670817200": {"Name": "Douglas S.E.", "AuthorID": "56670817200", "AffiliationID": "60023969, 60120605", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Nephrology, Royal Manchester Children's Hospital, Central Manchester University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "56671328400": {"Name": "Rajai A.", "AuthorID": "56671328400", "AffiliationID": "60120605, 60111801", "AffiliationName": "Research and Innovation Department, Central Manchester University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Manchester Academic Health Science Centre"}, "55598352100": {"Name": "Roberts S.A.", "AuthorID": "55598352100", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Biostatistics, University of Manchester"}, "13606275800": {"Name": "Grenda R.", "AuthorID": "13606275800", "AffiliationID": "60087496", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nephrology, Kidney Transplantation and Hypertension, Children's Memorial Health Institute"}, "8889557300": {"Name": "Marks S.D.", "AuthorID": "8889557300", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Nephrology, Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "7403384021": {"Name": "Watson A.R.", "AuthorID": "7403384021", "AffiliationID": "60025016", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Nephrology, Nottingham University Hospitals"}, "16149985100": {"Name": "Fitzpatrick M.", "AuthorID": "16149985100", "AffiliationID": "60006866", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Nephrology, Leeds General Infirmary"}, "6603032157": {"Name": "Vondrak K.", "AuthorID": "6603032157", "AffiliationID": "60023469", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Nephrology, University Hospital Motol"}, "7004204704": {"Name": "Maxwell H.", "AuthorID": "7004204704", "AffiliationID": "60003355", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Nephrology, Royal Hospital for Sick Children"}, "7004140030": {"Name": "Jaray J.", "AuthorID": "7004140030", "AffiliationID": "60026261", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Nephrology, Semmelweis University of Medicine"}, "55663640100": {"Name": "Van Damme-Lombaerts R.", "AuthorID": "55663640100", "AffiliationID": "60031069, 60025063", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatric Nephrology, Universitair Ziekenhuis KU Leuven"}, "7007173212": {"Name": "Milford D.V.", "AuthorID": "7007173212", "AffiliationID": "60022357", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Nephrology, Birmingham Children's Hospital"}, "16177650300": {"Name": "Godefroid N.", "AuthorID": "16177650300", "AffiliationID": "60012936, 60000874", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatrics, Cliniques Universitaires Saint-Luc, Universit\u00e9 Catholique de Louvain Medical School"}, "7101626043": {"Name": "Cochat P.", "AuthorID": "7101626043", "AffiliationID": "106405753", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatric Nephrology, Hopital Femme Mere Enfant"}, "6701405351": {"Name": "Ognjanovic M.", "AuthorID": "6701405351", "AffiliationID": "60024240", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Nephrology, Royal Victoria Infirmary, Newcastle Upon Tyne, United Kingdom."}, "57194130714": {"Name": "Murer L.", "AuthorID": "57194130714", "AffiliationID": "60027298", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatrics, Azienda Ospedaliera di Padova"}, "7102869548": {"Name": "McCulloch M.", "AuthorID": "7102869548", "AffiliationID": "60013264", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatric Nephrology, Red Cross Children's Hospital"}, "7005057465": {"Name": "T\u00f6nshoff B.", "AuthorID": "7005057465", "AffiliationID": "60003280", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatrics i, University Children's Hospital"}}}
