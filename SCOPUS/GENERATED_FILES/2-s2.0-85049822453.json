All rights reserved.This chapter provides an overview of recent twin and molecular genetic studies that have the potential to inform a model of developmental vulnerability to adult psychopathy and offending. Antisocial behavior is associated with substantial social and economic costs. Individuals with psychopathic traits are particularly prone to violent behavior, which can cause severe harm and significant emotional distress. Callous-unemotional traits can distinguish a subgroup of youths with conduct problems who show a more severe and stable pattern of antisocial behavior. The genetic factors account for stability of callous-unemotional traits across development. The genetic factors are important in explaining the covariance between callous-unemotional traits and antisocial behavior. Youths with antisocial behavior and callous-unemotional traits could respond to interventions in a different way than youths with antisocial behavior without callous-unemotional traits given distinct patterns of etiological vulnerability - more research is needed to identify the environmental components that may lead to substantial change in youth callous-unemotional traits.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Adult psychopathy", "Antisocial behavior", "Callous-unemotional traits", "Developmental vulnerability", "Emotional distress", "Psychopathic traits"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85049822453", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychology (all)", "PSYC", "3200"]], "AuthorData": {"23977946500": {"Name": "Fontaine N.", "AuthorID": "23977946500", "AffiliationID": "60009507", "AffiliationName": "School of Criminology, Universit\u00e9 deMontr\u00e9al"}, "6602910723": {"Name": "Mccrory E.", "AuthorID": "6602910723", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychology and Language Sciences, University College London"}, "23091807800": {"Name": "Viding E.", "AuthorID": "23091807800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychology and Language Sciences, University College London"}}}
