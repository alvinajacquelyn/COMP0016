Methods Systematic literature review and network meta-analyses (NMA) conducted on 24 week efficacy and safety outcomes: Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index, modified total sharp score (mTSS, including 52 weeks), American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 20/50/70, European League Against Rheumatism Disease Activity Score 28-joint count erythrocyte sedimentation rate (DAS28)<2.6; serious infections/serious adverse events (including 52 weeks). Results 53 trials were selected for NMA. csDMARD-IR: Sarilumab 200 mg+csDMARDs and 150 mg+csDMARDs were superior versus placebo+csDMARDs on all outcomes. Against most targeted DMARDs, sarilumab 200 mg showed no statistically significant differences, except superiority to baricitinib 2 mg, tofacitinib and certolizumab on 24 week mTSS. Sarilumab 150 mg was similar to all targeted DMARDs. TNFi-IR: Sarilumab 200 mg was similar to abatacept, golimumab, tocilizumab 4 mg and 8 mg/kg intravenously and rituximab on ACR20/50/70, superior to baricitinib 2 mg on ACR50 and DAS28<2.6 and to abatacept, golimumab, tocilizumab 4 mg/kg intravenously and rituximab on DAS28<2.6. Sarilumab 150 mg was similar to targeted DMARDs but superior to baricitinib 2 mg and rituximab on DAS28<2.6 and inferior to tocilizumab 8 mg on ACR20 and DAS28<2.6. Serious adverse events, including serious infections, appeared similar for sarilumab versus comparators. Conclusions Results suggest that in csDMARD-IR and TNFi-IR (a smaller network), sarilumab+csDMARD had superior efficacy and similar safety versus placebo+csDMARDs and at least similar efficacy and safety versus other targeted DMARDs+csDMARDs.", "AuthorKeywords": ["biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs", "network meta-analysis", "rheumatoid arthritis", "sarilumab"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85061924045", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Rheumatology", "MEDI", "2745"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"]], "AuthorData": {"7005149637": {"Name": "Choy E.", "AuthorID": "7005149637", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity, Cardiff University"}, "57204674407": {"Name": "Freemantle N.", "AuthorID": "57204674407", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Clinical Trials and Methodology, University College London"}, "57196119145": {"Name": "Proudfoot C.", "AuthorID": "57196119145", "AffiliationID": "122193271", "AffiliationName": "Health Economics and Outcomes Research"}, "57191043727": {"Name": "Chen C.I.", "AuthorID": "57191043727", "AffiliationID": "60023187", "AffiliationName": "Health Economics and Outcomes Research, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc"}, "23568159200": {"Name": "Kuznik A.", "AuthorID": "23568159200", "AffiliationID": "60023187", "AffiliationName": "Health Economics and Outcomes Research, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc"}, "36873239300": {"Name": "Pollissard L.", "AuthorID": "36873239300", "AffiliationID": "60010850", "AffiliationName": "Global Health Economics and Value Assessment, Sanofi France"}, "26661844900": {"Name": "Carita P.", "AuthorID": "26661844900", "AffiliationID": "60010850", "AffiliationName": "Global Health Economics and Value Assessment, Sanofi France"}, "57193489702": {"Name": "Van Hoogstraten H.", "AuthorID": "57193489702", "AffiliationID": "60010850", "AffiliationName": "Global Medical Affairs, I and i Sanofi"}, "56340745200": {"Name": "Mangan E.", "AuthorID": "56340745200", "AffiliationID": "60023187", "AffiliationName": "Medical Affairs, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc"}, "57206730568": {"Name": "Huynh T.M.T.", "AuthorID": "57206730568", "AffiliationID": "60010850", "AffiliationName": "Real World Evidence and Clinical Outcome Generation, Sanofi France"}}}
