The functional implications of contralesional M1 recruitment to date remain a matter of debate. We here assessed the role of contralesional M1 in 12 patients recovering from a first-ever stroke using online transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS): Short bursts of TMS were administered over contralesional M1 or a control site (occipital vertex) while patients performed different motor tasks with their stroke-affected hand. In the early subacute phase (1\u20132 weeks post-stroke), we observed significant improvements in maximum finger tapping frequency when interfering with contralesional M1, while maximum grip strength and speeded movement initiation remained unaffected. After > 3 months of motor recovery, disruption of contralesional M1 activity did not interfere with performance in any of the three tasks, similar to what we observed in healthy controls. In patients with mild to moderate motor deficits, contralesional M1 has a task- and time-specific negative influence on motor performance of the stroke-affected hand. Our results help to explain previous contradicting findings on the role of contralesional M1 in recovery of function.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Brain stimulation", "Cortical plasticity", "Motor control", "Motor reorganization"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Female", "Functional Laterality", "Hand", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Motor Activity", "Motor Cortex", "Recovery of Function", "Stroke", "Stroke Rehabilitation", "Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85026540414", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"], ["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"]], "AuthorData": {"55598427000": {"Name": "Volz L.J.", "AuthorID": "55598427000", "AffiliationID": "60029241", "AffiliationName": "SAGE Center for the Study of the Mind, University of California"}, "57196489733": {"Name": "Vollmer M.", "AuthorID": "57196489733", "AffiliationID": "60008658", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, University Hospital Cologne"}, "55314338300": {"Name": "Michely J.", "AuthorID": "55314338300", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60084279", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, University College London"}, "7202767717": {"Name": "Fink G.R.", "AuthorID": "7202767717", "AffiliationID": "60007774", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Neuroscience and Medicine (INM-3), Research Center J\u00fclich"}, "6602258560": {"Name": "Grefkes C.", "AuthorID": "6602258560", "AffiliationID": "60007774", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Neuroscience and Medicine (INM-3), Research Center J\u00fclich"}, "55455767400": {"Name": "Rothwell J.C.", "AuthorID": "55455767400", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Sobell Department of Motor Neuroscience and Movement Disorders, UCL Institute of Neurology"}}}
