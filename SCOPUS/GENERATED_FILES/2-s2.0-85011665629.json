We assessed the risk of future sICH in patients presenting to our comprehensive stroke service with acute non-traumatic cSAH due to suspected CAA, between 2011 and 2016. We conducted a systematic search and pooled analysis including our cohort and other published studies including similar cohorts. Our hospital cohort included 20 patients (mean age 69 years; 60% male); 12 (60%) had probable CAA, and 6 (30%) had possible CAA according to the modified Boston criteria; two did not meet CAA criteria because of age <55 years, but were judged likely to be due to CAA. Fourteen patients (70%) had cortical superficial siderosis; 12 (60%) had cerebral microbleeds. Over a mean follow-up period of 19 months, 2 patients (9%) suffered sICH, both with probable CAA (annual sICH risk for probable CAA 8%). In a pooled analysis including our cohort and eight other studies (n = 172), the overall sICH rate per patient-year was 16% (95% CI 11\u201324%). In those with probable CAA (n = 104), the sICH rate per patient-year was 19% (95% CI 13\u201327%), compared to 7% (95% CI 3\u201315%) for those without probable CAA (n = 72). Patients with acute cSAH associated with suspected CAA are at high risk of future sICH (16% per patient-year); probable CAA might carry the highest risk.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cerebral amyloid angiopathy", "Intracerebral haemorrhage", "Non-traumatic convexity/convexial/cortical subarachnoid haemorrhage", "Stroke", "Superficial siderosis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy", "Cerebral Hemorrhage", "Cohort Studies", "Female", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Meta-Analysis as Topic", "Middle Aged", "Siderosis", "Tomography Scanners, X-Ray Computed"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85011665629", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"57202955229": {"Name": "Wilson D.", "AuthorID": "57202955229", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Stroke Research Centre, UCL Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "57105716400": {"Name": "Hostettler I.", "AuthorID": "57105716400", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Stroke Research Centre, UCL Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "57130290000": {"Name": "Banerjee G.", "AuthorID": "57130290000", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Stroke Research Centre, UCL Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "6603707621": {"Name": "Werring D.", "AuthorID": "6603707621", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Stroke Research Centre, UCL Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "7003730066": {"Name": "Ambler G.", "AuthorID": "7003730066", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Statistical Science, UCL"}, "26642970600": {"Name": "J\u00e4ger H.", "AuthorID": "26642970600", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Neuroradiological Academic Unit, Department of Brain Repair and Rehabilitation, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}}}
