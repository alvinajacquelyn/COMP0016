Data from 26 English learners of French (aged 10\u201311) were collected across three times points over a 12-month period. The study employed the use of lesson observations, along with questionnaires and focus group interviews to examine the development of attitudes and motivation. To measure linguistic progression an oral role play task, an oral photo description task, and a free writing task were administered at each time point. The results show that an abrupt shift in pedagogy may negatively influence learner attitudes and motivation in early secondary and, while early language learning does appear to generate positive attitudes to language learning, questions remain as to its effectiveness over the longer term when learners encounter language teaching that appears incongruous with their aims. Learners did make significant linguistic progress across the transition phase as measured by objective and fine-grained measures, which raises the question as to whether it may in fact be assessment practices that account for the reported \u2018hiatus\u2019 in progression across transition rather than lack of actual progress.", "AuthorKeywords": ["early language learning", "modern foreign languages", "primary languages", "Transition"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85026265716", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"]], "AuthorData": {"57188816615": {"Name": "Courtney L.", "AuthorID": "57188816615", "AffiliationID": "60012197", "AffiliationName": "University of Reading"}}}
