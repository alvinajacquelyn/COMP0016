The catalysts were found to promote the generation of an active methylene from the enamine-based portion of the oxazine, which was followed by a nucleophilic attack on the aldehyde functionality of the coumarin reagent. In the resulting system, the emission of the conjugated fluorophore can be observed at 670 nm and, thus, the processes occurring at the catalyst surface can be monitored in real time by total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM).", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Aprotic solvents", "Catalyst surfaces", "Heterogeneous acid catalysts", "In-situ condensations", "Niobium phosphates", "Nucleophilic attack", "Switchable", "Total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84916212223", "SubjectAreas": [["Catalysis", "CENG", "1503"]], "AuthorData": {"22334402400": {"Name": "Impellizzeri S.", "AuthorID": "22334402400", "AffiliationID": "60193400, 60028897", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Centre for Catalysis Research and Innovation, University of Ottawa"}, "56165707700": {"Name": "Simoncelli S.", "AuthorID": "56165707700", "AffiliationID": "60001563", "AffiliationName": "Departamento de Qu\u00edmica Inorg\u00e1nica, Anal\u00edtica, Y Qu\u00edmica F\u00edsica, Facultad de Ciencias Exactas Y Naturales, Universidad de Buenos Aires"}, "26432568100": {"Name": "Fasciani C.", "AuthorID": "26432568100", "AffiliationID": "60193400, 60028897", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Centre for Catalysis Research and Innovation, University of Ottawa"}, "18134272400": {"Name": "Marin M.L.", "AuthorID": "18134272400", "AffiliationID": "60068624, 60011476", "AffiliationName": "Instituto Universitario Mixto de Tecnolog\u00eda Qu\u00edmica (UPV-CSIC), Universitat Polit\u00e8cnica de Val\u00e8ncia"}, "26632954200": {"Name": "Hallett-Tapley G.L.", "AuthorID": "26632954200", "AffiliationID": "60193400, 60028897", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Centre for Catalysis Research and Innovation, University of Ottawa"}, "56441065900": {"Name": "Hodgson G.K.", "AuthorID": "56441065900", "AffiliationID": "60193400, 60028897", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Centre for Catalysis Research and Innovation, University of Ottawa"}, "35556550100": {"Name": "Scaiano J.C.", "AuthorID": "35556550100", "AffiliationID": "60193400, 60028897", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Centre for Catalysis Research and Innovation, University of Ottawa"}}}
