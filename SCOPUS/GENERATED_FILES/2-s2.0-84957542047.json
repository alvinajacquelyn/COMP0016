All rights reserved.Tissue engineering is a multidisciplinary field that combines aspects of biology, material sciences, engineering and medicine-the ultimate goal being able to fabricate replacement tissues and/or organs for an ageing population. However, parallel to this milestone, is the exploitation of the biomimetic constructs as feasible alternatives to in vivo/ex vivo toxicity testing models due to their accurate representation of innate tissue and organs. Herein, we summarise a range of concepts within tissue engineering with a particular emphasis on biological material selection and implications to animal testing.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Humans", "Tissue Engineering", "Toxicity Tests"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84957542047", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"], ["Pharmaceutical Science", "PHAR", "3003"]], "AuthorData": {"57103516200": {"Name": "Garrod M.", "AuthorID": "57103516200", "AffiliationID": "60032760", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacy, Pharmacology and Postgraduate Medicine, School of Life and Medical Sciences University of Hertfordshire"}, "8646329300": {"Name": "Chau D.", "AuthorID": "8646329300", "AffiliationID": "60032760", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacy, Pharmacology and Postgraduate Medicine, School of Life and Medical Sciences University of Hertfordshire"}}}
