This happens because of the fact that gene regulatory networks can perform as perceptrons, simple intelligent schemes known from studies on Artificial Intelligence. We study the role of genetic noise in intelligent decision making at the genetic level and show that noise can play a constructive role helping cells to make a proper decision. We show this using the example of a simple genetic classifier able to classify two external stimuli.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Algorithms", "Artificial Intelligence", "Signal-To-Noise Ratio"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84930683145", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"56708095100": {"Name": "Bates R.", "AuthorID": "56708095100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University College London"}, "7103103296": {"Name": "Zaikin A.", "AuthorID": "7103103296", "AffiliationID": "60008673", "AffiliationName": "Lobachevsky State University of Nizhniy Novgorod"}, "56020531500": {"Name": "Blyuss O.", "AuthorID": "56020531500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Women's Health, University College London"}, "55664358300": {"Name": "Alsaedi A.", "AuthorID": "55664358300", "AffiliationID": "60004582", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, King AbdulAziz University"}}}
