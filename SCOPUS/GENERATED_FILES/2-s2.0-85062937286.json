Methods: A total of 24 male 12-week-old Sprague\u2013Dawley rats were divided into three equal groups: sham; PD without treatment (transforming growth factor-\u03b2 [TGF -\u03b2]); and PD treated with SVF 1 day after disease induction. Sham rats received two injections of vehicle into the TA 1 day apart. TGF -\u03b2 rats received TGF- \u03b21 injection and injection of vehicle 1 day later. SVF rats received TGF-\u03b21 injection, followed by SVF 1 day later. One month after treatment, all rats underwent measurement of intracavernosal pressure and mean arterial pressure during electrostimulation of the cavernous nerve. The rats were then killed and penises were harvested for histology and Western blot analysis. Results: Erectile function was moderately reduced in the TGF-\u03b2 group and was significantly improved after SVF treatment (P < 0.05). PD rats developed areas of fibrosis with a significant upregulation of collagen III, collagen I and elastin protein expression. These fibrotic changes were prevented when treated with SVF. Conclusions: Local injection of SVF may represent treatment for the acute phase of PD.", "AuthorKeywords": ["adipose stem cell, #Peyronies, #erectiledysfunction", "penile plaque", "sexual dysfunction"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Disease Models, Animal", "Injections", "Male", "Penile Induration", "Rats", "Rats, Sprague-Dawley", "Stromal Cells", "Transforming Growth Factor beta1"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85062937286", "SubjectAreas": [["Urology", "MEDI", "2748"]], "AuthorData": {"36702681800": {"Name": "Castiglione F.", "AuthorID": "36702681800", "AffiliationID": "60082964", "AffiliationName": "Division of Oncology/Unit of Urology, Urological Research Institute, IRCCS Ospedale San Raffaele"}, "56161787500": {"Name": "Weyne E.", "AuthorID": "56161787500", "AffiliationID": "60025063", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory for Experimental Urology, Organ Systems, Department of Development and Regeneration, University of Leuven"}, "57200406177": {"Name": "Hakim L.", "AuthorID": "57200406177", "AffiliationID": "60069383", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, Airlangga University / Dr Soetomo General Hospital"}, "57201754738": {"Name": "De Ridder D.", "AuthorID": "57201754738", "AffiliationID": "60025063", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory for Experimental Urology, Organ Systems, Department of Development and Regeneration, University of Leuven"}, "57189365453": {"Name": "Milenkovic U.", "AuthorID": "57189365453", "AffiliationID": "60025063", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory for Experimental Urology, Organ Systems, Department of Development and Regeneration, University of Leuven"}, "6602792294": {"Name": "Joniau S.", "AuthorID": "6602792294", "AffiliationID": "60025063", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory for Experimental Urology, Organ Systems, Department of Development and Regeneration, University of Leuven"}, "36136496600": {"Name": "Albersen M.", "AuthorID": "36136496600", "AffiliationID": "60025063", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory for Experimental Urology, Organ Systems, Department of Development and Regeneration, University of Leuven"}, "55781298300": {"Name": "Ralph D.", "AuthorID": "55781298300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Urology, University College of London Hospital"}, "24474853700": {"Name": "Garaffa G.", "AuthorID": "24474853700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Urology, University College of London Hospital"}, "24339107700": {"Name": "Muneer A.", "AuthorID": "24339107700", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Division of Surgery and Interventional Science, NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, University College London Hospital"}, "7102168325": {"Name": "Montorsi F.", "AuthorID": "7102168325", "AffiliationID": "60082964", "AffiliationName": "Division of Oncology/Unit of Urology, Urological Research Institute, IRCCS Ospedale San Raffaele"}, "7004134984": {"Name": "Salonia A.", "AuthorID": "7004134984", "AffiliationID": "60082964", "AffiliationName": "Division of Oncology/Unit of Urology, Urological Research Institute, IRCCS Ospedale San Raffaele"}, "7004483109": {"Name": "Bivalacqua T.J.", "AuthorID": "7004483109", "AffiliationID": "60006433, 60003443", "AffiliationName": "James Buchanan Brady Urological Institute, Department of Urology, Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions"}, "7005214631": {"Name": "Hedlund P.", "AuthorID": "7005214631", "AffiliationID": "60009358", "AffiliationName": "Division of Drug Research, Department of Medical and Health Sciences, Link\u00f6ping University"}, "null": {"Name": null, "AuthorID": null, "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
