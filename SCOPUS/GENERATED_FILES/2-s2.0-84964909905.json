All right reserved.Inspired by Bourdieu\u2019s forms of capital, theorists have utilized the additional category of erotic capital as a descriptor of the increasing importance of physical appearance to economic mobility.

Additionally, the prevalence of this belief in the emancipatory power of attractiveness also overlaps with indigenous concepts of fortune (hishig) and reputation (nerelkh\u00fc\u00fc), which most likely facilitated its integration in the Mongolian context. As a result, individuals from diverse socioeconomic backgrounds pursue a standard of beauty associated with the wealthy and successful.
