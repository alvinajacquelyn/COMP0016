We find that the ground-state Li4Ge under ambient conditions has a cubic symmetry. Li4Ge undergoes a structural phase transition at about 2 GPa from the cubic P213 phase to the R3m phase. The dynamic and mechanical stabilities of P213 and R3m were confirmed by phonon and elastic constant calculations. From the calculated elastic constants, we obtained the elastic moduli and discussed their elastic anisotropy effect. Our calculation shows that the P213 structure is brittle while the R3m structure is ductile. The anisotropic properties of R3m are more pronounced than those of P213 at ambient pressure. P213-Li4Ge is a narrow band gap semiconductor while the R3m phase is a poor metal.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Ambient conditions", "Ambient pressures", "Anisotropic property", "Cubic symmetry", "Elastic anisotropy", "Evolutionary crystal structure prediction", "First-principles calculation", "Structural phase transition"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85054856112", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"]], "AuthorData": {"57195902674": {"Name": "Hao C.M.", "AuthorID": "57195902674", "AffiliationID": "60004691", "AffiliationName": "School of Physics and Electronic Engineering, Jiangsu Normal University"}, "55588581000": {"Name": "Li Y.", "AuthorID": "55588581000", "AffiliationID": "60004691", "AffiliationName": "School of Physics and Electronic Engineering, Jiangsu Normal University"}, "57204185437": {"Name": "Chen X.Y.", "AuthorID": "57204185437", "AffiliationID": "60004691", "AffiliationName": "School of Physics and Electronic Engineering, Jiangsu Normal University"}, "22987031300": {"Name": "Wang Z.X.", "AuthorID": "22987031300", "AffiliationID": "60004691", "AffiliationName": "School of Physics and Electronic Engineering, Jiangsu Normal University"}, "55969559600": {"Name": "Li Y.L.", "AuthorID": "55969559600", "AffiliationID": "60004691", "AffiliationName": "School of Physics and Electronic Engineering, Jiangsu Normal University"}, "45662268000": {"Name": "Zhu Q.", "AuthorID": "45662268000", "AffiliationID": "60031892", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Nevada Las Vegas"}}}
