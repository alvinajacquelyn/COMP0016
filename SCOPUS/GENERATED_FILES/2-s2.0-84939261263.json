Our theoretical framework was drawn from the programme theories of six countries\u2019 school inspection systems (i.e. the Netherlands, England, Sweden, Ireland, the province of Styria in Austria and the Czech Republic). We describe how inspection models differ in the scheduling and frequency of visits (using a differentiated or cyclical approach), the evaluation of process and/or output standards, and the consequences of visits, and how these models lead to school improvement through the setting of expectations, the use of performance feedback and actions of the school\u2019s stakeholders. These assumptions were tested by means of a survey of principals in primary and secondary schools in these countries (n = 2239). The data analysis followed a three-step approach: (1) confirmatory factor analyses, (2) path modelling and (3) fitting of multiple-indicator multiple-cause models. The results indicate that Inspectorates of Education that use a differentiated model (in addition to regular visits), in which they evaluate both educational practices and outcomes of schools and publicly report inspection findings of individual schools, are the most effective. These changes seem to be mediated by improvements in the schools\u2019 self-evaluations and the schools\u2019 stakeholders\u2019 awareness of the findings in the public inspection reports. However, differentiated inspections also lead to unintended consequences as principals report on narrowing the curriculum and on discouraging teachers from experimenting with new teaching methods.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84939261263", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"]], "AuthorData": {"8283638900": {"Name": "Ehren M.", "AuthorID": "8283638900", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Education, University College London"}, "7401846675": {"Name": "Gustafsson J.", "AuthorID": "7401846675", "AffiliationID": "60016437", "AffiliationName": "Department of Education and Special Education, University of Gothenburg"}, "6507262744": {"Name": "Altrichter H.", "AuthorID": "6507262744", "AffiliationID": "60021931", "AffiliationName": "Institut f\u00fcr P\u00e4dagogik und Psychologie, Johannes Kepler Universit\u00e4t"}, "56491131700": {"Name": "Kemethofer D.", "AuthorID": "56491131700", "AffiliationID": "60021931", "AffiliationName": "Institut f\u00fcr P\u00e4dagogik und Psychologie, Johannes Kepler Universit\u00e4t"}, "35105947100": {"Name": "Skedsmo G.", "AuthorID": "35105947100", "AffiliationID": "108827969", "AffiliationName": "IBB \u2013 Institut f\u00fcr Bildungsmanagement und Bildungs\u00f6konomie, P\u00e4dagogische Hochschule Zug"}, "55175028800": {"Name": "Huber S.", "AuthorID": "55175028800", "AffiliationID": "108827969", "AffiliationName": "IBB \u2013 Institut f\u00fcr Bildungsmanagement und Bildungs\u00f6konomie, P\u00e4dagogische Hochschule Zug"}}}
