Currently, few systematic reviews provide sufficient guidance of this sort. Methods: Through a worked example, this paper reports on a methodological approach, Intervention Component Analysis (ICA), specifically developed to bridge the gap between evidence of effectiveness and practical implementation of interventions. By (a) using an inductive approach to explore the nature of intervention features and (b) making use of trialists' informally reported experience-based evidence, the approach is designed to overcome the deficiencies of poor reporting which often hinders knowledge translation work whilst also avoiding the need to invest significant amounts of time and resources in following up details with authors. Results: A key strength of the approach is its ability to reveal hidden or overlooked intervention features and barriers and facilitators only identified in practical application of interventions. It is thus especially useful where hypothesised mechanisms in an existing programme theory have failed. A further benefit of the approach is its ability to identify potentially new configurations of components that have not yet been evaluated. Conclusions: ICA is a formal and rigorous yet relatively streamlined approach to identify key intervention content and implementation processes. ICA addresses a critical need for knowledge translation around complex interventions to support policy decisions and evidence implementation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Complex interventions", "Electronic prescribing", "Evidence synthesis", "Knowledge translation", "Medication error", "Paediatrics", "Systematic reviews"], "IndexKeywords": ["Electronic Prescribing", "Evidence-Based Medicine", "Humans", "Medication Errors", "Pediatrics", "Program Development", "Research Design", "Review Literature as Topic", "Translational Medical Research"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84945587919", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (miscellaneous)", "MEDI", "2701"]], "AuthorData": {"35235593400": {"Name": "Sutcliffe K.", "AuthorID": "35235593400", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London (UCL), EPPI-Centre, Social Science Research Unit, Institute of Education"}, "55574208397": {"Name": "Thomas J.", "AuthorID": "55574208397", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London (UCL), EPPI-Centre, Social Science Research Unit, Institute of Education"}, "56927856400": {"Name": "Stokes G.", "AuthorID": "56927856400", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London (UCL), EPPI-Centre, Social Science Research Unit, Institute of Education"}, "55746144500": {"Name": "Hinds K.", "AuthorID": "55746144500", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London (UCL), EPPI-Centre, Social Science Research Unit, Institute of Education"}, "55321437800": {"Name": "Bangpan M.", "AuthorID": "55321437800", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London (UCL), EPPI-Centre, Social Science Research Unit, Institute of Education"}}}
