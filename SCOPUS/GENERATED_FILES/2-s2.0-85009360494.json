Application of A\u03b2 oligomers in physiological concentrations have been shown to transiently elevate internal Ca2+ in cultured astroglia. While the cellular machinery involved has been extensively explored, to what degree this important signalling cascade occurs in organised brain tissue has remained unclear. Here we adapted two-photon excitation microscopy and calibrated time-resolved imaging (FLIM), coupled with patch-clamp electrophysiology, to monitor Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]) inside individual astrocytes and principal neurons in acute brain slices. Inside the slice tissue local micro-ejection of A\u03b2 in sub-micromolar concentrations triggered prominent [Ca2+] elevations in an adjacent astrocyte translated as an approximately two-fold increase (averaged over \u223c5 min) in basal [Ca2+]. This elevation did not spread to neighbouring cells and appeared comparable in amplitude with commonly documented spontaneous [Ca2+] rises in astroglia. Principal nerve cells (pyramidal neurons) also showed Ca2+ sensitivity, albeit to a lesser degree. These observations shed light on the extent and dynamics of the acute physiological effects of A\u03b2 on brain cells in situ, in the context of AD.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Amyloid beta", "Astroglia", "Calcium imaging", "Fluorescence lifetime imaging", "Hippocampus"], "IndexKeywords": ["Amyloid beta-Peptides", "Animals", "Astrocytes", "Calcium", "Cations, Divalent", "Central Nervous System Agents", "Hippocampus", "Membrane Potentials", "Microscopy, Fluorescence", "Neurons", "Patch-Clamp Techniques", "Peptide Fragments", "Rats, Sprague-Dawley", "Single-Cell Analysis", "Tissue Culture Techniques"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85009360494", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"]], "AuthorData": {"56940678500": {"Name": "Tyurikova O.", "AuthorID": "56940678500", "AffiliationID": "60008673", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neuroscience, University of Nizhny Novgorod"}, "25937590000": {"Name": "Zheng K.", "AuthorID": "25937590000", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "57221936258": {"Name": "Rings A.", "AuthorID": "57221936258", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "7005393308": {"Name": "Rusakov D.A.", "AuthorID": "7005393308", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "36542475200": {"Name": "Drews A.", "AuthorID": "36542475200", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge"}, "7004374922": {"Name": "Klenerman D.", "AuthorID": "7004374922", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge"}}}
