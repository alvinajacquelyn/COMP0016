Using an unbiased proteomics screen in lung tissue, we identified the membrane protein caveolin -1 (Cav1) as a direct interaction partner of the GR. In Cav1 knockout mice GR transactivates anti-inflammatory genes, including Dusp1, more than in controls. We therefore determined the role of Cav1 in modulating Gc action in two models of pulmonary inflammation. We first tested innate responses in lung. Loss of Cav1 impaired the inflammatory response to nebulized LPS, increasing cytokine/chemokine secretion from lung, but impairing neutrophil infiltration. Despite these changes to the inflammatory response, there was no Cav1 effect on anti-inflammatory capacity of Gcs. We also tested GR/Cav1 crosstalk in a model of allergic airway inflammation. Cav1 had a very mild effect on the inflammatory response, but no effect on the Gc response \u2013 with comparable immune cell infiltrate (macrophage, eosinophils, neutrophils), pathological score and PAS positive cells observed between both genotypes. Pursuing the Th2 adaptive immune response further we demonstrate that Cav1 knockout mice retained their ability to expel the intestinal nematode parasite T.muris, which requires adaptive Th2 immune response for elimination. Therefore, Cav1 regulates innate immune responses in the lung, but does not have an effect on Th2-mediated adaptive immunity in lung or gut. Although we demonstrate that Cav1 regulates GR transactivation of anti-inflammatory genes, this does not translate to an effect on suppression of inflammation in vivo.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Caveolin 1", "Immunity, Innate", "Inflammation", "Lung", "Lung Diseases, Parasitic", "Mice", "Mice, Knockout", "Receptors, Glucocorticoid", "Th2 Cells", "Trichuriasis", "Trichuris"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85067271324", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"56439887400": {"Name": "Caratti G.", "AuthorID": "56439887400", "AffiliationID": "60010586", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Comparative Molecular Endocrinology, University of Ulm"}, "8509263400": {"Name": "Poolman T.", "AuthorID": "8509263400", "AffiliationID": "60111801, 60172345", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Biology, Medicine, and Health, University of Manchester and Manchester Academic Health Sciences Centre"}, "55246745600": {"Name": "Hurst R.J.", "AuthorID": "55246745600", "AffiliationID": "60111801, 60172345", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Biology, Medicine, and Health, University of Manchester and Manchester Academic Health Sciences Centre"}, "56282291400": {"Name": "Ince L.", "AuthorID": "56282291400", "AffiliationID": "60028717", "AffiliationName": "Walter Brendel Centre of Experimental Medicine, Ludwig-Maximilians-University of Munich"}, "57209303016": {"Name": "Knight A.", "AuthorID": "57209303016", "AffiliationID": "60111801, 60172345", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Biology, Medicine, and Health, University of Manchester and Manchester Academic Health Sciences Centre"}, "57209309533": {"Name": "Krakowiak K.", "AuthorID": "57209309533", "AffiliationID": "60111801, 60172345", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Biology, Medicine, and Health, University of Manchester and Manchester Academic Health Sciences Centre"}, "8941471800": {"Name": "Durrington H.J.", "AuthorID": "8941471800", "AffiliationID": "60111801, 60172345", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Biology, Medicine, and Health, University of Manchester and Manchester Academic Health Sciences Centre"}, "7202083239": {"Name": "Gibbs J.", "AuthorID": "7202083239", "AffiliationID": "60111801, 60172345", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Biology, Medicine, and Health, University of Manchester and Manchester Academic Health Sciences Centre"}, "7003647297": {"Name": "Else K.J.", "AuthorID": "7003647297", "AffiliationID": "60111801, 60172345", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Biology, Medicine, and Health, University of Manchester and Manchester Academic Health Sciences Centre"}, "57217603814": {"Name": "Ray D.W.", "AuthorID": "57217603814", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60008323, 60026851, 60172675", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Oxford Biomedical Research Centre, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, UK and Oxford Centre for Diabetes, Endocrinology and Metabolism, University of Oxford"}, "7202488707": {"Name": "Matthews L.C.", "AuthorID": "7202488707", "AffiliationID": "60023959, 60012070, 60163612", "AffiliationName": "Leeds Institute of Medical Research, Faculty of Medicine and Health, University of Leeds"}}}
