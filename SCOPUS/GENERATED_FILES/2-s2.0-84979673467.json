We sought to identify factors associated with the risk of viral load rebound in this trial. Methods: PIVOT was a randomized controlled trial in HIV-positive adults with suppressed viral load for at least 24 weeks on combination therapy comparing a strategy of physician-selected ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor monotherapy versus ongoing triple therapy. In participants receivingmonotherapy,weanalysed time to confirmed viral load rebound and its predictors using flexible parametric survival models. Results: Of 290 participants initiating protease inhibitor monotherapy (80% darunavir, 14% lopinavir, and 6% other), 93 developed viral load rebound on monotherapy. The risk of viral load rebound peaked at 9 months after starting monotherapy and then declined to approximately 5 per 100 person-years from 18 months onwards. Independent predictors of viral load rebound were duration of viral load suppression before starting monotherapy (hazard ratio 0.81 per additional year <50 copies/ml; P<0.001), CD4+ cell count (hazard ratio 0.73 per additional 100 cells/ml for CD4+ nadir; P=0.008); ethnicity (hazard ratio 1.87 for nonwhite versus white, P=0.025) but not the protease inhibitor agent used (P=0.27). Patients whose viral load was analysed with the Roche TaqMan-2 assay had a 1.87-fold risk for viral load rebound compared with Abbott RealTime assay (P=0.012). Conclusion: A number of factors can identify patients at low risk of rebound with protease inhibitor monotherapy, and this may help to better target those who may benefit from this management strategy.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Clinical trial", "HIV", "Monotherapy", "Protease inhibitor", "Virological rebound"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Female", "HIV Infections", "HIV Protease Inhibitors", "HIV-1", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Protease Inhibitors", "Risk Factors", "Treatment Failure", "Viral Load"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84979673467", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"8632775600": {"Name": "St\u00f6hr W.", "AuthorID": "8632775600", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60003108", "AffiliationName": "MRC Clinical Trials Unit, University College London, Institute of Clinical Trials and Methodology"}, "56595739700": {"Name": "Dunn D.T.", "AuthorID": "56595739700", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60003108", "AffiliationName": "MRC Clinical Trials Unit, University College London, Institute of Clinical Trials and Methodology"}, "6506318874": {"Name": "Arenas-Pinto A.", "AuthorID": "6506318874", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60003108", "AffiliationName": "MRC Clinical Trials Unit, University College London, Institute of Clinical Trials and Methodology"}, "7202849810": {"Name": "Sanders K.", "AuthorID": "7202849810", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60003108", "AffiliationName": "MRC Clinical Trials Unit, University College London, Institute of Clinical Trials and Methodology"}, "7101820336": {"Name": "Paton N.I.", "AuthorID": "7101820336", "AffiliationID": "60026680, 60017161", "AffiliationName": "Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore"}, "16507203900": {"Name": "Orkin C.", "AuthorID": "16507203900", "AffiliationID": "60159931", "AffiliationName": "Barts and The Royal London Hospital NHS Trust"}, "57207820760": {"Name": "Clarke A.", "AuthorID": "57207820760", "AffiliationID": "60003456", "AffiliationName": "Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals, NHS Trust"}, "57206923926": {"Name": "Williams I.", "AuthorID": "57206923926", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "57192083463": {"Name": "Johnsone M.", "AuthorID": "57192083463", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Royal Free Hospital"}, "7006669596": {"Name": "Beeching N.J.", "AuthorID": "7006669596", "AffiliationID": "60023925", "AffiliationName": "Royal Liverpool University Hospital"}, "7103182055": {"Name": "Wilkins E.", "AuthorID": "7103182055", "AffiliationID": "60007321", "AffiliationName": "North Manchester General Hospital"}}}
