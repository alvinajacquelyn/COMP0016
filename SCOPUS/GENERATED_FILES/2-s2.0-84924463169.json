JATD is genetically heterogeneous with at least nine genes identified, all encoding ciliary proteins, hence the classification of JATD as a skeletal ciliopathy. Consistent with the observation that the heterogeneous molecular basis of JATD has not been fully determined yet, we have identified two consanguineous Saudi families segregating JATD who share a single identical ancestral homozygous haplotype among the affected members. Whole-exome sequencing revealed a single novel variant within the disease haplotype in CEP120, which encodes a core centriolar protein. Subsequent targeted sequencing of CEP120 in Saudi and European JATD cohorts identified two additional families with the same missense mutation. Combining the four families in linkage analysis confirmed a significant genome-wide linkage signal at the CEP120 locus. This missense change alters a highly conserved amino acid within CEP120 (p.Ala199Pro). In addition, we show marked reduction of cilia and abnormal number of centrioles in fibroblasts from one affected individual. Inhibition of the CEP120 ortholog in zebrafish produced pleiotropic phenotypes characteristic of cilia defects including abnormal body curvature, hydrocephalus, otolith defects and abnormal renal, head and craniofacial development. We also demonstrate that in CEP120.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Amino Acid Sequence", "Animals", "Bone and Bones", "Cell Cycle Proteins", "Centrioles", "Chromosome Mapping", "Chromosomes, Human, Pair 5", "Cilia", "Cohort Studies", "Disease Models, Animal", "Ellis-Van Creveld Syndrome", "Europe", "Female", "Fibroblasts", "Genetic Loci", "Genome-Wide Association Study", "Humans", "Infant", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Molecular Sequence Data", "Mutation, Missense", "Pedigree", "Phenotype", "Saudi Arabia", "Zebrafish"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84924463169", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Genetics (clinical)", "MEDI", "2716"]], "AuthorData": {"6701642450": {"Name": "Shaheen R.", "AuthorID": "6701642450", "AffiliationID": "60016332", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genetics, King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center"}, "56155521600": {"Name": "Almoisheer A.", "AuthorID": "56155521600", "AffiliationID": "60016332", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genetics, King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center"}, "55823798900": {"Name": "Alamro R.", "AuthorID": "55823798900", "AffiliationID": "60016332", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genetics, King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center"}, "56544667900": {"Name": "Alshiddi T.", "AuthorID": "56544667900", "AffiliationID": "60016332", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genetics, King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center"}, "57212401508": {"Name": "Alzahrani F.", "AuthorID": "57212401508", "AffiliationID": "60016332", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genetics, King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center"}, "6602397795": {"Name": "Alkuraya F.S.", "AuthorID": "6602397795", "AffiliationID": "60104002", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology, College of Medicine, Alfaisal University"}, "6603658830": {"Name": "Schmidts M.", "AuthorID": "6603658830", "AffiliationID": "60002573, 60016529", "AffiliationName": "Department of Human Genetics, Radboud University Medical Center, Radboud Institute for Molecular Life Sciences, Radboud University Nijmegen"}, "56544237900": {"Name": "Holder I.", "AuthorID": "56544237900", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Genetics and Genomic Medicine, UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "7003490596": {"Name": "Mitchison H.M.", "AuthorID": "7003490596", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Genetics and Genomic Medicine, UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "7004556611": {"Name": "Beales P.L.", "AuthorID": "7004556611", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Genetics and Genomic Medicine, UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "24778230900": {"Name": "Faqeih E.", "AuthorID": "24778230900", "AffiliationID": "60091176", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatrics, King Fahad Medical City"}, "55751032000": {"Name": "Hashem A.", "AuthorID": "55751032000", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatrics, Prince Sultan Military Medical City"}, "6602579054": {"Name": "Lausch E.", "AuthorID": "6602579054", "AffiliationID": "60024805", "AffiliationName": "Pediatric Genetics Division, Center for Adolescent and Pediatric Medicine, University Hospital Freiburg"}, "7006588536": {"Name": "Superti-Furga A.", "AuthorID": "7006588536", "AffiliationID": "60023561, 60000239", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatrics, Lausanne University Hospital, University of Lausanne"}}}
