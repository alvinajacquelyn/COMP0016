Methods: We assessed interoceptive awareness in 19 adults with GTS and 25 age-matched healthy controls using the heartbeat counting task. We also used multiple regression to explore whether the severity of premonitory urges was predicted by interoceptive awareness or severity of tics and obsessive-compulsive symptoms. Results: We observed lower interoceptive awareness in GTS compared with controls. Interoceptive awareness was the strongest predictor of premonitory urges in GTS, with greater interoceptive awareness being associated with more urges. Greater tic severity was also associated with higher rates of premonitory urges. Conclusion: The observed relationship between severity of premonitory urges and interoceptive awareness suggests that interoception might be involved in self-reported premonitory urges in GTS. High levels of interoceptive awareness might reflect a self-attentive capacity to perceive urges. \u00a9 2015 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Gilles de la Tourette syndrome", "interoceptive awareness", "premonitory urges", "tic disorders"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Anticipation, Psychological", "Awareness", "Case-Control Studies", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Severity of Illness Index", "Tics", "Tourette Syndrome", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85027958953", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"37101265800": {"Name": "Ganos C.", "AuthorID": "37101265800", "AffiliationID": "60005036", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE)"}, "57189043160": {"Name": "Garrido A.", "AuthorID": "57189043160", "AffiliationID": "60028462", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Hospital Universitari Germans Trias i Pujol"}, "55951615600": {"Name": "Navalpotro-G\u00f3mez I.", "AuthorID": "55951615600", "AffiliationID": "60023506", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Hospital del Mar"}, "36167347400": {"Name": "Ricciardi L.", "AuthorID": "36167347400", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Sobell Department of Motor Neuroscience and Movement Disorders, UCL Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "55251354800": {"Name": "Edwards M.J.", "AuthorID": "55251354800", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Sobell Department of Motor Neuroscience and Movement Disorders, UCL Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "25958636400": {"Name": "Bhatia K.P.", "AuthorID": "25958636400", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Sobell Department of Motor Neuroscience and Movement Disorders, UCL Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "7003948139": {"Name": "Martino D.", "AuthorID": "7003948139", "AffiliationID": "60176725", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Lewisham & Greenwich NHS Trust"}, "8612330500": {"Name": "Tsakiris M.", "AuthorID": "8612330500", "AffiliationID": "60020595", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Royal Holloway, University of London"}, "7005933195": {"Name": "Haggard P.", "AuthorID": "7005933195", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60109771", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, University College"}}}
