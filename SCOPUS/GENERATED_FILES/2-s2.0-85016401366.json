The framework developed for reliability evaluation combines the stochastic modelling of renewable resources with chronological simulation of energy system performance for the evaluation of system reliability. The effect of inter-year variability is quantified by using a modified form of the loss of power supply probability as the reliability objective. A bi-criteria problem of capital cost minimization and reliability maximization is solved for two cases of remotely-located mining operations in Chile and Canada to demonstrate the capabilities of the methodology. Approximations to the Pareto-optimal fronts generated using a multi-objective genetic algorithm (NSGA-II). The performances of the minimum-cost designs generated are investigated in each case. The methodology provides the decision maker with necessary information about a number of alternative designs based on which sizing decisions may be made.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Energy storage", "Multi-objective optimization", "Reliability", "Renewables variability", "Systems design"], "IndexKeywords": ["Alternative designs", "Complex energy systems", "Loss of power supply probability", "Minimum-cost design", "Multi-objective genetic algorithm", "Pareto-optimal front", "Reliability Evaluation", "Renewables"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85016401366", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"]], "AuthorData": {"56811433800": {"Name": "Amusat O.", "AuthorID": "56811433800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Process Systems Engineering, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "7006429775": {"Name": "Fraga E.", "AuthorID": "7006429775", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Process Systems Engineering, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "24178516700": {"Name": "Shearing P.", "AuthorID": "24178516700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electrochemical Innovation Lab, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}}}
