Solvent selection determines the critical minimum polymer concentration and the critical minimum chain entanglement which allows the spinning of nanofibres rather than other hybrid morphologies such as beaded structures. Pressurised gyration, which simultaneously combines the use of gas pressure and rotation, is used as the processing and forming route for spinning fibres in this work. This study investigates 23 different solvents and solvent systems spread on a wide area of a Teas graph and able to dissolve the functional polymer polyethylene (terephthalate) (PET) and spin products by the application of pressurised gyration. The results are mapped on a Teas graph to identify the solubility-spinnability region. Based on this solubility-spinnability region, various solvents and binary solvent systems that allow the making of PET fibres are suggested. Scaling laws for the relationship between polymer concentration and specific viscosity are identified. The structural evolution in the fibres prepared is elucidated. For the first time, a mathematical model to scale fibre diameter with respect to flow properties and processing parameters encountered in pressurised gyration has been successfully developed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Gyration", "Model", "Nanofibres", "Polyethylene (terephthalate)", "Pressure", "Solvents"], "IndexKeywords": ["Binary solvent systems", "Chain entanglements", "Gyration", "Polymer concentrations", "Processing parameters", "Specific viscosity", "Structural evolution", "Terephthalate"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84934985348", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Environmental Chemistry", "ENVI", "2304"], ["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"], ["Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering", "ENGI", "2209"]], "AuthorData": {"22935212900": {"Name": "Mahalingam S.", "AuthorID": "22935212900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "7006247915": {"Name": "Edirisinghe M.", "AuthorID": "7006247915", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "55948967400": {"Name": "Raimi-Abraham B.", "AuthorID": "55948967400", "AffiliationID": "60016379", "AffiliationName": "University College London School of Pharmacy"}, "55428995000": {"Name": "Craig D.", "AuthorID": "55428995000", "AffiliationID": "60016379", "AffiliationName": "University College London School of Pharmacy"}}}
