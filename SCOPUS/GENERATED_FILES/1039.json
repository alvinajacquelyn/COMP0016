Only the morphology of the earliest members has been investigated, although other sets of data, from bone microanatomy and histology, are known to yield valuable paleobiological information. In the present study, we provide the first histological and microanatomical data on the oldest known stem-urodeles, the karaurids, from the Middle Jurassic. Three humeri from the Upper Bathonian, Oxfordshire, referred to juvenile or subadult individuals of Marmorerpeton and to an unnamed caudate of undetermined (but obviously non-larval) ontogenetic stage, were sampled in order to shed new light on the habitat and ontogeny of these basal caudates. The great compactness of the three humeri suggests that these salamanders were aquatic. The presence of extensive amounts of calcified cartilage in the humeri greatly strengthens the case for the presence of neoteny in these taxa, a suggestion that had initially been made on the basis of a few morphological characters. This constitutes the oldest known occurrence of neoteny in lissamphibians. Finally, bone histology reveals that the growth of Marmorerpeton and the related unnamed caudate was fairly slow and cyclic, a characteristic of extant lissamphibians.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Caudata", "Jurassic", "Lissamphibia", "neoteny", "paleohistology", "Urodela"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84908254584", "SubjectAreas": [["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"]], "AuthorData": {"6701381395": {"Name": "de Buffr\u00e9nil V.", "AuthorID": "6701381395", "AffiliationID": "60028311, 60072960, 60008134, 60001422", "AffiliationName": "D\u00e9partement Histoire de la Terre, UMR 7207, CNRS/MNHN/UPMC, Centre de Recherche Sur la Paleobiodiversit\u00e9 et les Pal\u00e9oenvironnements, Mus\u00e9um National d'Histoire Naturelle, B\u00e2timent de G\u00e9ologie"}, "24068429800": {"Name": "Canoville A.", "AuthorID": "24068429800", "AffiliationID": "60028311, 60072960, 60008134, 60001422", "AffiliationName": "D\u00e9partement Histoire de la Terre, UMR 7207, CNRS/MNHN/UPMC, Centre de Recherche Sur la Paleobiodiversit\u00e9 et les Pal\u00e9oenvironnements, Mus\u00e9um National d'Histoire Naturelle, B\u00e2timent de G\u00e9ologie"}, "7005382367": {"Name": "Laurin M.", "AuthorID": "7005382367", "AffiliationID": "60028311, 60072960, 60008134, 60001422", "AffiliationName": "D\u00e9partement Histoire de la Terre, UMR 7207, CNRS/MNHN/UPMC, Centre de Recherche Sur la Paleobiodiversit\u00e9 et les Pal\u00e9oenvironnements, Mus\u00e9um National d'Histoire Naturelle, B\u00e2timent de G\u00e9ologie"}, "7402709518": {"Name": "Evans S.E.", "AuthorID": "7402709518", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University College London"}}}
