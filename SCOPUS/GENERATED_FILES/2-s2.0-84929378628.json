Temperature-dependent X-ray diffraction (TD-XRD) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) showed that the base metal nanoparticles are smoothly formed from related base metal oxides via carbothermal reduction (fcc copper, T < 500 C; fcc nickel, T < 500 C; fcc cobalt, T = 570 C; bcc iron, T = 700 C). Moreover, it is shown that at distinct temperatures nickel (T \u2265 800 C), cobalt (T \u2265 800 C), and iron (T \u2265 715 C) nanoparticles catalyze the conversion of the amorphous carbon support into ribbons of turbostratic graphitic carbon according to Raman spectroscopy and TD-XRD. Copper, however, was found to be inactive. Furthermore, HRTEM revealed that nickel (500 C \u2264 T < 800 C) and cobalt nanoparticles (700 C \u2264 T < 800 C) after their initial formation become encapsulated by graphite-like shells prior to the onset of catalytic graphitization. This does not occur in the presence of iron nanoparticles. This distinction is attributed to the temperature required to access iron nanoparticles by carbothermal reduction and their concomitant mobility. Evidence (HRTEM) is provided that for the onset of catalytic graphitization nickel and cobalt nanoparticles first have to escape from their graphite-like shells. Therefore, iron nanoparticles are the most active catalyst. Our results further show that (metastable) metal carbides play a pivotal role in catalytic graphitization. This is demonstrated by the inactivity of copper nanoparticles, the distinct onset temperatures of catalytic graphitization, and the identification of cementite in the case of iron nanoparticles.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Catalytic graphitization", "Cobalt nanoparticles", "Copper nanoparticles", "Iron nanoparticles", "Microcrystalline cellulose", "Nickel and cobalts", "Temperature dependent", "Temperature regimes"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84929378628", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Energy (all)", "ENER", "2100"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"], ["Surfaces, Coatings and Films", "MATE", "2508"]], "AuthorData": {"36988551000": {"Name": "Hoekstra J.", "AuthorID": "36988551000", "AffiliationID": "60070173, 60007989", "AffiliationName": "Organic Chemistry and Catalysis, Debye Institute for Nanomaterials Science, Utrecht University"}, "7006334475": {"Name": "Geus J.W.", "AuthorID": "7006334475", "AffiliationID": "60070173, 60007989", "AffiliationName": "Organic Chemistry and Catalysis, Debye Institute for Nanomaterials Science, Utrecht University"}, "7005882507": {"Name": "Jenneskens L.W.", "AuthorID": "7005882507", "AffiliationID": "60070173, 60007989", "AffiliationName": "Organic Chemistry and Catalysis, Debye Institute for Nanomaterials Science, Utrecht University"}, "8889480300": {"Name": "Beale A.M.", "AuthorID": "8889480300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "8071755700": {"Name": "Soulimani F.", "AuthorID": "8071755700", "AffiliationID": "60070173, 60007989", "AffiliationName": "Inorganic Chemistry and Catalysis, Debye Institute for Nanomaterials Science, Utrecht University"}, "14059252400": {"Name": "Versluijs-Helder M.", "AuthorID": "14059252400", "AffiliationID": "60070173, 60007989", "AffiliationName": "Inorganic Chemistry and Catalysis, Debye Institute for Nanomaterials Science, Utrecht University"}}}
