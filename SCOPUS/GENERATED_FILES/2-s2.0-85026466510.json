Methods: High-resolution gradient-echo images of the knees of six healthy children and adolescents aged 6 to 15 were acquired with a 28-channel coil at 7 T. Phase images from the coils were combined using a short echo-time reference scan method (COMPOSER). Results: Veins oriented perpendicular to the static B0 field appeared doubled in susceptibility-weighted imaging, but not quantitative susceptibility mapping. Veins and layers in the cartilage were visible in all children up to the age of 13. Conclusions: Phase imaging using susceptibility-weighted imaging and quantitative susceptibility mapping allows the in vivo visualization of veins and layers in human growth cartilage.
