This chapter focuses on derivation and maintenance of cell lines from adult post-metamorphic salamanders and in particular cells derived from normal and regenerating limbs. We also describe a protocol for nucleofecting newt cells that can be used both to investigate the gene function in short-term studies and to establish stable cell lines.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Axolotl", "Blastema", "Cell culture", "Limb", "Nucleofection", "Regeneration", "Salamander", "Transfection"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Cell Culture Techniques", "Cell Line", "Cell Transplantation", "Cryopreservation", "Extremities", "Regeneration", "Salamandridae", "Time Factors", "Tissue Culture Techniques", "Transfection"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84924408570", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"]], "AuthorData": {"35583510100": {"Name": "Ferretti P.", "AuthorID": "35583510100", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "35310884000": {"Name": "Kumar A.", "AuthorID": "35310884000", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
