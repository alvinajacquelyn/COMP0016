To provide insight into the risk to subsequent pregnancies, this cohort study compares the outcomes of pregnant women with a previous preterm birth associated with either a prior FDCS or a prior term vaginal delivery. Material and methods: We identified women attending two inner-city preterm surveillance clinics (Guy's and St Thomas Hospital and University College London Hospital, London, UK) who had a spontaneous late miscarriage (14+0\u201323+6 weeks) or spontaneous preterm birth (sPTB; <37 weeks' gestation) following a term pregnancy, and then a further pregnancy for analysis. Cases were those with a prior term FDCS, whereas controls had a prior term vaginal birth; both before the late miscarriage/sPTB. Main outcomes were gestational age at delivery and delivery at <30 weeks in the next (third) pregnancy. Results: Over the study period, 66 women were identified who had a term delivery followed by a late miscarriage or sPTB, and a subsequent pregnancy. Recurrent sPTB <30 weeks was more common in cases than in controls (12/29, vs. 5/37, p = 0.02, Fisher's exact test, RR 3.06, 95% CI 1.22\u20137.71). Median gestation at delivery was significantly lower [249 days (IQR 154, 267) vs. 280 days (IQR 259, 280) p < 0.001]. Eleven women in the FDCS group received vaginal cerclage, five of whom delivered <37 weeks. Conclusion: In this cohort study we observed that women with a term FDCS and subsequent late miscarriage/sPTB have a higher risk of recurrent sPTB compared with women whose first term delivery was vaginal.", "AuthorKeywords": ["cervix", "Cesarean section", "delivery", "preterm birth", "ultrasound"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Cervix Uteri", "Cesarean Section", "Female", "Humans", "Labor Stage, Second", "London", "Pregnancy", "Pregnancy Outcome", "Pregnancy Trimester, Second", "Premature Birth", "Prenatal Diagnosis", "Risk Factors", "State Medicine"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85020285649", "SubjectAreas": [["Obstetrics and Gynecology", "MEDI", "2729"]], "AuthorData": {"57189514658": {"Name": "Watson H.A.", "AuthorID": "57189514658", "AffiliationID": "60004111, 60177635", "AffiliationName": "Division of Women's Health, King's College London, St Thomas' Hospital"}, "56453804800": {"Name": "Carter J.", "AuthorID": "56453804800", "AffiliationID": "60004111, 60177635", "AffiliationName": "Division of Women's Health, King's College London, St Thomas' Hospital"}, "57200763137": {"Name": "Seed P.T.", "AuthorID": "57200763137", "AffiliationID": "60004111, 60177635", "AffiliationName": "Division of Women's Health, King's College London, St Thomas' Hospital"}, "35378370800": {"Name": "Shennan A.H.", "AuthorID": "35378370800", "AffiliationID": "60004111, 60177635", "AffiliationName": "Division of Women's Health, King's College London, St Thomas' Hospital"}, "7402605276": {"Name": "David A.L.", "AuthorID": "7402605276", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Women's Health, University College London"}}}
