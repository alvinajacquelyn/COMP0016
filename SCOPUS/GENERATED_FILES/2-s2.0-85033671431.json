However, the toxicity of lead is considered one of the main obstacles to the commercialization of this technology. Although challenging, the replacement of lead by tin is currently the most promising alternative. Herein, we explore a class of low-dimensional, lead-free perovskite materials (2D (PEA)2SnIxBr4-x, where PEA \u00e2\u2030\u00a1 C6H5CH2CH2NH3 +) with tunable optical properties in the visible region of the spectrum. Specifically, we show that 2D (PEA)2SnI4 perovskite exhibits superior photoluminescence properties to conventional 3D CH3NH3SnI3 and that (PEA)2SnI4 can act as a sensitizer on mesoporous TiO2. We go on to demonstrate visible (630 nm) electroluminescence from a device employing a (PEA)2SnI4 emitter sandwiched between ITO/PEDOT:PSS and F8/LiF/Al as hole and electron injection electrodes, respectively. These devices reach a luminance of 0.15 cd/m2 at 4.7 mA/cm2 and an efficacy of 0.029 cd/A at 3.6 V. This proof-of-principle device indicates a viable path to low-dimensional, lead-free perovskite optoelectronics.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Lead-free perovskites", "Light emitting devices", "Low dimensional", "Mesoporous TiO2", "Photoluminescence properties", "Proof-of-principle device", "Tunable optical properties", "Visible emissions"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85033671431", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (miscellaneous)", "CHEM", "1601"], ["Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment", "ENER", "2105"], ["Fuel Technology", "ENER", "2103"], ["Energy Engineering and Power Technology", "ENER", "2102"], ["Materials Chemistry", "MATE", "2505"]], "AuthorData": {"57060461100": {"Name": "Lanzetta L.", "AuthorID": "57060461100", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry and Centre for Plastic Electronics, Imperial College London, South Kensington Campus"}, "55842142700": {"Name": "Marin-Beloqui J.M.", "AuthorID": "55842142700", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry and Centre for Plastic Electronics, Imperial College London, South Kensington Campus"}, "26531746700": {"Name": "Sanchez-Molina I.", "AuthorID": "26531746700", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry and Centre for Plastic Electronics, Imperial College London, South Kensington Campus"}, "57196713873": {"Name": "Ding D.", "AuthorID": "57196713873", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry and Centre for Plastic Electronics, Imperial College London, South Kensington Campus"}, "55382763400": {"Name": "Haque S.A.", "AuthorID": "55382763400", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry and Centre for Plastic Electronics, Imperial College London, South Kensington Campus"}}}
