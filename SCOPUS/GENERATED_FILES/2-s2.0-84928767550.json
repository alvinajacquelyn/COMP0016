Rossini et al., 1994). A new Committee, composed of international experts, some of whom were in the panel of the 1994 \"Report\", was selected to produce a current state-of-the-art review of non-invasive stimulation both for clinical application and research in neuroscience.Since 1994, the international scientific community has seen a rapid increase in non-invasive brain stimulation in studying cognition, brain-behavior relationship and pathophysiology of various neurologic and psychiatric disorders. New paradigms of stimulation and new techniques have been developed. Furthermore, a large number of studies and clinical trials have demonstrated potential therapeutic applications of non-invasive brain stimulation, especially for TMS. Recent guidelines can be found in the literature covering specific aspects of non-invasive brain stimulation, such as safety (. Rossi et al., 2009), methodology (. Groppa et al., 2012) and therapeutic applications (. Lefaucheur et al., 2014).This up-dated review covers theoretical, physiological and practical aspects of non-invasive stimulation of brain, spinal cord, nerve roots and peripheral nerves in the light of more updated knowledge, and include some recent extensions and developments.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Clinical neurophysiology", "Excitability threshold", "Human cortex", "Non-invasive stimulation", "TMS measures", "Transcranial magnetic stimulation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Advisory Committees", "Animals", "Brain", "Cognition Disorders", "Deep Brain Stimulation", "Humans", "Mental Disorders", "Peripheral Nerves", "Research Report", "Spinal Cord", "Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84928767550", "SubjectAreas": [["Sensory Systems", "NEUR", "2809"], ["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Physiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2737"]], "AuthorData": {"36040393500": {"Name": "Rossini P.M.", "AuthorID": "36040393500", "AffiliationID": "60031984", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neurology, Department of Geriatrics, Neuroscience and Orthopedics, Catholic University"}, "36889036100": {"Name": "Di Iorio R.", "AuthorID": "36889036100", "AffiliationID": "60031984", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neurology, Department of Geriatrics, Neuroscience and Orthopedics, Catholic University"}, "7403247655": {"Name": "Burke D.", "AuthorID": "7403247655", "AffiliationID": "60018150, 60025709", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, University of Sydney"}, "7406315658": {"Name": "Chen R.", "AuthorID": "7406315658", "AffiliationID": "60016849, 60006377", "AffiliationName": "Division of Neurology, Toronto Western Research Institute, University of Toronto"}, "7403928815": {"Name": "Cohen L.G.", "AuthorID": "7403928815", "AffiliationID": "60013780, 60006577", "AffiliationName": "Human Cortical Physiology and Neurorehabilitation Section, NINDS, NIH"}, "6603590114": {"Name": "Daskalakis Z.", "AuthorID": "6603590114", "AffiliationID": "60016849, 60015765", "AffiliationName": "Temerty Centre for Therapeutic Brain Intervention, Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, University of Toronto"}, "7006069196": {"Name": "Di Lazzaro V.", "AuthorID": "7006069196", "AffiliationID": "60005308", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, University Campus Bio-medico"}, "8759218500": {"Name": "Ferreri F.", "AuthorID": "8759218500", "AffiliationID": "60103673", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Neurophysiology, University of Eastern Finland"}, "7202233054": {"Name": "Fitzgerald P.B.", "AuthorID": "7202233054", "AffiliationID": "60012932", "AffiliationName": "Monash Alfred Psychiatry Research Centre, Monash University Central Clinical School and The Alfred"}, "56752276600": {"Name": "George M.S.", "AuthorID": "56752276600", "AffiliationID": "60023222, 60001421", "AffiliationName": "Medical University of South Carolina, Ralph H.
