This work has served as a framework for several ongoing clinical studies focused on bringing novel observations into the clinic in the form of tissue, liquid, and imaging biomarkers. Resistance in CRPC typically is driven through reactivation of androgen receptor (AR) signaling, which can occur through AR-activating point mutations, amplification, splice variants (such as AR-V7), or other bypass mechanisms. Detection of AR aberrations in the circulation negatively impacts response to subsequent AR-directed therapies such as abiraterone and enzalutamide. Other potentially clinically relevant alterations in CRPC include defects in DNA damage repair (at either the somatic or germline level) in up to 20% of patients (with implications for PARP1 inhibitor therapy), PI3K/PTEN/Akt pathway activation, WNT signaling pathway alterations, cell cycle gene alterations, and less common but potentially targetable alterations involving RAF and FGFR2. Imaging biomarkers that include those focused on incorporating overexpressed androgen-regulated genes/proteins, such as prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) in combination with CT, can noninvasively identify patterns of AR-driven distribution of CRPC tumor cells, monitor early metastatic lesions, and potentially capture heterogeneity of response to AR-directed therapies and other therapeutics. This article focuses on the current state of clinical biomarker development and future directions for how they might be implemented into the clinic in the near term to improve risk stratification and treatment selection for patients.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["DNA Repair", "Drug Resistance, Neoplasm", "Humans", "Male", "Mutation", "Neoplasm Metastasis", "Neoplasm Staging", "Neoplastic Cells, Circulating", "Oncogene Proteins, Fusion", "Phthalazines", "Piperazines", "Poly (ADP-Ribose) Polymerase-1", "Prostatic Neoplasms, Castration-Resistant", "PTEN Phosphohydrolase", "Receptors, Androgen", "Transcriptional Regulator ERG", "Translational Medical Research", "Tumor Suppressor Protein p53"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84991571098", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"36024985600": {"Name": "Beltran H.", "AuthorID": "36024985600", "AffiliationID": "60027057, 60010337, 60009343, 60021212", "AffiliationName": "From Weill Cornell Medicine, The Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins, MD; Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Weill Cornell Medicine, NY; The Institute of Cancer Research, The Royal Marsden Hospital"}, "55881902100": {"Name": "Antonarakis E.S.", "AuthorID": "55881902100", "AffiliationID": "60027057, 60010337, 60009343, 60021212", "AffiliationName": "From Weill Cornell Medicine, The Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins, MD; Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Weill Cornell Medicine, NY; The Institute of Cancer Research, The Royal Marsden Hospital"}, "56525913500": {"Name": "Morris M.J.", "AuthorID": "56525913500", "AffiliationID": "60027057, 60010337, 60009343, 60021212", "AffiliationName": "From Weill Cornell Medicine, The Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins, MD; Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Weill Cornell Medicine, NY; The Institute of Cancer Research, The Royal Marsden Hospital"}, "9740870900": {"Name": "Attard G.", "AuthorID": "9740870900", "AffiliationID": "60027057, 60010337, 60009343, 60021212", "AffiliationName": "From Weill Cornell Medicine, The Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins, MD; Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Weill Cornell Medicine, NY; The Institute of Cancer Research, The Royal Marsden Hospital"}}}
