Aims To identify reciprocal, longitudinal relationships between smoking cessation and depression among older smokers. Method Across four waves, covering six years (2002-2008), changes in smoking status and depression, measured using the 8-item Centre for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, were assessed among recent ex-smokers and smokers (n = 2375) in the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing. Results In latent growth curve analysis, smoking at baseline predicted depression caseness longitudinally and vice versa. When both processes were modelled concurrently, depression predicted continued smoking longitudinally (B(b) = 0.21 (0.27); 95% CI = 0.08-0.35) but not the other way round. This was the case irrespective of mental health history and adjusting for a range of covariates. Conclusions In older smokers, depression appears to act as an important barrier to quitting, although quitting has no long-term impact on depression.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Depressive Disorder", "England", "Female", "Humans", "Longitudinal Studies", "Male", "Mental Health", "Middle Aged", "Prognosis", "Smoking Cessation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84941248853", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"15123109500": {"Name": "Shahab L.", "AuthorID": "15123109500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "16029356900": {"Name": "Shankar A.", "AuthorID": "16029356900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "7402396010": {"Name": "West R.", "AuthorID": "7402396010", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "56249879600": {"Name": "Gilchrist G.", "AuthorID": "56249879600", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Psychiatry, King's College London"}, "12769074400": {"Name": "Hagger-Johnson G.", "AuthorID": "12769074400", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "7103020938": {"Name": "West E.", "AuthorID": "7103020938", "AffiliationID": "60021889", "AffiliationName": "School of Health and Social Care, University of Greenwich"}}}
