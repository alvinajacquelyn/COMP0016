This paper proposes an improved Alternating Direction Multiplier Method (AD-MM) for high-dimensional quantum state reconstruction. The proposed method not only greatly reduces the computational complexity and speeds up the convergence, but also has a strong robustness to the noise. For the density matrix reconstruction of 11-qubit quantum system, the proposed algorithm achieves 4.54e-2 reconstruction error using 0.6% of total measurement data and 99.26 seconds.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Alternating directions", "Compressive sensing", "Convex optimization problems", "Density-matrix reconstruction", "Multiplier methods", "Quantum state reconstruction", "Reconstruction error", "Strong robustness"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85047545916", "SubjectAreas": [["Control and Optimization", "MATH", "2606"]], "AuthorData": {"57194018028": {"Name": "Zhang J.", "AuthorID": "57194018028", "AffiliationID": "60019118", "AffiliationName": "Department of Automation, University of Science and Technology of China"}, "7005067661": {"Name": "Cong S.", "AuthorID": "7005067661", "AffiliationID": "60019118", "AffiliationName": "Department of Automation, University of Science and Technology of China"}, "55488020900": {"Name": "Li K.", "AuthorID": "55488020900", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, Imperial College"}}}
