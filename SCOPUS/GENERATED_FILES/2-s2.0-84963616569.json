Here, we show that during ZA remodeling in a model neuroepithelial cell, the Cdc42 effector P21-activated kinase 4 (Pak4/Mbt) regulates AJ morphogenesis and stability through \u03b2-catenin (\u03b2-cat/Arm) phosphorylation. We find that \u03b2-catenin phosphorylation by Mbt, and associated AJ morphogenesis, is needed for the retention of the apical determinant Par3/Bazooka at the remodeling ZA. Importantly, this retention mechanism functions together with Par1-dependent lateral exclusion of Par3/Bazooka to regulate apical membrane differentiation. Our results reveal an important functional link between Pak4, AJ material morphogenesis, and polarity remodeling during organogenesis downstream of Par3.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adherens Junctions", "Animals", "beta Catenin", "Cell Differentiation", "Cell Polarity", "Compound Eye, Arthropod", "Drosophila", "Drosophila Proteins", "Epithelial Cells", "Membrane Proteins", "Protein Kinases"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84963616569", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"7005657227": {"Name": "Walther R.", "AuthorID": "7005657227", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60010269", "AffiliationName": "MRC Laboratory for Molecular Cell Biology, University College London"}, "57188819600": {"Name": "Nunes de Almeida F.", "AuthorID": "57188819600", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60010269", "AffiliationName": "MRC Laboratory for Molecular Cell Biology, University College London"}, "36640826700": {"Name": "Vlassaks E.", "AuthorID": "36640826700", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60010269", "AffiliationName": "MRC Laboratory for Molecular Cell Biology, University College London"}, "7003987735": {"Name": "Burden J.", "AuthorID": "7003987735", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60010269", "AffiliationName": "MRC Laboratory for Molecular Cell Biology, University College London"}, "6701660589": {"Name": "Pichaud F.", "AuthorID": "6701660589", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60010269", "AffiliationName": "MRC Laboratory for Molecular Cell Biology, University College London"}}}
