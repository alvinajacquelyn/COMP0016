This article reviews the core features of AMBIT, exploring applications of attachment theory to understand what makes young people \u201chard to reach,\u201d and provide routes toward increased security in their attachment to a worker. Using the theory of the pedagogical stance and epistemic (\u201cpertaining to knowledge\u201d) trust, we show how it is the therapeutic worker\u2019s accurate mentalizing of the adolescent that creates conditions for new learning, including the establishment of alternative (more secure) internal working models of helping relationships. This justifies an individual keyworker model focused on maintaining a mentalizing stance toward the adolescent, but simultaneously emphasizing the critical need for such keyworkers to remain well connected to their wider team, avoiding activation of their own attachment behaviors. We consider the role of AMBIT in developing a shared team culture (shared experiences, shared language, shared meanings), toward creating systemic contexts supportive of such relationships. We describe how team training may enhance the team\u2019s ability to serve as a secure base for keyworkers, and describe an innovative approach to treatment manualization, using a wiki format as one way of supporting this process.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Attachment", "Hard-to-reach", "Mentalization", "Outreach", "Therapy"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Humans", "Interpersonal Relations", "Learning", "Object Attachment", "Parent-Child Relations", "Patient Care Team", "Psychology, Adolescent", "Theory of Mind", "Trust"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84926419859", "SubjectAreas": [["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"55204451400": {"Name": "Bevington D.", "AuthorID": "55204451400", "AffiliationID": "60170329", "AffiliationName": "Anna Freud Centre"}, "6601980951": {"Name": "Fuggle P.", "AuthorID": "6601980951", "AffiliationID": "60170329", "AffiliationName": "Anna Freud Centre"}, "7004981532": {"Name": "Fonagy P.", "AuthorID": "7004981532", "AffiliationID": "60170329", "AffiliationName": "Anna Freud Centre"}}}
