In order to identify the pathways by which p130Cas exerts its biological functions in endothelial cells we mapped the p130Cas interactome and its dynamic changes in response to VEGF using high-resolution mass spectrometry and reconstruction of protein interaction (PPI) networks with the aid of multiple PPI databases. VEGF enriched the p130Cas interactome in proteins involved in actin cytoskeletal dynamics and cell movement, including actin-binding proteins, small GTPases and regulators or binders of GTPases. Detailed studies showed that p130Cas association of the GTPase-binding scaffold protein, IQGAP1, plays a key role in VEGF chemotactic signaling, endothelial polarization, VEGF-induced cell migration, and endothelial tube formation. These findings indicate a cardinal role for assembly of the p130Cas interactome in mediating the cell migratory response to VEGF in angiogenesis, and provide a basis for further studies of p130Cas in cell movement.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Chemotaxis", "Crk-Associated Substrate Protein", "Databases, Protein", "Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells", "Humans", "Mass Spectrometry", "Neovascularization, Physiologic", "Protein Interaction Maps", "Proteomics", "Signal Transduction", "Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85013167819", "SubjectAreas": [["Analytical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1602"], ["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"]], "AuthorData": {"7103109629": {"Name": "Evans I.M.", "AuthorID": "7103109629", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Medicine, Rayne Building, Centre for Cardiovascular Biology and Medicine, University College London"}, "57189713156": {"Name": "Paliashvili K.", "AuthorID": "57189713156", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Medicine, Rayne Building, Centre for Cardiovascular Biology and Medicine, University College London"}, "41662385100": {"Name": "Yamaji M.", "AuthorID": "41662385100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Medicine, Rayne Building, Centre for Cardiovascular Biology and Medicine, University College London"}, "24074082100": {"Name": "Britton G.", "AuthorID": "24074082100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Medicine, Rayne Building, Centre for Cardiovascular Biology and Medicine, University College London"}, "57217377365": {"Name": "Frankel P.", "AuthorID": "57217377365", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Medicine, Rayne Building, Centre for Cardiovascular Biology and Medicine, University College London"}, "7006463251": {"Name": "Zachary I.C.", "AuthorID": "7006463251", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Medicine, Rayne Building, Centre for Cardiovascular Biology and Medicine, University College London"}, "56785085100": {"Name": "Kennedy S.A.", "AuthorID": "56785085100", "AffiliationID": "60005141", "AffiliationName": "Systems Biology Ireland, University College Dublin"}, "54896827500": {"Name": "Santra T.", "AuthorID": "54896827500", "AffiliationID": "60005141", "AffiliationName": "Systems Biology Ireland, University College Dublin"}, "7007060021": {"Name": "Kolch W.", "AuthorID": "7007060021", "AffiliationID": "60014241, 60005141", "AffiliationName": "School of Medicine and Medical Science, University College Dublin"}, "7003921726": {"Name": "Lovering R.C.", "AuthorID": "7003921726", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cardiovascular Genetics, Institute of Cardiovascular Science, Rayne Building, University College London"}}}
