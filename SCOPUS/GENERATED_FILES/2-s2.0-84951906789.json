Pumps are routinely implanted subcutaneously in the anterior abdominal wall. We describe two unusual cases where skin-related complications necessitated revision surgery in order to relocate the pump to alternative sites. The first patient was an international power canoeist, whose strenuous exercise programme interfered with his pump\u2019s original siting. The second patient was a cachectic university student with a history of cerebral palsy, who maintained low body mass despite attempted weight gain. The relocation of these two intrathecal devices to the medial compartment of the right thigh and right iliac fossa, respectively, is described.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Baclofen", "Cerebral palsy", "Intrathecal baclofen", "Intrathecal device", "Spastic diplegia", "Spasticity"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Baclofen", "Humans", "Infusion Pumps, Implantable", "Male", "Muscle Relaxants, Central", "Muscle Spasticity", "Reoperation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84951906789", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"56845207100": {"Name": "Devine O.", "AuthorID": "56845207100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "The Medical School, University College London"}, "56845248400": {"Name": "Harborne A.", "AuthorID": "56845248400", "AffiliationID": "60027201", "AffiliationName": "Hull Royal Infirmary"}, "35590180800": {"Name": "Lo W.B.", "AuthorID": "35590180800", "AffiliationID": "60012191", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurosurgery, Queen Elizabeth Medical Centre"}, "57201769119": {"Name": "Weinberg D.", "AuthorID": "57201769119", "AffiliationID": "60008873", "AffiliationName": "Salford Royal NHS Foundation Trust"}, "56975822300": {"Name": "Price R.", "AuthorID": "56975822300", "AffiliationID": "60029028", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurosurgery, University Hospital of North Staffordshire"}, "56976285600": {"Name": "Ciras M.", "AuthorID": "56976285600", "AffiliationID": "60029028", "AffiliationName": "Department of Rehabilitation and Musculoskeletal Medicine, University Hospital of North Staffordshire"}}}
