These often-unintended consequences occur at different stages of prevention processes, including before official start dates. They can improve or reduce intervention impacts. Evaluations using before-and-after designs with or without controls can fail to identify these effects. We describe a longitudinal framework to guide the design and evaluation of interventions that can account for these side effects when causal mechanisms are better understood. Methods: Our time-course framework provides a comprehensive assessment of the prevention process. Using place-based examples as illustrations, it builds on previously identified temporal benefits and backfires\u2014such as anticipatory benefits, residual deterrence, and initial backfire\u2014that have never been systematically organized into a single framework. We show how our framework can be incorporated into the EMMIE framework for assessing prevention utility. Results: The proposed time-course framework links together all temporal effects, their underlying mechanisms, and shows how they can vary by context. Conclusions: The framework suggests that considering all decisions within these timelines will be more cost-effective and produce greater crime reductions in the long run. By considering the mechanisms that can be triggered at various points in an intervention\u2019s time-course, we can better design experiments to test them and generate stronger evaluations of programs.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Crime prevention policy", "EMMIE framework", "Initial backfire", "Intervention time-course", "Program evaluation"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85069507333", "SubjectAreas": [["Law", "SOCI", "3308"]], "AuthorData": {"55331630400": {"Name": "Linning S.J.", "AuthorID": "55331630400", "AffiliationID": "60018208", "AffiliationName": "Department of Criminal Justice and Criminology, Washington State University"}, "7006388124": {"Name": "Bowers K.", "AuthorID": "7006388124", "AffiliationID": "60090044, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Jill Dando Institute of Security and Crime Science, University College London"}, "8745902600": {"Name": "Eck J.E.", "AuthorID": "8745902600", "AffiliationID": "60025152", "AffiliationName": "School of Criminal Justice, University of Cincinnati"}}}
