Although the human retina harbors M\u00fcller glia with stem cell characteristics, there is no evidence that they regenerate the retina after disease or injury. Transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF\u03b2) and Wnt signaling regulate retinal neurogenesis and inflammation, but their roles in the neural differentiation of human M\u00fcller stem cells (hMSC) are not known. We examined hMSC lines in vitro for the expression of various Wnt signaling components and for their modulation by TGF\u03b21, as well as the effect of this cytokine on the photoreceptor differentiation of these cells. Culture of hMSC with a combination of factors that induce photoreceptor differentiation of hMSC (FGF2, taurine, retinoic acid, and insulin-like growth factor type1; FTRI), markedly upregulated the expression of components of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway, including WNT2B, DKK1, and active \u03b2-CATENIN. Although FTRI did not modify mRNA expression of WNT5B, a component of the noncanonical/planar cell polarity Wnt pathway, it upregulated its secretion. Furthermore, TGF\u03b21 not only decreased WNT2B expression, but also inhibited FTRI-induced photoreceptor differentiation of hMSC, as determined by expression of the photoreceptor markers NR2E3, RHODOPSIN, and RECOVERIN. Inhibition of TGF\u03b21 signaling by an ALK5 inhibitor prevented TGF\u03b21-induced changes in the expression of the two Wnt ligands examined. More importantly, inhibition of the canonical WNT signaling by XAV-939 prevented FTRI-induced photoreceptor differentiation. These observations suggest that TGF\u03b2 may play a key role in preventing neural differentiation of hMSC and may constitute a potential target for induction of endogenous regeneration of the human retina.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Cell Differentiation", "Cell Line", "Down-Regulation", "Ependymoglial Cells", "Gene Expression Regulation", "Glycoproteins", "Humans", "Neurogenesis", "Photoreceptor Cells", "Stem Cells", "Transforming Growth Factor beta1", "Wnt Proteins", "Wnt Signaling Pathway"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84954172237", "SubjectAreas": [["Hematology", "MEDI", "2720"], ["Developmental Biology", "BIOC", "1309"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"56976338000": {"Name": "Angbohang A.", "AuthorID": "56976338000", "AffiliationID": "60013148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Ocular Biology and Therapeutics, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "57212668009": {"Name": "Wu N.", "AuthorID": "57212668009", "AffiliationID": "60009860, 60121908", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Science, Eye and ENT Hospital, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University"}, "57203041452": {"Name": "Charalambous T.", "AuthorID": "57203041452", "AffiliationID": "60013148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Ocular Biology and Therapeutics, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "54787676900": {"Name": "Eastlake K.", "AuthorID": "54787676900", "AffiliationID": "60013148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Ocular Biology and Therapeutics, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "57051897100": {"Name": "Kim Y.S.", "AuthorID": "57051897100", "AffiliationID": "60013148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Ocular Biology and Therapeutics, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "8900715000": {"Name": "Lei Y.", "AuthorID": "8900715000", "AffiliationID": "60009860, 60121908", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Science, Eye and ENT Hospital, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University"}, "57189617550": {"Name": "Sun X.H.", "AuthorID": "57189617550", "AffiliationID": "60009860, 60121908", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Science, Eye and ENT Hospital, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University"}, "56785711800": {"Name": "Limb G.A.", "AuthorID": "56785711800", "AffiliationID": "60016691, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Ocular Biology and Therapeutics, NIHR Biomedical Research Centre for Ophthalmology, Moorfields Eye Hospital, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}}}
