In this paper, I argue that various different approaches can all be viewed from an associational perspective. I also argue that our understanding will be enhanced by adopting some basic ideas of scientific reasoning to the process of establishing validity and making fully transparent the assumptions and procedures used by both test constructors and test users.", "AuthorKeywords": ["associational validity", "educational measurement", "scientific reasoning", "validity"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84926435023", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"]], "AuthorData": {"7203025236": {"Name": "Goldstein H.", "AuthorID": "7203025236", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "Graduate School of Education, University of Bristol"}}}
