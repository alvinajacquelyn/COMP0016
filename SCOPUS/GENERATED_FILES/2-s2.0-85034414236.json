To address this issue, porous structures have been introduced into the VO2 film. Herein, mesoporous VO2 powders with pore size of about 2\u201310 nm were synthesized using cotton as template by hydrothermal methods. The pore and crystal size of the synthesized VO2 powders can be reliably controlled by the hydrothermal temperature. The mesoporous VO2 powders were mixed with PVP to prepare the VO2-based nanocomposite films by spin coating. The VO2-based films show a better performance between \u0394Tsol and Tlum than that appeared in previous reports. Especially, a larger pore size could lead to a higher visible transmittance and a larger crystal size would facilitate the enhancement in the solar modulation. In this sense, the VO2-based film obtained at the hydrothermal temperature of 180 \u00b0C exhibits an outstanding thermochromic performance with \u0394Tsol of 12.9% and Tlum up to 56.0% due to a larger crystal size and pore size. Therefore, this synthetic route shows a potential method for the application of mesoporous VO2 powders for solar control coatings.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Mesoporous structure", "Solar modulation ability", "Thermochromic property", "VO2 film"], "IndexKeywords": ["Hydrothermal methods", "Hydrothermal temperature", "Mesoporous structures", "Solar control coatings", "Solar modulation", "Thermochromic materials", "Thermochromic properties", "Visible transmittance"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85034414236", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment", "ENER", "2105"], ["Surfaces, Coatings and Films", "MATE", "2508"]], "AuthorData": {"57197744498": {"Name": "Wu S.", "AuthorID": "57197744498", "AffiliationID": "60022414", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Silicate Materials for Architectures, Wuhan University of Technology (WUT)"}, "53985320000": {"Name": "Tian S.", "AuthorID": "53985320000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Materials Chemistry Centre, University College London"}, "7408690803": {"Name": "Liu B.", "AuthorID": "7408690803", "AffiliationID": "60022414", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Silicate Materials for Architectures, Wuhan University of Technology (WUT)"}, "7202328209": {"Name": "Tao H.", "AuthorID": "7202328209", "AffiliationID": "60022414", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Silicate Materials for Architectures, Wuhan University of Technology (WUT)"}, "7407542254": {"Name": "Zhao X.", "AuthorID": "7407542254", "AffiliationID": "60022414", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Silicate Materials for Architectures, Wuhan University of Technology (WUT)"}, "8227436900": {"Name": "Palgrave R.G.", "AuthorID": "8227436900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Materials Chemistry Centre, University College London"}, "7006847733": {"Name": "Sankar G.", "AuthorID": "7006847733", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Materials Chemistry Centre, University College London"}, "56217400400": {"Name": "Parkin I.P.", "AuthorID": "56217400400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Materials Chemistry Centre, University College London"}}}
