Evidence suggests that in healthy individuals positive subliminal cues are taken as a signal that goal pursuit is easy and therefore reduce the effort that is mobilized for goal attainment. Patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls were instructed that a long run of successive correct responses in a visual attention task would entitle them to a reward (the goal to attain). Affective pictures were displayed supraliminally or subliminally during each run and electrophysiological activity was recorded. Patients self-assessed the emotional content of the pictures correctly. However, differences between patients and controls emerged during the goal pursuit task. Healthy controls mobilized less effort for the positive than the neutral subliminal pictures, as suggested by increased error rates and the weaker contingent negative variation (CNV). For the patients, no influence of positive subliminal pictures was found on performance and on the CNV. Similarly the influence of positive pictures was absent or abnormal on components which are usually impaired in patients (fronto-central P2 and N2). In contrast, positive pictures influenced normally the parieto-occipital N2, related to a component of visual attention which has been proposed to be preserved in schizophrenia. The present study indicates the difficulties of patients to modulate effort mobilization during goal pursuit in the presence of positive subliminal cues. The results question the role of cognitive deficits on affective influences.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Affective primes", "ERPs", "Goal", "Schizophrenia", "Unconscious"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Arousal", "Attention", "Brain", "Contingent Negative Variation", "Cues", "Electroencephalography", "Emotions", "Female", "Goals", "Humans", "Male", "Neuropsychological Tests", "Psychomotor Performance", "Schizophrenia", "Subliminal Stimulation", "Unconscious (Psychology)", "Visual Perception"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84921515996", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"], ["Biological Psychiatry", "NEUR", "2803"]], "AuthorData": {"56490954600": {"Name": "Chaillou A.", "AuthorID": "56490954600", "AffiliationID": "60103368, 60000905", "AffiliationName": "University of Strasbourg, Department of Psychiatry, INSERM"}, "6701709610": {"Name": "Giersch A.", "AuthorID": "6701709610", "AffiliationID": "60103368, 60000905", "AffiliationName": "University of Strasbourg, Department of Psychiatry, INSERM"}, "6603780474": {"Name": "Bonnefond A.", "AuthorID": "6603780474", "AffiliationID": "60103368, 60000905", "AffiliationName": "University of Strasbourg, Department of Psychiatry, INSERM"}, "24474088700": {"Name": "Capa R.", "AuthorID": "24474088700", "AffiliationID": "60103368, 60000905", "AffiliationName": "University of Strasbourg, Department of Psychiatry, INSERM"}, "6506357747": {"Name": "Custers R.", "AuthorID": "6506357747", "AffiliationID": "60007989", "AffiliationName": "Utrecht University, Department of Psychology"}}}
