Difficulties with formulating the nanoparticles for uniformity and stability at concentrations required for in vivo and clinical use are limiting their progression in these areas. Here, we report a simple but effective method of formulating monodisperse nanocomplexes from a ternary formulation of lipids, targeting peptides, and nucleic acids at a low starting concentration of 0.2 mg/mL of DNA, and we then increase their concentration up to 4.5 mg/mL by reverse dialysis against a concentrated polymer solution at room temperature. The nanocomplexes did not aggregate and they had maintained their biophysical properties, but, importantly, they also mediated DNA transfection and siRNA silencing in cultured cells. Moreover, concentrated anionic nanocomplexes administered by convection-enhanced delivery in the striatum showed efficient silencing of the \u00df-secretase gene BACE1. This method of preparing nanocomplexes could probably be used to concentrate other nonviral formulations and may enable more widespread use of nanoparticles in vivo.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Anionic liposome", "Concentration", "DNA", "Nanoparticles", "siRNA", "Targeted gene delivery"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Cell Line, Tumor", "DNA", "Humans", "Lipids", "Mice", "Nanoparticles", "Peptides", "RNA, Small Interfering", "Transfection"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84928113980", "SubjectAreas": [["Biophysics", "BIOC", "1304"], ["Bioengineering", "CENG", "1502"], ["Biomaterials", "MATE", "2502"], ["Pharmaceutical Science", "PHAR", "3003"], ["Drug Discovery", "PHAR", "3002"], ["Organic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1605"]], "AuthorData": {"6603243611": {"Name": "Tagalakis A.D.", "AuthorID": "6603243611", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Experimental and Personalised Medicine Section, University College London (UCL) Institute of Child Health"}, "55551177200": {"Name": "Castellaro S.", "AuthorID": "55551177200", "AffiliationID": "60025153", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacy, University of Genova"}, "55716808400": {"Name": "Zhou H.", "AuthorID": "55716808400", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Experimental and Personalised Medicine Section, University College London (UCL) Institute of Child Health"}, "55963566300": {"Name": "Munye M.M.", "AuthorID": "55963566300", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Experimental and Personalised Medicine Section, University College London (UCL) Institute of Child Health"}, "57203103916": {"Name": "Hart S.L.", "AuthorID": "57203103916", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Experimental and Personalised Medicine Section, University College London (UCL) Institute of Child Health"}, "6603316994": {"Name": "Bienemann A.", "AuthorID": "6603316994", "AffiliationID": "60020650, 60016447", "AffiliationName": "Functional Neurosurgery Research Group, School of Clinical Sciences, AMBI Labs, University of Bristol, Southmead Hospital"}, "37021961900": {"Name": "White E.A.", "AuthorID": "37021961900", "AffiliationID": "60020650, 60016447", "AffiliationName": "Functional Neurosurgery Research Group, School of Clinical Sciences, AMBI Labs, University of Bristol, Southmead Hospital"}, "8658898000": {"Name": "McCarthy D.", "AuthorID": "8658898000", "AffiliationID": "60016379", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy"}}}
