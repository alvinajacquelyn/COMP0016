Neutron reflectivity is known as a promising tool for precise and non-destructive analysis of buried layers and interfaces of thin films. On the other hand, studying inhomogeneous samples, which is quite often the case in practice with thin films, has been a big challenge, mainly because of the difficulty in obtaining a small neutron beam without significant intensity loss. The present research examines an alternative efficient way to provide spatial resolution in neutron reflectivity without the use of any micro beam and/or any high-resolution position sensitive neutron detector. It has been demonstrated for the first time that the reflectogram, which is a projection at grazing incidence along a neutron's propagation direction, can be obtained by use of a Hadamard coded mask and a conventional point detector such as a 3He detector. This suggests that neutron reflectivity imaging will be realized by collecting further reflectograms as a function of in-plane rotation angles.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Inhomogeneity", "Intensity profile", "Neutron reflectivity", "Reflection projection", "Reflectogram", "Spatial resolution"], "IndexKeywords": ["Inhomogeneities", "Intensity profiles", "Neutron reflectivity", "Reflectograms", "Spatial resolution"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85041579416", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"36006532200": {"Name": "Sakurai K.", "AuthorID": "36006532200", "AffiliationID": "60002414", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Materials Science"}, "6701371448": {"Name": "Mizusawa M.", "AuthorID": "6701371448", "AffiliationID": "112571049", "AffiliationName": "Comprehensive Research Organization for Science and Society (CROSS)"}, "57191158875": {"Name": "Jiang J.", "AuthorID": "57191158875", "AffiliationID": "60002414", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Materials Science"}, "55245830700": {"Name": "Ito T.", "AuthorID": "55245830700", "AffiliationID": "112571049", "AffiliationName": "Comprehensive Research Organization for Science and Society (CROSS)"}}}
