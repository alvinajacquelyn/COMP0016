This study was carried out using a full-scale model of a portion of a shading device, in a semi-anechoic chamber, using traditional and sound absorbing louvres. The psychoacoustic effects produced by the shading system were evaluated through comparisons between averaged values of loudness, roughness and sharpness levels, as well as sound pressure levels as reference. Results highlighted that the sound absorbing shading device offers good attenuation in terms of loudness, roughness and sound pressure level, with a small reduction in sharpness. The traditional shading system studied does not efficiently reduce the analysed parameters, or even worsens the situation. Several analyses of variance were carried out, one for each situation studied. The sound source position and the louvres' tilt angle both produce statistically significant effects on almost all of the variations of the parameters studied. The analyses of the partial eta squared factors highlighted that source position and louvre tilt angle affect the variations of the parameters studied to a different degree in respect of the two types of louvres.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Building shading devices", "Insertion loss", "Loudness", "Psychoacoustics", "Roughness", "Sharpness"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85007427294", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Instrumentation", "PHYS", "3105"], ["Engineering (all)", "ENGI", "2200"], ["Process Chemistry and Technology", "CENG", "1508"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Fluid Flow and Transfer Processes", "CENG", "1507"]], "AuthorData": {"57132885500": {"Name": "Martello N.", "AuthorID": "57132885500", "AffiliationID": "60024690", "AffiliationName": "Engineering Department, University of Ferrara"}, "6507120315": {"Name": "Fausti P.", "AuthorID": "6507120315", "AffiliationID": "60024690", "AffiliationName": "Engineering Department, University of Ferrara"}, "55557756700": {"Name": "Aletta F.", "AuthorID": "55557756700", "AffiliationID": "60001881", "AffiliationName": "School of Architecture, University of Sheffield"}, "55485135500": {"Name": "Kang J.", "AuthorID": "55485135500", "AffiliationID": "60001881", "AffiliationName": "School of Architecture, University of Sheffield"}, "36718973400": {"Name": "Secchi S.", "AuthorID": "36718973400", "AffiliationID": "60021859", "AffiliationName": "Industrial Engineering Department, University of Florence"}}}
