In this context many different technologies have emerged accompanied by relevant learning material and resources. Our observation is that the vast number of learning activities is driven by multiple \u201cpersonal pedagogies\u201d which results in the fragmentation of the domain. To address this problem we propose the construct of \u201cactivity plan template\u201d, a generic design tool that will facilitate different stakeholders (teachers, instructors, researchers) to design learning activities for different robotic toolkits. In this paper we discuss the characteristics of the activity plan template and the research process employed to generate it. Since we report work in progress, we present here the first version of the activity plan template, the construction of which is based on a set of best practices identified and on previous work for the introduction of digital technologies in education.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Activity plan template", "Educational robotics", "Learning design"], "IndexKeywords": ["Activity plan", "Digital technologies", "Educational robotics", "Learning Activity", "Learning designs", "Learning materials", "Research process", "Work in progress"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84992671983", "SubjectAreas": [["Control and Systems Engineering", "ENGI", "2207"], ["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"]], "AuthorData": {"43461953000": {"Name": "Yiannoutsou N.", "AuthorID": "43461953000", "AffiliationID": "60028900", "AffiliationName": "UoA ETL, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens"}, "57191727683": {"Name": "Nikitopoulou S.", "AuthorID": "57191727683", "AffiliationID": "60028900", "AffiliationName": "UoA ETL, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens"}, "23091199800": {"Name": "Kynigos C.", "AuthorID": "23091199800", "AffiliationID": "60028900", "AffiliationName": "UoA ETL, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens"}, "56113382300": {"Name": "Gueorguiev I.", "AuthorID": "56113382300", "AffiliationID": "60110404", "AffiliationName": "ESI CEE, European Software Institute Center Eastern Europe"}, "57191736975": {"Name": "Fernandez J.", "AuthorID": "57191736975", "AffiliationID": "60018163", "AffiliationName": "ESI CEE ACIN Institute of Automation and Control, Vienna University of Technology"}}}
