However, most recent research has focused on the environmental and economic aspects of developing sustainable urban environment, whilst largely neglecting the social aspects. Contemporary political thinking in the UK often disregards the potential of the urban infrastructure to improve social equity. The aimof this studywas to analyse the impact of transport infrastructure on a variety of socialmeasures, in an empirical and ideologically unbiased fashion, using both quantitative and qualitative methods. We selected \"Tramlink\" as a case study: a light-rail system in the London Borough of Croydon which began operation in 2000. We used quantitativemethods, including advanced spatial statistics, to produce a more detailed analysis of social equity than has been previously published. This acknowledges that determining localised issues can produce more informed and effective policy interventions. Our results demonstrate that the physical properties of transport infrastructure and the non-physical attributes of society, in combination, help to create opportunities for individuals to succeed. We also find that in order to reduce the negative effects of austerity, public money could be more effectively spent if diverted to areas that are most in need which can be highlighted through localised investigations.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Geographically weighted regression", "Light railway (Tramlink)", "London", "Social equity", "Spatial accessibility", "Transport infrastructure investment", "Urban environment", "Urban transport"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85062824244", "SubjectAreas": [["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"], ["Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment", "ENER", "2105"], ["Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law", "ENVI", "2308"]], "AuthorData": {"57207769269": {"Name": "Cuthill N.", "AuthorID": "57207769269", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Bartlett School of Planning, University College London"}, "57193545823": {"Name": "Cao M.", "AuthorID": "57193545823", "AffiliationID": "60000508", "AffiliationName": "Department of Planning and Transport, University ofWestminster"}, "57202628780": {"Name": "Gao X.", "AuthorID": "57202628780", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Bartlett School of Planning, University College London"}, "57207781228": {"Name": "Zhang Y.", "AuthorID": "57207781228", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Bartlett School of Planning, University College London"}, "56946494800": {"Name": "Liu Y.", "AuthorID": "56946494800", "AffiliationID": "60006541", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urban Planning and Design, The University of Hong Kong"}}}
