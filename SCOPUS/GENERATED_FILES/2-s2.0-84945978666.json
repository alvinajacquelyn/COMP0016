Methods: We show that brief incubations with rapamycin, everolimus, FK506 or cyclosporine A increase the immunosuppressive potency of MSCs and other cell types. Results: The treated MSCs are up to 5-fold more potent at inhibiting the induced proliferation of T lymphocytes in vitro. We show that this effect probably is due to adsorption of the drug by the MSCs during pre-treatment, with subsequent diffusion into co-cultures at concentrations sufficient to inhibit T-cell proliferation. MSCs contain measurable amounts of rapamycin after a 15-min exposure, and the potentiating effect is blocked by a neutralizing antibody to the drug. With the use of a pre-clinical model of acute graft-versus-host disease, we demonstrate that a low dose of rapamycin-treated but not untreated umbilical cord-derived MSCs significantly inhibit the onset of disease. Conclusions: The use of treated MSCs may achieve clinical end points not reached with untreated MSCs and allow for infusion of fewer cells to reduce costs and minimize potential side effects.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Immunoregulation", "Immunosuppression", "Mesenchymal stromal cells", "Rapamycin", "Sirolimus"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Antibodies, Neutralizing", "Cell Proliferation", "Coculture Techniques", "Cyclosporine", "Disease Models, Animal", "Everolimus", "Female", "Graft vs Host Disease", "Humans", "Immune Tolerance", "Immunosuppression", "Immunosuppressive Agents", "Lymphocyte Activation", "Male", "Mesenchymal Stem Cell Transplantation", "Mesenchymal Stromal Cells", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred BALB C", "Sirolimus", "T-Lymphocytes", "Tacrolimus", "Umbilical Cord"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84945978666", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"], ["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Genetics (clinical)", "MEDI", "2716"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"], ["Cancer Research", "BIOC", "1306"], ["Transplantation", "MEDI", "2747"]], "AuthorData": {"6701516527": {"Name": "Girdlestone J.", "AuthorID": "6701516527", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity, University College"}, "6602952352": {"Name": "Pido-Lopez J.", "AuthorID": "6602952352", "AffiliationID": "60030968", "AffiliationName": "Histocompatibility and Immunogenetics Research Group, NHS Blood and Transplant"}, "56937557700": {"Name": "Srivastava S.", "AuthorID": "56937557700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity, University College"}, "7006391032": {"Name": "Navarrete C.V.", "AuthorID": "7006391032", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity, University College"}, "7202678975": {"Name": "Chai J.", "AuthorID": "7202678975", "AffiliationID": "60011520, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Transplantation, King's College"}, "7202583024": {"Name": "Lombardi G.", "AuthorID": "7202583024", "AffiliationID": "60011520, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Transplantation, King's College"}, "8651106700": {"Name": "Leaver N.", "AuthorID": "8651106700", "AffiliationID": "60022023", "AffiliationName": "UK National Monitoring Service for Sirolimus, Royal Brompton and oHarefield NHS Foundation Trust"}, "26664503900": {"Name": "Galleu A.", "AuthorID": "26664503900", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Regenerative and Haematological Medicine, Rayne Institute, King's College"}}}
