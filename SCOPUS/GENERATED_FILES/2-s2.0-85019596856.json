All rights reserved.The growing use of nanotechnology in high-tech industries is likely to become another way for humans to be exposed to intentionally generated engineered nanoparticles (NPs). Reduction in size to the nanoscale changes the characteristics of particles, primarily due to the increased surface-to-volume ratio. There are as yet no paradigms to anticipate the significance of any of these changes in characteristics. In this chapter, we describe the effect of NPs in living systems.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Live cells", "Nanoparticles", "Toxicity"], "IndexKeywords": ["Engineered nanoparticles", "Exposed to", "High tech industry", "Live cell", "Living systems", "Nano scale", "Surface-to-volume ratio"], "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85019596856", "SubjectAreas": [["Engineering (all)", "ENGI", "2200"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"]], "AuthorData": {"55195045900": {"Name": "Mukhopadhyay A.", "AuthorID": "55195045900", "AffiliationID": "60026548", "AffiliationName": "Rhodes University"}, "14067825400": {"Name": "Patra H.", "AuthorID": "14067825400", "AffiliationID": "60009358", "AffiliationName": "Linkoping University"}}}
