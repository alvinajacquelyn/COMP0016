Responding to his contemporaneous architectural crisis of the 1970s instigated by the rise of positivism, P\u00e9rez-G\u00f3mez uses Alexandre Koyr\u00e9's history of the scientific revolution as a mirror to reflect the historical developments of architectural theory upon it. Although effectively circumscribed, his deliberate exposure to an interdisciplinary history nonetheless contributes to the opening up of a much richer constellation of perspectives that illuminate the nature of the disciplinary crisis he was trying to negotiate. These in turn open up new lines of interdisciplinary inquiry for the present condition and the new wave of positivism that haunts contemporary theories of parametricism in a novel moment of crisis.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84924745282", "SubjectAreas": [["Architecture", "ENGI", "2216"], ["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["Visual Arts and Performing Arts", "ARTS", "1213"]], "AuthorData": {"56548839500": {"Name": "Giamarelos S.", "AuthorID": "56548839500", "AffiliationID": "60085003", "AffiliationName": "Bartlett School of Architecture, UCL"}}}
