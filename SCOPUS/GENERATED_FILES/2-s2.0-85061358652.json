To further the understanding of consumers\u2019 behavior, this study explores the association and conflicts between their ethical and legal judgments. In addition, it examines the way consumers\u2019 judgments depend on their mind-sets and the legal liability criterion of action (activity). In two experiments, participants were asked to judge the ethicality and legality of consumers\u2019 morally-questionable behaviors. Behavior activity and participants\u2019 mind-sets were manipulated. The results show that consumers are more likely to judge a behavior to be legal when they consider it ethical than when they consider it unethical. Nevertheless, conflicts between ethical and legal judgments are prevalent. Furthermore, ethical judgments, legal judgments, and the occurrence of conflicts between them depend on activity and on consumers\u2019 mind-sets. Finally, consumers report uncertainty about the ethicality and legality of a wide range of morally-questionable behaviors. Thus, the results paint a picture of individuals who perceive the law to be often beyond their reach or in conflict with their ethical principles. They portray both ethical and legal judgments as dynamically-changing, subjective, and context-dependent. Theoretical contribution and business applications are discussed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Ethical judgment", "Legal judgment", "Mind-set"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85061358652", "SubjectAreas": [["Business and International Management", "BUSI", "1403"], ["Business, Management and Accounting (all)", "BUSI", "1400"], ["Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)", "ARTS", "1201"], ["Economics and Econometrics", "ECON", "2002"], ["Law", "SOCI", "3308"]], "AuthorData": {"57164620300": {"Name": "Sobolev D.", "AuthorID": "57164620300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "School of Management, University College London"}, "57205743909": {"Name": "Voege N.", "AuthorID": "57205743909", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "School of Management, University College London"}}}
