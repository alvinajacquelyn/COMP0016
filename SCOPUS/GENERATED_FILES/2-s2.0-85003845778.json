Thus, even when environmental taxes are imposed, firms may be unable (or unwilling) to adjust their behaviour and technology in response to price signals. With a focus on energy and material efficiency investments, this paper systematically investigates how the theoretical assumptions of perfectly competitive and efficient markets are violated in practice, and how this results in complex and interlinked investment barriers. It classifies five categories of investment barriers: information, capacity, and financial constraints, as well as uncompetitive market structures and fiscal mismanagement; and presents evidence on each of these. It concludes by proposing a range of measures for mitigating investment barriers, and addressing their structural causes. Overall, the evidence presented in this paper aims to help increase the effectiveness of environmental taxes and regulation, by identifying market imperfections that environmental taxes alone cannot address.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Efficiency", "Environmental taxes", "Firms", "Investment barriers"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85003845778", "SubjectAreas": [["Economics and Econometrics", "ECON", "2002"]], "AuthorData": {"56331793000": {"Name": "Rentschler J.", "AuthorID": "56331793000", "AffiliationID": "60105954", "AffiliationName": "Oxford Institute for Energy Studies"}, "6603227818": {"Name": "Bleischwitz R.", "AuthorID": "6603227818", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Institute for Sustainable Resources"}, "57192304574": {"Name": "Flachenecker F.", "AuthorID": "57192304574", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Institute for Sustainable Resources"}}}
