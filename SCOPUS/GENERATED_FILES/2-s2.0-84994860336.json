Bayesian emulators based on Gaussian processes adequately quantify the uncertainty that results from the cost of the original simulator, and thus the inability to evaluate it on the whole input space. However, it is common in the literature that only a partial Bayesian analysis is carried out, whereby the underlying hyper-parameters are estimated via gradient-free optimization or genetic algorithms, to name a few methods. On the other hand, maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation could discard important regions of the hyper-parameter space. In this paper, we carry out a more complete Bayesian inference, that combines Slice Sampling with some recently developed sequential Monte Carlo samplers. The resulting algorithm improves the mixing in the sampling through the delayed-rejection nature of Slice Sampling, the inclusion of an annealing scheme akin to Asymptotically Independent Markov Sampling and parallelization via transitional Markov chain Monte Carlo. Examples related to the estimation of Gaussian process hyper-parameters are presented.
