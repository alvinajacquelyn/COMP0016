Patients and methods: This pharmacokinetic study enrolled patients admitted to the paediatric ICU for whom intravenous piperacillin/tazobactam (8:1 ratio) was indicated (75 mg/kg every 6 h based on piperacillin). Piperacillin/tazobactam concentrations were measured by an LC-MS/MS method. Pharmacokinetic data were analysed using non-linear mixed effects modelling. Results: Piperacillin and tazobactam blood samples were collected from 47 patients (median age 2.83 years; range 2months to 15 years). Piperacillin and tazobactam disposition was best described by a two-compartment model that included allometric scaling and a maturation function to account for the effect of growth and age. Mean clearance estimates for piperacillin and tazobactamwere 4.00 and 3.01 L/h for a child of 14 kg. Monte Carlo simulations showed that an intermittent infusion of 75mg/kg (based on piperacillin) every 4 h over 2 h, 100mg/kg every 4 h given over 1 h or a loading dose of 75mg/kg followed by a continuous infusion of 300mg/kg/24 h were theminimal requirements to achieve the therapeutic targets for piperacillin (60%f T>MIC >16mg/L). Conclusions: Standard intermittent dosing regimens do not ensure optimal piperacillin/tazobactam exposure in critically ill patients, thereby risking treatment failure. The use of a loading dose followed by a continuous infusion is recommended for treatment of severe infections in children >2months of age.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Anti-Bacterial Agents", "Bacterial Infections", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Critical Illness", "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug", "Drug Administration Schedule", "Female", "Humans", "Infant", "Infusions, Intravenous", "Male", "Microbial Sensitivity Tests", "Monte Carlo Method", "Penicillanic Acid", "Piperacillin", "Prospective Studies"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85021818273", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"], ["Microbiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2726"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"14059947300": {"Name": "De Cock P.", "AuthorID": "14059947300", "AffiliationID": "116338381", "AffiliationName": "Division of Pharmacology, Leiden Academic Centre for Drug Research"}, "6602446276": {"Name": "Robays H.", "AuthorID": "6602446276", "AffiliationID": "60068590", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacy, Ghent University Hospital"}, "7003442552": {"Name": "De Paepe P.", "AuthorID": "7003442552", "AffiliationID": "60068608, 60033316", "AffiliationName": "Heymans Institute of Pharmacology, Ghent University"}, "23391694900": {"Name": "de Jaeger A.", "AuthorID": "23391694900", "AffiliationID": "60068590", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Intensive Care, Ghent University Hospital"}, "7202583446": {"Name": "Willems J.", "AuthorID": "7202583446", "AffiliationID": "60068590", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Intensive Care, Ghent University Hospital"}, "36054330400": {"Name": "van Dijkman S.", "AuthorID": "36054330400", "AffiliationID": "116338381", "AffiliationName": "Division of Pharmacology, Leiden Academic Centre for Drug Research"}, "8536932300": {"Name": "Della Pasqua O.", "AuthorID": "8536932300", "AffiliationID": "118735506", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics"}, "55327051100": {"Name": "Carlier M.", "AuthorID": "55327051100", "AffiliationID": "60068590", "AffiliationName": "Department of Laboratory Medicine, Ghent University Hospital"}, "7004046648": {"Name": "Verstraete A.", "AuthorID": "7004046648", "AffiliationID": "60033316", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Chemistry, Microbiology and Immunology, Ghent University"}, "7005065008": {"Name": "Delanghe J.", "AuthorID": "7005065008", "AffiliationID": "60033316", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Chemistry, Microbiology and Immunology, Ghent University"}, "12760188700": {"Name": "Walle J.", "AuthorID": "12760188700", "AffiliationID": "60068590", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Nephrology, Ghent University Hospital"}}}
