Skipping of exons adjacent to out-of-frame deletions has proven to restore dystrophin expression in Duchenne patients. Exon 51 has been the most studied target in both preclinical and clinical settings and the availability of standardized procedures to quantify exon skipping would be advantageous for the evaluation of preclinical and clinical data. Objective To compare methods currently used to quantify antisense oligonucleotide\u00b1induced exon 51 skipping in the DMD transcript and to provide guidance about the method to use. Methods Six laboratories shared blinded RNA samples from Duchenne patient-derived muscle cells treated with different amounts of exon 51 targeting antisense oligonucleotide. Exon 51 skipping levels were quantified using five different techniques: Digital droplet PCR, single PCR assessed with Agilent bioanalyzer, nested PCR with agarose gel image analysis by either ImageJ or GeneTools software and quantitative real-time PCR. Results Differences in mean exon skipping levels and dispersion around the mean were observed across the different techniques. Results obtained by digital droplet PCR were reproducible and showed the smallest dispersion. Exon skipping quantification with the other methods showed overestimation of exon skipping or high data variation. Conclusions Our results suggest that digital droplet PCR was the most precise and quantitative method. The quantification of exon 51 skipping by Agilent bioanalyzer after a single round of PCR was the second-best choice with a 2.3-fold overestimation of exon 51 skipping levels compared to digital droplet PCR.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Cell Line", "Dystrophin", "Exons", "Humans", "Muscular Dystrophy, Duchenne", "Myoblasts", "Oligonucleotides, Antisense", "Polymerase Chain Reaction", "RNA Splicing"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85054356248", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"56060758600": {"Name": "Hiller M.", "AuthorID": "56060758600", "AffiliationID": "60015618", "AffiliationName": "Department of Human Genetics, Leiden University Medical Center"}, "6506555410": {"Name": "Aartsma-Rus A.", "AuthorID": "6506555410", "AffiliationID": "60015618", "AffiliationName": "Department of Human Genetics, Leiden University Medical Center"}, "57218216666": {"Name": "Spitali P.", "AuthorID": "57218216666", "AffiliationID": "60015618", "AffiliationName": "Department of Human Genetics, Leiden University Medical Center"}, "56028020900": {"Name": "Falzarano M.S.", "AuthorID": "56028020900", "AffiliationID": "60024690", "AffiliationName": "UOL of Medical Genetics, University of Ferrara"}, "57189066538": {"Name": "Osman H.", "AuthorID": "57189066538", "AffiliationID": "60024690", "AffiliationName": "UOL of Medical Genetics, University of Ferrara"}, "56942300000": {"Name": "Ferlini A.", "AuthorID": "56942300000", "AffiliationID": "60024690", "AffiliationName": "UOL of Medical Genetics, University of Ferrara"}, "57197845229": {"Name": "Garcia-Jimenez I.", "AuthorID": "57197845229", "AffiliationID": "60113250", "AffiliationName": "Neuromuscular Disorders Group, Biocruces Bizkaia Health Research Institute"}, "52664221000": {"Name": "Ruiz-Del-Yerro E.", "AuthorID": "52664221000", "AffiliationID": "60113250", "AffiliationName": "Neuromuscular Disorders Group, Biocruces Bizkaia Health Research Institute"}, "26657120200": {"Name": "Arechavala-Gomeza V.", "AuthorID": "26657120200", "AffiliationID": "60113250", "AffiliationName": "Neuromuscular Disorders Group, Biocruces Bizkaia Health Research Institute"}, "57221297426": {"Name": "Sardone V.", "AuthorID": "57221297426", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dubowitz Neuromuscular Centre, University College London, Institute of Child Health"}, "35612015900": {"Name": "Anthony K.", "AuthorID": "35612015900", "AffiliationID": "60000931", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Health and Society, University of Northampton"}, "7102038246": {"Name": "Muntoni F.", "AuthorID": "7102038246", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60015879, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Neuromuscular Diseases, University College London, Institute of Child Health"}, "57191484656": {"Name": "Verheul R.C.", "AuthorID": "57191484656", "AffiliationID": "60003426", "AffiliationName": "BioMarin Nederland B.V."}, "6603563450": {"Name": "Datson N.A.", "AuthorID": "6603563450", "AffiliationID": "60003426", "AffiliationName": "BioMarin Nederland B.V."}, "20235763000": {"Name": "Popplewell L.", "AuthorID": "20235763000", "AffiliationID": "60020595", "AffiliationName": "Centre of Biomedical Sciences, School of Biological Sciences, Royal Holloway University of London"}, "7103204913": {"Name": "Dickson G.", "AuthorID": "7103204913", "AffiliationID": "60020595", "AffiliationName": "Centre of Biomedical Sciences, School of Biological Sciences, Royal Holloway University of London"}, "8062998000": {"Name": "Goeman J.J.", "AuthorID": "8062998000", "AffiliationID": "60015618", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Statistics and Bioinformatics, Leiden University Medical Center"}, "6507658532": {"Name": "Mamchaoui K.", "AuthorID": "6507658532", "AffiliationID": "60000905, 60157980, 60001422", "AffiliationName": "INSERM, Institute of Myology, Center of Research in Myology, Sorbonne Universities, UPMC Univ Paris 6"}}}
