Journal of Clinical Nursing Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.Aims and objectives: To explore the experiences and perceptions of healthcare staff caring for people with dementia in the acute setting. This article focuses on the methodological process of conducting framework synthesis using nvivo for each stage of the review: screening, data extraction, synthesis and critical appraisal. Background: Qualitative evidence synthesis brings together many research findings in a meaningful way that can be used to guide practice and policy development. For this purpose, synthesis must be conducted in a comprehensive and rigorous way. There has been previous discussion on how using nvivo can assist in enhancing and illustrate the rigorous processes involved. Design: Qualitative framework synthesis. Methods: Twelve documents, or research reports, based on nine studies, were included for synthesis. Conclusion: The benefits of using nvivo are outlined in terms of facilitating teams of researchers to systematically and rigorously synthesise findings. nvivo functions were used to conduct a sensitivity analysis. Some valuable lessons were learned, and these are presented to assist and guide researchers who wish to use similar methods in future. Relevance to clinical practice: Ultimately, good qualitative evidence synthesis will provide practitioners and policymakers with significant information that will guide decision-making on many aspects of clinical practice. The example provided explored how people with dementia are cared for acute settings.", "AuthorKeywords": ["dementia", "framework synthesis", "nvivo", "qualitative evidence synthesis", "sensitivity analysis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Data Collection", "Dementia", "Humans", "Nursing Research", "Qualitative Research", "Research Design"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85013875493", "SubjectAreas": [["Nursing (all)", "NURS", "2900"]], "AuthorData": {"36130307000": {"Name": "Houghton C.", "AuthorID": "36130307000", "AffiliationID": "60008539", "AffiliationName": "School of Nursing and Midwifery, National University of Ireland, Galway"}, "26646851500": {"Name": "Murphy K.", "AuthorID": "26646851500", "AffiliationID": "60008539", "AffiliationName": "School of Nursing and Midwifery, National University of Ireland, Galway"}, "7102986834": {"Name": "Casey D.", "AuthorID": "7102986834", "AffiliationID": "60008539", "AffiliationName": "School of Nursing and Midwifery, National University of Ireland, Galway"}, "57188555820": {"Name": "Meehan B.", "AuthorID": "57188555820", "AffiliationID": "116471868", "AffiliationName": "QDA Training Ltd"}, "57220582018": {"Name": "Thomas J.", "AuthorID": "57220582018", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Social Science Research Unit, UCL Institute of Education, University College London"}, "7005094294": {"Name": "Brooker D.", "AuthorID": "7005094294", "AffiliationID": "60000972", "AffiliationName": "University of Worcester Association for Dementia Studies, Institute of Health and Society, University of Worcester"}}}
