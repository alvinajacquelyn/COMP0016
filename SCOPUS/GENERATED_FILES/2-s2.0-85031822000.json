For patients where surgery is not the treatment of choice, for example in the elderly, in case of severe comorbidity, inoperability, or refusal of surgery alternative treatment options are available. These treatment options include active surveillance (AS), radiofrequency ablation (RFA), cryoablation (CA) microwave ablation (MWA), or stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT). In the present overview, the efficacy, safety, and outcome of these different options are summarized, particularly focusing on recent developments. Materials and Methods: Databases of MEDLINE (through PubMed), EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library were systematically searched according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) criteria. The search was performed in December 2016, and included a search period from 2010 to 2016. The terms and synonyms used were renal cell carcinoma, active surveillance radiofrequency ablation, microwave ablation, cryoablation and stereotactic body radiotherapy. Results: The database search identified 2806 records, in total 73 articles were included to assess the rationale and clinical evidence of alternative treatment modalities for small renal masses. The methodological quality of the included articles varied between level 2b and level 4. Conclusion: Alternative treatment modalities, such as AS, RFA, CA, MWA, and SBRT, are treatment options especially for those patients who are unfit to undergo an invasive treatment. There are no randomized controlled trials available comparing surgery and less invasive modalities, leading to a low quality on the reported articles. A case-controlled registry might be an alternative to compare outcomes of noninvasive treatment modalities in the future.", "AuthorKeywords": ["active surveillance", "cryoablation", "focal therapy", "microwave ablation, stereotactic body radiotherapy", "minimal invasive", "radio frequency ablation", "renal cancer"], "IndexKeywords": ["Ablation Techniques", "Carcinoma, Renal Cell", "Catheter Ablation", "Cryosurgery", "Humans", "Kidney Neoplasms", "Nephrons", "Radiosurgery"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85031822000", "SubjectAreas": [["Urology", "MEDI", "2748"]], "AuthorData": {"56462368400": {"Name": "Prins F.", "AuthorID": "56462368400", "AffiliationID": "60032724", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiation Oncology, University Medical Center Utrecht"}, "16506562600": {"Name": "Kerkmeijer L.", "AuthorID": "16506562600", "AffiliationID": "60032724", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiation Oncology, University Medical Center Utrecht"}, "56954743100": {"Name": "Pronk A.", "AuthorID": "56954743100", "AffiliationID": "60102768", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, Tergooi Hospital"}, "11340179500": {"Name": "Vonken E.", "AuthorID": "11340179500", "AffiliationID": "60032724", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, University Medical Center Utrecht"}, "16203334900": {"Name": "Meijer R.", "AuthorID": "16203334900", "AffiliationID": "60032724", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, University Medical Center Utrecht"}, "7004237921": {"Name": "Bex A.", "AuthorID": "7004237921", "AffiliationID": "60070177, 60015205", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, Netherlands Cancer Institute, Antoni Van Leeuwenhoek Hospital"}, "56628985300": {"Name": "Barendrecht M.", "AuthorID": "56628985300", "AffiliationID": "60032724", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, Tergooi Hospital, Hilversum and University Medical Center Utrecht"}}}
