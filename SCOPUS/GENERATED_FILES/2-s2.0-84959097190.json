However high blood concentrations of lipophilic, alkylating drugs result in brain uptake, but cause myelosuppression. We hypothesised that nanoparticles could achieve therapeutic brain concentrations without dose-limiting myelosuppression. Methods: Mice were dosed with either intravenous lomustine Molecular Envelope Technology (MET) nanoparticles (13 mg kg-1) or ethanolic lomustine (6.5 mg kg-1) and tissues analysed. Efficacy was assessed in an orthotopic U-87 MG glioblastoma model, following intravenous MET lomustine (daily 13 mg kg-1) or ethanolic lomustine (daily 1.2 mg kg-1 - the highest repeated dose possible). Myelosuppression and MET particle macrophage uptake were also investigated. Results: The MET formulation resulted in modest brain targeting (brain/ bone AUC0-4h ratios for MET and ethanolic lomustine = 0.90 and 0.53 respectively and brain/ liver AUC0-4h ratios for MET and ethanolic lomustine = 0.24 and 0.15 respectively). The MET formulation significantly increased mice (U-87 MG tumours) survival times; with MET lomustine, ethanolic lomustine and untreated mean survival times of 33.2, 22.5 and 21.3 days respectively and there were no material treatment-related differences in blood and femoral cell counts. Macrophage uptake is slower for MET nanoparticles than for liposomes. Conclusions: Particulate drug formulations improved brain tumour therapy without major bone marrow toxicity.", "AuthorKeywords": ["glioblastoma multiforme", "lomustine", "molecular envelope technology (MET)", "myelosuppression", "nanoparticles"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating", "Bone Marrow", "Brain", "Brain Neoplasms", "Cell Line, Tumor", "Drug Delivery Systems", "Glioblastoma", "Humans", "Lomustine", "Male", "Mice", "Nanoparticles"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84959097190", "SubjectAreas": [["Biotechnology", "BIOC", "1305"], ["Molecular Medicine", "BIOC", "1313"], ["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"], ["Pharmaceutical Science", "PHAR", "3003"], ["Organic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1605"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"57140776700": {"Name": "Fisusi F.A.", "AuthorID": "57140776700", "AffiliationID": "60016379, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "54884907000": {"Name": "Siew A.", "AuthorID": "54884907000", "AffiliationID": "60016379, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "6602743329": {"Name": "Chooi K.W.", "AuthorID": "6602743329", "AffiliationID": "60016379, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "57220285611": {"Name": "Okubanjo O.", "AuthorID": "57220285611", "AffiliationID": "60016379, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "57140850100": {"Name": "Lalatsa K.", "AuthorID": "57140850100", "AffiliationID": "60016379, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "55345467100": {"Name": "Serrano D.", "AuthorID": "55345467100", "AffiliationID": "60016379, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "57189666030": {"Name": "Stapleton P.", "AuthorID": "57189666030", "AffiliationID": "60016379, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "6604050498": {"Name": "Sch\u00e4tzlein A.G.", "AuthorID": "6604050498", "AffiliationID": "60159334", "AffiliationName": "Nanomerics Ltd.
