A basic antenna configuration is analyzed and modified through an optimization aiming at reducing the size of the antenna and focusing the radiated power in a single lobe to be directed toward the wall and the targets to be detected. Both the basic and the optimized antennas have been manufactured and tested. The optimized patch antennas and a conventional Vivaldi antenna have been successfully used in the frequency-modulated interrupted continuous wave (FMICW) radar system developed at Durham University. Results of a novel wall-removal technique for TTWI using numerical simulations and measurements aimed at the detection of stationary targets and people are presented.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Printed antennas", "through-The-Wall imaging", "UWB radar"], "IndexKeywords": ["Antenna configurations", "Design and optimization", "Frequency modulated interrupted continuous waves", "Printed antenna", "Radar applications", "Simulations and measurements", "Through the wall imaging", "UWB radars"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84924569827", "SubjectAreas": [["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"55574564400": {"Name": "Fioranelli F.", "AuthorID": "55574564400", "AffiliationID": "60022175", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Communications Systems, School of Engineering and Computing Sciences, Durham University"}, "7003713925": {"Name": "Salous S.", "AuthorID": "7003713925", "AffiliationID": "60022175", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Communications Systems, School of Engineering and Computing Sciences, Durham University"}, "55576426600": {"Name": "Raimundo X.", "AuthorID": "55576426600", "AffiliationID": "60022175", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Communications Systems, School of Engineering and Computing Sciences, Durham University"}, "55970976700": {"Name": "Ndip I.", "AuthorID": "55970976700", "AffiliationID": "60007915", "AffiliationName": "Fraunhofer Institut f\u00fcr Zuverl\u00e4sssigkeit und MIkrointegration, Fraunhofer IZM"}}}
