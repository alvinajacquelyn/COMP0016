Architecture-on-Demand based hybrid optical switched (OPS/OCS) data centre network (DCN) fabric is introduced, which is able to realise different inter-And intra-cluster configurations and dynamically support diverse traffic in the DC. The optical DCN is controlled and managed by a software-defined networking (SDN) enabled control plane to achieve high programmability. Moreover, virtual data centre (VDC) composition is developed as an application of such software-defined optical DC to create VDC slices for different tenants.", "AuthorKeywords": ["optical data centre (DC)", "software-defined networking (SDN)", "virtual data centre (VDC)", "virtualisation"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84940971940", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"57199616607": {"Name": "Shuping P.", "AuthorID": "57199616607", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "High Performance Networks Group, University of Bristol"}, "55910101200": {"Name": "Bingli G.", "AuthorID": "55910101200", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "High Performance Networks Group, University of Bristol"}, "56822889800": {"Name": "Yi S.", "AuthorID": "56822889800", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "High Performance Networks Group, University of Bristol"}, "9274397600": {"Name": "Zervas G.", "AuthorID": "9274397600", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "High Performance Networks Group, University of Bristol"}, "8723651100": {"Name": "Nejabati R.", "AuthorID": "8723651100", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "High Performance Networks Group, University of Bristol"}, "12784155200": {"Name": "Simeonidou D.", "AuthorID": "12784155200", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "High Performance Networks Group, University of Bristol"}}}
