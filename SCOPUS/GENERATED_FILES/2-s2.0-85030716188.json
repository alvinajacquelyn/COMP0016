Published by John Wiley & Sons LtdBackground: Patients can and do search the Internet for information on various health-related topics. YouTube\u2122 is one popular website they may consult. Aim: To examine the quality of information offered by YouTube\u2122 for patients seeking information on early childhood caries (ECC). Design: YouTube\u2122 was searched for videos on ECC. The usefulness of selected videos in providing adequate information about ECC was evaluated using a 13-point usefulness score. The guidelines of the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry were used for benchmarking. Results: Most videos were uploaded by healthcare professionals (60%, n = 18). Videos had generally low usefulness scores (mean: 5.1 \u00b1 2.9; range: 1\u201311). An average YouTube\u2122 video on ECC was viewed two times/day (range: 0.07\u201334.4 views/day). Less useful videos ranked early on the viewing list, and viewer's interactions with videos were not affected significantly by their usefulness. Conclusion: YouTube\u2122 should not be used as a trusted site for educating patients on ECC.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Child, Preschool", "Consumer Health Information", "Dental Caries", "Health Education, Dental", "Humans", "Internet", "Parents"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85030716188", "SubjectAreas": [["Dentistry (all)", "DENT", "3500"]], "AuthorData": {"44260895700": {"Name": "ElKarmi R.", "AuthorID": "44260895700", "AffiliationID": "60064180", "AffiliationName": "Department of Dentistry, The University of Jordan Hospital"}, "36945655800": {"Name": "Hassona Y.", "AuthorID": "36945655800", "AffiliationID": "60064180", "AffiliationName": "Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Oral Medicine and Periodontology, School of Dentistry, The University of Jordan"}, "57115278600": {"Name": "Taimeh D.", "AuthorID": "57115278600", "AffiliationID": "60064180", "AffiliationName": "Department of Dentistry, The University of Jordan Hospital"}, "55183840900": {"Name": "Scully C.", "AuthorID": "55183840900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
