{"Title": "Brief Report: Association of Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor\u2013Associated Periodic Syndrome With Gonosomal Mosaicism of a Novel 24-Nucleotide TNFRSF1A Deletion", "Year": 2016, "Source": "Arthritis Rheum.", "Volume": "68", "Issue": 8, "Art.No": null, "PageStart": 2044, "PageEnd": 2049, "CitedBy": 28, "DOI": "10.1002/art.39683", "Link": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84979588276&origin=inward", "Abstract": "\u00a9 2016, American College of RheumatologyObjective: To investigate the molecular cause of persistent fevers in a patient returning from working overseas, in whom investigations for tropical diseases yielded negative results. Methods: DNA was extracted from the patient's whole blood, leukocyte subpopulations, saliva, hair root, and sperm. The TNFRSF1A gene was analyzed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), allele-specific PCR, Sanger sequencing, and next-generation sequencing. In silico molecular modeling was performed to predict the structural and functional consequences of the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) type I protein mutation in the extracellular domain. Results: Sanger sequencing corroborated by allele-specific PCR detected a novel in-frame deletion of 24 nucleotides (c.255_278del) in the TNFRSF1A gene, and this was subsequently confirmed using next-generation sequencing methods (targeted sequencing and amplicon-based deep sequencing). Results of amplicon-based deep sequencing revealed variable frequency of the mutant allele among different cell lines, including sperm, thus supporting the presence of gonosomal TNFRSF1A mosaicism. The patient had a complete response to treatment with interleukin-1 (IL-1) blockade, with resolution of symptoms and normalization of acute-phase protein levels. Conclusion: We describe the first case of gonosomal TNFRSF1A mosaicism in a patient with TNFR-associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS), which was attributable to a novel, somatic 24-nucleotide in-frame deletion. The clinical picture in this patient, including the complete response to IL-1 blockade, was typical of that found in TRAPS. This case adds TRAPS to the list of dominantly inherited autoinflammatory diseases reported to be caused by somatic (or postzygotic) mutation.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84979588276", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Rheumatology", "MEDI", "2745"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"]], "AuthorData": {"14012189400": {"Name": "Rowczenio D.", "AuthorID": "14012189400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "55598248400": {"Name": "Trojer H.", "AuthorID": "55598248400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "55376853000": {"Name": "Omoyinmi E.", "AuthorID": "55376853000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "55547947300": {"Name": "Baginska A.", "AuthorID": "55547947300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "57190380057": {"Name": "Silva Pilorz C.", "AuthorID": "57190380057", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "57190370553": {"Name": "Wang G.", "AuthorID": "57190370553", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "41861760800": {"Name": "Lane T.", "AuthorID": "41861760800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "7004602186": {"Name": "Brogan P.", "AuthorID": "7004602186", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "35464959200": {"Name": "Hawkins P.", "AuthorID": "35464959200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "7004915734": {"Name": "Lachmann H.", "AuthorID": "7004915734", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "56553329500": {"Name": "Ar\u00f3stegui J.", "AuthorID": "56553329500", "AffiliationID": "60030315, 60010814", "AffiliationName": "Hospital Clinic\u2013Institut d'Investigacions Biom\u00e8diques August Pi i Sunyer"}, "56528370300": {"Name": "Mensa-Vilaro A.", "AuthorID": "56528370300", "AffiliationID": "60030315, 60010814", "AffiliationName": "Hospital Clinic\u2013Institut d'Investigacions Biom\u00e8diques August Pi i Sunyer"}, "56901046500": {"Name": "Arakelov G.", "AuthorID": "56901046500", "AffiliationID": "60070848, 60070855", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Molecular Biology NAS RA, Laboratory of Computation Modeling of Biological Processes, and Russian-Armenian Slavonic University, Group for Bioinformation Technologies of Research Center for Critical Technologies"}}}
