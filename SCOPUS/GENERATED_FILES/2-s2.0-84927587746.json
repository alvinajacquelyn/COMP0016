Methods A cross-sectional study involving 136 clinically heterogeneous patients with ALS and 104 healthy and neurological controls was extended to include a prospective analysis of 74 of these ALS cases, with samplings at approximately 3-month intervals in a follow-up period of up to 3 years. We analysed the correlation between longitudinal NfH-phosphoform levels and disease progression. Temporal patterns of NfH changes were evaluated using multilevel linear regression. Results Baseline plasma NfH levels were higher than controls only in patients with ALS with short disease duration to baseline sampling. Compared with controls, fast-progressing patients with ALS, particularly those with a short diagnostic latency and disease duration, had higher plasma NfH levels at an early stage and lower levels closer to end-stage disease. Lower NfH levels between visits were associated with rapid functional deterioration. We also detected antibodies against NfH, NfH aggregates and NfH cleavage products. Conclusions Disease progression in ALS involves defined trajectories of plasma NfH levels, reflecting speed of neurological decline and survival. Intervisit plasma NfH changes are also indicative of disease progression. This study confirms that longitudinal measurements of NfH plasma levels are more informative than cross-sectional studies, where the time of sampling may represent a bias in the interpretation of the results. Autoantibodies against NfH aggregates and NfH cleavage products may explain the variable expression of plasma NfH with disease progression.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis", "Autoantibodies", "Case-Control Studies", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Disease Progression", "Female", "Humans", "Longitudinal Studies", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Neurofilament Proteins"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84927587746", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"7404804808": {"Name": "Lu C.H.", "AuthorID": "7404804808", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Sobell Department of Motor Neuroscience and Movement Disorders, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "55347725200": {"Name": "Topping J.", "AuthorID": "55347725200", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Neuroscience and Trauma, Blizard Institute, Queen Mary University of London"}, "8937520800": {"Name": "Kuhle J.", "AuthorID": "8937520800", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Neuroscience and Trauma, Blizard Institute, Queen Mary University of London"}, "34770127900": {"Name": "Giovannoni G.", "AuthorID": "34770127900", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Neuroscience and Trauma, Blizard Institute, Queen Mary University of London"}, "7003290890": {"Name": "Malaspina A.", "AuthorID": "7003290890", "AffiliationID": "112958820", "AffiliationName": "North-East London and Essex MND Care and Research Centre"}, "57203069719": {"Name": "Greensmith L.", "AuthorID": "57203069719", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Neuromuscular Diseases, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "7006826396": {"Name": "Petzold A.", "AuthorID": "7006826396", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroinflammation, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "56254656700": {"Name": "Allen K.", "AuthorID": "56254656700", "AffiliationID": "60170321", "AffiliationName": "Basildon and Thurrock University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "36105102100": {"Name": "Macdonald-Wallis C.", "AuthorID": "36105102100", "AffiliationID": "60020650, 60172455", "AffiliationName": "MRC Integrative Epidemiology Unit, University of Bristol"}, "7403674316": {"Name": "Howard R.", "AuthorID": "7403674316", "AffiliationID": "60020650, 60172455", "AffiliationName": "MRC Integrative Epidemiology Unit, University of Bristol"}, "56114200800": {"Name": "Clarke J.", "AuthorID": "56114200800", "AffiliationID": "60020736", "AffiliationName": "National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "7005900136": {"Name": "Orrell R.", "AuthorID": "7005900136", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "56491440700": {"Name": "Pearce N.", "AuthorID": "56491440700", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Statistics, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "12802595400": {"Name": "Fratta P.", "AuthorID": "12802595400", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "57221060388": {"Name": "Sidle K.", "AuthorID": "57221060388", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "7006461325": {"Name": "Fish M.", "AuthorID": "7006461325", "AffiliationID": "60006737", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Trial Unit, Musgrove Park Hospital"}}}
