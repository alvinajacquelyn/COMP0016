However, research in hospice settings is very challenging. This paper describes a case study of a successful multidisciplinary research team approach (MDRT) to the recruitment of participants (hospice patients, family members and health professionals) for a study in a hospice setting on the economic evaluation of end-of-life care. A successful recruitment plan includes three key strategies: identifying key members of the MDRT early in the research process; having a clear and constant communication stream; and creating an environment where all team members have a shared commitment to the research, all voices are heard and valued, and everyone contributes to the research aims. An MDRT approach will be helpful to guide the development of successful recruitment plans for academic-community research partnerships in the hospice setting.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Case study", "End of life", "Hospice", "Palliative care", "Recruitment", "Research"], "IndexKeywords": ["Clinical Nursing Research", "Cost-Benefit Analysis", "England", "Hospice and Palliative Care Nursing", "Humans", "Interdisciplinary Communication", "Intersectoral Collaboration", "Patient Care Team", "Patient Selection", "State Medicine", "Terminal Care"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84979233665", "SubjectAreas": [["Advanced and Specialized Nursing", "NURS", "2902"]], "AuthorData": {"56274044900": {"Name": "Campbell C.L.", "AuthorID": "56274044900", "AffiliationID": "60032396", "AffiliationName": "University of Virginia, School of Nursing"}, "36650256300": {"Name": "Bailey C.", "AuthorID": "36650256300", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "School of Nursing, Institute of Clinical Sciences, University of Birmingham"}, "57190049117": {"Name": "Armour K.", "AuthorID": "57190049117", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Marie Curie Hospice"}, "57190046872": {"Name": "Perry R.", "AuthorID": "57190046872", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Marie Curie Hospice, Solihull"}, "55295763500": {"Name": "Orlando R.", "AuthorID": "55295763500", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "CLAHRC Wessex, University of Southampton"}, "55211236400": {"Name": "Kinghorn P.", "AuthorID": "55211236400", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "Health Economics Unit, Institute of Applied Health Research, University of Birmingham"}, "7403623810": {"Name": "Jones L.", "AuthorID": "7403623810", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "55971738500": {"Name": "Coast J.", "AuthorID": "55971738500", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "School of Social and Community Medicine, University of Bristol"}}}
