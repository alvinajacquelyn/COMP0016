We observed widespread acetylomic variation associated with AD neuropathology, identifying 4,162 differential peaks (false discovery rate < 0.05) between AD cases and controls. Differentially acetylated peaks were enriched in disease-related biological pathways and included regions annotated to genes involved in the progression of amyloid-\u03b2 and tau pathology (for example, APP, PSEN1, PSEN2, and MAPT), as well as regions containing variants associated with sporadic late-onset AD. Partitioned heritability analysis highlighted a highly significant enrichment of AD risk variants in entorhinal cortex H3K27ac peak regions. AD-associated variable H3K27ac was associated with transcriptional variation at proximal genes including CR1, GPR22, KMO, PIM3, PSEN1, and RGCC. In addition to identifying molecular pathways associated with AD neuropathology, we present a framework for genome-wide studies of histone modifications in complex disease.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Acetylation", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Alzheimer Disease", "Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor", "Entorhinal Cortex", "Female", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Histones", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "tau Proteins"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85055464133", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"]], "AuthorData": {"57188564934": {"Name": "Marzi S.J.", "AuthorID": "57188564934", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "The Blizard Institute, Queen Mary University of London"}, "7801372409": {"Name": "Troakes C.", "AuthorID": "7801372409", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience, King\u2019s College London"}, "57203252040": {"Name": "Al-Sarraj S.", "AuthorID": "57203252040", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience, King\u2019s College London"}, "57196214731": {"Name": "Leung S.K.", "AuthorID": "57196214731", "AffiliationID": "60111707, 60026479", "AffiliationName": "University of Exeter Medical School, University of Exeter"}, "55602412500": {"Name": "Hannon E.", "AuthorID": "55602412500", "AffiliationID": "60111707, 60026479", "AffiliationName": "University of Exeter Medical School, University of Exeter"}, "57209188725": {"Name": "Smith A.R.", "AuthorID": "57209188725", "AffiliationID": "60111707, 60026479", "AffiliationName": "University of Exeter Medical School, University of Exeter"}, "35171140700": {"Name": "Pishva E.", "AuthorID": "35171140700", "AffiliationID": "60018869", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry and Neuropsychology, Maastricht University Medical Centre"}, "15520231300": {"Name": "Poschmann J.", "AuthorID": "15520231300", "AffiliationID": "60032006, 60000905, 60105579", "AffiliationName": "Centre de Recherche en Transplantation et Immunologie, Inserm, Universit\u00e9 de Nantes"}, "7403339775": {"Name": "Moore K.", "AuthorID": "7403339775", "AffiliationID": "60111707, 60026479", "AffiliationName": "University of Exeter Medical School, University of Exeter"}, "8854048100": {"Name": "Lunnon K.", "AuthorID": "8854048100", "AffiliationID": "60111707, 60026479", "AffiliationName": "University of Exeter Medical School, University of Exeter"}, "57219048880": {"Name": "Mill J.", "AuthorID": "57219048880", "AffiliationID": "60111707, 60026479", "AffiliationName": "University of Exeter Medical School, University of Exeter"}, "24282240100": {"Name": "Ribarska T.", "AuthorID": "24282240100", "AffiliationID": "60105037", "AffiliationName": "Oslo University Hospital"}, "57193033325": {"Name": "Beck S.", "AuthorID": "57193033325", "AffiliationID": "60109234, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Cancer Institute, University College London"}, "56277801800": {"Name": "Newman S.", "AuthorID": "56277801800", "AffiliationID": "60001359", "AffiliationName": "University of Essex"}, "7003409002": {"Name": "Schalkwyk L.C.", "AuthorID": "7003409002", "AffiliationID": "60001359", "AffiliationName": "University of Essex"}}}
