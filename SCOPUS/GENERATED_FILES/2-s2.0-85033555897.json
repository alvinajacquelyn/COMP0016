In the European plain there is evidence for fully developed agrarian societies by 7,500 cal. yr BP, yet a well-established agrarian society does not appear in the north until 6,000 cal. yr BP for unknown reasons. Here we show a sudden increase in summer temperature at 6,000 cal. yr BP in northern Europe using a well-dated, high resolution record of sea surface temperature (SST) from the Baltic Sea. This temperature rise resulted in hypoxic conditions across the entire Baltic sea as revealed by multiple sedimentary records and supported by marine ecosystem modeling. Comparison with summed probability distributions of radiocarbon dates from archaeological sites indicate that this temperature rise coincided with both the introduction of farming, and a dramatic population increase. The evidence supports the hypothesis that the boundary of farming rapidly extended north at 6,000 cal. yr BP because terrestrial conditions in a previously marginal region improved.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Agriculture", "Archaeology", "Climate Change", "Demography", "Europe", "History, Ancient", "Humans", "Seasons"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85033555897", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"57191620323": {"Name": "Warden L.", "AuthorID": "57191620323", "AffiliationID": "60007989, 60004789", "AffiliationName": "NIOZ Royal Netherlands Institute for Sea Research, Department of Marine Microbiology and Biogeochemistry, Utrecht University"}, "55857005800": {"Name": "Sollai M.", "AuthorID": "55857005800", "AffiliationID": "60007989, 60004789", "AffiliationName": "NIOZ Royal Netherlands Institute for Sea Research, Department of Marine Microbiology and Biogeochemistry, Utrecht University"}, "35518370600": {"Name": "Sinninghe Damst\u00e9 J.", "AuthorID": "35518370600", "AffiliationID": "60007989", "AffiliationName": "Utrecht University, Faculty of Geosciences"}, "6603815605": {"Name": "Moros M.", "AuthorID": "6603815605", "AffiliationID": "60072358", "AffiliationName": "Leibniz Institute for Baltic Sea Research, Departments of Marine Geology and Physical Oceanography"}, "7102979506": {"Name": "Neumann T.", "AuthorID": "7102979506", "AffiliationID": "60072358", "AffiliationName": "Leibniz Institute for Baltic Sea Research, Departments of Marine Geology and Physical Oceanography"}, "26634247300": {"Name": "Perner K.", "AuthorID": "26634247300", "AffiliationID": "60072358", "AffiliationName": "Leibniz Institute for Baltic Sea Research, Departments of Marine Geology and Physical Oceanography"}, "57190854150": {"Name": "H\u00e4usler K.", "AuthorID": "57190854150", "AffiliationID": "60072358", "AffiliationName": "Leibniz Institute for Baltic Sea Research, Departments of Marine Geology and Physical Oceanography"}, "6701327816": {"Name": "Leipe T.", "AuthorID": "6701327816", "AffiliationID": "60072358", "AffiliationName": "Leibniz Institute for Baltic Sea Research, Departments of Marine Geology and Physical Oceanography"}, "6602165458": {"Name": "Arz H.", "AuthorID": "6602165458", "AffiliationID": "60072358", "AffiliationName": "Leibniz Institute for Baltic Sea Research, Departments of Marine Geology and Physical Oceanography"}, "6602927062": {"Name": "Shennan S.", "AuthorID": "6602927062", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Archaeology, University College London"}, "55875310400": {"Name": "Timpson A.", "AuthorID": "55875310400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genetics Evolution and Environment, University College London"}, "23392975700": {"Name": "Manning K.", "AuthorID": "23392975700", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography, King's College London"}, "6603463064": {"Name": "Wacker L.", "AuthorID": "6603463064", "AffiliationID": "60025858", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Ion Beam Physics, ETH Z\u00fcrich"}, "6505786314": {"Name": "Zill\u00e9n L.", "AuthorID": "6505786314", "AffiliationID": "60029441", "AffiliationName": "Geological Survey of Sweden, Department of Marine Geology"}, "6506127747": {"Name": "Kotilainen A.", "AuthorID": "6506127747", "AffiliationID": "60019215", "AffiliationName": "Geological Survey of Finland"}, "35553164800": {"Name": "Jansen E.", "AuthorID": "35553164800", "AffiliationID": "60029622", "AffiliationName": "Bjerknes Centre for Climate Research, Department of Earth Science, University of Bergen"}, "7403513732": {"Name": "Schneider R.", "AuthorID": "7403513732", "AffiliationID": "60012345", "AffiliationName": "Insitute of Geosciences, Kiel University"}, "6505841301": {"Name": "Oeberst R.", "AuthorID": "6505841301", "AffiliationID": "113802027", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Baltic Sea Fisheries, Th\u00fcnen Institute"}}}
