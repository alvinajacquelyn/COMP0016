Here we define a critical role of the apical protein Crumbs2 (CRB2) in the gastrulation EMT. Static and live imaging show that ingressing cells in Crumbs2 mutant embryos become trapped at the primitive streak, where they continue to express the epiblast transcription factor SOX2 and retain thin E-cadherin-containing connections to the epiblast surface that trap them at the streak. CRB2 is distributed in a complex anisotropic pattern on apical cell edges, and the level of CRB2 on a cell edge is inversely correlated with the level of myosin IIB. The data suggest that the distributions of CRB2 and myosin IIB define which cells will ingress, and we propose that cells with high apical CRB2 are basally extruded from the epiblast by neighbouring cells with high levels of apical myosin.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Basement Membrane", "Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition", "Gastrulation", "Germ Layers", "Homeodomain Proteins", "Imaging, Three-Dimensional", "In Situ Hybridization", "Mammals", "Membrane Proteins", "Mesoderm", "Mice", "Mutation", "Nonmuscle Myosin Type IIB", "Primitive Streak"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84996761447", "SubjectAreas": [["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"25632931100": {"Name": "Ramkumar N.", "AuthorID": "25632931100", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60010269", "AffiliationName": "MRC Laboratory of Molecular Cell Biology, University College London"}, "7404580051": {"Name": "Anderson K.", "AuthorID": "7404580051", "AffiliationID": "60009343", "AffiliationName": "Developmental Biology Program, Sloan Kettering Institute, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"}, "6603324673": {"Name": "Omelchenko T.", "AuthorID": "6603324673", "AffiliationID": "60009343, 60002388", "AffiliationName": "Cell Biology Program, Sloan Kettering Institute, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"}, "14219602600": {"Name": "Silva-Gagliardi N.", "AuthorID": "14219602600", "AffiliationID": "60030319, 60016849", "AffiliationName": "Hospital for Sick Children, Arthur and Sonia Labatt Brain Tumor Research Center, University of Toronto"}, "7003589944": {"Name": "McGlade C.", "AuthorID": "7003589944", "AffiliationID": "60030319, 60016849", "AffiliationName": "Hospital for Sick Children, Arthur and Sonia Labatt Brain Tumor Research Center, University of Toronto"}, "7004225210": {"Name": "Wijnholds J.", "AuthorID": "7004225210", "AffiliationID": "60015618", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, Leiden University Medical Center"}}}
