Here, we demonstrate that the conditional ablation of resident microglia in CD11b-HSVTK (TK) mice is followed by a rapid repopulation of the brain by peripherally derived myeloid cells. We used this system to directly assess the ability of peripheral macrophages to reduce A\u03b2 plaque pathology and therefore depleted and replaced the pool of resident microglia with peripherally derived myeloid cells in A\u03b2-carrying APPPS1 mice crossed to TK mice (APPPS1;TK). Despite a nearly complete exchange of resident microglia with peripheral myeloid cells, there was no significant change in A\u03b2 burden or APP processing in APPPS1;TK mice. Importantly, however, newly recruited peripheral myeloid cells failed to cluster around A\u03b2 deposits. Even additional anti-A\u03b2 antibody treatment aimed at engaging myeloid cells with amyloid plaques neither directed peripherally derived myeloid cells to amyloid plaques nor altered A\u03b2 burden. These data demonstrate that mere recruitment of peripheral myeloid cells to the brain is insufficient in substantially clearing A\u03b2 burden and suggest that specific additional triggers appear to be required to exploit the full potential of myeloid cell-based therapies for AD.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Alzheimer Disease", "Amyloid beta-Peptides", "Animals", "Cell Movement", "Disease Models, Animal", "Ganciclovir", "Male", "Mice", "Microglia", "Myeloid Cells", "Vaccination"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84950248998", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"]], "AuthorData": {"8564962400": {"Name": "Prokop S.", "AuthorID": "8564962400", "AffiliationID": "60026245", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuropathology, Charit\u00e9-Universit\u00e4tsmedizin Berlin"}, "7404256549": {"Name": "Miller K.R.", "AuthorID": "7404256549", "AffiliationID": "60026245", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuropathology, Charit\u00e9-Universit\u00e4tsmedizin Berlin"}, "35810211500": {"Name": "Drost N.", "AuthorID": "35810211500", "AffiliationID": "60026245", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuropathology, Charit\u00e9-Universit\u00e4tsmedizin Berlin"}, "51665013200": {"Name": "Handrick S.", "AuthorID": "51665013200", "AffiliationID": "60026245", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuropathology, Charit\u00e9-Universit\u00e4tsmedizin Berlin"}, "12241498000": {"Name": "Wegner A.", "AuthorID": "12241498000", "AffiliationID": "60026245", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuropathology, Charit\u00e9-Universit\u00e4tsmedizin Berlin"}, "23086064100": {"Name": "Heppner F.L.", "AuthorID": "23086064100", "AffiliationID": "112880500", "AffiliationName": "Cluster of Excellence, NeuroCure"}, "56031223100": {"Name": "Mathur V.", "AuthorID": "56031223100", "AffiliationID": "60028084", "AffiliationName": "Center for Tissue Regeneration, Repair, and Restoration, VA Palo Alto Health Care System"}, "55254323800": {"Name": "Luo J.", "AuthorID": "55254323800", "AffiliationID": "60028084", "AffiliationName": "Center for Tissue Regeneration, Repair, and Restoration, VA Palo Alto Health Care System"}, "7004490711": {"Name": "Wyss-Coray T.", "AuthorID": "7004490711", "AffiliationID": "60028084", "AffiliationName": "Center for Tissue Regeneration, Repair, and Restoration, VA Palo Alto Health Care System"}}}
