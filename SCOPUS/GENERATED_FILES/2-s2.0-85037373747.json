Annals of Clinical and Translational Neurology published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc on behalf of American Neurological Association.Xeroderma pigmentosum is characterized by cutaneous, ophthalmological, and neurological features. Although it is typical of childhood, late presentations can mimic different neurodegenerative conditions. We report two families presenting as Huntington's disease-like syndromes. The first case (group G) presented with neuropsychiatric features, cognitive decline and chorea. Typical lentigines were only noticed after the neurological disease started. The second case (group B) presented adult-onset chorea and neuropsychiatric symptoms after an aggressive ocular melanoma. Xeroderma pigmentosum can manifest as a Huntington's Disease-like syndrome. Classic dermatological and oncological features have to be investigated in choreic patients with negative genetic tests for Huntington's disease-like phenotypes.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85037373747", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"56769941900": {"Name": "Garcia-Moreno H.", "AuthorID": "56769941900", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Ataxia Centre, Department of Molecular Neuroscience, University College London, Institute of Neurology"}, "6603845190": {"Name": "Giunti P.", "AuthorID": "6603845190", "AffiliationID": "60005518, 60002803", "AffiliationName": "National Xeroderma Pigmentosum Service, St John's Institute of Dermatology, Guy's and St Thomas\u2019 Foundation Trust"}, "8943452600": {"Name": "Fassihi H.", "AuthorID": "8943452600", "AffiliationID": "60005518, 60002803", "AffiliationName": "National Xeroderma Pigmentosum Service, St John's Institute of Dermatology, Guy's and St Thomas\u2019 Foundation Trust"}, "6603148339": {"Name": "Sarkany R.P.E.", "AuthorID": "6603148339", "AffiliationID": "60005518, 60002803", "AffiliationName": "National Xeroderma Pigmentosum Service, St John's Institute of Dermatology, Guy's and St Thomas\u2019 Foundation Trust"}, "22735057700": {"Name": "Phukan J.", "AuthorID": "22735057700", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Neurology Department, Royal Free Hospital"}, "57210127924": {"Name": "Warner T.", "AuthorID": "57210127924", "AffiliationID": "60115564, 60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Reta Lila Weston Institute of Neurological Studies, University College London, Institute of Neurology"}, "24561642600": {"Name": "Lehmann A.R.", "AuthorID": "24561642600", "AffiliationID": "60009097, 60017317", "AffiliationName": "Genome Damage and Stability Centre, University of Sussex"}}}
