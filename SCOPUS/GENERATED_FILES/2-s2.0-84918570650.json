Placing the N-arylation cyclisation handle on the imine precursor derived from an ortho-bromine substituted aromatic aldehyde gave the corresponding \u03b2-nitroamines in 55-72% yields as single diastereoisomers. Nitro reduction was effected with modified quantities of Zn/HCl and a subsequent Pd(0) catalysed Buchwald Hartwig cyclisation gave indoline products in 40-70% yields as single diastereoisomers.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["1 ,2-diamine", "Conjugate addition", "Diastereoisomers", "Modified quantity", "N-arylations", "Nitro-Mannich reaction", "Stereoselective synthesis", "Substituted aromatic aldehydes", "Chemistry Techniques, Synthetic", "Cyclization", "Diamines", "Indoles", "Nitro Compounds", "Palladium", "Stereoisomerism", "Substrate Specificity"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84918570650", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"], ["Organic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1605"]], "AuthorData": {"55553734284": {"Name": "Anderson J.", "AuthorID": "55553734284", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "56430543200": {"Name": "Shannon J.", "AuthorID": "56430543200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "7005072839": {"Name": "Tocher D.", "AuthorID": "7005072839", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "55414472700": {"Name": "Campbell I.", "AuthorID": "55414472700", "AffiliationID": "60020649", "AffiliationName": "GlaxoSmithKline, Medicines Research Centre"}, "56430605300": {"Name": "Campos S.", "AuthorID": "56430605300", "AffiliationID": "60020649", "AffiliationName": "GlaxoSmithKline, Medicines Research Centre"}}}
