Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.Recently, the electron transport through a quasi-one dimensional (quasi-1D) electron gas was investigated experimentally as a function of the confining potential. We present a physical model for quantum ballistic transport of electrons through a short conduction channel, and investigate the role played by the Coulomb interaction in modifying the energy levels of two-electron states at low temperatures as the width of the channel is increased. In this regime, the effect of the Coulomb interaction on the two-electron states has been shown to lead to four split energy levels, including two anticrossings and two crossing-level states. Due to the interplay between the anticrossing and crossing of the energy levels, the ground state for the two-electron model switches from one anticrossing state for strong confinement to a crossing state for intermediate confinement as the channel width is first increased, and then returned to its original anticrossing state. This switching behavior is related to the triplet spin degeneracy as well as the Coulomb repulsion and reflected in the ballistic conductance. Here, many-body effects can still affect electron occupations in the calculation of quantum ballistic conductance although it cannot vary the center-of-mass velocity.", "AuthorKeywords": ["72.10.-d Theory of electronic transport", "72.20.-i Conductivity phenomena in semiconductors and insulators", "73.21.Hb Quantum wires; 73.23.Ad Ballistic transport", "Ballistic transport", "quasi 1D conductance hybrid clusters", "scattering mechanisms"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85050749694", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"7005735990": {"Name": "Gumbs G.", "AuthorID": "7005735990", "AffiliationID": "60017954", "AffiliationName": "Donostia International Physics Center (DIPC)"}, "57203154357": {"Name": "Hon J.", "AuthorID": "57203154357", "AffiliationID": "60007033, 60002896", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, Hunter College of the City University of New York"}, "7403890391": {"Name": "Huang D.", "AuthorID": "7403890391", "AffiliationID": "60015710, 60001262", "AffiliationName": "Air Force Research Laboratory, Space Vehicles Directorate, Kirtland Air Force Base"}, "56463590500": {"Name": "Pepper M.", "AuthorID": "56463590500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "57202530291": {"Name": "Kumar S.", "AuthorID": "57202530291", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}}}
