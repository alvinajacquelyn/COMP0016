(ACM).This course will provide an introduction to methods used in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) research. An equal focus will be given to both the quantitative and qualitative research traditions used to understand people and interactional contexts. We shall discuss these major research traditions along with their contemporary framings (e.g., in-the-wild research and Interaction Science). By the end of the course attendees will have a detailed understanding of how to select and apply methods to address a range of problems that are of concern to contemporary HCI researchers.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Empirical research", "Hci research methods", "Qualitative", "Quantitative"], "IndexKeywords": ["Empirical research", "Hci researches", "Human-computer interaction researches", "Qualitative", "Quantitative", "Quantitative and qualitative researches", "Research traditions"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85019605961", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Human-Computer Interaction", "COMP", "1709"], ["Computer Graphics and Computer-Aided Design", "COMP", "1704"]], "AuthorData": {"22833443900": {"Name": "Brumby D.", "AuthorID": "22833443900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Interaction Centre, University College"}, "7004087556": {"Name": "Blandford A.", "AuthorID": "7004087556", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Interaction Centre, University College"}, "23391770800": {"Name": "Cox A.", "AuthorID": "23391770800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Interaction Centre, University College"}, "55258058900": {"Name": "Gould S.", "AuthorID": "55258058900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Interaction Centre, University College"}, "57191485447": {"Name": "Marshall P.", "AuthorID": "57191485447", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Interaction Centre, University College"}}}
