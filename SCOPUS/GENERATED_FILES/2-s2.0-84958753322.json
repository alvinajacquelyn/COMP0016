The phenotype includes haemophilia A, moyamoya angiopathy, dysmorphia and hypertension. The genetic analysis of the family of our SHAM patient demonstrated carrier state in proband's mother and sister.The patient's mother is apparently well, whereas his currently 18-years-old sister presents with mild haemophilia A, coarctation of the aorta, hypertension, and ventricular arrhythmia. We performed X chromosome inactivation assay based on HpaII methylation analysis of a polymorphic short tandem repeat (STR) in the X linked AR (androgen receptor) gene and used quantitative real-time RT PCR to measure the expression of genes from the deleted region in proband's family members. We found an extremely skewed X chromosome inactivation pattern in the female members of the family leading to preferential inactivation of the X chromosome without Xq28 deletion in patient's sister. We demonstrated differential expression of the genes from the deleted region in four members of the family, that tightly correlates with the clinical features.In conclusion, we show that the haematologic and cardiovascular morbidity and the discrepancy between patient's sister and mother despite the same genetic lesion are due to skewed X chromosome inactivation leading to clinically relevant differential expression of SHAM syndrome genes. This report highlights the role for BRCC3 in cardiovascular physiology and disease, and demonstrates that in some complex hereditary syndromes full diagnostics may require the examination of both genetic and epigenetic events.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Aortic coarctation", "Arrhythmias", "Haemophilia A", "Hypertension", "Moyamoya", "X chromosome inactivation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Epigenesis, Genetic", "Female", "Hemophilia A", "Humans", "Membrane Proteins", "Moyamoya Disease", "X Chromosome Inactivation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84958753322", "SubjectAreas": [["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Genetics (clinical)", "MEDI", "2716"]], "AuthorData": {"23034979100": {"Name": "Janczar S.", "AuthorID": "23034979100", "AffiliationID": "60006651", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatrics, Oncology, Hematology and Diabetology, Medical University of Lodz"}, "23568660700": {"Name": "Pastorczak A.", "AuthorID": "23568660700", "AffiliationID": "60006651", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatrics, Oncology, Hematology and Diabetology, Medical University of Lodz"}, "24081656300": {"Name": "Wegner O.", "AuthorID": "24081656300", "AffiliationID": "60006651", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatrics, Oncology, Hematology and Diabetology, Medical University of Lodz"}, "55928583000": {"Name": "Zalewska-Szewczyk B.", "AuthorID": "55928583000", "AffiliationID": "60006651", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatrics, Oncology, Hematology and Diabetology, Medical University of Lodz"}, "7005559050": {"Name": "Borowiec M.", "AuthorID": "7005559050", "AffiliationID": "60006651", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatrics, Oncology, Hematology and Diabetology, Medical University of Lodz"}, "7004717489": {"Name": "Mlynarski W.", "AuthorID": "7004717489", "AffiliationID": "60006651", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatrics, Oncology, Hematology and Diabetology, Medical University of Lodz"}, "56305543100": {"Name": "Kosinska J.", "AuthorID": "56305543100", "AffiliationID": "60069009", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Genetics, Warsaw Medical University"}, "7003937391": {"Name": "Ploski R.", "AuthorID": "7003937391", "AffiliationID": "60069009", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Genetics, Warsaw Medical University"}, "6603819449": {"Name": "Paige A.", "AuthorID": "6603819449", "AffiliationID": "60012622", "AffiliationName": "Department of Life Science, University of Bedfordshire"}}}
