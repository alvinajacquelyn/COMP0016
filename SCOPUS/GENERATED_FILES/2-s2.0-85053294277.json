Although stem cell therapy restores these lineages, residual immune defects are observed that may result from selective persistence of \u03b3c-deficiency in myeloid lineages. However, little is known about the contribution of myeloid-expressed \u03b3c to protective immune responses. Here we examine the importance of \u03b3c for myeloid dendritic cell (DC) function. Methods: We utilize a combination of in vitro DC/T-cell co-culture assays and a novel lipid bilayer system mimicking the T cell surface to delineate the role of DC-expressed \u03b3c during DC/T-cell interaction. Results: We observed that \u03b3c in DC was recruited to the contact interface following MHCII ligation, and promoted IL-15R\u03b1 colocalization with engaged MHCII. Unexpectedly, trans-presentation of IL-15 was required for optimal CD4+T cell activation by DC and depended on DC \u03b3c expression. Neither recruitment of IL-15R\u03b1 nor IL-15 trans-signaling at the DC immune synapse (IS), required \u03b3c signaling in DC, suggesting that \u03b3c facilitates IL-15 transpresentation through induced intermolecular cis associations or cytoskeletal reorganization following MHCII ligation. Conclusions: These findings show that DC-expressed \u03b3c is required for effective antigen-induced CD4+ T cell activation. We reveal a novel mechanism for recruitment of DC IL-15/IL-15R\u03b1 complexes to the IS, leading to CD4+ T cell costimulation through localized IL-15 transpresentation that is coordinated with antigen-recognition.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Dendritic cells", "Immunodeficiency", "Immunological synapse", "Interleukins", "Lymphocytes", "Trans-presentation"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85053294277", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (miscellaneous)", "MEDI", "2701"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"36571541100": {"Name": "Beilin C.", "AuthorID": "36571541100", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Molecular Immunology Unit, Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "7006134013": {"Name": "Bouma G.", "AuthorID": "7006134013", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Molecular Immunology Unit, Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "55877813000": {"Name": "Malinova D.", "AuthorID": "55877813000", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Molecular Immunology Unit, Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "7005085037": {"Name": "Thrasher A.J.", "AuthorID": "7005085037", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}, "6602680727": {"Name": "Choudhuri K.", "AuthorID": "6602680727", "AffiliationID": "60024541, 60021784", "AffiliationName": "Skirball Institute of Biomolecular Medicine, New York University"}, "6603014554": {"Name": "Llodra J.", "AuthorID": "6603014554", "AffiliationID": "60024541, 60021784", "AffiliationName": "Skirball Institute of Biomolecular Medicine, New York University"}, "7101638050": {"Name": "Stokes D.L.", "AuthorID": "7101638050", "AffiliationID": "60024541, 60021784", "AffiliationName": "Skirball Institute of Biomolecular Medicine, New York University"}, "35450639400": {"Name": "Springer T.A.", "AuthorID": "35450639400", "AffiliationID": "60024541, 60021784", "AffiliationName": "Skirball Institute of Biomolecular Medicine, New York University"}, "7006586101": {"Name": "Dustin M.L.", "AuthorID": "7006586101", "AffiliationID": "60007247, 60026851, 60002634", "AffiliationName": "Kennedy Institute of Rheumatology, Nuffield Department of Orthopedics, Rheumatology and Musculoskeletal Sciences, University of Oxford"}, "57213758933": {"Name": "Shimaoka M.", "AuthorID": "57213758933", "AffiliationID": "60030521, 60080647", "AffiliationName": "Immune Disease Institute, Children's Hospital Boston"}, "8778070100": {"Name": "Burns S.O.", "AuthorID": "8778070100", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60170516", "AffiliationName": "University College London Institute of Immunity and Transplantation, Department of Immunology, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
