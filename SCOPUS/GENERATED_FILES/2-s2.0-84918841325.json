However their functional and molecular mechanisms are unclear, hence, there is strong interest in developing selective inhibitors for them. Here we report the identification of key residues within the nucleotide-binding sites of the AlkB subfamilies that likely determine their substrate specificity. We further provide proof of principle that a strategy exploiting these inherent structural differences can enable selective and potent inhibition of the AlkB subfamilies. This is demonstrated by the first report of a subfamily-selective and cell-active FTO inhibitor 12. The distinct selectivity of 12 for FTO against other AlkB subfamilies and 2OG oxygenases shall be of considerable interest with regards to its potential use as a functional probe. The strategy outlined here is likely applicable to other AlkB subfamilies, and, more widely, to other 2OG oxygenases.
