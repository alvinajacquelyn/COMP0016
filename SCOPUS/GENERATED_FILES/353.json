In spinal cord injury (SCI), the severity of disease is quantified by clinical measures that have limited sensitivity and reliability, and no blood-based biomarker has been established to further stratify the degree of injury. We aimed to examine a serum-based NfL immunoassay as predictor of the clinical outcome in SCI. Methods: Longitudinal measurement of serum NfL was performed in patients with central cord syndrome (CCS, n=4), motor-incomplete SCI (iSCI, n=10), motorcomplete SCI (cSCI, n=13) and healthy controls (HC, n=67), and correlated with clinical severity, neurological outcome, and neuroprotective effect of the drug minocycline. Results: Baseline NfL levels were higher in iSCI (21 pg/mL) and cSCI (70 pg/mL) than in HC (5 pg/mL, p=0.006 and p<0.001) and CCS (6 pg/mL, p=0.025 and p=0.010). Levels increased over time (p<0.001) and remained higher in cSCI versus iSCI (p=0.011) and than in CCS (p<0.001). NfL levels correlated with American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) motor score at baseline (r=-0.53, p=0.004) and after 24 h (r=-0.69, p<0.001) and 3-12-month motor outcome (baseline NfL: r=-0.43, p=0.026 and 24 h NfL: r=-0.72, p<0.001). Minocycline treatment showed decreased NfL levels in the subgroup of cSCI patients. Conclusions: Serum NfL concentrations in SCI patients show a close correlation with acute severity and neurological outcome. Our data provide evidence that serum NfL is of prognostic value in SCI patients for the first time. Further, blood NfL levels may qualify as drug response markers in SCI.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Anti-Bacterial Agents", "Biomarkers", "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug", "Drug Administration Schedule", "Female", "Humans", "Infusions, Intravenous", "Longitudinal Studies", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Minocycline", "Neurofilament Proteins", "Neurologic Examination", "Prognosis", "Reference Values", "Spinal Cord Injuries"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84923187687", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"8937520800": {"Name": "Kuhle J.", "AuthorID": "8937520800", "AffiliationID": "60028287", "AffiliationName": "Neurology, University Hospital Basel"}, "24278783500": {"Name": "Gaiottino J.", "AuthorID": "24278783500", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Blizard Institute, Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London"}, "7003290890": {"Name": "Malaspina A.", "AuthorID": "7003290890", "AffiliationID": "112958820", "AffiliationName": "North-East London and Essex Regional MND Care Centre"}, "7404804808": {"Name": "Lu C.H.", "AuthorID": "7404804808", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Blizard Institute, Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London"}, "36093903900": {"Name": "Dobson R.", "AuthorID": "36093903900", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Blizard Institute, Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London"}, "26631703200": {"Name": "Disanto G.", "AuthorID": "26631703200", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Blizard Institute, Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London"}, "34770127900": {"Name": "Giovannoni G.", "AuthorID": "34770127900", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Blizard Institute, Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London"}, "7003711670": {"Name": "Leppert D.", "AuthorID": "7003711670", "AffiliationID": "60028287", "AffiliationName": "Neurology, University Hospital Basel"}, "7004559324": {"Name": "Kappos L.", "AuthorID": "7004559324", "AffiliationID": "60028287", "AffiliationName": "Neurology, University Hospital Basel"}, "7006826396": {"Name": "Petzold A.", "AuthorID": "7006826396", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neurosciences, UCL, Institute of Neurology"}, "14027999700": {"Name": "Bestwick J.P.", "AuthorID": "14027999700", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Wolfson Institute of Preventive Medicine, Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London"}, "6507640983": {"Name": "Norgren N.", "AuthorID": "6507640983", "AffiliationID": "60112896", "AffiliationName": "UmanDiagnostics"}, "6701724009": {"Name": "Nissim A.", "AuthorID": "6701724009", "AffiliationID": "60022109", "AffiliationName": "Biochemical Pharmacology, John Vane Science Centre, Queen Mary University of London"}, "7005005237": {"Name": "Hurlbert J.", "AuthorID": "7005005237", "AffiliationID": "60192954, 60002306", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Neurosciences, Hotchkiss Brain Institute, University of Calgary"}, "7005214860": {"Name": "Yong V.W.", "AuthorID": "7005214860", "AffiliationID": "60192954, 60002306", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Neurosciences, Hotchkiss Brain Institute, University of Calgary"}, "6508391513": {"Name": "Casha S.", "AuthorID": "6508391513", "AffiliationID": "60192954, 60002306", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Neurosciences, Hotchkiss Brain Institute, University of Calgary"}}}
