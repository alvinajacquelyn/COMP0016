The current aim was to investigate whether these caregiver profiles could predict subsequent service use. In addition, non-personal (e.g. meals on wheels) and supportive services (e.g. Alzheimer caf\u00e9) in early dementia were investigated as predictors. Methods: A total of 451 dyads of people with dementia and their informal caregivers from eight European countries were followed for one year. People were included if they did not use formal (personal) care but were expected to do so within 1 year. Logistic regression analyses were used with four clusters of service use as dependent variables (home social care, home personal care, day care and admission). The independent variables were caregiver profiles, and non-personal and supportive services at baseline. Results: Caregiver profiles were significant predictors of service use; those experiencing high strain were more likely to use formal care. The use of low-intensity, less intrusive services at baseline significantly predicted the use of home personal care and admission at follow-up. The use of day care at follow-up was predicted by the baseline use of supportive services. Conclusion: Caregiver profiles are valuable predictors for service use: this knowledge can aid professionals in ensuring optimal access to services, which is important for maintaining independence at home. In addition, the use of supportive and less intrusive, non-personal services in the early stages of dementia is to be advised.", "AuthorKeywords": ["caregiver profiles", "Dementia", "informal caregiver", "service use"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Caregivers", "Cost of Illness", "Dementia", "Female", "Health Services", "Home Care Services", "Homes for the Aged", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Nursing Homes", "Quality of Life", "Social Support"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85058143438", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychiatric Mental Health", "NURS", "2921"], ["Gerontology", "NURS", "2909"], ["Geriatrics and Gerontology", "MEDI", "2717"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"57191226886": {"Name": "Kerpershoek L.", "AuthorID": "57191226886", "AffiliationID": "60018869", "AffiliationName": "Maastricht University"}, "12801695000": {"Name": "Wolfs C.", "AuthorID": "12801695000", "AffiliationID": "60018869", "AffiliationName": "Maastricht University"}, "7007057244": {"Name": "Verhey F.", "AuthorID": "7007057244", "AffiliationID": "60018869", "AffiliationName": "Maastricht University"}, "36169263300": {"Name": "Handels R.", "AuthorID": "36169263300", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurobiology, Care sciences and Society, Karolinska Institutet"}, "7801535173": {"Name": "de Vugt M.", "AuthorID": "7801535173", "AffiliationID": "60018869", "AffiliationName": "Maastricht University"}, "7101638963": {"Name": "Woods B.", "AuthorID": "7101638963", "AffiliationID": "60025779", "AffiliationName": "Bangor University"}, "54973817600": {"Name": "Jelley H.", "AuthorID": "54973817600", "AffiliationID": "60025779", "AffiliationName": "Bangor University"}, "57190747903": {"Name": "Bieber A.", "AuthorID": "57190747903", "AffiliationID": "60014059", "AffiliationName": "Martin-Luther University Halle-Wittenberg"}, "55811737600": {"Name": "Stephan A.", "AuthorID": "55811737600", "AffiliationID": "60014059", "AffiliationName": "Martin-Luther University Halle-Wittenberg"}, "55039161000": {"Name": "Michelet M.", "AuthorID": "55039161000", "AffiliationID": "60010348", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Medicine, University of Oslo"}, "56888905900": {"Name": "Selbaek G.", "AuthorID": "56888905900", "AffiliationID": "60108588", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Old Age Psychiatry Research, Innlandet Hospital Trust"}, "56235097300": {"Name": "Wimo A.", "AuthorID": "56235097300", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurobiology, Care sciences and Society, Karolinska Institutet"}, "56928061600": {"Name": "Hopper L.", "AuthorID": "56928061600", "AffiliationID": "60025059", "AffiliationName": "School of Nursing and Human Sciences, Dublin City University"}, "8621765000": {"Name": "Irving K.", "AuthorID": "8621765000", "AffiliationID": "60025059", "AffiliationName": "School of Nursing and Human Sciences, Dublin City University"}, "57194552785": {"Name": "Marques M.J.", "AuthorID": "57194552785", "AffiliationID": "60033159, 60002769, 60031875", "AffiliationName": "Nova Medical School, Faculdade de Ci\u00eancias M\u00e9dicas, Universidade Nova de Lisboa, CEDOC"}, "13609276600": {"Name": "Gon\u00e7alves-Pereira M.", "AuthorID": "13609276600", "AffiliationID": "60033159, 60002769, 60031875", "AffiliationName": "Nova Medical School, Faculdade de Ci\u00eancias M\u00e9dicas, Universidade Nova de Lisboa, CEDOC"}, "56193726900": {"Name": "Portolani E.", "AuthorID": "56193726900", "AffiliationID": "60084291", "AffiliationName": "Alzheimer\u2019s Research Unit-Memory Clinic, IRCCS \u201cCentro S.
