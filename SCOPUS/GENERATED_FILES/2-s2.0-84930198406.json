The purpose of this study was to evaluate effectiveness of user training in improving reliable, valid and confident application of BCTTv1 to code BCTs in intervention descriptions. One hundred sixty-one trainees (109 in workshops and 52 in group tutorials) were trained to code frequent BCTs. The following measures were taken before and after training: (i) inter-coder agreement, (ii) trainee agreement with expert consensus, (iii) confidence ratings and (iv) coding competence. Coding was assessed for 12 BCTs (workshops) and for 17 BCTs (tutorials). Trainees completed a course evaluation. Methods improved agreement with expert consensus (p <.05) but not inter-coder agreement (p =.08, p =.57, respectively) and increased confidence for BCTs assessed (both p <.05). Methods were as effective as one another at improving coding competence (p =.55). Training was evaluated positively. The training improved agreement with expert consensus, confidence for BCTs assessed, coding competence but not inter-coder agreement. This varied according to BCT.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Behaviour change techniques", "Taxonomy", "Training methods"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84930198406", "SubjectAreas": [["Applied Psychology", "PSYC", "3202"], ["Behavioral Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2802"]], "AuthorData": {"55795890200": {"Name": "Wood C.", "AuthorID": "55795890200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Centre for Behaviour Change, Research Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London"}, "7402060418": {"Name": "Johnston M.", "AuthorID": "7402060418", "AffiliationID": "60015875", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Applied Health Sciences, University of Aberdeen"}, "7004779970": {"Name": "Michie S.", "AuthorID": "7004779970", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Centre for Behaviour Change, Research Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London"}, "36053555200": {"Name": "Richardson M.", "AuthorID": "36053555200", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Health Services and Population Research, Kings College London"}, "57197661321": {"Name": "Abraham C.", "AuthorID": "57197661321", "AffiliationID": "60111707, 60026479", "AffiliationName": "University of Exeter Medical School, University of Exeter"}, "24438010700": {"Name": "Francis J.", "AuthorID": "24438010700", "AffiliationID": "60025704", "AffiliationName": "School of Health Sciences, City University London"}, "6603849969": {"Name": "Hardeman W.", "AuthorID": "6603849969", "AffiliationID": "60009587, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Primary Care Unit, Institute of Public Health, University of Cambridge"}}}
