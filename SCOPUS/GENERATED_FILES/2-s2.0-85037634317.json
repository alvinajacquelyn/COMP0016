KGaA, WeinheimHydrogels can potentially prolong the release of a therapeutic protein, especially to treat blinding conditions. One challenge is to ensure that the protein and hydrogel are intimately mixed by better protein entanglement within the hydrogel. N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPAAM) gels are optimized with poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEDGA) crosslinker in the presence of either bevacizumab or PEG conjugated ranibizumab (PEG10-Fabrani). The release profiles of the hydrogels are evaluated using an outflow model of the eye, which is previously validated for human clearance of proteins. Release kinetics of in situ loaded bevacizumab-NIPAAM gels displays a prolonged bimodal release profile in phosphate buffered saline compared to bevacizumab loaded into a preformed NIPAAM gel. Bevacizumab release in simulated vitreous from in situ loaded gels is similar to bevacizumab control indicating that diffusion through the vitreous rather than from the gel is rate limiting. Ranibizumab is site-specifically PEGylated by disulfide rebridging conjugation. Prolonged and continuous release is observed with the in situ loaded PEG10-Fabrani-NIPAAM gels compared to PEG10-Fabrani injection (control). Compared to an unmodified protein, there is better mixing due to PEG entanglement and compatibility of PEG10-Fabrani within the NIPAAM-PEDGA hydrogel. These encouraging results suggest that the extended release of PEGylated proteins in the vitreous can be achieved using injectable hydrogels.", "AuthorKeywords": ["hydrogel", "ocular delivery", "PEGylated protein", "stimuli responsive", "therapeutic protein"], "IndexKeywords": ["Injectable hydrogels", "N-isopropylacrylamides", "Ocular delivery", "PEGylated proteins", "Phosphate-buffered salines", "Polyethylene glycol diacrylate", "Stimuli-responsive", "Therapeutic protein", "Acrylamides", "Antibodies", "Bevacizumab", "Drug Liberation", "Humans", "Hydrogel, Polyethylene Glycol Dimethacrylate", "Immunoglobulin Fab Fragments", "Polyethylene Glycols", "Ranibizumab"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85037634317", "SubjectAreas": [["Biotechnology", "BIOC", "1305"], ["Bioengineering", "CENG", "1502"], ["Biomaterials", "MATE", "2502"], ["Polymers and Plastics", "MATE", "2507"], ["Materials Chemistry", "MATE", "2505"]], "AuthorData": {"56698061000": {"Name": "Awwad S.", "AuthorID": "56698061000", "AffiliationID": "60016691, 60172638, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Biomedical Research Centre at Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust and UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "57199145719": {"Name": "Al-Shohani A.", "AuthorID": "57199145719", "AffiliationID": "60016691, 60172638, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Biomedical Research Centre at Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust and UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "6701323615": {"Name": "Brocchini S.", "AuthorID": "6701323615", "AffiliationID": "60016691, 60172638, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Biomedical Research Centre at Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust and UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "7006578947": {"Name": "Khaw P.T.", "AuthorID": "7006578947", "AffiliationID": "60016691, 60172638, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Biomedical Research Centre at Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust and UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}}}
