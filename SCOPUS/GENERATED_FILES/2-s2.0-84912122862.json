In addition to increased fighting abilities, many social parasites evolved sophisticated sensory deception mechanisms to elude host colonies defenses by exploiting host communication channels. Recently, it has been shown that the conspicuous facial markings of a paper wasp social parasite, Polistes sulcifer, decrease the aggressiveness of host foundresses. Two main hypotheses stand as explanations of this phenomenon: visual sensory deception (i.e. the black patterning reduces host aggression by exploiting the host visual communication system) and visual quality assessment (i.e. facial markings reduce aggressiveness as they signal the increased fighting ability of parasites). Through behavioral assays and morphological measurements we tested three predictions resulting from these hypotheses and found no support either for the visual sensory deception or for the quality assessment to explain the reduction in host aggressiveness towards the parasite. Our results suggest that other discrimination processes may explain the observed phenomenon.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Assessment", "Sensory deception", "Social parasitism", "Social wasps", "Visual communication"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aggression", "Animal Communication", "Animals", "Behavior, Animal", "Deception", "Face", "Female", "Male", "Parasites", "Size Perception", "Social Behavior", "Visual Perception", "Wasps"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84912122862", "SubjectAreas": [["Animal Science and Zoology", "AGRI", "1103"], ["Behavioral Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2802"]], "AuthorData": {"22133717200": {"Name": "Cini A.", "AuthorID": "22133717200", "AffiliationID": "60021859", "AffiliationName": "Dipartimento di Biologia, Universit\u00e0 di Firenze"}, "24462529700": {"Name": "Ortolani I.", "AuthorID": "24462529700", "AffiliationID": "60021859", "AffiliationName": "Dipartimento di Biologia, Universit\u00e0 di Firenze"}, "6603953920": {"Name": "Cervo R.", "AuthorID": "6603953920", "AffiliationID": "60021859", "AffiliationName": "Dipartimento di Biologia, Universit\u00e0 di Firenze"}, "36524550500": {"Name": "Zechini L.", "AuthorID": "36524550500", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "Center for Integrative Physiology, Euan MacDonald Center for Motor Neuron Disease Research, School of Biomedical Sciences, University of Edinburgh"}}}
