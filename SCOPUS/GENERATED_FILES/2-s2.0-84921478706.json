At the same time, cells are spatially heterogeneous systems in which subcellular compartmentalization of different functions is ubiquitous and requires efficient cross-compartmental communication. Dynamic redistribution of multitudinous proteins to different subcellular locations in response to cellular functional state is increasingly recognized as a crucial characteristic of cellular function that seems to be at least as important as overall changes in protein abundance. Characterization of the subcellular spatial dynamics of protein distribution is a major challenge for proteomics and recent results with MCF7 breast cancer cells suggest that this may be of particular importance for cancer cells.", "AuthorKeywords": ["breast cancer", "cytoplasm", "estrogen receptor", "mass spectrometry", "MCF7 cells", "nucleus", "protein trafficking", "quantitative proteomics", "SILAC", "subcellular protein location"], "IndexKeywords": ["Humans", "MCF-7 Cells", "Neoplasms", "Protein Transport", "Proteome", "Proteomics"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84921478706", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"]], "AuthorData": {"56924703100": {"Name": "Pinto G.", "AuthorID": "56924703100", "AffiliationID": "60017293", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacy, University of Naples Federico II"}, "56033839000": {"Name": "Alhaiek A.", "AuthorID": "56033839000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Medicine, University College London, Centre for Nephrology"}, "7005472520": {"Name": "Godovac-Zimmermann J.", "AuthorID": "7005472520", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Medicine, University College London, Centre for Nephrology"}}}
