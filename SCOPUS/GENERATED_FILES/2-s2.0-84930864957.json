However, a crucial limitation of these analyses is that they do not control for the potential endogeneity of education. The aim of our study is to estimate the role of women\u2019s education on their number of children in Malawi, accounting for the possible presence of endogeneity and for nonlinear effects of continuous observed confounders. Our analysis is based on micro data from the 2010 Malawi Demographic Health Survey, and uses a flexible instrumental variable regression approach. The results suggest that the relationship of interest is affected by endogeneity and exhibits an inverted U-shape among women living in rural areas of Malawi, whereas it exhibits an inverse (nonlinear) relationship for women living in urban areas.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Education", "Endogeneity", "Instrumental variable", "Inverted U-shape", "Number of children", "Two-stage generalized additive model"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84930864957", "SubjectAreas": [["Demography", "SOCI", "3317"], ["Economics and Econometrics", "ECON", "2002"]], "AuthorData": {"36483885600": {"Name": "Zanin L.", "AuthorID": "36483885600", "AffiliationID": "60112667", "AffiliationName": "Prometeia"}, "23985987100": {"Name": "Radice R.", "AuthorID": "23985987100", "AffiliationID": "60162130", "AffiliationName": "Department of Economics, Mathematics and Statistics Birkbeck, University of London"}, "36005147900": {"Name": "Marra G.", "AuthorID": "36005147900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Statistical Science, University College London"}}}
