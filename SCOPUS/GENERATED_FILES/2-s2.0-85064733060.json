Decreased [18F]FSPG uptake in drug-ian cancer (HGSOC). Currently, there is no satisfactory way resistant cells was a consequence of changes in intracellular to identify patients with HGSOC that are refractive to the cystine, a key precursor in GSH biosynthesis. In vivo, standard of care. Here, we propose the system xc radio-[18F]FSPG uptake was decreased nearly 80% in chemother-tracer (4S)-4-(3-[18F]fluoropropyl)-L-glutamate ([18F]FSPG) apy-resistant A2780 tumors compared with parental drug-as a non-invasive method to measure upregulated antiox-sensitive tumors, with nonresponding tumors displaying idant pathways present in drug-resistant HGSOC. high levels of oxidized-to-reduced GSH. Treatment of drug-Experimental Design: Using matched chemotherapy sen-resistant A2780 tumors with doxorubicin resulted in no sitive and resistant ovarian cancer cell lines, we assessed detectable change in tumor volume, GSH, or [18F]FSPG their antioxidant capacity and its relation to [18F]FSPG uptake. uptake, both in cells and in animal models of human Conclusions: This study demonstrates the ability of ovarian cancer. We identified the mechanisms driving dif-[18F]FSPG to detect upregulated antioxidant pathways present ferential [18F]FSPG cell accumulation and evaluated in drug-resistant cancer. [18F]FSPG may therefore enable the [18F]FSPG tumor uptake as predictive marker of treatment identification of patients with HGSOC that are refractory to response in drug-resistant tumors. standard of care, allowing the transferal of drug-resistant Results: High intracellular glutathione (GSH) and low patients to alternative therapies, thereby improving outcomes reactive oxygen species corresponded to decreased in this disease.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Antineoplastic Agents", "Antioxidants", "Biomarkers", "Cell Line, Tumor", "Cystine", "Disease Models, Animal", "Drug Resistance, Neoplasm", "Female", "Humans", "Mice", "Models, Biological", "Neoplasm Grading", "Ovarian Neoplasms", "Positron Emission Tomography Computed Tomography", "Positron-Emission Tomography", "Radiopharmaceuticals", "Reactive Oxygen Species", "Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85064733060", "SubjectAreas": [["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Cancer Research", "BIOC", "1306"]], "AuthorData": {"57205416758": {"Name": "Greenwood H.E.", "AuthorID": "57205416758", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Advanced Biomedical Imaging, Division of Medicine, University College London"}, "57205419428": {"Name": "McCormick P.N.", "AuthorID": "57205419428", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Advanced Biomedical Imaging, Division of Medicine, University College London"}, "57205415185": {"Name": "Pereira R.", "AuthorID": "57205415185", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Advanced Biomedical Imaging, Division of Medicine, University College London"}, "7004107686": {"Name": "Lythgoe M.F.", "AuthorID": "7004107686", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Advanced Biomedical Imaging, Division of Medicine, University College London"}, "26641518000": {"Name": "Witney T.H.", "AuthorID": "26641518000", "AffiliationID": "60004111, 60177635", "AffiliationName": "King's College London, Lambeth Wing, St Thomas Hospital"}, "56605140400": {"Name": "Gendron T.", "AuthorID": "56605140400", "AffiliationID": "60090043, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Institute of Nuclear Medicine, University College London"}, "7103281884": {"Name": "Glaser M.", "AuthorID": "7103281884", "AffiliationID": "60090043, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Institute of Nuclear Medicine, University College London"}, "8626055500": {"Name": "Sander K.", "AuthorID": "8626055500", "AffiliationID": "60090043, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Institute of Nuclear Medicine, University College London"}, "6507965888": {"Name": "\u00c5rstad E.", "AuthorID": "6507965888", "AffiliationID": "60090043, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Institute of Nuclear Medicine, University College London"}, "24080682500": {"Name": "Maddocks O.D.K.", "AuthorID": "24080682500", "AffiliationID": "60001574, 60001490", "AffiliationName": "Wolfson Wohl Cancer Research Centre, Institute of Cancer Sciences, University of Glasgow"}, "55729001600": {"Name": "Zhang T.", "AuthorID": "55729001600", "AffiliationID": "60001574, 60001490", "AffiliationName": "Wolfson Wohl Cancer Research Centre, Institute of Cancer Sciences, University of Glasgow"}, "57170382500": {"Name": "Koglin N.", "AuthorID": "57170382500", "AffiliationID": "106226774", "AffiliationName": "Life Molecular Imaging GmbH"}, "6701713285": {"Name": "Hochhauser D.", "AuthorID": "6701713285", "AffiliationID": "60109234, 60012754, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Research UK Drug-DNA Interactions Research Group, UCL Cancer Institute, University College London"}}}
