The analytical sample comprises 5799 participants with complete data. Logistic regression analysis showed that higher professional parental social class (OR = 2.0: 1.05, 3.86, p < 0.05), female sex (OR = 2.24: 1.68\u20132.99, p < 0.001), migraine in childhood diagnosed by physicians (OR = 1.76: 1.23\u20132.50, p < 0.01), and higher trait neuroticism (OR = 1.17:1.26-1.06, p < 0.01): < 0 were all significantly associated with the prevalence of migraine in adulthood.
