However, different software packages tend to use different variants, which lead to a translation problem if more than one package is used. Here the relationships between squared Mahalanobis distance D2, the GH distance of WinISI, and the T2 and leverage (L) statistics of The Unscrambler are established as D2= T2 \u2248 L \u00d7 n \u2248 GH \u00d7 k, where n and k are the numbers of samples and variables, respectively, in the set of spectral data used to establish the distance measure. The implications for setting thresholds for outlier detection are discussed. On the way to this result the principal component scores from WinISI and The Unscrambler are compared. Both packages scale the scores for a component to have variances proportional to the contribution of that component to total variance, but the WinISI scores, unlike those from The Unscrambler, do not have mean zero.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Hotelling\u2019s T2", "leverage", "Mahalanobis distance", "near infrared spectroscopy", "outliers", "principal components"], "IndexKeywords": ["Hotelling", "leverage", "Mahalanobis distances", "outliers", "Principal Components"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85067702534", "SubjectAreas": [["Spectroscopy", "CHEM", "1607"]], "AuthorData": {"13807579400": {"Name": "Garrido-Varo A.", "AuthorID": "13807579400", "AffiliationID": "60003138", "AffiliationName": "Non-Destructive Spectral Sensors Unit, Faculty of Agriculture and Forestry Engineering, University of Cordoba"}, "6603284398": {"Name": "Garcia-Olmo J.", "AuthorID": "6603284398", "AffiliationID": "60003138", "AffiliationName": "NIR/ MIR Spectroscopy Unit, Central Service for Research Support, University of Cordoba"}, "7004179964": {"Name": "Fearn T.", "AuthorID": "7004179964", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Statistical Science, University College London"}}}
