Published by Elsevier B.V.The well-known linear stability theory of wind-wave generation is revisited with a focus on the generation of wave groups. As well as recovering the usual temporal instability, the analysis has the outcome that the wave group must move with a real-valued group velocity. This has the consequence that both the wave frequency and the wavenumber should be complex-valued. In the frame of reference moving with the group velocity, the growth rate is enhanced above that for just a temporally growing monochromatic sinusoidal wave. The analysis is extended to the weakly nonlinear regime where a nonlinear Schr\u00d6dinger equation with a linear growth term is discussed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["group velocity", "Wave group", "wind wave generation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Frame of reference", "Group velocities", "Linear stability theory", "Temporal instability", "Wave frequencies", "Wave group", "Weakly non-linear", "Wind wave"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85047466008", "SubjectAreas": [["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"]], "AuthorData": {"35462748600": {"Name": "Grimshaw R.", "AuthorID": "35462748600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University College London"}}}
