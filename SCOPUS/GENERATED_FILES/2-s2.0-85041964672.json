All rights reserved.Hierarchical structure has been cherished as a grammatical universal. We use experimental methods to show where linear order is also a relevant syntactic relation. An identical methodology and design were used across six research sites on South Slavic languages. Experimental results show that in certain configurations, grammatical production can in fact favor linear order over hierarchical structure. However, these findings are limited to coordinate structures and distinct from the kind of production errors found with comparable configurations such as \"attraction\" errors. The results demonstrate that agreement morphology may be computed in a series of steps, one of which is partly independent from syntactic hierarchy.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Female", "Humans", "Language", "Linguistics", "Male", "Psycholinguistics", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85041964672", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"57200629470": {"Name": "Gold J.", "AuthorID": "57200629470", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychology and Language Sciences, University College London"}, "23025748800": {"Name": "Nevins A.", "AuthorID": "23025748800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychology and Language Sciences, University College London"}, "25222642500": {"Name": "Arsenijevi\u0107 B.", "AuthorID": "25222642500", "AffiliationID": "60068806", "AffiliationName": "Department for Serbian Language, Faculty of Philosophy, University of Ni\u0161"}, "57200626466": {"Name": "Mit\u00edc I.", "AuthorID": "57200626466", "AffiliationID": "60068806", "AffiliationName": "Department for Serbian Language, Faculty of Philosophy, University of Ni\u0161"}, "57194833143": {"Name": "Stankov\u00edc B.", "AuthorID": "57194833143", "AffiliationID": "60068806", "AffiliationName": "Department for Serbian Language, Faculty of Philosophy, University of Ni\u0161"}, "56411867600": {"Name": "Batini\u0107 M.", "AuthorID": "56411867600", "AffiliationID": "60017028", "AffiliationName": "Department of Linguistics, University of Zadar"}, "56736654600": {"Name": "Kresi\u0107 M.", "AuthorID": "56736654600", "AffiliationID": "60017028", "AffiliationName": "Department of Linguistics, University of Zadar"}, "36130960100": {"Name": "Becker M.", "AuthorID": "36130960100", "AffiliationID": "60026415", "AffiliationName": "Department of Linguistics, Stony Brook University"}, "57200628132": {"Name": "\u010cordalija N.", "AuthorID": "57200628132", "AffiliationID": "60068811", "AffiliationName": "Department of English, Faculty of Philosophy, University of Sarajevo"}, "24387981000": {"Name": "Leko N.", "AuthorID": "24387981000", "AffiliationID": "60068811", "AffiliationName": "Department of English, Faculty of Philosophy, University of Sarajevo"}, "15118977800": {"Name": "Maru\u0161i\u010d F.", "AuthorID": "15118977800", "AffiliationID": "60025254", "AffiliationName": "Center for Cognitive Science of Language, University of Nova Gorica"}, "57200628601": {"Name": "\u0160uligoj T.", "AuthorID": "57200628601", "AffiliationID": "60025254", "AffiliationName": "Center for Cognitive Science of Language, University of Nova Gorica"}, "55256211900": {"Name": "Mil\u00edcev T.", "AuthorID": "55256211900", "AffiliationID": "60068801", "AffiliationName": "Department of English Studies, Faculty of Philosophy, University of Novi Sad"}, "54891914800": {"Name": "Mil\u00edcev\u00edc N.", "AuthorID": "54891914800", "AffiliationID": "60068801", "AffiliationName": "Department of English Studies, Faculty of Philosophy, University of Novi Sad"}, "53980318300": {"Name": "Peti-Stant\u00edc A.", "AuthorID": "53980318300", "AffiliationID": "60008408", "AffiliationName": "Department of South Slavic Languages and Literatures, Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences, University of Zagreb"}, "57200628645": {"Name": "Tu\u0161ek J.", "AuthorID": "57200628645", "AffiliationID": "60008408", "AffiliationName": "Department of South Slavic Languages and Literatures, Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences, University of Zagreb"}}}
