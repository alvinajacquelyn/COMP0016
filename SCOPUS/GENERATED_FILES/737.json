Heart rate (HR), fluid balance and sweat electrolyte content were assessed on 17 international players across a 6-day tournament involving 5 games and 2 training sessions played indoors (23 \u00b1 2 \u00b0C, 30 \u00b1 2% relative humidity). Active play (effective) mean HR was 155 \u00b1 14 bpm (80 \u00b1 7.5% HRmax) with the majority of time (64%) spent exercising at intensities >80% HRmax. Mean (SD) sweat rates during games were 1.02 \u00b1 0.07 L \u00b7 h-1 and on 56% of occasions fluid intake matched or exceeded sweat loss. A significant relationship was observed between estimated sweat loss and fluid intake during exercise (r2 = .121, p = .001). Mean sweat sodium concentration was 38 \u00b1 10 mmol \u00b7 L-1, with significant associations observed between player sweat rates and time spent exercising at intensities >90% HRmax (r2 = .181, p = .001). Fluid and electrolyte loss appear to be work rate dependent in elite female handball players, whom appear well capable of replacing fluids lost within a tournament environment. Due to large between-athlete variations, a targeted approach may be warranted for certain players only.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Athletic training", "Exercise performance", "Exercise training", "Nutrition"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Athletes", "Athletic Performance", "Beverages", "Electrolytes", "Female", "Fluid Therapy", "Heart Rate", "Humans", "Nutrition Assessment", "Physical Exertion", "Rehydration Solutions", "Running", "Sports", "Sports Nutritional Physiological Phenomena", "Stress, Physiological", "Sweat", "Sweating", "Time Factors", "Water-Electrolyte Balance", "Water-Electrolyte Imbalance", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84925430627", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (miscellaneous)", "MEDI", "2701"], ["Orthopedics and Sports Medicine", "MEDI", "2732"], ["Nutrition and Dietetics", "NURS", "2916"]], "AuthorData": {"34871750100": {"Name": "Cunniffe B.", "AuthorID": "34871750100", "AffiliationID": "60107252", "AffiliationName": "English Institute of Sport, Bisham Abbey"}, "56568193800": {"Name": "Fallan C.", "AuthorID": "56568193800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "ISEH, University College"}, "56392676500": {"Name": "Yau A.", "AuthorID": "56392676500", "AffiliationID": "60022046", "AffiliationName": "School of Healthcare Sciences, Manchester Metropolitan University"}, "23100000400": {"Name": "Evans G.", "AuthorID": "23100000400", "AffiliationID": "60022046", "AffiliationName": "School of Healthcare Sciences, Manchester Metropolitan University"}, "7003493917": {"Name": "Cardinale M.", "AuthorID": "7003493917", "AffiliationID": "60106885", "AffiliationName": "Aspire Academy"}}}
