Design Serial cross-sectional study. Setting Nationally representative sample, India. Data sources Three consecutive National Sample Surveys (NSS) on healthcare utilisation in 1995-1996, 2004 and 2014. Participants Six hundred and thirty-three thousand four hundred and five individuals in NSS 1995-1996, 385 055 in NSS 2004 and 335 499 in NSS 2014. Methods Descriptive statistics, multivariable analyses and a regression decomposition technique were used to attain the study objectives. Result The annual hospitalisation rate per 1000 increased from 16.6 to 37.0 in India from 1995-1996 to 2014. The hospitalisation rate was about half in the less developed than the more developed states in 2014 (26.1 vs 48.6 per 1000). Poor people used more public than private hospitals; this differential was higher in the more developed (40.7% vs 22.9%) than the less developed (54.3% vs 40.1%) states in 2014. When compared with the younger population, the older population had a 3.6 times higher hospitalisation rate (109.9 vs 30.7) and a greater proportion of hospitalisation for non-communicable diseases (80.5% vs 56.7%) in 2014. Among the older population, hospitalisation rates were comparatively lower for females, poor and rural residents. Propensity change contributed to 86.5% of the increase in hospitalisation among the older population and compositional change contributed 9.3%. Conclusion The older population in India has a much higher hospitalisation rate and has continuing greater socioeconomic differentials in hospitalisation rates. Specific policy focus on the requirements of the older population for hospital care in India is needed in light of the anticipated increase in their proportion in the population.", "AuthorKeywords": ["ageing", "decomposition", "hospitalization", "non-communicable diseases", "older population", "propensity"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Age Distribution", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Female", "Hospitalization", "Hospitals, Private", "Hospitals, Public", "Humans", "India", "Infant", "Infant, Newborn", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Propensity Score", "Regression Analysis", "Sex Distribution", "Socioeconomic Factors", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85050884419", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"55633420800": {"Name": "Pandey A.", "AuthorID": "55633420800", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Population Health, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "7007017243": {"Name": "Dandona L.", "AuthorID": "7007017243", "AffiliationID": "60015481, 60091926", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, University of Washington"}, "7201975104": {"Name": "Clarke L.", "AuthorID": "7201975104", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Population Health, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "14020124700": {"Name": "Ploubidis G.B.", "AuthorID": "14020124700", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Longitudinal Studies, Department of Social Science, UCL- Institute of Education, University College London"}}}
