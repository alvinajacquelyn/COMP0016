Network-generating algorithms typically produce fairly contrived networks and lack mechanisms by which to systematically sample the space of network solutions. In this paper, we explore the potential of a multi-objective novelty-biased GA to provide a viable alternative to these algorithms. We believe our results provide the first proof of principle that (i) it is possible to use GAs to generate graphs satisfying set levels of key classical graph theoretic properties and (ii) it is possible to generate diverse solutions within these constraints.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Clustering", "Coevolutionary dynamic", "Degree distribution", "Graph diversity", "Higherorder structure", "Multi-objective optimisation", "Network generation", "Novelty search"], "IndexKeywords": ["Clustering", "Coevolutionary dynamics", "Degree distributions", "Graph diversity", "Higher-order structure", "Network generation", "Novelty search"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84959342755", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Theoretical Computer Science", "MATH", "2614"], ["Artificial Intelligence", "COMP", "1702"]], "AuthorData": {"57148363600": {"Name": "Overbury P.", "AuthorID": "57148363600", "AffiliationID": "60017317", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Computational Neuroscience and Robotics, Department of Informatics, University of Sussex"}, "55884445900": {"Name": "Berthouze L.", "AuthorID": "55884445900", "AffiliationID": "60017317", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Computational Neuroscience and Robotics, Department of Informatics, University of Sussex"}}}
