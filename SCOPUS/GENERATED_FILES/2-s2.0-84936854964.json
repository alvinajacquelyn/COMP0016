We integrate discussion of comics\u2019 formal properties with a sitespecific comics installation (Dave McKean\u2019s The Rut) to show the intertwining of these spaces. Our argument is articulated through juxtaposition of the literature on space-time in comics with our case study. This montage speaks to graphic narratives\u2019 formal properties, especially its alchemic, emergent nature. Our argument begins by introducing The Rut as an example of how space and narrative can be intertwined. Our argument tacks back to the literature, discussing the pluralization of time-space(s) throughout recent writing within human geography and how this can help us think with The Rut. We then briefly describe the way The Rut is physically laid out. Returning once again to the literature, we argue that the topological figuration of comics is mediated by readers\u2019 practices of relation-building and narrative construction, which are in turn impacted by the irreversible nature of time. This is demonstrated for The Rut through experience of the art as well as participant observation. Finally, we highlight how actual spaces are overlaid with virtual spaces that help shape the actualized version; we illustrate this by showing how the embodied experience of The Rut\u2019s materiality was productive of a multiplicity of experiential spaces, both actual and virtual. We close by drawing three conclusions: the first about the implications of graphic narrative\u2019s relational ontology for how social scientists narrate socio-spatial processes; the second, a call for more empirical work examining the emergence, evolution, and dissipation of topological spaces; and the third about the political possibility of initiating new practices of \u2018reading\u2019 spaces and times to produce and access new ways of being in the world.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Comics", "Dave McKean", "Graphic narrative", "Henri Bergson", "Installation art", "Topology"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84936854964", "SubjectAreas": [["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"], ["Cultural Studies", "SOCI", "3316"], ["Environmental Science (miscellaneous)", "ENVI", "2301"]], "AuthorData": {"10139031000": {"Name": "Dittmer J.", "AuthorID": "10139031000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "7006574944": {"Name": "Latham A.", "AuthorID": "7006574944", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
