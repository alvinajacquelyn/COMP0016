The molecular regulation of TRPV1 channel activity is not yet fully understood. Therefore, we investigated factors regulating sensitisation of this receptor during development of neuropathic pain in a rat model of chronic construction injury (CCI) in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG).In the rat CCI model, elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6) in DRG corresponded to development of neuropathic pain. We assessed the expression of known kinases influencing TRPV1 sensitisation at the mRNA and/or protein level. Protein kinase C \u03b5 (PKC\u03b5) showed the strongest upregulation at the mRNA and protein levels among all tested kinases. Co-expression of PKC\u03b5 and TRPV1 in L5 DRG of CCI animals was high during the development of neuropathic pain. The number of neurons expressing PKC\u03b5 increased throughout the experiment.We provide complex data on the expression of a variety of factors involved in TRPV1 sensitisation in a CCI model of neuropathic pain. Our study supports evidence for involvement of TRPV1 in the development of neuropathic pain, by showing increased expression of interleukins and kinases responsible for the channel sensitisation. TNF\u03b1 and NGF seem to play a role in the transition from acute to neuropathic pain, while PKC\u03b5 in its maintenance. Further studies might confirm their significance as novel targets for the treatment of neuropathic pain.", "AuthorKeywords": ["CCI", "DRG", "Neuronal inflammation", "Neuropathic pain", "TRPV1 sensitisation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Ganglia, Spinal", "Interleukin-1beta", "Interleukin-6", "Male", "Neuralgia", "Protein Kinase C-epsilon", "Rats", "Rats, Wistar", "RNA, Messenger", "TRPV Cation Channels", "Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84922550901", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"55639256000": {"Name": "Malek N.", "AuthorID": "55639256000", "AffiliationID": "60000995, 60014383", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Pain Pathophysiology, Department of Pain Pharmacology, Institute of Pharmacology, Polish Academy of Sciences"}, "56511507900": {"Name": "Pajak A.", "AuthorID": "56511507900", "AffiliationID": "60000995, 60014383", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Pain Pathophysiology, Department of Pain Pharmacology, Institute of Pharmacology, Polish Academy of Sciences"}, "56512417300": {"Name": "Kolosowska N.", "AuthorID": "56512417300", "AffiliationID": "60000995, 60014383", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Pain Pathophysiology, Department of Pain Pharmacology, Institute of Pharmacology, Polish Academy of Sciences"}, "56511468700": {"Name": "Kucharczyk M.", "AuthorID": "56511468700", "AffiliationID": "60000995, 60014383", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Pain Pathophysiology, Department of Pain Pharmacology, Institute of Pharmacology, Polish Academy of Sciences"}, "14120485500": {"Name": "Starowicz K.", "AuthorID": "14120485500", "AffiliationID": "60000995, 60014383", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Pain Pathophysiology, Department of Pain Pharmacology, Institute of Pharmacology, Polish Academy of Sciences"}}}
