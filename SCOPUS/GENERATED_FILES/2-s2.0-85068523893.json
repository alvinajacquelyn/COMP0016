KGaA, WeinheimThe deceptively simple tin selenide (SnSe) film has emerged as an appealing 2D material with a narrow bandgap, high charge carrier mobility, and significant thermoelectric figure of merit. In particular, compared with most commonly investigated 2D materials, SnSe with a puckered honeycomb structure possesses a lower lattice symmetry, resulting in prominent in-plane anisotropy. Herein, with polarization-dependent Raman spectroscopy and polarization-dependent nonlinear absorption measurements, pronounced polarization-dependent nonlinear optical properties of a SnSe flake are demonstrated originating from the anisotropic optical transition probability of SnSe, which is confirmed by ultrafast polarization-dependent pump\u2013probe experiments. Furthermore, a novel SnSe-based all-optical switch is proposed and experimentally explored. Specifically, due to the polarization-dependent nonlinear optical response of SnSe, this all-optical switch can access the \u201cON\u201d and \u201cOFF\u201d modes of continuous-wave signal light (633 nm, 13 \u00b5W) by altering the polarization of the switching light (800 nm, 65 fs, 1 kHz, 34 GW cm\u22122), rather than modifying its intensity, achieving an unexpectedly high ON/OFF ratio (the difference of the normalized transmittance of signal light between \u201cON\u201d and \u201cOFF\u201d modes) of 44%. This work opens up real perspectives for versatile optoelectronic devices based on SnSe materials.", "AuthorKeywords": ["all-optical switches", "anisotropy", "nonlinear optics", "SnSe flake"], "IndexKeywords": ["All optical switch", "Continuous-wave signals", "Non-linear optical properties", "Nonlinear absorptions", "Nonlinear optical response", "Optical transition probability", "SnSe flake", "Thermoelectric figure of merit"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85068523893", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"]], "AuthorData": {"57204426620": {"Name": "Zhang C.", "AuthorID": "57204426620", "AffiliationID": "60024350", "AffiliationName": "College of Advanced Interdisciplinary Studies, National University of Defense Technology"}, "57210739043": {"Name": "Ouyang H.", "AuthorID": "57210739043", "AffiliationID": "60024350", "AffiliationName": "College of Advanced Interdisciplinary Studies, National University of Defense Technology"}, "57205134193": {"Name": "Miao R.", "AuthorID": "57205134193", "AffiliationID": "60024350", "AffiliationName": "College of Advanced Interdisciplinary Studies, National University of Defense Technology"}, "57200244837": {"Name": "Sui Y.", "AuthorID": "57200244837", "AffiliationID": "60024350", "AffiliationName": "College of Advanced Interdisciplinary Studies, National University of Defense Technology"}, "57209619106": {"Name": "Hao H.", "AuthorID": "57209619106", "AffiliationID": "60024350", "AffiliationName": "College of Advanced Interdisciplinary Studies, National University of Defense Technology"}, "57203747260": {"Name": "Tang Y.", "AuthorID": "57203747260", "AffiliationID": "60024350", "AffiliationName": "College of Advanced Interdisciplinary Studies, National University of Defense Technology"}, "55598164400": {"Name": "Xu Z.", "AuthorID": "55598164400", "AffiliationID": "60024350", "AffiliationName": "College of Advanced Interdisciplinary Studies, National University of Defense Technology"}, "7401753972": {"Name": "Cheng X.", "AuthorID": "7401753972", "AffiliationID": "60024350", "AffiliationName": "College of Advanced Interdisciplinary Studies, National University of Defense Technology"}, "35590198700": {"Name": "Jiang T.", "AuthorID": "35590198700", "AffiliationID": "60024350", "AffiliationName": "College of Advanced Interdisciplinary Studies, National University of Defense Technology"}, "55792104600": {"Name": "You J.", "AuthorID": "55792104600", "AffiliationID": "120797264", "AffiliationName": "National Innovation Institute of Defense Technology"}, "36571054700": {"Name": "Zheng X.", "AuthorID": "36571054700", "AffiliationID": "120797264", "AffiliationName": "National Innovation Institute of Defense Technology"}}}
