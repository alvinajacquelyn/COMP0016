Hence there is much interest in the growth of thin films of BiFeO3 via chemical vapor deposition (CVD); however, the number of suitable bismuth precursors is severely limited. A series of homoleptic bismuth(III) \u03b2-diketonate complexes were synthesized via simple room temperature ligand-exchange reactions from [Bi(N(SiMe3)2)3] and free diketonate ligands, which yielded the crystal structure of [Bi(acac)3] as a 1-D polymer. We attempted to use these complexes for low pressure CVD (LPCVD) growth of BiFeO3 films with [Fe(acac)3]; however, all bismuth complexes exhibited poor volatilities and decomposition characteristics, and as a result film growth was unsuccessful. Subsequently, the volatile alkoxide [Bi(OtBu)3], with [Fe(acac)3], was used to grow dense BiFeO3 films via low pressure CVD. The BiFeO3 films possessed multiferroic properties at room temperature and exhibited activity for visible light-driven water oxidation in the presence of a Ag+ electron scavenger, which improved significantly when modified with a cobalt surface cocatalyst. The increase in activity, probed by time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy, was attributed to improved charge carrier separation arising from the in-built internal electric field of BiFeO3 in addition to the presence of an efficient cobalt oxygen evolution catalyst.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Chemical vapor depositions (CVD)", "Decomposition characteristics", "Diketonate complexes", "Internal electric fields", "Ligand exchange reactions", "Multiferroic properties", "Photocatalytic behaviors", "Time resolved photoluminescence spectroscopies"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84978984871", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"]], "AuthorData": {"35722558900": {"Name": "Moniz S.", "AuthorID": "35722558900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "7404638641": {"Name": "Tang J.", "AuthorID": "7404638641", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "7005826606": {"Name": "Blackman C.", "AuthorID": "7005826606", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "7003437916": {"Name": "Carmalt C.", "AuthorID": "7003437916", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "57197043008": {"Name": "Pugh D.", "AuthorID": "57197043008", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Imperial College London, South Kensington Campus"}}}
