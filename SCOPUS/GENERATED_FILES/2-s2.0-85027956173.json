We analyze the stability of brain signals as end-users with motor disabilities progress from performing simple standard on-screen training tasks to interacting with real devices in the real world. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the concept of shared control - which interprets the user's commands in context - empowers users to perform rather complex tasks without a high workload. We present the results of nine end-users with motor disabilities who were able to complete navigation tasks with a telepresence robot successfully in a remote environment (in some cases in a different country) that they had never previously visited. Moreover, these end-users achieved similar levels of performance to a control group of 10 healthy users who were already familiar with the environment.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Application control", "brain-computer interface (BCI)", "electroencephalogram (EEG)", "end-users with motor disabilities", "motor imagery", "robotic device", "shared control", "telepresence"], "IndexKeywords": ["Application-control", "Electro-encephalogram (EEG)", "Motor disability", "Motor imagery", "Robotic devices", "Shared control", "Telepresence"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85027956173", "SubjectAreas": [["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"9940938400": {"Name": "Leeb R.", "AuthorID": "9940938400", "AffiliationID": "60028186", "AffiliationName": "Center for Neuroprosthetics, \u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne"}, "36810606700": {"Name": "Tonin L.", "AuthorID": "36810606700", "AffiliationID": "60000481", "AffiliationName": "Intelligent Autonomous Systems Laboratory, Department of Information Engineering, University of Padua"}, "55344846000": {"Name": "Rohm M.", "AuthorID": "55344846000", "AffiliationID": "60016908", "AffiliationName": "University of Heidelberg"}, "54681773800": {"Name": "Desideri L.", "AuthorID": "54681773800", "AffiliationID": "119121792", "AffiliationName": "AIAS Bologna Onlus/Ausilioteca"}, "56295883500": {"Name": "Carlson T.", "AuthorID": "56295883500", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60099424", "AffiliationName": "Aspire Centre for Rehabilitation Engineering and Assistive Technology, University College London"}, "57216343965": {"Name": "Mill\u00e1n J.D.R.", "AuthorID": "57216343965", "AffiliationID": "60028186", "AffiliationName": "Defitech Chai. in Brain-Machine Interface, Center for Neuroprosthetics, \u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne"}}}
