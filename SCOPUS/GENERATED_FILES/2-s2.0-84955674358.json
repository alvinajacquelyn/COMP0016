This article presents the first sustained analysis of Tocqueville\u2019s speeches and writings on French corruption. It examines Tocqueville\u2019s initial encounter with corruption during his run for parliamentary office, his sophisticated account of the sources of corruption, and his strategies for reforming French politics. The article contends that taking seriously Tocqueville\u2019s struggle against corruption has the effect of complicating several conventional interpretations of his thought. In his speeches and writings on corruption Tocqueville shows himself remarkably willing to compromise with, even to work with, centralisation. And he argues that in a nation like France which lacks substantial local self-government, a vibrant parliamentary politics could be an effective means for promoting energetic civic participation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Administrative state", "Alexis de Tocqueville", "Corruption", "French liberalism", "July Monarchy", "Patronage"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84955674358", "SubjectAreas": [["History", "ARTS", "1202"], ["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"], ["Philosophy", "ARTS", "1211"]], "AuthorData": {"56021710200": {"Name": "Selinger W.", "AuthorID": "56021710200", "AffiliationID": "60009982", "AffiliationName": "Committee on Degrees in Social Studies, Harvard University"}}}
