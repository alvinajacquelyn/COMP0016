This study sought the views of local decision makers involved in the implementation of the CWP in the winter of 2012/13 to establish the effects of the CWP on local planning. It was part of a multi-component independent evaluation of the CWP. Methods Ten LA areas were purposively sampled which varied in level of deprivation and urbanism. Fifty-two semi-structured interviews were held with health and social care managers involved in local planning between November 2012 and May 2013. Results Thematic analysis revealed that the CWP was considered a useful framework to formalize working arrangements between agencies though local leadership varied across localities. There were difficulties in engaging general practitioners, differences in defining vulnerable individuals and a lack of performance monitoring mechanisms. Conclusions The CWP was welcomed by local health and social care managers, and improved proactive winter preparedness. Areas for improvement include better integration with general practice, and targeting resources at socially isolated individuals in cold homes with specific interventions aimed at reducing social isolation and building community resilience.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Communities", "Health services", "Public health"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cold Temperature", "England", "General Practice", "Health Services", "Health Services Administration", "Humans", "Interviews as Topic", "Public Health Practice", "Social Welfare", "Vulnerable Populations"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85054080831", "SubjectAreas": [["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"8774242500": {"Name": "Heffernan C.", "AuthorID": "8774242500", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Policy Innovation Research Unit (PIRU), Faculty of Public Health and Policy, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "6602875368": {"Name": "Erens B.", "AuthorID": "6602875368", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Policy Innovation Research Unit (PIRU), Faculty of Public Health and Policy, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "7005218485": {"Name": "Mays N.", "AuthorID": "7005218485", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Policy Innovation Research Unit (PIRU), Faculty of Public Health and Policy, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "56399481000": {"Name": "Jones L.", "AuthorID": "56399481000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Applied Health Research, University College London"}, "57062013800": {"Name": "Ritchie B.", "AuthorID": "57062013800", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60170329", "AffiliationName": "Evidence Based Practice Unit, University College London, Anna Freud National Centre for Children and Families"}, "6701780461": {"Name": "Chalabi Z.", "AuthorID": "6701780461", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Social and Environmental Health Research, Faculty of Public Health and Policy, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}}}
