Following excitation of the A2(11\u03c0\u03c3\u2217) state, we observe population flow out of the Franck-Condon region on a \u227250 fs timescale. Following excitation of the B2(21\u03c0\u03c0\u2217) state, we observe population being transferred to the A2(11\u03c0\u03c3\u2217) state on a <50 fs timescale and subsequently out of the Franck-Condon region, also on a <50 fs timescale. Quantum dynamics calculations suggest that population is transferred from the B2(21\u03c0\u03c0\u2217) state through the A2(1\u03c03pz) state to the B1(21\u03c0\u03c3\u2217) state before being transferred to the A2(11\u03c0\u03c3\u2217) state.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Electronic relaxation", "Pyrrole", "Quantum dynamics simulation", "Time-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy", "Ultrafast internal conversion"], "IndexKeywords": ["Electronic relaxation", "Internal conversions", "Pyrrole", "Quantum dynamics simulation", "Time-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85018624810", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"]], "AuthorData": {"55308110700": {"Name": "Kirkby O.", "AuthorID": "55308110700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "8839107300": {"Name": "Parkes M.", "AuthorID": "8839107300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "7006625328": {"Name": "Worth G.", "AuthorID": "7006625328", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "7003283537": {"Name": "Fielding H.", "AuthorID": "7003283537", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "36967643400": {"Name": "Neville S.", "AuthorID": "36967643400", "AffiliationID": "60028897", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Ottawa"}}}
