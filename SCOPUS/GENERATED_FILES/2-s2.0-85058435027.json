We have used the recently proposed Parallel Level Sets (PLS) anatomical prior as it has shown promising results in the literature. It was incorporated into the previously proposed preconditioned algorithm (L-BFGS-B-PC) for achieving both good image quality and fast convergence rate. A 2-dimensional (2D) disc phantom with a hot spot at the center and a 3D XCAT thorax phantom with lesions inserted in different slices are used to study how surrounding activity and lesion location affect both the visual appearance and quantitative consistency, respectively. Anatomical information is provided and assumed to be well-aligned with the corresponding activity images. For the XCAT phantom, the inserted lesions are either present or absent in the anatomical images to investigate the influence of the anatomical penalty. The reconstructed images for both phantoms with and without applying the spatially-variant penalty strength are compared. Preliminary results demonstrate that applying the spatially-variant penalization with an anatomical prior can reduce the dependence of local contrast on background activity and lesion location. Further work to explore the potential benefit in clinical imaging is warranted.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Anatomical images", "Anatomical information", "Fast convergence rate", "PET reconstruction", "Potential benefits", "Preconditioned algorithms", "Reconstructed image", "Visual appearance"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85058435027", "SubjectAreas": [["Instrumentation", "PHYS", "3105"], ["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"], ["Nuclear and High Energy Physics", "PHYS", "3106"]], "AuthorData": {"35621323500": {"Name": "Tsai Y.J.", "AuthorID": "35621323500", "AffiliationID": "60090043, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Nuclear Medicine, University College London"}, "15842886700": {"Name": "Bousse A.", "AuthorID": "15842886700", "AffiliationID": "60090043, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Nuclear Medicine, University College London"}, "23480655200": {"Name": "Thielemans K.", "AuthorID": "23480655200", "AffiliationID": "60090043, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Nuclear Medicine, University College London"}, "55076094600": {"Name": "Schramm G.", "AuthorID": "55076094600", "AffiliationID": "60121202, 60025063", "AffiliationName": "Department of Imaging and Pathology, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven"}, "7004308496": {"Name": "Nuyts J.", "AuthorID": "7004308496", "AffiliationID": "60121202, 60025063", "AffiliationName": "Department of Imaging and Pathology, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven"}, "7401988960": {"Name": "Ahn S.", "AuthorID": "7401988960", "AffiliationID": "60021211", "AffiliationName": "GE Global Research"}, "7006642803": {"Name": "Stearns C.W.", "AuthorID": "7006642803", "AffiliationID": "60106890", "AffiliationName": "MICT Engineering, GE Healthcare"}, "7005759823": {"Name": "Arridge S.", "AuthorID": "7005759823", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}}}
