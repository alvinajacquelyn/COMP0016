Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.Open MRI in functional positions has potential to directly and non-invasively assess cam femoroacetabular impingement (FAI). Our objective was to investigate whether open MRI can depict intrusion of the cam deformity into the intra-articular joint space, and whether intrusion is associated with elevated acetabular contact force. Cadaver hips (9 cam; 3 controls) were positioned in an anterior impingement posture and imaged using open MRI with multi-planar reformatting. The \u03b2-angle (describing clearance between the femoral neck and acetabulum) was measured around the entire circumference of the femoral neck. We defined a binary \"MRI cam-intrusion sign\" (positive if \u03b2 < 0\u00b0). We then instrumented each hip with a piezoresistive sensor and conducted six repeated positioning trials, measuring acetabular contact force (F). We defined a binary \"contact-force sign\" (positive if F > 20N). Cam hips were more likely than controls to have both a positive MRI cam-intrusion sign (p = 0.0182, Fisher's exact test) and positive contact-force sign (p = 0.0083), which represents direct experimental evidence for cam intrusion. There was also a relationship between the MRI cam-intrusion sign and contact-force sign (p = 0.033), representing a link between imaging and mechanics. Our findings indicate that open MRI has significant potential for in vivo investigation of the cam FAI mechanism.", "AuthorKeywords": ["biomechanics", "Femoroacetabular impingement", "hip", "open MRI", "osteoarthritis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Female", "Femoracetabular Impingement", "Hip Joint", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Middle Aged"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84955755913", "SubjectAreas": [["Orthopedics and Sports Medicine", "MEDI", "2732"]], "AuthorData": {"56654402100": {"Name": "Buchan L.L.", "AuthorID": "56654402100", "AffiliationID": "60086833, 60010365", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, Centre for Hip Health and Mobility, University of British Columbia"}, "55633657000": {"Name": "Zhang H.", "AuthorID": "55633657000", "AffiliationID": "60086833, 60010365", "AffiliationName": "Department of Orthopaedics, Centre for Hip Health and Mobility, University of British Columbia"}, "9737194300": {"Name": "Wilson D.R.", "AuthorID": "9737194300", "AffiliationID": "60086833, 60010365", "AffiliationName": "Department of Orthopaedics, Centre for Hip Health and Mobility, University of British Columbia"}, "24466324900": {"Name": "Konan S.", "AuthorID": "24466324900", "AffiliationID": "60027009", "AffiliationName": "Department of Orthopaedics, Vancouver General Hospital"}, "23100043100": {"Name": "Heaslip I.", "AuthorID": "23100043100", "AffiliationID": "60010365", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, University of British Columbia"}, "8628544400": {"Name": "Ratzlaff C.R.", "AuthorID": "8628544400", "AffiliationID": "60016782, 60002746", "AffiliationName": "Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School"}}}
