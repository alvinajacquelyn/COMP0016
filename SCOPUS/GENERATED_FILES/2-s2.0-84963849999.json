The pneumococcal-conjugate vaccines have now been rolled out in many high income settings and an increasing number of low and middle income countries. They have been highly effective at preventing vaccine serotype disease in infants. However, a window of susceptibility remains prior to the first vaccination at around six weeks of age. This paper summarizes the data available on both maternal and neonatal vaccination to prevent disease in newborns and early infancy and considers the key challenges and next steps for research in the field.", "AuthorKeywords": ["23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine", "immunogenicity", "maternal vaccination", "nasopharyngeal carriage", "neonatal vaccination", "pneumococcal conjugate vaccine", "pneumococcus", "safety", "Streptococcus pneumoniae"], "IndexKeywords": ["Africa South of the Sahara", "Child, Preschool", "Female", "Humans", "Infant", "Infant, Newborn", "Infectious Disease Transmission, Vertical", "Pneumococcal Infections", "Pneumococcal Vaccines", "Pregnancy", "Pregnancy Complications, Infectious", "Vaccination", "Vaccines, Conjugate"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84963849999", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"], ["Molecular Medicine", "BIOC", "1313"], ["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"], ["Drug Discovery", "PHAR", "3002"]], "AuthorData": {"14007309800": {"Name": "Clarke E.", "AuthorID": "14007309800", "AffiliationID": "60072002", "AffiliationName": "Vaccines and Immunity Theme, MRC Unit, The Gambia"}, "7004011883": {"Name": "Kampmann B.", "AuthorID": "7004011883", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Academic Department of Paediatrics, Imperial College London"}, "7102190212": {"Name": "Goldblatt D.", "AuthorID": "7102190212", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Child Health, University College London"}}}
