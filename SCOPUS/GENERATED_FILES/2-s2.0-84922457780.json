The first school is linked to path analysis and structural equation models (SEMs), while the second is related mostly to methods developed within the potential outcomes approach to causal inference. By giving model-free definitions of direct and indirect effects and clear assumptions for their identification, the latter school has formalized notions intuitively developed in the former and has greatly increased the flexibility of the models involved. However, through its predominant focus on nonparametric identification, the causal inference approach to effect decomposition via natural effects is limited to settings that exclude intermediate confounders. Such confounders are naturally dealt with (albeit with the caveats of informality and modeling inflexibility) in the SEM framework. Therefore, it seems pertinent to revisit SEMs with intermediate confounders, armed with the formal definitions and (parametric) identification assumptions from causal inference. Here we investigate: 1) how identification assumptions affect the specification of SEMs, 2) whether the more restrictive SEM assumptions can be relaxed, and 3) whether existing sensitivity analyses can be extended to this setting. Data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (1990-2005) are used for illustration.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Eating disorders", "Estimation by combination", "G-computation", "Parametric identification", "Path analysis", "Sensitivity analysis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Body Mass Index", "Causality", "Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)", "Epidemiologic Methods", "Feeding and Eating Disorders", "Female", "Humans", "Mathematical Concepts", "Models, Theoretical"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84922457780", "SubjectAreas": [["Epidemiology", "MEDI", "2713"]], "AuthorData": {"7004622714": {"Name": "De Stavola B.L.", "AuthorID": "7004622714", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Statistics, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "54412038100": {"Name": "Daniel R.M.", "AuthorID": "54412038100", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Statistics, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "14020124700": {"Name": "Ploubidis G.B.", "AuthorID": "14020124700", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Statistics, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "16031429800": {"Name": "Micali N.", "AuthorID": "16031429800", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Statistics, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}}}
