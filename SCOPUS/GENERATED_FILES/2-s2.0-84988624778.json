In many applications, these targets are shielded by external materials and thus cannot be directly accessed. Hence, interrogation techniques are required that allow penetration through the shielding materials, in order for the target to be identified. Electromagnetic interrogation techniques represent a powerful solution to this challenge, as they enable penetration through conductive shields. In this work, we demonstrate the power of resonant electromagnetic induction imaging to penetrate through metallic shields (1.5-mm-thick) and image targets (having conductivities \u03c3 ranging from 0.54 to 59.77 MSm-1) concealed behind them.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Interrogation techniques", "Metallic shield", "Shielding materials"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84988624778", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"55212309300": {"Name": "Guilizzoni R.", "AuthorID": "55212309300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "56415822800": {"Name": "Bartlett P.", "AuthorID": "56415822800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "6603770390": {"Name": "Renzoni F.", "AuthorID": "6603770390", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "56415576300": {"Name": "Watson J.", "AuthorID": "56415576300", "AffiliationID": "60020573", "AffiliationName": "Novel Detection Concepts, National Nuclear Security Programme, Atomic Weapons Establishment"}}}
