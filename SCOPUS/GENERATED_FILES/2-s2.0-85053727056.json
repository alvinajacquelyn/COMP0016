We investigated the combined association of these factors with the prediction of CVD and all-cause mortality in a representative cohort of older men and women.Methods We measured C-reactive protein (CRP) and depressive symptoms in 5328 men and women aged 52-89 years in the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing. Depressive symptoms were measured using the eight-item Centre for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale. CRP was analysed from peripheral blood. Mortality was ascertained from national registers and associations with depressive symptoms and inflammation were estimated using Cox proportional hazard models.Results We identified 112 CVD related deaths out of 420 all-cause deaths in men and 109 CVD related deaths out of 334 all-cause deaths in women over a mean follow-up of 7.7 years. Men with both depressive symptoms and high CRP (3-20 mg/L) had an increased risk of CVD mortality (hazard ratio; 95% confidence interval: 3.89; 2.04-7.44) and all-cause mortality (2.40; 1.65-3.48) after adjusting for age, socioeconomic variables and health behaviours. This considerably exceeds the risks associated with high CRP alone (CVD 2.43; 1.59-3.71, all-cause 1.49; 1.20-1.84). There was no significant increase in mortality risk associated with depressive symptoms alone in men. In women, neither depressive symptoms or inflammation alone or the combination of both significantly predicted CVD or all-cause mortality.Conclusions The combination of depressive symptoms and increased inflammation confers a considerable increase in CVD mortality risk for men. These effects appear to be independent, suggesting an additive role.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cardiovascular disease", "depressive symptoms", "inflammation", "mortality"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Aging", "Cardiovascular Diseases", "Cause of Death", "Comorbidity", "Depression", "England", "Female", "Humans", "Inflammation", "Longitudinal Studies", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Proportional Hazards Models", "Registries", "Risk Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85053727056", "SubjectAreas": [["Applied Psychology", "PSYC", "3202"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"57203951063": {"Name": "Lawes S.", "AuthorID": "57203951063", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "6505997583": {"Name": "Demakakos P.", "AuthorID": "6505997583", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "7102289942": {"Name": "Steptoe A.", "AuthorID": "7102289942", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "7402636448": {"Name": "Lewis G.", "AuthorID": "7402636448", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, University College London"}, "55440517500": {"Name": "Carvalho L.A.", "AuthorID": "55440517500", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Pharmacology, William Harvey Research Institute, Queen Mary University of London"}}}
