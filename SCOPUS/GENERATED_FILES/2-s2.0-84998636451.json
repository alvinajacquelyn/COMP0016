The objective was to define precise criteria for diagnosing AGI. Methods A process of expert review and consensus, involving formal collaboration between vascular surgeons, infection specialists, and radiologists from several English National Health Service hospital Trusts with large vascular services (Management of Aortic Graft Infection Collaboration [MAGIC]), produced the definition. Results Diagnostic criteria from three categories were classified as major or minor. It is proposed that AGI should be suspected if a single major criterion or two or more minor criteria from different categories are present. AGI is diagnosed if there is one major plus any criterion (major or minor) from another category. (i) Clinical/surgical major criteria comprise intraoperative identification of pus around a graft and situations where direct communication between the prosthesis and a nonsterile site exists, including fistulae, exposed grafts in open wounds, and deployment of an endovascular stent-graft into an infected field (e.g., mycotic aneurysm); minor criteria are localized AGI features or fever \u226538\u00b0C, where AGI is the most likely cause. (ii) Radiological major criteria comprise increasing perigraft gas volume on serial computed tomography (CT) imaging or perigraft gas or fluid (\u22657 weeks and \u22653 months, respectively) postimplantation; minor criteria include other CT features or evidence from alternative imaging techniques. (iii) Laboratory major criteria comprise isolation of microorganisms from percutaneous aspirates of perigraft fluid, explanted grafts, and other intraoperative specimens; minor criteria are positive blood cultures or elevated inflammatory indices with no alternative source. Conclusion This AGI definition potentially offers a practical and consistent diagnostic standard, essential for comparing clinical management strategies, trial design, and developing evidence-based guidelines. It requires validation that is planned in a multicenter, clinical service database supported by the Vascular Society of Great Britain & Ireland.", "AuthorKeywords": ["(Endo)Graft", "Aortic", "Definition", "Diagnosis", "Infection", "Prosthetic", "Stent-graft"], "IndexKeywords": ["Anti-Bacterial Agents", "Aorta", "Aortography", "Bacteriological Techniques", "Blood Vessel Prosthesis", "Blood Vessel Prosthesis Implantation", "Clinical Decision-Making", "Computed Tomography Angiography", "Consensus", "Device Removal", "Endovascular Procedures", "England", "Humans", "Predictive Value of Tests", "Prosthesis-Related Infections", "State Medicine", "Stents", "Terminology as Topic", "Time Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84998636451", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"22941254800": {"Name": "Lyons O.T.A.", "AuthorID": "22941254800", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Cardiovascular Division, King's College London"}, "16306367100": {"Name": "Bell R.E.", "AuthorID": "16306367100", "AffiliationID": "60005518", "AffiliationName": "Department of Vascular Surgery, Guy's & St Thomas\u2019 NHS Foundation Trust"}, "8377246500": {"Name": "Modarai B.", "AuthorID": "8377246500", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Cardiovascular Division, King's College London"}, "57193818294": {"Name": "Baguneid M.", "AuthorID": "57193818294", "AffiliationID": "60008250", "AffiliationName": "School of Health Sciences, University of Salford"}, "8680921800": {"Name": "Barwick T.D.", "AuthorID": "8680921800", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery & Cancer, Imperial College London"}, "57210013339": {"Name": "Foster N.", "AuthorID": "57210013339", "AffiliationID": "60012508", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Microbiology, Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust"}, "7003727365": {"Name": "Sandoe J.A.T.", "AuthorID": "7003727365", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "Leeds Institute of Biomedical & Clinical Sciences, University of Leeds"}, "56266099800": {"Name": "Homer-Vanniasinkam S.", "AuthorID": "56266099800", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "Leeds Vascular Institute & Leeds Institute of Genetics, Health & Therapeutics (LIGHT), University of Leeds"}, "7202260726": {"Name": "Hopkins S.", "AuthorID": "7202260726", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infectious Diseases & Microbiology, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57192711524": {"Name": "Hussain A.", "AuthorID": "57192711524", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "School of Clinical & Experimental Medicine, University of Birmingham"}, "57195055338": {"Name": "Katsanos K.", "AuthorID": "57195055338", "AffiliationID": "60024484, 60031155", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, School of Medicine, University of Patras"}, "57189496577": {"Name": "Thomas S.", "AuthorID": "57189496577", "AffiliationID": "60120605", "AffiliationName": "Department of Microbiology, University Hospital of South Manchester NHS Foundation Trust"}, "35601901900": {"Name": "Price N.M.", "AuthorID": "35601901900", "AffiliationID": "60005518", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infectious Diseases, Guy's & St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
