We hypothesized that starting peritoneal dialysis (PD) should reduce overhydration, and we measured body composition and hydration status using bioimpedance in PD patients prior to training and then at the first assessment of peritoneal membrane function. We studied 100 consecutive patients with a planned start to PD, without peritoneal infections or mechanical catheter problems, mean age 54.7 \u00b1 17.1 years, 57% male and 25% diabetic. Extracellular water (ECW) overhydration increased from -0.06 (-1.21 to 0.97) L to 0.96 (0.50 to 3.01) L, p < 0.001. Fat mass increased from 22.7 \u00b1 11.1 to 23.7 \u00b1 11.3 kg, p = 0.007). The change in ECW/ total body water (TBW) was associated with age (\u03b2 0.065, p < 0.001), increasing comorbidity (\u03b2 1.107, p = 0.005), faster peritoneal protein transport (\u03b2 1.84, p < 0.04), and negatively with serum albumin (\u03b2 -0.208, p < 0.001), and residual renal function (\u03b2 -0.725, p = 0.026). Patients who had an increase in ECW/TBW had higher C-reactive protein (CRP) both before starting (16.8 \u00b1 24.1 vs 7.7 \u00b1 18.9 mg/L), and when established on PD (15.0 \u00b1 31.8 vs 4.6 \u00b1 5.1 mg/L), p < 0.05. Rather than a reduction in ECW hydration status, overhydration increased after starting PD. This was greater for older more comorbid patients and those with an inflammatory milieu and lower residual renal function. These factors should be considered when deciding upon initial PD prescriptions to limit ECW overhydration before information on peritoneal membrane function becomes available.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bioelectrical impedance", "Extracellular water", "Glucose", "Icodextrin", "Intracellular water", "Peritoneal dialysis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Biomarkers", "Body Composition", "C-Reactive Protein", "Dialysis Solutions", "Electric Impedance", "Extracellular Fluid", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Humans", "Hypovolemia", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Peritoneal Dialysis", "Peritoneum", "Prospective Studies", "Serum Albumin", "Treatment Outcome", "Uremia", "Water-Electrolyte Imbalance"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85028472933", "SubjectAreas": [["Nephrology", "MEDI", "2727"]], "AuthorData": {"56196162800": {"Name": "Panorchan K.", "AuthorID": "56196162800", "AffiliationID": "60029950, 60022148, 60032819", "AffiliationName": "UCL Centre for Nephrology, Royal Free Hospital, University College London Medical School"}, "55437680000": {"Name": "Davenport A.", "AuthorID": "55437680000", "AffiliationID": "60029950, 60022148, 60032819", "AffiliationName": "UCL Centre for Nephrology, Royal Free Hospital, University College London Medical School"}}}
