The reference observational value from Mahlstein and Knutti (2012) that we used for comparison with the CMIP5 climate models is actually unsuitable for our purpose. This is because the value of observed sensitivity given by Mahlstein and Knutti (2012) is (1) based on sea-ice area rather than extent, and (2) only considers the period to 2007. In our study, we used extent and analyzed the sensitivity through 2014. An updated analysis based on NASA GISS Surface Temperature data (GISTEMP, http://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/) and the NASA-Team sea-ice extent until 2014 gives a larger observed sensitivity of \u2212 4.42 km2 sea-ice loss per degree of global warming. This is about twice the rate simulated by the models, and about twice the estimate of Mahlstein and Knutti (2012) that we used previously. Note, that this corrigendum only applies to the relationship for global-mean warming. The relationship between sea-ice loss and Arctic warming was correctly described in our paper, and the models indeed match the observed sensitivity relative to Arctic warming quite well. The authors would like to apologise for any inconvenience caused.
