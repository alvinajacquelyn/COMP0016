EIA is produced by the interaction of a weak probe beam with the atomic ground state driven in a degenerate coherent superposition by either a co- or counter-propagating pump beam. We have obtained an order of magnitude increase of the EIA\u2019s contrast with respect to previous similar experiments, performed with other alkalis, without compromising its linewidth. Furthermore, we show that the magneto-optic resonances can be continuously tuned from EIT to EIA by changing the relative handedness of circular polarizations of pump and probe beams, or depending on whether they co- or counter-propagate. This opens new perspectives in the use of EIA in a broad range of physical domains and in a large wealth of potential applications in optics and photonics.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Atomic ground state", "Coherent resonances", "Coherent superpositions", "Counterpropagating", "Electromagnetically induced absorption", "Electromagnetically-induced transparency", "Physical domain", "Weak probe beam"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85026382098", "SubjectAreas": [["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"]], "AuthorData": {"6701738608": {"Name": "Gozzini S.", "AuthorID": "6701738608", "AffiliationID": "60006264, 60021199", "AffiliationName": "Istituto Nazionale di Ottica, INO-CNR, SS Pisa"}, "7006372010": {"Name": "Fioretti A.", "AuthorID": "7006372010", "AffiliationID": "60006264, 60021199", "AffiliationName": "Istituto Nazionale di Ottica, INO-CNR, SS Pisa"}, "56133502200": {"Name": "Lucchesini A.", "AuthorID": "56133502200", "AffiliationID": "60006264, 60021199", "AffiliationName": "Istituto Nazionale di Ottica, INO-CNR, SS Pisa"}, "23477770400": {"Name": "Marmugi L.", "AuthorID": "23477770400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "7007039404": {"Name": "Marinelli C.", "AuthorID": "7007039404", "AffiliationID": "60002838", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physical Sciences, Earth and Environment, Universit\u00e0 di Siena"}, "56200188800": {"Name": "Tsvetkov S.", "AuthorID": "56200188800", "AffiliationID": "60008830, 60024147", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Electronics, Bulgarian Academy of Sciences"}, "6603413512": {"Name": "Gateva S.", "AuthorID": "6603413512", "AffiliationID": "60008830, 60024147", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Electronics, Bulgarian Academy of Sciences"}, "6701725607": {"Name": "Cartaleva S.", "AuthorID": "6701725607", "AffiliationID": "60008830, 60024147", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Electronics, Bulgarian Academy of Sciences"}}}
