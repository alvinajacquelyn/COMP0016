The magnitude and duration of these excursions permit intra-basinal and inter-basinal correlation, which indicates that they probably represent a global change in seawater composition. The occurrence of decoupled \u03b413Ccar-\u03b413Corg with almost invariable \u03b413Corg values at Wangjiapeng, Zhongling, Yangjiaping sections is consistent with remineralization of a dissolved organic carbon (DOC) pool by means of sulfate reduction, as recorded in EN3. The synchronous presence of EN3, a shift to higher 87Sr/86Sr and decrease of Mn and Fe contents and \u03b415N values together points to a glacial influence whereby oxygenation and remineralization of reduced carbon produced 13C-depleted DIC. Glaciations cause a drop in sea level, which itself leads to increased continental shelf area to be exposed to surface weathering, and ultimately to enhanced delivery of radiogenic 87Sr. The increase of 87Sr/86Sr ratios, sulfate and phosphate are consequences of surface runoff into oceanic environments and such perturbations induce biogeochemical changes.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Doushantuo Formation", "Ediacaran chemostratigraphy", "Ediacaran glaciation", "Open marine environment", "South China", "\u03b413C-\u03b418O-87Sr/86Sr-\u03b415N"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85056601067", "SubjectAreas": [["Geology", "EART", "1907"], ["Geochemistry and Petrology", "EART", "1906"]], "AuthorData": {"14825450600": {"Name": "Lan Z.", "AuthorID": "14825450600", "AffiliationID": "60025272", "AffiliationName": "Atmosphere and Ocean Research Institute, The University of Tokyo"}, "7402344505": {"Name": "Sano Y.", "AuthorID": "7402344505", "AffiliationID": "60025272", "AffiliationName": "Atmosphere and Ocean Research Institute, The University of Tokyo"}, "56016011000": {"Name": "Yahagi T.", "AuthorID": "56016011000", "AffiliationID": "60025272", "AffiliationName": "Atmosphere and Ocean Research Institute, The University of Tokyo"}, "55741545000": {"Name": "Tanaka K.", "AuthorID": "55741545000", "AffiliationID": "60025272", "AffiliationName": "Atmosphere and Ocean Research Institute, The University of Tokyo"}, "10440176900": {"Name": "Shirai K.", "AuthorID": "10440176900", "AffiliationID": "60025272", "AffiliationName": "Atmosphere and Ocean Research Institute, The University of Tokyo"}, "9638888200": {"Name": "Papineau D.", "AuthorID": "9638888200", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60162133", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, and Center for Planetary Sciences, University College London"}, "23098213100": {"Name": "Sawaki Y.", "AuthorID": "23098213100", "AffiliationID": "60025272", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Science and Astronomy, The University of Tokyo"}, "57201752809": {"Name": "Ohno T.", "AuthorID": "57201752809", "AffiliationID": "60009089", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Science, Gakushuin University"}, "37058459500": {"Name": "Abe M.", "AuthorID": "37058459500", "AffiliationID": "60004283", "AffiliationName": "Department of Subsurface Geobiological Analysis and Research (D-SUGAR), Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology (JAMSTEC)"}, "57193664769": {"Name": "Yang H.", "AuthorID": "57193664769", "AffiliationID": "105272203", "AffiliationName": "Central South Institute of Metallurgical Geology"}, "57193676349": {"Name": "Liu H.", "AuthorID": "57193676349", "AffiliationID": "105272203", "AffiliationName": "Central South Institute of Metallurgical Geology"}, "57193668196": {"Name": "Jiang T.", "AuthorID": "57193668196", "AffiliationID": "105272203", "AffiliationName": "Central South Institute of Metallurgical Geology"}, "57193670011": {"Name": "Wang T.", "AuthorID": "57193670011", "AffiliationID": "105272203", "AffiliationName": "Central South Institute of Metallurgical Geology"}}}
