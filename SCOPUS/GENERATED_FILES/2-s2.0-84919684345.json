The purpose of this paper is to find a counterpart to this phenomenon for typical convex bodies of given constant width. Such bodies cannot have zero curvatures. A main result says that for a typical n-dimensional convex body of constant width 1 (without loss of generality), at almost all boundary points, in the sense of measure, all curvatures are equal to 1. (In contrast, note that a ball of width 1 has radius 1/2, hence all its curvatures are equal to 2.) Since the property of constant width is linear with respect to Minkowski addition, the proof requires recourse to a linear curvature notion, which is provided by the tangential radii of curvature.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Baire category", "Convex bodies of constant width", "Curvature", "Primary", "Secondary"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84919684345", "SubjectAreas": [["Mathematics (all)", "MATH", "2600"]], "AuthorData": {"7005223038": {"Name": "B\u00e1r\u00e1ny I.", "AuthorID": "7005223038", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University College London"}, "57203295996": {"Name": "Schneider R.", "AuthorID": "57203295996", "AffiliationID": "60025641", "AffiliationName": "Mathematisches Institut, Albert-Ludwigs-Universit\u00e4t"}}}
