However, it is unclear what factors explain the social differences. Objectives To identify early-life risk factors for eczema, and to explore how early-life risk factors explain any differences in eczema. Methods We estimated odds ratios (ORs) for ever having had eczema by age 5 years in 14 499 children from the U.K. Millennium Cohort Study (MCS), with a focus on maternal, antenatal and early-life risk factors and socioeconomic circumstances (SECs). Risk factors were explored to assess whether they attenuated associations between SECs and eczema. Results Overall 35\u00b71% of children had ever had eczema by age 5 years. Children of mothers with degree-level qualifications vs. no educational qualifications were more likely to have eczema (OR 1\u00b752, 95% confidence interval 1\u00b731-1\u00b776), and there was a gradient across the socioeconomic spectrum. Maternal atopy, breastfeeding (1-6 weeks and \u2265 6 months), introduction of solids under 4 months or cow's milk under 9 months, antibiotic exposure in the first year of life and grime exposure were associated with an increased odds of having eczema. Female sex, Pakistani and Bangladeshi ethnicity, smoking during pregnancy, exposure to environmental tobacco smoke and having more siblings were associated with reduced odds for eczema. Controlling for maternal, antenatal and early-life characteristics (particularly maternal smoking during pregnancy, breastfeeding and number of siblings) reduced the OR for eczema to 1\u00b726 (95% confidence interval 1\u00b703-1\u00b750) in the group with the highest educational qualifications compared with the least. Conclusions In a representative U.K. child cohort, eczema was more common in more advantaged children. This was explained partially by early-life factors including not smoking during pregnancy, breastfeeding and having fewer siblings.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Age of Onset", "Child, Preschool", "Eczema", "Educational Status", "Environmental Exposure", "Female", "Humans", "Infant", "Male", "Maternal Age", "Mothers", "Prevalence", "Risk Factors", "United Kingdom", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84959418809", "SubjectAreas": [["Dermatology", "MEDI", "2708"]], "AuthorData": {"23475904400": {"Name": "Taylor-Robinson D.", "AuthorID": "23475904400", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "23397901800": {"Name": "Pearce A.", "AuthorID": "23397901800", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "57203073817": {"Name": "Law C.", "AuthorID": "57203073817", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "7005279868": {"Name": "Hope S.", "AuthorID": "7005279868", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "23500447000": {"Name": "Williams H.", "AuthorID": "23500447000", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "Centre of Evidence Based Dermatology, University of Nottingham"}}}
