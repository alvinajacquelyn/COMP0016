While our models successfully reproduce the gross experimental selectivities for two xanthines, our atomistic models reveal in detail the considerable heterogeneity of the structure and binding mechanisms of different imprints within such a material. We also demonstrate how nonimprinted regions of a MIP are also responsible for much of binding of target molecules. High levels of cross-linking are shown to produce less specific imprints.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Atomistic models", "Binding mechanisms", "Construct models", "Molecularly Imprinted Polymer", "Target molecule"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84921026793", "SubjectAreas": [["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"], ["Surfaces, Coatings and Films", "MATE", "2508"], ["Materials Chemistry", "MATE", "2505"]], "AuthorData": {"56483253400": {"Name": "Schauperl M.", "AuthorID": "56483253400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "7404749677": {"Name": "Lewis D.", "AuthorID": "7404749677", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}}}
