Methods We used logistic regression to analyze data from the 2014 Health Behaviour in School-aged Children study. Four aspects of recent care experience were studied: feeling at ease, feeling treated with respect, satisfaction with doctor's explanation, and feeling able to discuss personal matters. Five dichotomized measures of health status were used: ever self-harmed; fair or poor self-reported health; frequent (at least weekly) low mood; sleeping problems; or headaches. Results Of 5,335 students, 4,149 reported having visiting their GP within the past year. Of these, 91.8% felt treated with respect, 78.7% felt at ease, 85.7% were satisfied with explanation, and 53.9% felt able to discuss personal matters. After adjusting for ethnicity, age, gender, and family affluence score, poor experience on any indicator was strongly associated with increased risk of self-harm (adjusted odds ratio range, 2.01\u20132.70; all p <.001); feeling low (AOR range, 1.53\u20132.11; all p < .001); and sleeping problems (AOR range, 1.49\u20131.91; all p \u2264.001). Poor experience on all indicators, except discussing personal matters, was associated with worse self-reported health. Conclusions Nearly half of this large, national study of adolescents did not feel able to discuss personal matters with their doctor. There was a consistent, strong association between reported lack of good GP experience and poor health measures.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Adolescent", "GP", "Health measures", "Patient experience", "Primary care", "Student"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adolescent Behavior", "Age Distribution", "Attitude to Health", "Child", "England", "Female", "Health Behavior", "Health Status", "Health Surveys", "Healthcare Disparities", "Humans", "Logistic Models", "Male", "Physician-Patient Relations", "Primary Health Care", "Sex Distribution", "State Medicine", "World Health Organization"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85007496827", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"56856787100": {"Name": "Yassaee A.A.", "AuthorID": "56856787100", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Population, Policy, and Practice Programme, UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "40461756100": {"Name": "Hargreaves D.S.", "AuthorID": "40461756100", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Population, Policy, and Practice Programme, UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "56373297000": {"Name": "Chester K.", "AuthorID": "56373297000", "AffiliationID": "60032760", "AffiliationName": "Adolescent, Child, and Family Health Research Unit, Centre for Research in Primary and Community Care, University of Hertfordshire"}, "57191278705": {"Name": "Lamb S.", "AuthorID": "57191278705", "AffiliationID": "112784491", "AffiliationName": "Herne Hill Group Practice and The Well Centre"}, "7801319977": {"Name": "Hagell A.", "AuthorID": "7801319977", "AffiliationID": "116390917", "AffiliationName": "Association for Young People's Health"}, "9733853000": {"Name": "Brooks F.M.", "AuthorID": "9733853000", "AffiliationID": "60023932", "AffiliationName": "University of Technology"}}}
