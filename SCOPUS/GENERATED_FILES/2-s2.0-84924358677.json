Commercial adhesives were used to bond the paint to various substrates and promote robustness.These surfaces maintained their water repellency after finger-wipe, knife-scratch, and even 40 abrasion cycles with sandpaper.The formulations developed can be used on clothes, paper, glass, and steel for a myriad of self-cleaning applications.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84924358677", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"57206597914": {"Name": "Lu Y.", "AuthorID": "57206597914", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "37081732100": {"Name": "Sathasivam S.", "AuthorID": "37081732100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "7003437916": {"Name": "Carmalt C.", "AuthorID": "7003437916", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "56217400400": {"Name": "Parkin I.", "AuthorID": "56217400400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "37077947000": {"Name": "Song J.", "AuthorID": "37077947000", "AffiliationID": "60004538, 60001604", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory for Precision and Non-traditional Machining Technology, Ministry of Education, Dalian University of Technology"}, "26028240500": {"Name": "Crick C.", "AuthorID": "26028240500", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Imperial College London, South Kensington Campus"}}}
