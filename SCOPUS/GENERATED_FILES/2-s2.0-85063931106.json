KGaA, WeinheimDespite the attention given to the development of novel responsive implants for regenerative medicine applications, the lack of integration with the surrounding tissues and the mismatch with the dynamic mechanobiological nature of native soft tissues remain in the current products. Hierarchical porous membranes based on a poly (urea\u2013urethane) (PUU) nanohybrid have been fabricated by thermally induced phase separation (TIPS) of the polymer solution at different temperatures. Thermoresponsive stiffness softening of the membranes through phase transition from the semicrystalline phase to rubber phase and reverse self-assembly of the quasi-random nanophase structure is characterized at body temperature near the melting point of the crystalline domains of soft segments. The effects of the porous structure and stiffness softening on proliferation and differentiation of human bone-marrow mesenchymal stem cells (hBM-MSCs) are investigated. The results of immunohistochemistry, histological, ELISA, and qPCR demonstrate that hBM-MSCs maintain their lineage commitment during stiffness relaxation; chondrogenic differentiation is favored on the soft and porous scaffold, while osteogenic differentiation is more prominent on the initial stiff one. Stiffness relaxation stimulates more osteogenic activity than chondrogenesis, the latter being more influenced by the synergetic coupling effect of softness and porosity.", "AuthorKeywords": ["chondrogenesis", "hBM-MSCs", "nanohybrid elastomers", "osteogenesis", "porosity", "stiffness softening"], "IndexKeywords": ["Chondrogenesis", "Chondrogenic differentiation", "hBM-MSCs", "Human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells", "Nano hybrids", "Osteogenesis", "Osteogenic differentiation", "Thermally induced phase separation", "Aggrecans", "Cell Differentiation", "Cell Proliferation", "Chondrogenesis", "Collagen Type II", "Core Binding Factor Alpha 1 Subunit", "Humans", "Hydrophobic and Hydrophilic Interactions", "Membranes, Artificial", "Mesenchymal Stem Cells", "Nanostructures", "Osteogenesis", "Polymers", "Polyurethanes", "Porosity", "Temperature", "Tensile Strength", "Wettability"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85063931106", "SubjectAreas": [["Biomaterials", "MATE", "2502"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"], ["Pharmaceutical Science", "PHAR", "3003"]], "AuthorData": {"57204005303": {"Name": "Wu L.", "AuthorID": "57204005303", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Biomaterials in Surgical Reconstruction and Regeneration, Division of Surgery & Interventional Science, University College London"}, "57193180976": {"Name": "Magaz A.", "AuthorID": "57193180976", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "Bio-Active Materials Group, School of Materials, The University of Manchester"}, "35733502300": {"Name": "Darbyshire A.", "AuthorID": "35733502300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Biomaterials in Surgical Reconstruction and Regeneration, Division of Surgery & Interventional Science, University College London"}, "57204294898": {"Name": "Loizidou M.", "AuthorID": "57204294898", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Biomaterials in Surgical Reconstruction and Regeneration, Division of Surgery & Interventional Science, University College London"}, "7004667094": {"Name": "Emberton M.", "AuthorID": "7004667094", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Biomaterials in Surgical Reconstruction and Regeneration, Division of Surgery & Interventional Science, University College London"}, "7401655806": {"Name": "Song W.", "AuthorID": "7401655806", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Biomaterials in Surgical Reconstruction and Regeneration, Division of Surgery & Interventional Science, University College London"}, "56958284000": {"Name": "Howkins A.", "AuthorID": "56958284000", "AffiliationID": "60020623", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Materials and Manufacturing, Brunel University London"}, "57202137602": {"Name": "Reynolds A.", "AuthorID": "57202137602", "AffiliationID": "60020623", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Materials and Manufacturing, Brunel University London"}, "7202299798": {"Name": "Boyd I.W.", "AuthorID": "7202299798", "AffiliationID": "60020623", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Materials and Manufacturing, Brunel University London"}, "57208152135": {"Name": "Song H.", "AuthorID": "57208152135", "AffiliationID": "60105683", "AffiliationName": "School of Innovation and Entrepreneurship, Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Southern University of Science and Technology"}, "57208153661": {"Name": "Song J.H.", "AuthorID": "57208153661", "AffiliationID": "60105683", "AffiliationName": "School of Innovation and Entrepreneurship, Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Southern University of Science and Technology"}, "7004957785": {"Name": "Birchall M.", "AuthorID": "7004957785", "AffiliationID": "60011326, 60029890, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Ear Institute, Royal National Throat, Nose and Ear Hospital, University College London"}}}
