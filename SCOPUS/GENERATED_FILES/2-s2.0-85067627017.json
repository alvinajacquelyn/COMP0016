Such concerns might make people more reluctant to participate in research that asks them to volunteer personal data, compromising many researchers\u2019 data collection. We tested several motivational messages that encouraged participation in a citizen science project. We measured people\u2019s willingness to disclose personal information. While participants were less likely to share sensitive data than neutral data, disclosure behaviour was not affected by attitudes to privacy. Importantly, we found that citizen scientists who were exposed to a motivational message that emphasised \u2018learning\u2019 were more likely to share sensitive information than those presented with other types of motivational cues. Our results suggest that priming individuals with motivational messages can increase their willingness to contribute personal data to a project, even if the request pertains to sensitive information.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Citizen science", "Dabblers", "Disclosure", "Motivation", "Privacy"], "IndexKeywords": ["Citizen science", "Dabblers", "Data collection", "Disclosure", "Participatory research", "Personal information", "Sensitive datas", "Sensitive informations"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85067627017", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Human-Computer Interaction", "COMP", "1709"], ["Computer Graphics and Computer-Aided Design", "COMP", "1704"]], "AuthorData": {"57202282323": {"Name": "Rudnicka A.", "AuthorID": "57202282323", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Interaction Centre, University College London"}, "23391770800": {"Name": "Cox A.", "AuthorID": "23391770800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Interaction Centre, University College London"}, "55258058900": {"Name": "Gould S.", "AuthorID": "55258058900", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "School of Computer Science, University of Birmingham"}}}
