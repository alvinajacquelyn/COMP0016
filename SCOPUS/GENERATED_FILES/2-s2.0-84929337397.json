All rights reserved.Background: Amyloid-\u2032 (A\u20321-42), total tau (T-tau), and phosphorylated tau (P-tau181) in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) are the most promising biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Still, little is known about the dynamics of these molecules in the living brain. In a transgenic mouse brain, soluble A\u2032 decreases with increasing age and advanced A\u2032 pathology as seen similarly in CSF. Objective: To assess the relationship between AD-related pathological changes in human brain tissue, ventricular and lumbar CSF, and brain interstitial fluid (ISF). Methods: Altogether 11 patients with suspected idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus underwent frontal cortical brain biopsy, 24-h intraventricular pressure monitoring, and a microdialysis procedure. AD-related biomarkers were analyzed from brain tissue, CSF, and ISF Results: ISF T-tau levels decreased strongly within the first 12 h, then plateauing until the end of the experiment. A\u20321-42 and P-tau181 remained stable during the experiment (n = 3). T-tau and P-tau were higher in the ISF than in ventricular or lumbar CSF, while A\u20321-42 levels were within similar range in both CSF and ISF samples. ISF P-tau correlated with the ventricular CSF T-tau (r = 0.70, p = 0.017) and P-tau181 (r = 0.64, p = 0.034). Five patients with amyloid pathology in the brain biopsy tended to reveal lower ISF A\u20321-42 levels than those six without amyloid pathology. Conclusions: This is the first study to report ISF A\u2032 and tau levels in the human brain without significant brain injury. The set-up used enables sampling from the brain ISF for at least 24 h without causing adverse effects due to the microdialysis procedure to follow the dynamics of the key molecules in AD pathogenesis in the living brain at various stages of the disease.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alzheimer's disease", "amyloid-\u2032", "biomarkers", "normal pressure hydrocephalus", "tau"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Amyloid beta-Peptides", "Apolipoprotein E4", "Brain", "Chi-Square Distribution", "Cognition Disorders", "Extracellular Fluid", "Female", "Humans", "Hydrocephalus, Normal Pressure", "Male", "Microdialysis", "Middle Aged", "Peptide Fragments", "tau Proteins"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84929337397", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Clinical Psychology", "PSYC", "3203"], ["Geriatrics and Gerontology", "MEDI", "2717"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"6508170833": {"Name": "Herukka S.", "AuthorID": "6508170833", "AffiliationID": "60024252", "AffiliationName": "Neurology of NeuroCenter, Kuopio University Hospital"}, "57210906244": {"Name": "Koivisto A.", "AuthorID": "57210906244", "AffiliationID": "60024252", "AffiliationName": "Neurology of NeuroCenter, Kuopio University Hospital"}, "36572448100": {"Name": "Sepp\u00e4l\u00e4 T.", "AuthorID": "36572448100", "AffiliationID": "60103673", "AffiliationName": "Unit of Neurology, Institute of Clinical Medicine, University of Eastern Finland"}, "7004075892": {"Name": "Helisalmi S.", "AuthorID": "7004075892", "AffiliationID": "60103673", "AffiliationName": "Unit of Neurology, Institute of Clinical Medicine, University of Eastern Finland"}, "7004918583": {"Name": "Hiltunen M.", "AuthorID": "7004918583", "AffiliationID": "60103673", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Biomedicine, University of Eastern Finland"}, "24318493000": {"Name": "Soininen H.", "AuthorID": "24318493000", "AffiliationID": "60024252", "AffiliationName": "Neurology of NeuroCenter, Kuopio University Hospital"}, "6603005308": {"Name": "Von Und Zu Fraunberg M.", "AuthorID": "6603005308", "AffiliationID": "60103673", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurosurgery, Institute of Clinical Medicine, University of Eastern Finland"}, "55303737200": {"Name": "Nerg O.", "AuthorID": "55303737200", "AffiliationID": "60024252", "AffiliationName": "Neurology of NeuroCenter, Kuopio University Hospital"}, "36622391600": {"Name": "Pyykk\u00f6 O.", "AuthorID": "36622391600", "AffiliationID": "60103673", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurosurgery, Institute of Clinical Medicine, University of Eastern Finland"}, "25949949000": {"Name": "J\u00e4\u00e4skel\u00e4inen J.", "AuthorID": "25949949000", "AffiliationID": "60103673", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurosurgery, Institute of Clinical Medicine, University of Eastern Finland"}, "6602700515": {"Name": "Leinonen V.", "AuthorID": "6602700515", "AffiliationID": "60024252", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurosurgery, Kuopio University Hospital"}, "6602432090": {"Name": "Rummukainen J.", "AuthorID": "6602432090", "AffiliationID": "60024252", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, Kuopio University Hospital"}, "6701516211": {"Name": "Ihalainen J.", "AuthorID": "6701516211", "AffiliationID": "60103673", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurobiology, A.I.Virtanen Institute for Molecular Sciences, University of Eastern Finland"}, "23668693700": {"Name": "Puli L.", "AuthorID": "23668693700", "AffiliationID": "60103673", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurobiology, A.I.Virtanen Institute for Molecular Sciences, University of Eastern Finland"}, "7006593430": {"Name": "Tanila H.", "AuthorID": "7006593430", "AffiliationID": "60103673", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurobiology, A.I.Virtanen Institute for Molecular Sciences, University of Eastern Finland"}, "6701454676": {"Name": "Zetterberg H.", "AuthorID": "6701454676", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "7006967788": {"Name": "Alafuzoff I.", "AuthorID": "7006967788", "AffiliationID": "60015216", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology and Cytology, Uppsala University Hospital"}, "7102915731": {"Name": "Rinne J.", "AuthorID": "7102915731", "AffiliationID": "60025765, 60006876", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurosurgery, Turku University Hospital, University of Turku"}}}
