Stomach augmentation using a tissue-engineered stomach is a potential solution to restore adequate physiology and food reservoir. Aim of this study was to evaluate the decellularisation of whole rat stomach using a detergent-enzymatic protocol. Methods: Stomachs harvested from rats were decellularised through luminal and vascular cannulation using 24-h detergent-enzymatic treatment and completely characterized by appropriate staining, DNA and Extracellular matrix -component quantifications. Results: The detergent-enzymatic protocol allows a complete decellularisation of the gastric tissue, with a complete removal of the DNA with two cycles as confirmed by both quantifications and histological analysis. Extracellular matrix components, collagen, fibronectin, laminin and elastin, were optimally preserved by the treatment, while glycosaminoglycans were reduced. Conclusion: Gastric tissue can be efficiently decellularised. Scaffolds retained original structure and important components that could enhance integration with other tissues for in vivo transplant. The use of naturally derived material could be potentially considered for the treatment of both congenital and acquired conditions.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Decellularisation", "Extracellular matrix", "Gastrectomy", "Microgastria", "Scaffold", "Stomach", "Tissue engineering"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Detergents", "Extracellular Matrix", "Female", "Male", "Models, Animal", "Rats", "Rats, Sprague-Dawley", "Stomach", "Tissue Engineering", "Tissue Scaffolds"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85056728035", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"]], "AuthorData": {"56319375700": {"Name": "Zambaiti E.", "AuthorID": "56319375700", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine Section, DBC, UCL, Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, University College of London"}, "55312079100": {"Name": "Scottoni F.", "AuthorID": "55312079100", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine Section, DBC, UCL, Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, University College of London"}, "57204692370": {"Name": "Rizzi E.", "AuthorID": "57204692370", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine Section, DBC, UCL, Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, University College of London"}, "57204690147": {"Name": "Russo S.", "AuthorID": "57204690147", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine Section, DBC, UCL, Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, University College of London"}, "57204268480": {"Name": "Deguchi K.", "AuthorID": "57204268480", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine Section, DBC, UCL, Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, University College of London"}, "7102181886": {"Name": "Eaton S.", "AuthorID": "7102181886", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine Section, DBC, UCL, Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, University College of London"}, "56615988200": {"Name": "Pellegata A.F.", "AuthorID": "56615988200", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine Section, DBC, UCL, Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, University College of London"}, "57203257829": {"Name": "De Coppi P.", "AuthorID": "57203257829", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Specialist Neonatal and Paediatric Surgery, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
