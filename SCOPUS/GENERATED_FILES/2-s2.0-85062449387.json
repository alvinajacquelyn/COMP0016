Epigenetic modifications have been described and these may be key in initiating and driving fibroblast activation. Among these epigenetic modifications methylation may be of central importance. The aim of this study was to examine the role of methyl cap binding protein-2 (MeCP2) in SSc fibrosis. Methods We used healthy and SSc dermal fibroblasts to examine the role of MeCP2, using both small interfering RNA silencing and lentiviral overexpression to determine its effects. We also examined the expression of MeCP2 in SSc fibroblasts by immunoblotting. miRNA132 was quantified by Taqman real time PCR. Results We demonstrated that TGF-\u03b21 induced the expression of MeCP2 in normal cells, and showed that SSc fibroblasts expressed high levels of MeCP2 under basal conditions. MeCP2 positively regulated the expression of extracellular matrix through epigenetic repression of the Wnt antagonist sFRP-1, leading to enhanced Wnt signalling. This mediated fibrosis through glycolysis, as the glycolysis inhibitor 2-deoxyglucose diminished the Wnt-mediated collagen expression. MiR132 expression was reduced in SSc fibroblasts. Conclusion The results suggest that an epigenetic loop exists mediating fibrosis. Targeting of MeCP2, as a key epigenetic regulator, may be a promising therapeutic approach, as would targeting the metabolic reprogramming that occurs through aerobic glycolysis.", "AuthorKeywords": ["epigenetics", "fibrosis", "methylation", "systemic sclerosis", "Wnt"], "IndexKeywords": ["Epigenesis, Genetic", "Extracellular Matrix", "Fibroblasts", "HEK293 Cells", "Humans", "Methyl-CpG-Binding Protein 2", "RNA, Small Interfering", "Scleroderma, Systemic", "Signal Transduction", "Skin", "Transforming Growth Factor beta1"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85062449387", "SubjectAreas": [["Rheumatology", "MEDI", "2745"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"57195726504": {"Name": "Henderson J.", "AuthorID": "57195726504", "AffiliationID": "60004636", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Health and Life Sciences, Northumbria University"}, "57047063800": {"Name": "Brown M.", "AuthorID": "57047063800", "AffiliationID": "60004636", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Health and Life Sciences, Northumbria University"}, "56610696700": {"Name": "Horsburgh S.", "AuthorID": "56610696700", "AffiliationID": "60004636", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Health and Life Sciences, Northumbria University"}, "57191171882": {"Name": "Duffy L.", "AuthorID": "57191171882", "AffiliationID": "60004636", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Health and Life Sciences, Northumbria University"}, "25951653100": {"Name": "Wilkinson S.", "AuthorID": "25951653100", "AffiliationID": "60004636", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Health and Life Sciences, Northumbria University"}, "55092256200": {"Name": "O'Reilly S.", "AuthorID": "55092256200", "AffiliationID": "60004636", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Health and Life Sciences, Northumbria University"}, "56581606400": {"Name": "Worrell J.", "AuthorID": "56581606400", "AffiliationID": "60026712, 60006222", "AffiliationName": "Fibrosis Research Group, Institute of Cellular Medicine, Newcastle University"}, "7006263741": {"Name": "Stratton R.", "AuthorID": "7006263741", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60032819", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Rheumatology and Connective Tissue Diseases, Royal Free Hospital, Division of Medicine, University College London"}}}
