However, most applications of this technique, to date, have been bespoke: analysing particular documents of historic importance. There has been little prior work done on evaluating this technique in a structured fashion, to provide recommendations on how best to capture and process images when working with damaged and abraded textual material. This article introduces a new approach for evaluating the efficacy of image processing algorithms in recovering information from multispectral images of deteriorated primary historical texts. We present a series of experiments that deliberately degrade samples cut from a real historical document to provide a set of images acquired before and after damage. These images then allow us to compare, both objectively and quantitatively, the effectiveness of multispectral imaging and image processing for recovering information from damaged text. We develop a methodological framework for the continuing study of the techniques involved in the analysis and processing of multispectral images of primary historical texts, and a dataset which will be of use to others interested in advanced digitisation techniques within the cultural heritage sector.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85028711417", "SubjectAreas": [["Information Systems", "COMP", "1710"], ["Language and Linguistics", "ARTS", "1203"], ["Linguistics and Language", "SOCI", "3310"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"]], "AuthorData": {"55509172700": {"Name": "Giacometti A.", "AuthorID": "55509172700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, UCL Centre for Digital Humanities, University College London"}, "56234114300": {"Name": "Campagnolo A.", "AuthorID": "56234114300", "AffiliationID": "60021764", "AffiliationName": "Ligatus Research Centre, CCW Graduate School, University of the Arts London"}, "7103387453": {"Name": "MacDonald L.", "AuthorID": "7103387453", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Photogrammetry, 3D Imaging and Metrology Research Centre, University College London"}, "56166904700": {"Name": "Mahony S.", "AuthorID": "56166904700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Centre for Digital Humanities, Department of Information Studies, University College London"}, "7102138821": {"Name": "Robson S.", "AuthorID": "7102138821", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Photogrammetry, 3D Imaging and Metrology Research Centre, University College London"}, "18435535300": {"Name": "Weyrich T.", "AuthorID": "18435535300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, UCL Centre for Digital Humanities, University College London"}, "23568761100": {"Name": "Terras M.", "AuthorID": "23568761100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Information Studies, UCL Centre for Digital Humanities, University College London"}, "7202353675": {"Name": "Gibson A.", "AuthorID": "7202353675", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}}}
