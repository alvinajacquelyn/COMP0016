The internal nasal valve (INV) is the rate limiting step to nasal airflow. A static INV grading score was devised with regard to visibility of the middle turbinate. Methods: A prospective study of all patients who underwent primary external functional septorhinoplasty in 2017 for nasal obstruction. All patients\u2019 INV score was assessed pre- and postoperatively in a blinded and independent fashion by surgeons of varying seniority. Results: Twenty-eight patients were studied, with mean age 30.9 years and follow-up 18.8 weeks. Inter-rater and test\u2013retest reliability of INV grading were excellent, with Cronbach\u2019s alpha 0.936 and 0.920, respectively. There was also statistically significant improvement in both subjective and objective postoperative outcome measures including nasal inspiratory peak flows. Conclusions: We demonstrate a novel, easy to interpret, clinically valuable grading system of the static internal nasal valve that is reliable and reproducible.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Nasal inspiratory peak flow", "Nasal obstruction", "Septoplasty", "Septorhinoplasty", "Valve"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Endoscopy", "Female", "Humans", "Inhalation", "Male", "Nasal Cavity", "Nasal Obstruction", "Nasal Septum", "Prospective Studies", "Reproducibility of Results", "Rhinoplasty", "Turbinates"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85054762221", "SubjectAreas": [["Otorhinolaryngology", "MEDI", "2733"]], "AuthorData": {"57189596244": {"Name": "Patel B.", "AuthorID": "57189596244", "AffiliationID": "60029890", "AffiliationName": "Rhinology Department, Royal National, Throat, Nose and Ear Hospital"}, "54966494700": {"Name": "Virk J.", "AuthorID": "54966494700", "AffiliationID": "60029890", "AffiliationName": "Rhinology Department, Royal National, Throat, Nose and Ear Hospital"}, "35373930800": {"Name": "Randhawa P.", "AuthorID": "35373930800", "AffiliationID": "60029890", "AffiliationName": "Rhinology Department, Royal National, Throat, Nose and Ear Hospital"}, "14521750300": {"Name": "Andrews P.", "AuthorID": "14521750300", "AffiliationID": "60029890", "AffiliationName": "Rhinology Department, Royal National, Throat, Nose and Ear Hospital"}}}
