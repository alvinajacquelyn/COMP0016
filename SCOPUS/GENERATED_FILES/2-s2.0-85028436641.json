The fluid is assumed to be incompressible and inviscid and the flow to be two-dimensional, irrotational and supercritical. The disturbance is chosen to be a point vortex. Highly accurate numerical solutions are computed. The basic idea of the numerical approach is first to develop codes to compute solitary waves and then to introduce appropriate modifications to model the point vortex. Previous results are recovered and new solutions are presented.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Free surface flows", "Point vortex", "Solitary waves"], "IndexKeywords": ["Free-surface flow", "Highly accurate", "New solutions", "Nonlinear free surface flows", "Numerical approaches", "Numerical solution", "Point vortices", "Supercritical"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85028436641", "SubjectAreas": [["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"57195487545": {"Name": "Doak A.", "AuthorID": "57195487545", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Department of Mathematics"}, "7005594518": {"Name": "Vanden-Broeck J.M.", "AuthorID": "7005594518", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Department of Mathematics"}}}
