Rheum.

Methods: We conducted a multicentre randomised trial in patients with BD requiring systemic therapy. Patients were randomised to 26 weeks of peginterferon-\u03b1-2b in addition to their standard care or to standard care only and followed 6-monthly for 3 years with BD activity scores and quality of life questionnaires. Patients at one centre had blood taken to measure regulatory T cells (Tregs) and Th17 cells. Results: 72 patients were included. At months 10-12, while among the entire patient population there was no difference in the corticosteroid dose or immunosuppression use between the treatment groups (adjusted OR 1.04, 95% CI 0.34 to 3.19), post hoc analysis revealed that in patients who were on corticosteroids at baseline the corticosteroid requirement was significantly lower in the peginterferon-\u03b1-2b (6.5 (5-15) mg/day) compared with the non-interferon group (10 (8.25-16.5) mg/day, p=0.039). Furthermore, there was a trend towards an improved quality of life that became significant by 36 months (p=0.008). This was associated with a significant rise in Tregs and a decrease in Th17 cells which was still present at 1 year and 6 months after the interferon was stopped. The safety profile was similar with adverse events in 10% in both groups. Conclusions: The addition of peginterferon-\u03b1-2b to the drug regime of BD patients did not significantly reduce their corticosteroid dose required at 1 year. However, in those on corticosteroids at baseline post hoc analysis demonstrated that the addition of peginterferon-\u03b1-2b did result in a significant reduction in corticosteroid dose with a significantly improved quality of life and trend to reduce other required immunosuppressive agents. This effect was seen at 1 year and associated with a rise in Tregs suggesting a possible mode for interferon action.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adrenal Cortex Hormones", "Adult", "Antiviral Agents", "Azathioprine", "Behcet Syndrome", "Cyclosporine", "Drug Therapy, Combination", "Female", "Humans", "Immunosuppressive Agents", "Interferon-alpha", "Lymphocyte Count", "Male", "Methotrexate", "Middle Aged", "Mycophenolic Acid", "Polyethylene Glycols", "Quality of Life", "Recombinant Proteins", "Single-Blind Method", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory", "Tacrolimus", "Th17 Cells", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84935004500", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Rheumatology", "MEDI", "2745"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"15035438500": {"Name": "Lightman S.", "AuthorID": "15035438500", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60016691", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "26021557300": {"Name": "Taylor S.R.J.", "AuthorID": "26021557300", "AffiliationID": "60111785", "AffiliationName": "Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"}, "7005268305": {"Name": "Bunce C.", "AuthorID": "7005268305", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57201661157": {"Name": "Tomkins-Netzer O.", "AuthorID": "57201661157", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60016691", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "56138601200": {"Name": "Yang D.", "AuthorID": "56138601200", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60016691", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "7003742122": {"Name": "Calder V.L.", "AuthorID": "7003742122", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60016691", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "7102594554": {"Name": "Haskard D.O.", "AuthorID": "7102594554", "AffiliationID": "60111785", "AffiliationName": "Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"}, "6602692513": {"Name": "Longhurst H.", "AuthorID": "6602692513", "AffiliationID": "60159931", "AffiliationName": "Barts Health NHS Trust"}, "7101691831": {"Name": "Lynn W.", "AuthorID": "7101691831", "AffiliationID": "60105470", "AffiliationName": "Ealing Hospital NHS Trust"}, "7006456102": {"Name": "Moots R.", "AuthorID": "7006456102", "AffiliationID": "60160274", "AffiliationName": "Aintree Hospitals NHS Trust"}, "7005918802": {"Name": "Stanford M.", "AuthorID": "7005918802", "AffiliationID": "60005518", "AffiliationName": "GSTT NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7006083023": {"Name": "Kvien T.K.", "AuthorID": "7006083023", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
