However, there is currently no evidence to support whether hearing aid owners can accurately self-report hearing aid handling skills via self-report survey that systematically evaluates the ability to accurately perform the individual aspects of hearing aid handling required for effective hearing aid management. Design: An explorative pilot study using a prospective research design. Study sample: Nineteen adult hearing aid owners, aged between 65 and 93 years. Results: The self-administered survey demonstrated high sensitivity when compared with clinician evaluation of skills, with 93% of participants accurately self-identifying and reporting whether hearing aid handling skill training was required. Conclusions: Hearing aid owners are able to accurately self-report hearing aid handling difficulties when provided with an itemised list of skills.", "AuthorKeywords": ["behavioural measures", "emotional", "hearing aid satisfaction", "Hearing aids", "psychosocial"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Auditory Perception", "Equipment Design", "Female", "Hearing", "Hearing Aids", "Hearing Disorders", "Humans", "Male", "Patient Education as Topic", "Patient Satisfaction", "Persons With Hearing Impairments", "Pilot Projects", "Predictive Value of Tests", "Prospective Studies", "Recognition (Psychology)", "Reproducibility of Results", "Self Care", "Self Report"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85023746387", "SubjectAreas": [["Language and Linguistics", "ARTS", "1203"], ["Linguistics and Language", "SOCI", "3310"], ["Speech and Hearing", "HEAL", "3616"]], "AuthorData": {"56810295100": {"Name": "Bennett R.", "AuthorID": "56810295100", "AffiliationID": "60031806", "AffiliationName": "Ear Sciences Centre, The University of Western Australia"}, "7006848551": {"Name": "Eikelboom R.", "AuthorID": "7006848551", "AffiliationID": "60021902", "AffiliationName": "Department of Speech Language Pathology and Audiology, University of Pretoria"}, "55791571100": {"Name": "Schmulian D.", "AuthorID": "55791571100", "AffiliationID": "60031806", "AffiliationName": "Ear Sciences Centre, The University of Western Australia"}, "26027432100": {"Name": "Meyer C.", "AuthorID": "26027432100", "AffiliationID": "60031004", "AffiliationName": "School of Health and Rehabilitation Sciences, University of Queensland"}, "55342136200": {"Name": "Olaithe M.", "AuthorID": "55342136200", "AffiliationID": "60031806", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, The University of Western Australia"}}}
