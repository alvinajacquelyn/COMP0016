These descriptors can then be used to estimate further partition coefficients into a wide variety of solvents. The descriptors also yield information about the properties of pentane-2,4-dione and its derivatives. Pentane-2,4-dione and its alkyl derivatives are quite polar, with substantial hydrogen bond basicity but with no hydrogen bond acidity. In contrast 1,1,1-trifluoropentane-2,4-dione and hexafluoropentan-2,4-dione have significant hydrogen bond acidities.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Absolv descriptors", "Acetylacetone", "Linear free energy relationships", "Partition coefficients", "Pentane-2,4-dione"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85027713758", "SubjectAreas": [["Biophysics", "BIOC", "1304"], ["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"]], "AuthorData": {"7202901240": {"Name": "Abraham M.", "AuthorID": "7202901240", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "35496753700": {"Name": "Acree W.", "AuthorID": "35496753700", "AffiliationID": "60024438", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of North Texas"}}}
