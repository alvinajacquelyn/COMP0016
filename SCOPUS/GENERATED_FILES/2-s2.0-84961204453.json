The financial impact of using CT colonography for surveillance was also estimated. Methods: We identified primary studies of CT colonography for surveillance of colorectal cancer patients. A summary ROC curve was constructed. Inter-study heterogeneity was explored using the I2 value. Financial impact was estimated for a theoretical cohort of patients, based on Cancer Research UK statistics. Results: Seven studies provided data on 880 patients. Five of seven studies (765 patients) were included for qualitative analysis. Sensitivity of CT colonography for detection of anastomotic recurrence was 95 % (95 % CI 62 \u2212 100), specificity 100 % (95 % CI 75 \u2212 100) and sensitivity for metachronous cancers was 100 %. No statistical heterogeneity was detected (I2 = 0 %). We estimated that CT colonography as a 'single test' alternative to colonoscopy and standard CT for surveillance would potentially save \u20ac20,785,232 (\u00a314,803,404) for an annual cohort of UK patients. Conclusion: CT colonography compares favourably to colonoscopy for detection of anastomotic recurrence and metachronous colorectal cancer, and appears financially beneficial. These findings should be considered alongside limitations of small patient numbers and high clinical heterogeneity between studies. Key Points: \u2022 CT colonography compares favourably to colonoscopy/standard CT for colorectal cancer surveillance. \u2022 CT colonography offers single-test luminal, serosal and extra-colonic assessment. \u2022 CT colonography is a potentially cost-saving alternative to standard surveillance protocols.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Colonoscopy", "Colorectal cancer", "CT colonography", "Imaging", "Surveillance"], "IndexKeywords": ["Colonography, Computed Tomographic", "Colonoscopy", "Colorectal Neoplasms", "Early Detection of Cancer", "Humans", "ROC Curve"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84961204453", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"35485066400": {"Name": "Port\u00e9 F.", "AuthorID": "35485066400", "AffiliationID": "60022734", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, St Mark\u2019s Hospital"}, "6602817616": {"Name": "Burling D.", "AuthorID": "6602817616", "AffiliationID": "60022734", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, St Mark\u2019s Hospital"}, "56538685700": {"Name": "Uppara M.", "AuthorID": "56538685700", "AffiliationID": "60022734", "AffiliationName": "Surgical Epidemiology, Trials and Outcome Centre (SETOC) St Mark\u2019s Hospital"}, "43761284000": {"Name": "Malietzis G.", "AuthorID": "43761284000", "AffiliationID": "60022734", "AffiliationName": "Surgical Epidemiology, Trials and Outcome Centre (SETOC) St Mark\u2019s Hospital"}, "23134285100": {"Name": "Faiz O.", "AuthorID": "23134285100", "AffiliationID": "60022734", "AffiliationName": "Surgical Epidemiology, Trials and Outcome Centre (SETOC) St Mark\u2019s Hospital"}, "55642708000": {"Name": "Halligan S.", "AuthorID": "55642708000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, University College London"}, "7003616769": {"Name": "Athanasiou T.", "AuthorID": "7003616769", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery and Cancer, Imperial College London"}}}
