This DMS is based on a set of 17 628 multi-reference configuration interaction data points that were calculated with the aug-cc-pCV6Z basis set with the Douglas-Kroll-Hess Hamiltonian; tests are performed at several other levels of ab initio theory. This new \"CKAPTEN\" DMS improves agreement with recent experimental measurements compared with previous models that poorly predicted some bands in the infrared while also maintaining or improving on the agreement for all remaining strong lines. For high overtones located in both the visible and the near ultraviolet regions, our predicted intensities all lie within 10% of recent atmospheric observations. A crossing of energy levels in the \u03bd1 fundamental and 2\u03bd2 states is seen to offset transition intensities in the \u03bd1 fundamental band; residual inaccuracies within the potential energy surface used is the cause of this problem.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Atmospheric observations", "Dipole moment surfaces", "Douglas-kroll-hess hamiltonians", "Fundamental bands", "Ground electronic state", "Multi reference configuration interactions", "Near-ultraviolet regions", "Transition intensity"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85052738110", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"]], "AuthorData": {"57203638185": {"Name": "Conway E.K.", "AuthorID": "57203638185", "AffiliationID": "60020680", "AffiliationName": "Atomic and Molecular Physics Division, Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics"}, "7006554518": {"Name": "Polyansky O.L.", "AuthorID": "7006554518", "AffiliationID": "60011774", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Applied Physics, Russian Academy of Sciences"}, "7101645601": {"Name": "Tennyson J.", "AuthorID": "7101645601", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "55901670600": {"Name": "Kyuberis A.A.", "AuthorID": "55901670600", "AffiliationID": "60011774", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Applied Physics, Russian Academy of Sciences"}, "35583085500": {"Name": "Zobov N.F.", "AuthorID": "35583085500", "AffiliationID": "60011774", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Applied Physics, Russian Academy of Sciences"}}}
