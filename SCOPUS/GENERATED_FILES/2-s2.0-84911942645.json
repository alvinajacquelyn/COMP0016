All rights reserved.Posterior cortical atrophy (PCA) is a neurodegenerative syndrome characterized by progressive visual dysfunction and parietal, occipital, and occipitotemporal atrophy. The aim of this study was to compare the impact of PCA and typical Alzheimer's disease (tAD) on everyday functional abilities and neuropsychiatric status. The Cambridge Behavioural Inventory-Revised was given to carers of 32 PCA and 71 tAD patients. PCA patients showed significantly greater impairment in everyday skills and self-care while the tAD group showed greater impairment in aspects of memory and orientation, and motivation. We suggest that PCA poses specific challenges for those caring for people affected by the condition.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Caregivers", "early onset Alzheimer's disease", "psychology", "questionnaires", "self-care", "self-report"], "IndexKeywords": ["Activities of Daily Living", "Aged", "Alzheimer Disease", "Atrophy", "Cerebral Cortex", "Female", "Humans", "Learning Disorders", "Male", "Mental Status Schedule", "Middle Aged", "Neurodegenerative Diseases", "Self Care", "Sleep Disorders"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84911942645", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Clinical Psychology", "PSYC", "3203"], ["Geriatrics and Gerontology", "MEDI", "2717"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"55036185800": {"Name": "Shakespeare T.J.", "AuthorID": "55036185800", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dementia Research Centre, Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "55650633000": {"Name": "Yong K.X.X.", "AuthorID": "55650633000", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dementia Research Centre, Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "6602191607": {"Name": "Crutch S.J.", "AuthorID": "6602191607", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dementia Research Centre, Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "54951573300": {"Name": "Foxe D.", "AuthorID": "54951573300", "AffiliationID": "60187518", "AffiliationName": "ARC, Centre of Excellence in Cognition and Its Disorders"}, "7202899431": {"Name": "Hodges J.", "AuthorID": "7202899431", "AffiliationID": "60187518", "AffiliationName": "ARC, Centre of Excellence in Cognition and Its Disorders"}}}
