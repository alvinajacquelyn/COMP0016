Texture-modified foods and thickened drinks are commonly used to reduce the risks of choking and aspiration. The International Dysphagia Diet Standardisation Initiative (IDDSI) was founded with the goal of developing globally standardized terminology and definitions for texture-modified foods and liquids applicable to individuals with dysphagia of all ages, in all care settings, and all cultures. A multi-professional volunteer committee developed a dysphagia diet framework through systematic review and stakeholder consultation. First, a survey of existing national terminologies and current practice was conducted, receiving 2050 responses from 33 countries. Respondents included individuals with dysphagia; their caregivers; organizations supporting individuals with dysphagia; healthcare professionals; food service providers; researchers; and industry. The results revealed common use of 3\u20134 levels of food texture (54 different names) and \u22653 levels of liquid thickness (27 different names). Substantial support was expressed for international standardization. Next, a systematic review regarding the impact of food texture and liquid consistency on swallowing was completed. A meeting was then convened to review data from previous phases, and develop a draft framework. A further international stakeholder survey sought feedback to guide framework refinement; 3190 responses were received from 57 countries. The IDDSI Framework (released in November, 2015) involves a continuum of 8 levels (0\u20137) identified by numbers, text labels, color codes, definitions, and measurement methods. The IDDSI Framework is recommended for implementation throughout the world.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Deglutition", "Deglutition disorders", "Dysphagia diet", "Food and fluid standards", "Swallowing", "Texture-modified food", "Thickened fluid"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adhesiveness", "Beverages", "Consensus", "Consensus Development Conferences as Topic", "Deglutition Disorders", "Food", "Hardness", "Humans", "Particle Size", "Review Literature as Topic", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "Terminology as Topic", "Viscosity"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85001104563", "SubjectAreas": [["Otorhinolaryngology", "MEDI", "2733"], ["Gastroenterology", "MEDI", "2715"], ["Speech and Hearing", "HEAL", "3616"]], "AuthorData": {"6603017513": {"Name": "Cichero J.A.Y.", "AuthorID": "6603017513", "AffiliationID": "60031004", "AffiliationName": "School of Pharmacy, Pharmacy Australia Centre of Excellence (PACE), The University of Queensland"}, "56402559100": {"Name": "Lam P.", "AuthorID": "56402559100", "AffiliationID": "114726452", "AffiliationName": "Peter Lam Consulting"}, "7101798810": {"Name": "Steele C.M.", "AuthorID": "7101798810", "AffiliationID": "60016849", "AffiliationName": "Rehabilitation Sciences Institute, Faculty of Medicine, University of Toronto"}, "7102037062": {"Name": "Hanson B.", "AuthorID": "7102037062", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "12239962300": {"Name": "Chen J.", "AuthorID": "12239962300", "AffiliationID": "60012581", "AffiliationName": "Zhejiang Gongshang University"}, "7007153272": {"Name": "Dantas R.O.", "AuthorID": "7007153272", "AffiliationID": "60008088", "AffiliationName": "Medical School of Ribeir\u00e3o Preto, University of S\u00e3o Paulo"}, "55256140200": {"Name": "Duivestein J.", "AuthorID": "55256140200", "AffiliationID": "60010365", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Medicine, University of British Columbia"}, "6603450438": {"Name": "Kayashita J.", "AuthorID": "6603450438", "AffiliationID": "60032427", "AffiliationName": "Department of Health Sciences, Prefectural University of Hiroshima"}, "16834888400": {"Name": "Lecko C.", "AuthorID": "16834888400", "AffiliationID": "60007904", "AffiliationName": "National Health Service Improvement"}, "55466981700": {"Name": "Murray J.", "AuthorID": "55466981700", "AffiliationID": "60014232", "AffiliationName": "Ann Arbor Veterans Affairs"}, "23975045000": {"Name": "Pillay M.", "AuthorID": "23975045000", "AffiliationID": "60022046", "AffiliationName": "Manchester Metropolitan University"}, "15823208700": {"Name": "Riquelme L.", "AuthorID": "15823208700", "AffiliationID": "60025356", "AffiliationName": "Barrique Speech-Language Pathology at Center for Swallowing & Speech-Language Pathology, New York Methodist Hospital"}, "55399401700": {"Name": "Stanschus S.", "AuthorID": "55399401700", "AffiliationID": "60009135", "AffiliationName": "Swallowing and Speech Pathology, Hospital zum Heiligen Geist"}}}
