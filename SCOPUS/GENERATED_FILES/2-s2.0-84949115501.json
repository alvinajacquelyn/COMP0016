All rights reserved.A full-field Digital Image Correlation (DIC) method with integrated Kriging regression is presented in this article. The displacement field is formulated as a best linear unbiased model that includes the correlations between all the locations in the Region of Interest (RoI). A global error factor is employed to extend conventional Kriging interpolation to quantify displacement errors of the control points. An updating strategy for the self-adaptive control grid is developed on the basis of the Mean Squared Error (MSE) determined from the Kriging model. Kriging DIC is shown to outperform several other full-field DIC methods when using open-access experimental data. Numerical examples are used to demonstrate the robustness of Kriging DIC to different choices of initial control points and to speckle pattern variability. Finally Kriging DIC is tested on an experimental example.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Digital image correlation", "Full-field", "Kriging regression"], "IndexKeywords": ["D. digital image correlation (DIC)", "Digital image correlations", "Displacement errors", "Full-field", "Kriging", "Kriging interpolation", "Self adaptive control", "The region of interest (ROI)"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84949115501", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"55508074500": {"Name": "Wang D.", "AuthorID": "55508074500", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Engineering Dynamics, School of Engineering, University of Liverpool"}, "36238014100": {"Name": "Diazdelao F.", "AuthorID": "36238014100", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Risk and Uncertainty, University of Liverpool"}, "7006580784": {"Name": "Mottershead J.", "AuthorID": "7006580784", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Risk and Uncertainty, University of Liverpool"}, "12759981800": {"Name": "Wang W.", "AuthorID": "12759981800", "AffiliationID": "60022046", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering, Manchester Metropolitan University"}}}
