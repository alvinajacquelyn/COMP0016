Many conventional sterilisation methods are not suitable for the next generation of biomaterials, mainly due to their complex composition, based on nanomaterials, often incorporating bioactive moieties. In this study, we investigate sterilisation efficacy of slow chlorine releasing compound sodium dichloroisocyanurate dihydrate (SDIC) for polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS)-poly(caprolactone urea-urethane) (PCL) scaffolds in comparison with conventional sterilisation methods. Methods POSS-PCL scaffolds were subjected to 70% ethanol, UV, and SDIC sterilisation methods. Samples were immersed in tryptone soya broth (TSB) and thioglycollate medium (THY) and after seven days visually inspected for signs of microbial growth. Bulk and surface properties and molecular weight distribution profiles of the scaffolds after sterilization were investigated using FTIR analysis, surface hydrophilicity, scanning electron microscopy analysis, tensile strength testing, and gel-permeation chromatography (GPC). Adipose-derived stem cells (ADSC) were seeded on the scaffolds and AlamarBlue\u00ae viability assay was performed to investigate cell metabolic activity. Confocal imaging of rhodamine phalloidin and Dapi stained ADSC on scaffolds was used to demonstrate cell morphology. Results GPC results showed that autoclaving led to a significant decrease in the molecular weight of POSS-PCL, whereas ethanol caused visible deformation of the polymer 3D structure and UV radiation did not effectively sterilise the scaffolds. AlamarBlue\u00ae analysis showed metabolic activity close to that of tissue culture plastic for ethanol and SDIC. Conclusion SDIC sterilisation can be safely applied to biodegradable scaffolds unsuitable for the more common sterilisation methods.", "AuthorKeywords": ["ADSC", "bleach", "GPC", "nanocomposite", "polymer", "SEM", "Sterilisation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adipose derived stem cells", "ADSC", "Biodegra-dable materials", "Bulk and surface properties", "Gel permeation chromatography (GPC)", "Polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxanes", "SODIUM DICHLOROISOCYANURATE", "Tissue culture plastics", "Absorbable Implants", "Adipocytes", "Adipose Tissue", "Biocompatible Materials", "Cell Culture Techniques", "Chlorine", "Chromatography", "Humans", "Microscopy, Electron, Scanning", "Microscopy, Fluorescence", "Nanocomposites", "Polyesters", "Polymers", "Porosity", "Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared", "Stem Cells", "Sterilization", "Tensile Strength", "Time Factors", "Tissue Scaffolds", "Triazines", "Ultraviolet Rays", "Water"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84958064076", "SubjectAreas": [["Biomaterials", "MATE", "2502"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"]], "AuthorData": {"56569922200": {"Name": "Naderi N.", "AuthorID": "56569922200", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60170516", "AffiliationName": "UCL Centre for Nanotechnology and Regenerative Medicine, University College London, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7003544885": {"Name": "Whitaker I.S.", "AuthorID": "7003544885", "AffiliationID": "60138360", "AffiliationName": "Welsh Centre for Burns and Plastic Surgery, ABMU Health Board"}, "36833858100": {"Name": "Griffin M.", "AuthorID": "36833858100", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60170516", "AffiliationName": "UCL Centre for Nanotechnology and Regenerative Medicine, University College London, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7005344804": {"Name": "Seifalian A.M.", "AuthorID": "7005344804", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60170516", "AffiliationName": "UCL Centre for Nanotechnology and Regenerative Medicine, University College London, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "55356394200": {"Name": "Malins E.", "AuthorID": "55356394200", "AffiliationID": "60022109", "AffiliationName": "Polymer Chemistry Laboratory, School of Engineering and Materials Science, Queen Mary, University of London"}, "15847721500": {"Name": "Becer R.", "AuthorID": "15847721500", "AffiliationID": "60022109", "AffiliationName": "Polymer Chemistry Laboratory, School of Engineering and Materials Science, Queen Mary, University of London"}, "55985666400": {"Name": "Mosahebi A.", "AuthorID": "55985666400", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Department of Plastic Surgery, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
