The obtained measurements were compared with the recommendations of the World Health Organization and the Society of Light and Lighting.Results: Recordings were within recommended levels for light and humidity overnight. Average noise levels were above the recommended levels. There were abrupt increases of light and noise levels which were high enough to cause sleep fragmentation. Mean temperature levels were higher than recommended.Conclusions: Our results indicated that the patients are at risk of disturbed sleep for the duration of their stay in rehabilitation unit. Exposure to generally high noise levels, as well as the sudden increases of noise and light intensities can prevent reaching restful night-time sleep and may negatively impact on rehabilitation process due to impaired memory, learning and well-being.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Environment", "Humidity", "Light", "Noise", "Rehabilitation", "Rehabilitation unit", "Temperature"], "IndexKeywords": ["Consciousness Disorders", "Consciousness Disorders", "Health Facility Environment", "Health Facility Environment", "Humans", "Humans", "Humidity", "Humidity", "Light", "Light", "London", "London", "Noise", "Noise", "Patients' Rooms", "Patients' Rooms", "Rehabilitation Centers", "Rehabilitation Centers", "Sleep", "Sleep", "Temperature", "Temperature"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84918818084", "SubjectAreas": [["Rehabilitation", "MEDI", "2742"]], "AuthorData": {"56451051800": {"Name": "Yelden K.", "AuthorID": "56451051800", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "17034040600": {"Name": "Duport S.", "AuthorID": "17034040600", "AffiliationID": "60029105", "AffiliationName": "Research Department, Royal Hospital for Neuro-Disability"}, "57055694800": {"Name": "Kempny A.", "AuthorID": "57055694800", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "7005863635": {"Name": "Playford E.", "AuthorID": "7005863635", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neurology, University College London"}}}
