IL-1\u03b2 is an inflammatory cytokine that has deleterious effects in myocardial remodeling and function. IL-1\u03b2 inhibition has beneficial effects after acute myocardial infarction. However, the role of IL-1\u03b2 in ADHF and its relationship to ST2 remain unclear. Objectives: This study sought to investigate the relationship between IL-1\u03b2 and sST2, and the prognostic impact of such a relationship in patients with ADHF. Methods: This study examined 316 consecutive patients who were hospitalized with ADHF (72 \u00b1 12 years of age, 57% male, and left ventricular ejection fraction 45 \u00b1 17%). Blood samples were collected at presentation, and IL-1\u03b2 and sST2 levels were measured. All-cause mortality was obtained for all patients at 1 year. Results: The IL-1\u03b2 concentration at presentation was associated with prior HF hospitalizations, functional impairment, and higher N-terminal pro\u2013B-type natriuretic peptide and high-sensitivity troponin T concentrations. IL-1\u03b2 was higher in patients who died during the year after hospitalization (n = 52, 16.5%) (p = 0.005), and the optimal threshold was identified with levels over 49.1 pg/ml (hazard ratio: 2.5; 95% confidence interval: 1.43 to 4.49; p = 0.0014). Circulating IL-1\u03b2 positively correlated with sST2 (\u03c1 = 0.65; p < 0.001). Considering the prognostic thresholds of IL-1\u03b2 (\u226549.1 pg/ml) and sST2 (\u226535.0 ng/ml) concentrations: all patients with low sST2 also presented with low IL-1\u03b2; among patients with high sST2, only those with also high IL-1\u03b2 had a significantly higher risk of death (30% vs. 14%; hazard ratio: 2.52; 95% confidence interval: 1.40 to 4.56; p = 0.002). Conclusions: Circulating IL-1\u03b2 concentrations are clinically meaningful in ADHF patients and interplay with the predictive ability of sST2. IL-1 axis-related inflammation signaling may represent a therapeutic target in ADHF.", "AuthorKeywords": ["acute", "heart failure", "IL-1\u03b2", "interleukin-1", "ST2"], "IndexKeywords": ["Acute Disease", "Aged", "Biomarkers", "Cause of Death", "Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay", "Female", "Heart Failure", "Humans", "Interleukin-1", "Male", "Prognosis", "Prospective Studies", "Registries", "Risk Assessment", "Risk Factors", "ROC Curve", "Spain", "Stroke Volume", "Survival Rate", "Ventricular Function, Left"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85062003195", "SubjectAreas": [["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"6603059758": {"Name": "Pascual-Figal D.", "AuthorID": "6603059758", "AffiliationID": "118586704", "AffiliationName": "CIBERCV"}, "54382867100": {"Name": "Asensio-Lopez M.", "AuthorID": "54382867100", "AffiliationID": "60000130, 60029675", "AffiliationName": "Cardiology Department, Hospital Virgen de la Arrixaca, IMIB-Arrixaca, University of Murcia"}, "57202461900": {"Name": "Hern\u00e1ndez-Vicente A.", "AuthorID": "57202461900", "AffiliationID": "60000130, 60029675", "AffiliationName": "Cardiology Department, Hospital Virgen de la Arrixaca, IMIB-Arrixaca, University of Murcia"}, "8967468300": {"Name": "Garrido-Bravo I.", "AuthorID": "8967468300", "AffiliationID": "60000130, 60029675", "AffiliationName": "Cardiology Department, Hospital Virgen de la Arrixaca, IMIB-Arrixaca, University of Murcia"}, "57202560985": {"Name": "Pastor-Perez F.", "AuthorID": "57202560985", "AffiliationID": "60000130, 60029675", "AffiliationName": "Cardiology Department, Hospital Virgen de la Arrixaca, IMIB-Arrixaca, University of Murcia"}, "7004680933": {"Name": "Lax A.", "AuthorID": "7004680933", "AffiliationID": "60000130, 60029675", "AffiliationName": "Cardiology Department, Hospital Virgen de la Arrixaca, IMIB-Arrixaca, University of Murcia"}, "13907649300": {"Name": "Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez B.", "AuthorID": "13907649300", "AffiliationID": "60019290", "AffiliationName": "IIS-Fundaci\u00f3n Jim\u00e9nez D\u00edaz University Hospital"}, "7004094140": {"Name": "Bayes-Genis A.", "AuthorID": "7004094140", "AffiliationID": "60028462", "AffiliationName": "Heart Institute, Hospital Universitari Germans Trias i Pujol"}, "7201552601": {"Name": "D\u00edez J.", "AuthorID": "7201552601", "AffiliationID": "117980504", "AffiliationName": "Instituto de Investigaci\u00f3n Sanitaria de Navarra, IDISNA"}}}
