With this in mind, we use ab initio path integral molecular dynamics to determine the absolute contribution of NQEs to the binding in DNA base pair complexes, arguably the most important hydrogen-bonded systems of all. We find that depending on the temperature, NQEs can either strengthen or weaken the binding within the hydrogen-bonded complexes. As a somewhat counterintuitive consequence, NQEs can have a smaller impact on hydrogen bond strengths at cryogenic temperatures than at room temperature. We rationalize this in terms of a competition of NQEs between low-frequency and high-frequency vibrational modes. Extending this idea, we also propose a simple model to predict the temperature dependence of NQEs on hydrogen bond strengths in general.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Cryogenic temperatures", "High-frequency vibrational modes", "Hydrogen bonded systems", "Hydrogen-bonded complexes", "Inverse temperatures", "Nuclear quantum effects", "Path-integral molecular dynamics", "Temperature dependence", "Base Pairing", "DNA", "Molecular Dynamics Simulation", "Quantum Theory"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84973571901", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"]], "AuthorData": {"56949706600": {"Name": "Fang W.", "AuthorID": "56949706600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "55642062800": {"Name": "Chen J.", "AuthorID": "55642062800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "56210204700": {"Name": "Michaelides A.", "AuthorID": "56210204700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "57214957648": {"Name": "Rossi M.", "AuthorID": "57214957648", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Physical and Theoretical Chemistry Lab, University of Oxford"}, "55203728300": {"Name": "Feng Y.", "AuthorID": "55203728300", "AffiliationID": "60032356", "AffiliationName": "School of Physics and Electronics, Hunan University"}, "35722170400": {"Name": "Li X.Z.", "AuthorID": "35722170400", "AffiliationID": "60014966", "AffiliationName": "International Center for Quantum Materials, School of Physics, Collaborative Innovation Center of Quantum Matter, Peking University"}}}
