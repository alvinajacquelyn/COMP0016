All rights reserved.Objectives The aims of this study were to (i) identify independent predictors of survival after pancreaticoduodenectomy for ampullary cancer and (ii) develop a prognostic model of survival. Methods Data were analyzed retrospectively on 110 consecutive patients who underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy between 2002 and 2013. Subjects were categorized into 3 nodal subgroups as per the recently proposed nodal subclassification: N0 (node negative), N1 (1-2 metastatic nodes), or N2 (\u22653 metastatic nodes). Clinicopathological features and overall survival were compared by Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses. Results The overall 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates were 79.8%, 42.2%, and 34.9%, respectively. The overall 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates for the N0 group were 85.2%, 71.9%, and 67.4%, respectively. The 1-, 3-, 5-year survival rates for the N1 and N2 subgroups were 81.5%, 49.4%, and 49.4% and 75%, 19.2%, and 6.4%, respectively (log rank, P < 0.0001). After performing a multivariate Cox regression analysis, vascular invasion and lymph node ratio were the only independent predictors of survival. Hence, a prediction model of survival was constructed based on those 2 variables. Conclusions Using data from a carefully selected cohort of patients, we created a pilot prognostic model of postresectional survival. The proposed model may help clinicians to guide treatments in the adjuvant setting.", "AuthorKeywords": ["ampullary adenocarcinoma", "pancreaticoduodenectomy", "periampullary tumors", "survival"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Ampulla of Vater", "Common Bile Duct Neoplasms", "Female", "Humans", "Kaplan-Meier Estimate", "Lymphatic Metastasis", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Multivariate Analysis", "Pancreatic Neoplasms", "Pancreaticoduodenectomy", "Pilot Projects", "Prognosis", "Proportional Hazards Models", "Retrospective Studies"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85032172259", "SubjectAreas": [["Internal Medicine", "MEDI", "2724"], ["Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism", "MEDI", "2712"], ["Hepatology", "MEDI", "2721"], ["Endocrinology", "BIOC", "1310"]], "AuthorData": {"35069270600": {"Name": "Feretis M.", "AuthorID": "35069270600", "AffiliationID": "60017488", "AffiliationName": "HPB Unit, University Department of Surgery, Addenbrooke's Hospital"}, "6603308710": {"Name": "Iype S.", "AuthorID": "6603308710", "AffiliationID": "60017488", "AffiliationName": "HPB Unit, University Department of Surgery, Addenbrooke's Hospital"}, "7004717542": {"Name": "Jamieson N.V.", "AuthorID": "7004717542", "AffiliationID": "60017488", "AffiliationName": "HPB Unit, University Department of Surgery, Addenbrooke's Hospital"}, "7003750111": {"Name": "Huguet E.", "AuthorID": "7003750111", "AffiliationID": "60017488", "AffiliationName": "HPB Unit, University Department of Surgery, Addenbrooke's Hospital"}, "57210775184": {"Name": "Balakrishnan A.", "AuthorID": "57210775184", "AffiliationID": "60017488", "AffiliationName": "HPB Unit, University Department of Surgery, Addenbrooke's Hospital"}, "16307025400": {"Name": "Jah A.", "AuthorID": "16307025400", "AffiliationID": "60017488", "AffiliationName": "HPB Unit, University Department of Surgery, Addenbrooke's Hospital"}, "6602858587": {"Name": "Praseedom R.K.", "AuthorID": "6602858587", "AffiliationID": "60017488", "AffiliationName": "HPB Unit, University Department of Surgery, Addenbrooke's Hospital"}, "24830377300": {"Name": "Harper S.J.", "AuthorID": "24830377300", "AffiliationID": "60017488", "AffiliationName": "HPB Unit, University Department of Surgery, Addenbrooke's Hospital"}, "14527682800": {"Name": "Liau S.S.", "AuthorID": "14527682800", "AffiliationID": "60017488", "AffiliationName": "HPB Unit, University Department of Surgery, Addenbrooke's Hospital"}, "52265072000": {"Name": "Wang T.", "AuthorID": "52265072000", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Statistical Laboratory, Department of Statistics, University of Cambridge"}, "57196187239": {"Name": "Duckworth A.", "AuthorID": "57196187239", "AffiliationID": "60017488", "AffiliationName": "Department of Histopathology, Addenbrooke's Hospital"}, "6507507073": {"Name": "Brais R.", "AuthorID": "6507507073", "AffiliationID": "60017488", "AffiliationName": "Department of Histopathology, Addenbrooke's Hospital"}, "12753875500": {"Name": "Basu B.", "AuthorID": "12753875500", "AffiliationID": "60017488", "AffiliationName": "Department of Oncology, Addenbrooke's Hospital"}}}
