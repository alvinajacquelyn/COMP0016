We find that even-charged Ar ion states can be more populated than odd-charged Ar ion states. This depends on the pulse intensity and the number of energetically accessible inner-shell holes. Fully accounting for fine structure, we demonstrate that one-electron spectra bear the imprints of Ar hollow states with two inner-shell holes. Moreover, we show how the Auger spectra of these hollow states can be extracted from two-electron coincidence spectra.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Auger spectrum", "Electron spectrum", "Fine structures", "Hollow state", "Inner shell", "Ion state", "Ion yields", "Pulse intensity"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84937509320", "SubjectAreas": [["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"]], "AuthorData": {"33068525000": {"Name": "Wallis A.", "AuthorID": "33068525000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "56727777200": {"Name": "Banks H.", "AuthorID": "56727777200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "6603477664": {"Name": "Emmanouilidou A.", "AuthorID": "6603477664", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}}}
