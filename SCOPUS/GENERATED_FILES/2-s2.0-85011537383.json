However, there is a missing link with respect to the source of contrast between OCT and other modern imaging modalities, no quantitative comparison has been demonstrated between them, yet. We evaluated, to our knowledge, for the first time in vivo OCT measurement of rat brain with our previously proposed forward imaging method by both qualitatively and quantitatively correlating OCT with the corresponding T1-weighted and T2-weighted magnetic resonance images, fiber density map (FDM), and two types of histology staining (cresyl violet and acetylcholinesterase AchE), respectively. Brain anatomical structures were identified and compared across OCT, MRI and histology imaging modalities. Noticeable resemblances corresponding to certain anatomical structures were found between OCT and other image profiles. Correlation was quantitatively assessed by estimating correlation coefficient (R) and mutual information (MI). Results show that the 1-D OCT measurements in regards to the intensity profile and estimated attenuation factor, do not have profound linear correlation with the other image modalities suggested from correlation coefficient estimation. However, findings in mutual information analysis demonstrate that there are markedly high MI values in OCT-MRI signals.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Medical and biological imaging", "Medical optics and biotechnology", "Optical coherence tomography"], "IndexKeywords": ["Acetylcholinesterase", "Anatomical structures", "Clinical application", "Correlation coefficient", "Medical and biological imaging", "Medical optics and biotechnology", "Quantitative comparison", "Quantitative evaluation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85011537383", "SubjectAreas": [["Biotechnology", "BIOC", "1305"], ["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"]], "AuthorData": {"55566629600": {"Name": "Xie Y.", "AuthorID": "55566629600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Translational Imaging Group, Centre for Medical Image Computing, Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "6603596563": {"Name": "Kirch R.D.", "AuthorID": "6603596563", "AffiliationID": "60025641", "AffiliationName": "Section of Neuroelectronic Systems, Department of General Neurosurgery, Medical Center University of Freiburg"}, "56830175100": {"Name": "Hofmann U.G.", "AuthorID": "56830175100", "AffiliationID": "60103368", "AffiliationName": "Freiburg Institute for Advanced Studies (FRIAS), University of Freiburg and University of Strasbourg Institute for Advanced Study (USIAS)"}, "7801516419": {"Name": "Harsan L.A.", "AuthorID": "7801516419", "AffiliationID": "60010247, 60011024", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biophysics and Nuclear Medicine, Hautepierre Hospital, University Hospitals of Strasbourg"}, "57021798900": {"Name": "Bienert T.", "AuthorID": "57021798900", "AffiliationID": "60025641", "AffiliationName": "Department of Diagnostic Radiology, Medical Center University of Freiburg"}, "23006926500": {"Name": "Von Elverfeldt D.", "AuthorID": "23006926500", "AffiliationID": "60025641", "AffiliationName": "Department of Diagnostic Radiology, Medical Center University of Freiburg"}}}
