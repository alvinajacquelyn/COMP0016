X-ray powder diffraction analysis reveals that the trihydrate phase is monoclinic (space group P21/n), with a unit-cell metric very similar to that of recently identified Gly\u00b7CoSO4\u00b73H2O [Tepavitcharova et al. (2012). J. Mol. Struct. 1018, 113-121]. In order to obtain an accurate determination of all structural parameters, including the locations of H atoms, and to better understand the relationship between the pentahydrate and the trihydrate, neutron powder diffraction measurements of both (fully deuterated) phases were carried out at 10?K at the ISIS neutron spallation source, these being complemented with X-ray powder diffraction measurements and Raman spectroscopy. At 10?K, glycine magnesium sulfate pentahydrate, structurally described by the 'double' formula [Gly(d5)\u00b7MgSO4\u00b75D2O]2, is triclinic (space group P, Z = 1), and glycine magnesium sulfate trihydrate, which may be described by the formula Gly(d5)\u00b7MgSO4\u00b73D2O, is monoclinic (space group P21/n, Z = 4). In the pentahydrate, there are two symmetry-inequivalent MgO6 octahedra on sites of symmetry and two SO4 tetrahedra with site symmetry 1. The octahedra comprise one [tetraaquadiglcyinemagnesium]2+ ion (centred on Mg1) and one [hexaaquamagnesium]2+ ion (centred on Mg2), and the glycine zwitterion, NH3+CH2COO-, adopts a monodentate coordination to Mg2. In the trihydrate, there are two pairs of symmetry-inequivalent MgO6 octahedra on sites of symmetry and two pairs of SO4 tetrahedra with site symmetry 1; the glycine zwitterion adopts a binuclear-bidentate bridging function between Mg1 and Mg2, whilst the Mg2 octahedra form a corner-sharing arrangement with the sulfate tetrahedra. These bridged polyhedra thus constitute infinite polymeric chains extending along the b axis of the crystal. A range of O - H...O, N - H...O and C - H...O hydrogen bonds, including some three-centred interactions, complete the three-dimensional framework of each crystal.We report the crystal structure of a new glycine-MgSO4 hydrate that is isotypic with the recently identified Gly\u00b7CoSO4\u00b73H2O.
