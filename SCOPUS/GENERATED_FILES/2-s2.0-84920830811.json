The experimental data were obtained in a horizontal 14. mmID acrylic pipe, for test oil and water superficial velocities ranging from 0.02. m/s to 0.51. m/s and from 0.05. m/s to 0.62. m/s, respectively. Using conductance probes, average interface heights were obtained at the pipe centre and close to the pipe wall, which revealed a concave interface shape in all cases studied. A correlation between the two heights was developed that was used in the two-fluid model. In addition, from the time series of the probe signal at the pipe centre, the average wave amplitude was calculated to be 0.0005. m and was used as an equivalent roughness in the interfacial shear stress model. Both the interface shape and roughness were considered in the two-fluid model together with literature interfacial shear stress correlations. Results showed that the inclusion of both the interface curvature and the equivalent roughness in the two-fluid model improved its predictions of pressure drop and interface height over the range of studied superficial oil and water velocities. Compared to the two-fluid model with other interfacial shear stress correlations, the modified model performed better particularly for predicting pressure drop.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Conductivity probes", "Curved interface", "Interfacial roughness", "Interfacial waves", "Liquid-liquid flow", "Two-fluid model"], "IndexKeywords": ["Conductivity probe", "Curved interface", "Interfacial roughness", "Interfacial waves", "Liquid-liquid flow", "Two fluid model"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84920830811", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"]], "AuthorData": {"42161456300": {"Name": "Edomwonyi-Otu L.", "AuthorID": "42161456300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "7004488806": {"Name": "Angeli P.", "AuthorID": "7004488806", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}}}
