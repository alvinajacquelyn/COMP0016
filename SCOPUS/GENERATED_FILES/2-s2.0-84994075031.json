The Kondo semiconductors CeT2Al10 (T=Fe, Ru and Os) possessing a c-f hybridization gap have received considerable attention recently because of the unexpected high magnetic ordering temperature of CeRu2Al10 (TN=27 K) and CeOs2Al10 (TN=28.5 K) and the Kondo insulating behaviour observed in the valence fluctuating compound CeFe2Al10 with a paramagnetic ground state down to 50 mK. We are investigating this family of compounds, both in polycrystalline and single crystal form, using inelastic neutron scattering to understand the role of anisotropic c-f hybridization on the spin gap formation as well as on their magnetic properties. We have observed a clear sign of a spin gap in all three compounds from our polycrystalline study as well as the existence of a spin gap above the magnetic ordering temperature in T=Ru and Os. Our inelastic neutron scattering studies on single crystals of CeRu2Al10 and CeOs2Al10 revealed dispersive gapped spin wave excitations below TN. Analysis of the spin wave spectrum reveals the presence of strong anisotropic exchange, along the c-axis (or z-axis) stronger than in the ab-plane. These anisotropic exchange interactions force the magnetic moment to align along the c-axis, competing with the single ion crystal field anisotropy, which prefers moments along the a-axis. In the paramagnetic state (below 50 K) of the Kondo insulator CeFe2Al10, we have also observed dispersive gapped magnetic excitations which transform into quasi-elastic scattering on heating to 100 K. We will discuss the origin of the anisotropic hybridization gap in CeFe2Al10 based on theoretical models of heavy-fermion semiconductors.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Antiferromagnetic ordering", "Caged compounds", "CeT2A10 (T=Fe, Ru and Os)", "Heavy fermion", "Kondo insulators", "Neutron scattering", "Thermoelectric materials"], "IndexKeywords": ["Antiferromagnetic orderings", "Caged compounds", "CeT2A10 (T=Fe, Ru and Os)", "Heavy fermion", "Kondo insulators", "Thermo-Electric materials"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84994075031", "SubjectAreas": [["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"]], "AuthorData": {"7005471548": {"Name": "Adroja D.T.", "AuthorID": "7005471548", "AffiliationID": "60030788", "AffiliationName": "Department of Quantum Matter, ADSM, and IAMR, Hiroshima University"}, "16022464800": {"Name": "Le M.D.", "AuthorID": "16022464800", "AffiliationID": "60001724, 60023254", "AffiliationName": "ISIS Facility, Rutherford Appleton Laboratory"}, "56262910000": {"Name": "Walker H.C.", "AuthorID": "56262910000", "AffiliationID": "60001724, 60023254", "AffiliationName": "ISIS Facility, Rutherford Appleton Laboratory"}, "7006763431": {"Name": "Muro Y.", "AuthorID": "7006763431", "AffiliationID": "60032632", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Engineering, Toyama Prefectural University"}, "35401368600": {"Name": "Takabatake T.", "AuthorID": "35401368600", "AffiliationID": "60030788", "AffiliationName": "Department of Quantum Matter, ADSM, and IAMR, Hiroshima University"}, "7006223445": {"Name": "McEwen K.A.", "AuthorID": "7006223445", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, London Centre for Nanotechnology, University College London"}, "7101618994": {"Name": "Boothroyd A.T.", "AuthorID": "7101618994", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of Oxford, Clarendon Laboratory"}}}
