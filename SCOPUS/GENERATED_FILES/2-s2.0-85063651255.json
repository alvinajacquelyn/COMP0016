Design: Consecutive, retrospective case series. Methods: SETTING: Moorfields Eye Hospital, London, United Kingdom. STUDY POPULATION: Consecutive cases of keratoconus treated with non\u2013laser assisted DALK from September 1, 2012, to September 31, 2016. OBSERVATION PROCEDURE: Data on preoperative status, operative details, intraoperative and postoperative complications, secondary interventions, and visual outcomes were archived for analysis. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Graft failure rate and percentage of patients with corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA) \u226520/40 within 1 year of surgery and at final review after suture removal. Results: Three hundred fifty-seven eyes of 338 patients undergoing DALK (91.3% big-bubble technique attempted) were analyzed. A total of 4.2% (95% confidence interval [CI] 2.4%\u20136.8%) of corneal transplants had failed within the follow-up period (21.8 \u00b1 11.4 months), and 75.9% of eyes had CDVA \u226520/40 within 1 year of surgery, rising to 81% after suture removal. Forty-two primary surgeons (31 trainees) participated. Intraoperative perforation of Descemet membrane occurred in 45.4% of eyes. A total of 24.1% were converted to penetrating keratoplasty (PK) intraoperatively. Conversion to PK increased the risk of transplant rejection (P = .026; odds ratio [OR] 1.94; 95% CI 1.1\u20133.5) and secondary glaucoma (P = .016; OR 4.0; 95% CI 1.3\u201312.4). Transplant rejection increased the risk of graft failure both overall (P = .017; OR = 3.9; 95% CI 1.4\u201311.0) and when cases converted to PK were excluded (P = .028; OR = 3.35; 95% CI 1.1\u20139.9). Conclusion: DALK for keratoconus achieves early results similar to those published for PK in a multisurgeon setting. Conservative management of intraoperative Descemet membrane perforation, where possible, may be safer than conversion to PK.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Corneal Topography", "Corneal Transplantation", "Female", "Graft Survival", "Humans", "Intraoperative Complications", "Keratoconus", "Male", "Medical Audit", "Postoperative Complications", "Retrospective Studies", "Treatment Outcome", "Visual Acuity", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85063651255", "SubjectAreas": [["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"]], "AuthorData": {"57202339413": {"Name": "Gadhvi K.A.", "AuthorID": "57202339413", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Department of Corneal and External Eye Diseases, Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "25960336600": {"Name": "Romano V.", "AuthorID": "25960336600", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Department of Corneal and External Eye Diseases, Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "55340829200": {"Name": "Fern\u00e1ndez-Vega Cueto L.", "AuthorID": "55340829200", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Department of Corneal and External Eye Diseases, Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "57094732600": {"Name": "Aiello F.", "AuthorID": "57094732600", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Department of Corneal and External Eye Diseases, Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "36028093000": {"Name": "Day A.C.", "AuthorID": "36028093000", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Department of Corneal and External Eye Diseases, Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "7102506160": {"Name": "Allan B.D.", "AuthorID": "7102506160", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Department of Corneal and External Eye Diseases, Moorfields Eye Hospital"}}}
