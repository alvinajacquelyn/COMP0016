ASSER PRESS and the authors 2015.This chapter analyses the EU\u2019s obligation to uphold and promote its values and interests in its external polies, in particular as regards some of the values generally underpinning the EU\u2019s internal market, and the rules and principles concerning services of general interest in particular. The first part of the chapter offers a mapping exercise of the relevant Treaty provisions-seeking to establish connections and ways of reading them so that they may \u201cinform\u201d each other. The second part puts them in the context of the debate about Normative Power Europe (NPE)-a much used, but not undisputed international relations concept coined to express the nature of the EU\u2019s external policies and projection. The third inquires further into the \u201cnormative\u201d nature and effect of the EU\u2019s constitutional values and objectives. It will be argued that the Treaty normative basis for the EU\u2019s external relations is meaningful and is to be taken seriously.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84942910588", "SubjectAreas": [["Social Sciences (all)", "SOCI", "3300"]], "AuthorData": {"6603178601": {"Name": "Eeckhout P.", "AuthorID": "6603178601", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "European Union Law, University College London"}}}
