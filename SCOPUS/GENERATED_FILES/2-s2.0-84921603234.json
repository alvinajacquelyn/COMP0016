This property of language is called underspecification. Parts of the lexicon have characteristic patterns of underspecification; for example, artifact nouns tend to specify shape, but not color, whereas substance nouns specify material but not shape. These regularities in the lexicon enable learners to generalize new words appropriately. How does the lexicon come to have these helpful regularities? We test the hypothesis that systematic backgrounding of some dimensions during learning and use causes language to gradually change, over repeated episodes of transmission, to produce a lexicon with strong patterns of underspecification across these less salient dimensions. This offers a cultural evolutionary mechanism linking individual word learning and generalization to the origin of regularities in the lexicon that help learners generalize words appropriately.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Attentional learning", "Cultural transmission", "Iterated learning", "Language and conceptualization", "Language evolution", "Word meaning"], "IndexKeywords": ["Concept Formation", "Culture", "Humans", "Language", "Learning", "Models, Psychological", "Verbal Learning", "Vocabulary"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84921603234", "SubjectAreas": [["Experimental and Cognitive Psychology", "PSYC", "3205"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"], ["Artificial Intelligence", "COMP", "1702"]], "AuthorData": {"56289107100": {"Name": "Silvey C.", "AuthorID": "56289107100", "AffiliationID": "60176139, 60027272", "AffiliationName": "School of Philosophy, Psychology, and Language Sciences, University of Edinburgh"}, "7102236888": {"Name": "Kirby S.", "AuthorID": "7102236888", "AffiliationID": "60176139, 60027272", "AffiliationName": "School of Philosophy, Psychology, and Language Sciences, University of Edinburgh"}, "57218971574": {"Name": "Smith K.", "AuthorID": "57218971574", "AffiliationID": "60176139, 60027272", "AffiliationName": "School of Philosophy, Psychology, and Language Sciences, University of Edinburgh"}}}
