KGaA, Weinheim.The development of a robust palladium-catalysed urea Narylation protocol to install various ureas at the 3-position of the 2(1H)-pyrazinone scaffold is described. The method involves Pd(OAc)2 in combination with bidentate ligands, xantphos [4,5-bis(diphenylphosphino)-9,9-dimethylxanthene] in particular, and resulted in good to excellent coupling yields of aliphatic, aromatic, and sterically hindered ureas. Furthermore, the C-3 chlorine was shown to be selectively displaced in the presence of aryl halide ureas, and this find-ing was supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This allows further diversification of the scaffold for the production of compound libraries. Overall, the protocol facilitates further exploitation of pyrazinones as beta-sheetinducing scaffolds in the development of sophisticated peptidomimetics/ protease inhibitors. This is exemplified here by the synthesis of a new pyrazinone-based hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS3 protease inhibitor.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Enzyme inhibitors /", "Homogeneous catalysis /", "Medicinal chemistry", "Nitrogen heterocycles /", "Palladium /", "Peptidomimetics /"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84922309710", "SubjectAreas": [["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"], ["Organic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1605"]], "AuthorData": {"6503974559": {"Name": "Belfrage A.", "AuthorID": "6503974559", "AffiliationID": "60022068, 60003858", "AffiliationName": "Organic Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Department of Medicinal Chemistry, Uppsala Biomedical Center, Uppsala University"}, "14059976000": {"Name": "Gising J.", "AuthorID": "14059976000", "AffiliationID": "60022068, 60003858", "AffiliationName": "Organic Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Department of Medicinal Chemistry, Uppsala Biomedical Center, Uppsala University"}, "6603427180": {"Name": "Svensson F.", "AuthorID": "6603427180", "AffiliationID": "60022068, 60003858", "AffiliationName": "Organic Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Department of Medicinal Chemistry, Uppsala Biomedical Center, Uppsala University"}, "56499003000": {"Name": "\u00c5kerblom E.", "AuthorID": "56499003000", "AffiliationID": "60022068, 60003858", "AffiliationName": "Organic Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Department of Medicinal Chemistry, Uppsala Biomedical Center, Uppsala University"}, "8964958000": {"Name": "Sk\u00f6ld C.", "AuthorID": "8964958000", "AffiliationID": "60022068, 60003858", "AffiliationName": "Organic Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Department of Medicinal Chemistry, Uppsala Biomedical Center, Uppsala University"}, "15756552300": {"Name": "Sandstr\u00f6m A.", "AuthorID": "15756552300", "AffiliationID": "60022068, 60003858", "AffiliationName": "Organic Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Department of Medicinal Chemistry, Uppsala Biomedical Center, Uppsala University"}}}
