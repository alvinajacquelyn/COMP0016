However, less is known about non-disease factors affecting FC in the BGN. The aim of this study was to examine associations of FC within the BGN with dopaminergic processes in healthy older adults. We explored the relationship between FC in the BGN and variables related to demographics, impulsive behavior, self-paced tasks, mood, and motor correlates in 486 participants in the Whitehall-II imaging sub-study using both region-of-interest- and voxel-based approaches. Age was the only correlate of FC in the BGN that was consistently significant with both analyses. The observed adverse effect of aging on FC may relate to alterations of the dopaminergic system, but no unique dopamine-related function seemed to have a link with FC beyond those detectable in and linearly correlated with healthy aging.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Basal ganglia", "Dopamine", "Functional connectivity", "Healthy aging", "Parkinson\u2019s disease", "Resting state fMRI"], "IndexKeywords": ["Affect", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Basal Ganglia", "Brain Mapping", "Female", "Healthy Aging", "Humans", "Impulsive Behavior", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Motor Activity", "Neural Pathways", "Rest", "Sleep"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85041902801", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"], ["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"], ["Behavioral Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2802"]], "AuthorData": {"41261247900": {"Name": "Griffanti L.", "AuthorID": "41261247900", "AffiliationID": "60002634", "AffiliationName": "Oxford Parkinson\u2019s Disease Centre (OPDC)"}, "26221643100": {"Name": "Filippini N.", "AuthorID": "26221643100", "AffiliationID": "60002634", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, University of Oxford"}, "25423301000": {"Name": "Zamboni G.", "AuthorID": "25423301000", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Centre for the functional MRI of the Brain (FMRIB), Wellcome Centre for Integrative Neuroimaging, Nuffield Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Oxford"}, "6504541838": {"Name": "Douaud G.", "AuthorID": "6504541838", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Centre for the functional MRI of the Brain (FMRIB), Wellcome Centre for Integrative Neuroimaging, Nuffield Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Oxford"}, "26429517800": {"Name": "Klein J.C.", "AuthorID": "26429517800", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Nuffield Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Oxford"}, "37028938400": {"Name": "Rolinski M.", "AuthorID": "37028938400", "AffiliationID": "60171764", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Bristol"}, "57189494530": {"Name": "Hu M.T.", "AuthorID": "57189494530", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Nuffield Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Oxford"}, "57196084116": {"Name": "Mackay C.E.", "AuthorID": "57196084116", "AffiliationID": "60000940, 60002634", "AffiliationName": "Oxford Centre for Human Brain Activity, Wellcome Centre for Integrative Neuroimaging, Department of Psychiatry, University of Oxford, Warneford Hospital"}, "55822253500": {"Name": "Stratmann P.", "AuthorID": "55822253500", "AffiliationID": "60019722, 60007798", "AffiliationName": "Department of Informatics, Germany and Institute of Robotics and Mechatronics, German Aerospace Center (DLR), Technical University of Munich"}, "23989895900": {"Name": "Zsoldos E.", "AuthorID": "23989895900", "AffiliationID": "60002634", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, University of Oxford"}, "56128285900": {"Name": "Mahmood A.", "AuthorID": "56128285900", "AffiliationID": "60002634", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, University of Oxford"}, "7004932147": {"Name": "Ebmeier K.P.", "AuthorID": "7004932147", "AffiliationID": "60002634", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, University of Oxford"}, "7004391239": {"Name": "Kivim\u00e4ki M.", "AuthorID": "7004391239", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "9734197200": {"Name": "Singh-Manoux A.", "AuthorID": "9734197200", "AffiliationID": "60014856, 60000905", "AffiliationName": "INSERM, U 1018, H\u00f4pital Paul-Brousse"}}}
