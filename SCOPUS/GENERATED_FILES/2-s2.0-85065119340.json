The approach dealt with combines, in a holistic way, a distributed fault detection and isolation algorithm with a specific tube-based model predictive control scheme. A distributed fault-tolerant control strategy is illustrated to guarantee overall stability and constraint satisfaction even after the occurrence of a fault. In particular, each subsystem is controlled and monitored by a local unit. The fault diagnosis component consists of a passive set-based fault detection algorithm and an active fault isolation one, yielding fault-isolability subject to local input and state constraints. The distributed active fault isolation module-thanks to a modification of the local inputs-allows to isolate the fault that has occurred, avoiding the usual drawback of controllers that possibly hide the effect of the faults. The Active Fault Isolation method is used as a decision support tool for the fault-tolerant control strategy after fault detection. The distributed design of the tube-based model predictive control allows the possible disconnection of faulty subsystems or the reconfiguration of local controllers after fault isolation. Simulation results on a well-known power network benchmark show the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Active fault diagnosis", "decentralized control", "fault-tolerant control (FTC)", "interconnected systems", "optimal control"], "IndexKeywords": ["Active fault diagnosis", "Constraint Satisfaction", "Distributed fault detections", "Fault detection algorithm", "Fault tolerant systems", "Input and state constraints", "Large-scale interconnected systems", "Stability analysis"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85065119340", "SubjectAreas": [["Control and Systems Engineering", "ENGI", "2207"], ["Signal Processing", "COMP", "1711"], ["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"], ["Control and Optimization", "MATH", "2606"]], "AuthorData": {"54411982800": {"Name": "Boem F.", "AuthorID": "54411982800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "57193098220": {"Name": "Gallo A.J.", "AuthorID": "57193098220", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Imperial College London"}, "55161538500": {"Name": "Parisini T.", "AuthorID": "55161538500", "AffiliationID": "60018363", "AffiliationName": "Department of Engineering and Architecture, University of Trieste"}, "23009807600": {"Name": "Raimondo D.M.", "AuthorID": "23009807600", "AffiliationID": "60015197", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical, Computer and Biomedical Engineering, University of Pavia"}}}
