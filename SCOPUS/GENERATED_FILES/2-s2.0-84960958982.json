Published by Elsevier Ltd.Chloride-induced corrosion of steel in reinforced concrete structures is one of the main problems affecting their durability, but most previous research projects and case studies have focused on concretes without cracks or not subjected to any structural load. Although it has been recognised that structural cracks do influence the chloride transport and chloride induced corrosion in reinforced concrete structures, there is little published work on the influence of micro-cracks due to service loads on these properties. Therefore the effect of micro-cracks caused by loading on chloride transport into concrete was studied. Four different stress levels (0%, 25%, 50% and 75% of the stress at ultimate load - fu) were applied to 100 mm diameter concrete discs and chloride migration was measured using a bespoke test setup based on the NT BUILD 492 test. The effects of replacing Portland cement CEMI by ground granulated blast-furnace slag (GGBS), pulverised fuel ash (PFA) and silica fume (SF) on chloride transport in concrete under sustained loading were studied. The results have indicated that chloride migration coefficients changed little when the stress level was below 50% of the fu; however, it is desirable to keep concrete stress less than 25% fu if this is practical. The effect of removing the load on the change of chloride migration coefficient was also studied. A recovery of around 50% of the increased chloride migration coefficient was found in the case of concretes subjected to 75% of the fu when the load was removed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Chloride transport", "Load effect", "Micro-cracks", "Service life", "Stress level"], "IndexKeywords": ["Chloride induced corrosion", "Chloride migration coefficients", "Chloride resistance", "Chloride transport", "Ground granulated blast furnace slag", "Load effects", "Pulverised fuel ashes", "Stress levels"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84960958982", "SubjectAreas": [["Civil and Structural Engineering", "ENGI", "2205"], ["Building and Construction", "ENGI", "2215"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"]], "AuthorData": {"56370107300": {"Name": "Wang J.", "AuthorID": "56370107300", "AffiliationID": "60029738", "AffiliationName": "School of Planning, Architecture and Civil Engineering, Queens University of Belfast"}, "23036324000": {"Name": "Nanukuttan S.", "AuthorID": "23036324000", "AffiliationID": "60029738", "AffiliationName": "School of Planning, Architecture and Civil Engineering, Queens University of Belfast"}, "7202417206": {"Name": "Long A.", "AuthorID": "7202417206", "AffiliationID": "60029738", "AffiliationName": "School of Planning, Architecture and Civil Engineering, Queens University of Belfast"}, "8612834400": {"Name": "Basheer P.", "AuthorID": "8612834400", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "School of Civil Engineering, University of Leeds"}, "55461062100": {"Name": "Bai Y.", "AuthorID": "55461062100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil, Environmental and Geomatic Engineering, University College London"}}}
