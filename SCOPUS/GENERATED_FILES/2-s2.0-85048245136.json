However, the electronic structure of the deprotonated indole anion has been relatively unexplored. Here, we use a combination of anion photoelectron velocity-map imaging measurements and quantum chemistry calculations to probe the electronic structure of the deprotonated indole anion. We report vertical detachment energies (VDEs) of 2.45 \u00b1 0.05 eV and 3.20 \u00b1 0.05 eV, respectively. The value for D0 is in agreement with recent high-resolution measurements whereas the value for D1 is a new measurement. We find that the first electronically excited singlet state of the anion, S1(\u03c0\u03c0\u2217), lies above the VDE and has shape resonance character with respect to the D0 detachment continuum and Feshbach resonance character with respect to the D1 continuum.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85048245136", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"]], "AuthorData": {"8839107300": {"Name": "Parkes M.A.", "AuthorID": "8839107300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "7004088715": {"Name": "Crellin J.", "AuthorID": "7004088715", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "57189599835": {"Name": "Henley A.", "AuthorID": "57189599835", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "7003283537": {"Name": "Fielding H.H.", "AuthorID": "7003283537", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}}}
