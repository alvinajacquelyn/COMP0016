All rights reserved.In general, treatment of solid tumours has been compartmentalized as local treatment and systemic treatment. The only systemic oncological effect of local treatment is supposedly eradication of the primary cancer thereby reducing the probability of further systemic spread. However, as will be described here there are instances where local treatment could impact the outcome in diverse ways. We describe how the modulation of surgery by changing its extent or addition of intraoperative radiation appears greatly impact it systemic effects.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Breast cancer", "Lumpectomy", "Mammoplasty", "Mastectomy", "Non-breast cancer deaths", "Reconstruction", "Relapse", "Surgical trauma", "Targeted intraoperative radiotherapy TARGIT IORT"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85033206038", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"7006928746": {"Name": "Vaidya J.S.", "AuthorID": "7006928746", "AffiliationID": "60032819, 60024544, 60162048", "AffiliationName": "Whittington Health, Royal Free Hospital, University College London Hospital"}}}
