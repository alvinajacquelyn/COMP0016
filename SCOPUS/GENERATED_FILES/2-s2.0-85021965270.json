In order to deploy effective technical and legal countermeasures, it is important to understand how these black-hat marketplaces operate, shedding light on the services they offer, who is selling, who is buying, what are they buying, who is more successful, why are they successful, etc. Toward this goal, in this paper, we present a detailed micro-economic analysis of a popular online black-hat marketplace, namely, SEOClerks.com. As the site provides non-anonymized transaction information, we set to analyze selling and buying behavior of individual users, propose a strategy to identify key users, and study their tactics as compared to other (non-key) users. We find that key users: (1) are mostly located in Asian countries, (2) are focused more on selling black-hat SEO services, (3) tend to list more lower priced services, and (4) sometimes buy services from other sellers and then sell at higher prices. Finally, we discuss the implications of our analysis with respect to devising effective economic and legal intervention strategies against marketplace operators and key users.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Asian countries", "Buying behavior", "Facebook", "Intervention strategy", "Key users", "Search engine optimizations", "Shedding light", "Transaction information"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85021965270", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Information Systems", "COMP", "1710"], ["Information Systems and Management", "DECI", "1802"]], "AuthorData": {"57188822163": {"Name": "Farooqi S.", "AuthorID": "57188822163", "AffiliationID": "60024324", "AffiliationName": "University of Iowa City"}, "15044177800": {"Name": "Friedman A.", "AuthorID": "15044177800", "AffiliationID": "60024324", "AffiliationName": "University of Iowa City"}, "15925235500": {"Name": "Jourjon G.", "AuthorID": "15925235500", "AffiliationID": "60108057", "AffiliationName": "Data61 CSIRO"}, "57206150249": {"Name": "Ikram M.", "AuthorID": "57206150249", "AffiliationID": "60108057, 60028333", "AffiliationName": "Data61 CSIRO, UNSW"}, "24338380900": {"Name": "Kaafar M.", "AuthorID": "24338380900", "AffiliationID": "108082753", "AffiliationName": "Atlassian"}, "17433897300": {"Name": "De Cristofaro E.", "AuthorID": "17433897300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "57190254675": {"Name": "Shafiq Z.", "AuthorID": "57190254675", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "15770538900": {"Name": "Zaffar F.", "AuthorID": "15770538900", "AffiliationID": "60042311", "AffiliationName": "LUMS"}}}
