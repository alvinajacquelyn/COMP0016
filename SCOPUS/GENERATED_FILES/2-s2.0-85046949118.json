We assessed the long-term impact of a PLA intervention in rural Nepal on women\u2019s agency in the household. In 2014, we conducted a follow-up study to a cluster randomised controlled trial on the impact of PLA women\u2019s groups from 2001\u20132003. Agency was measured using the Relative Autonomy Index (RAI) and its subdomains. Multi-level regression analyses were performed adjusting for baseline socio-demographic characteristics. We additionally adjusted for potential exposure to subsequent PLA groups based on women\u2019s pregnancy status and conduct of PLA groups in areas of residence. Sensitivity analyses were performed using two alternative measures of agency. We analysed outcomes for 4030 mothers (66% of the cohort) who survived and were recruited to follow-up at mean age 39.6 years. Across a wide range of model specifications, we found no association between exposure to the original PLA intervention with women\u2019s agency in the household approximately 11.5 years later. Subsequent exposure to PLA groups was not associated with greater agency in the household at follow-up, but some specifications found evidence for reduced agency. Household agency may be a prerequisite for actualising the benefits of PLA groups rather than a consequence.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Community Participation", "Family Characteristics", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Humans", "Models, Theoretical", "Nepal", "Time Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85046949118", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"57216109600": {"Name": "Gram L.", "AuthorID": "57216109600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Global Health, University College London"}, "26654536200": {"Name": "Skordis-Worrall J.", "AuthorID": "26654536200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Global Health, University College London"}, "55222208600": {"Name": "Strachan D.", "AuthorID": "55222208600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Global Health, University College London"}, "9435917600": {"Name": "Morrison J.", "AuthorID": "9435917600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Global Health, University College London"}, "23486721300": {"Name": "Saville N.", "AuthorID": "23486721300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Global Health, University College London"}, "6603217003": {"Name": "Osrin D.", "AuthorID": "6603217003", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Global Health, University College London"}, "54790609700": {"Name": "Costello A.", "AuthorID": "54790609700", "AffiliationID": "60027142", "AffiliationName": "Department of Maternal, Newborn, Child and Adolescent Health (MCA), World Health Organization"}, "22234232400": {"Name": "Heys M.", "AuthorID": "22234232400", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "12767143700": {"Name": "Manandhar D.S.", "AuthorID": "12767143700", "AffiliationID": "100381402", "AffiliationName": "Mother and Infant Research Activities (MIRA)"}, "6508236333": {"Name": "Tumbahangphe K.M.", "AuthorID": "6508236333", "AffiliationID": "100381402", "AffiliationName": "Mother and Infant Research Activities (MIRA)"}}}
