Elbows are critical structures subject to continuous corrosion that can lead to a burst or collapse. It is important to be able to predict both burst strength in continually corroding structures and the behaviour of the structures after critical corrosion takes place. Structural failures due to a significant reduction in wall thickness make it very complicated for pipeline operators to maintain pipeline serviceability. This paper discusses the plastic limit pressure of elbows without defects and with several local thinned areas. Finite element analysis (FEA) and the Goodall formula were used to evaluate the new formula. The results of the FEA show that the limit load of elbows under internal pressure differs with position and depth of damage. An empirical formula for the limit load of elbows with local thinned areas is proposed. Eight sizes of elbow were considered in this study, with Rm/t of 5, 6, 7.5, 9, 12, 15, 20 and 25. This range covers most of the piping used in high-pressure environments, such as nuclear and subsea situations. The method of numerical analysis was validated by experiment and with FEA results from the literature. The results of the study can be applied to both the operation and assessment of pipelines. A formula to predict the maximum burst strength of damaged elbows is presented, which will enable more accurate estimates of the time until pipelines need to be replaced or repaired.", "AuthorKeywords": ["22g steel", "burst pressure", "condition assessment", "corrosion", "elbow", "local thin area", "modified Goodall formula", "pipeline serviceability"], "IndexKeywords": ["Burst pressures", "Condition assessments", "elbow", "Local thin areas", "modified Goodall formula"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84955168267", "SubjectAreas": [["Ocean Engineering", "ENGI", "2212"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"]], "AuthorData": {"56660130300": {"Name": "Lee G.", "AuthorID": "56660130300", "AffiliationID": "60008783", "AffiliationName": "Department Narval Archtecture and Ocean Enigeering, Pusan National University"}, "35821146600": {"Name": "Paik J.", "AuthorID": "35821146600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "36890591400": {"Name": "Seo J.", "AuthorID": "36890591400", "AffiliationID": "60008783", "AffiliationName": "The Korea Ship and Offshore Research Institute (The Lloyd's Register Foundation Research Centre of Excellence), Pusan National University"}}}
