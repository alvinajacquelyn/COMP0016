These MMHT2014 PDFs supersede the \u2018MSTW2008\u2019 parton sets, but they are obtained within the same basic framework. We include a variety of new data sets, from the LHC, updated Tevatron data and the HERA combined H1 and ZEUS data on the total and charm structure functions. We also improve the theoretical framework of the previous analysis. These new PDFs are compared to the \u2018MSTW2008\u2019 parton sets. In most cases the PDFs, and the predictions, are within one standard deviation of those of MSTW2008. The major changes are the $$u-d$$u-d valence quark difference at small $$x$$x due to an improved parameterisation and, to a lesser extent, the strange quark PDF due to the effect of certain LHC data and a better treatment of the $$D \\rightarrow \\mu $$D\u2192\u03bc branching ratio. We compare our MMHT PDF sets with those of other collaborations; in particular with the NNPDF3.0 sets, which are contemporary with the present analysis.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84928999884", "SubjectAreas": [["Engineering (miscellaneous)", "ENGI", "2201"], ["Physics and Astronomy (miscellaneous)", "PHYS", "3101"]], "AuthorData": {"35589760900": {"Name": "Harland-Lang L.A.", "AuthorID": "35589760900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "15035882900": {"Name": "Motylinski P.", "AuthorID": "15035882900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "7101652961": {"Name": "Thorne R.S.", "AuthorID": "7101652961", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "7404932388": {"Name": "Martin A.D.", "AuthorID": "7404932388", "AffiliationID": "60022175, 60176038", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Particle Physics Phenomenology, Durham University"}}}
