All rights reserved.The paper maps and analyzes all existing practical exercises aiming to develop indicators for public sector innovations. To our knowledge this is the first attempt to comprehensively gather information about various international efforts. We only considered such exercises where actual indicators were developed and used at least once. We map five such exercises through extensive desk research and 13 interviews with surveyed project members. The paper shows that all existing attempts to measure public sector innovations operate within a rather limited conception of the public sector (efficiency), neglecting other possible logics (e.g. legitimacy); the existing exercises also neglect large areas of public sector activities, e.g. cooperation with business and third sectors (such as service co-creation, public-private partnership practices). This narrow focus often dictates that indicators and their technical assumptions are copied from the private sector; none of the five analyzed exercises utilized public administration experience and research (e.g. on performance measurement). The paper argues that instead of trying to come up with quantified indicators, public sector innovations should be assessed in complex evaluation frameworks.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85056608736", "SubjectAreas": [["Public Administration", "SOCI", "3321"]], "AuthorData": {"24166963100": {"Name": "Kattel R.", "AuthorID": "24166963100", "AffiliationID": "60068861", "AffiliationName": "Ragnar Nurkse Department of Innovation and Governance, Tallinn University of Technology"}, "57189257825": {"Name": "Cepilovs A.", "AuthorID": "57189257825", "AffiliationID": "60068861", "AffiliationName": "Ragnar Nurkse Department of Innovation and Governance, Tallinn University of Technology"}, "6507246912": {"Name": "Lember V.", "AuthorID": "6507246912", "AffiliationID": "60068861", "AffiliationName": "Ragnar Nurkse Department of Innovation and Governance, Tallinn University of Technology"}, "55359607700": {"Name": "T\u00f5nurist P.", "AuthorID": "55359607700", "AffiliationID": "60068861", "AffiliationName": "Ragnar Nurkse Department of Innovation and Governance, Tallinn University of Technology"}}}
