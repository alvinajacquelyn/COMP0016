We tested the efficacy of the theory for predicting adherence to treatment in chronic illness across multiple studies. A database search identified 27 studies, meeting inclusion criteria. Averaged intercorrelations among theory variables were computed corrected for sampling error using random-effects meta-analysis. Path-analysis using the meta-analytically derived correlations was used to test theory hypotheses and effects of moderators. The theory explained 33 and 9 % of the variance in intention and adherence behavior respectively. Theoretically consistent patterns of effects among the attitude, subjective norm, perceived behavioral control, intention and behavior constructs were found with small-to-medium effect sizes. Effect sizes were invariant across behavior and measurement type. Although results support theory predictions, effect sizes were small, particularly for the intention-behavior relationship.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Adherence", "Chronic illness", "Compliance", "Meta-analysis", "Theory of planned behavior"], "IndexKeywords": ["Attitude", "Chronic Disease", "Humans", "Intention", "Patient Compliance", "Psychological Theory"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84937631047", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychology (all)", "PSYC", "3200"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"56287289700": {"Name": "Rich A.", "AuthorID": "56287289700", "AffiliationID": "60023932", "AffiliationName": "Graduate School of Health, University of Technology Sydney"}, "55861247900": {"Name": "Brandes K.", "AuthorID": "55861247900", "AffiliationID": "60029019, 60002483", "AffiliationName": "Amsterdam School of Communication Research, University of Amsterdam"}, "24344595500": {"Name": "Mullan B.", "AuthorID": "24344595500", "AffiliationID": "60031226, 60090173", "AffiliationName": "Health Psychology and Behavioral Medicine Research Group, School of Psychology and Speech Pathology, Curtin University"}, "6602134841": {"Name": "Hagger M.S.", "AuthorID": "6602134841", "AffiliationID": "60031226, 60090173", "AffiliationName": "Health Psychology and Behavioral Medicine Research Group, School of Psychology and Speech Pathology, Curtin University"}}}
