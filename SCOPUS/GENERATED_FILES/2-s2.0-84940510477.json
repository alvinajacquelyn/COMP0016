Method: The sample comprised 1264 (ED patients = 653; Healthy Controls = 611) participants, recruited into a multicentre European project. Socio-family factors assessed included: perceived maternal and parental parenting styles, family, peer and media influences, and body dissatisfaction. Two types of path-analyses were run to assess the socio-family model: 1.) a multinomial logistic path-model including ED sub-types [Anorexia Nervosa-Restrictive (AN-R), AN-Binge-Purging (AN-BP), Bulimia Nervosa (BN) and EDNOS)] as the key polychotomous categorical outcome and 2.) a path-model assessing whether the socio-family model differed across ED sub-types and healthy controls using body dissatisfaction as the outcome variable. Results: The first path-analyses suggested that family and media (but not peers) were directly and indirectly associated (through body dissatisfaction) with all ED sub-types. There was a weak effect of perceived parenting directly on ED sub-types and indirectly through family influences and body dissatisfaction. For the second path-analyses, the socio-family model varied substantially across ED sub-types. Family and media influences were related to body dissatisfaction in the EDNOS and control sample, whereas perceived abusive parenting was related to AN-BP and BN. Discussion: This is the first study providing support for this new socio-family model, which differed across ED sub-types. This suggests that prevention and early intervention might need to be tailored to diagnosis-specific ED profiles.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Anorexia", "Body dissatisfaction", "Bulimia", "Eating disorders", "EDNOS", "Family", "Media", "Parenting", "Pathway models", "Peers"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Anorexia Nervosa", "Binge-Eating Disorder", "Body Image", "Bulimia", "Bulimia Nervosa", "Case-Control Studies", "Europe", "Family", "Feeding and Eating Disorders", "Female", "Humans", "Mass Media", "Models, Psychological", "Parenting", "Parents", "Peer Group", "Personal Satisfaction", "Risk", "Social Environment", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84940510477", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychology (all)", "PSYC", "3200"], ["Nutrition and Dietetics", "NURS", "2916"]], "AuthorData": {"16047693100": {"Name": "Krug I.", "AuthorID": "16047693100", "AffiliationID": "60026553", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychological Sciences, University of Melbourne"}, "26631590000": {"Name": "Fuller-Tyszkiewicz M.", "AuthorID": "26631590000", "AffiliationID": "60018805", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, Deakin University"}, "6507794022": {"Name": "Anderluh M.", "AuthorID": "6507794022", "AffiliationID": "60026823", "AffiliationName": "University Psychiatric Hospital Ljubljana"}, "7007178273": {"Name": "Bellodi L.", "AuthorID": "7007178273", "AffiliationID": "101899966", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuropsychiatric Sciences (DSNP), Fondazione Centro S.
