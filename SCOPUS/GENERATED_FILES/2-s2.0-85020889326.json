All rights reserved.Purpose: To determine differences in key tear film cytokines between mild and severe cases of acanthamoeba keratitis (AK) and control contact lens (CL) wearers. Methods: This was a prospective study of CL wearers with AK attending Moorfields Eye Hospital and control CL wearers from the Institute of Optometry, London. Basal tear specimens were collected by 10-mL capillary tubes (BLAUBRAND intraMark, Wertheim, Germany), and tear protein levels were measured with a multiplex magnetic bead array (Luminex 100; Luminex Corporation, Austin, TX) for cytokines interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-17A, IL-17E, IL-17F, IL-22, and interferon gamma and with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Abcam, Cambridge, United Kingdom) for CXCL2. Severe cases of AK were defined as having active infection for over 12 months and at least 1 severe inflammatory event. Results: One hundred and thirty-two tear samples were collected from a total of 61 cases (15 severe and 46 mild-moderate) and 22 controls. IL-8, part of the Toll-like receptor 4 cytokine cascade, was found to be expressed at a detectable level more often in cases of AK than in control CL wearers (P = 0.003) and in higher concentrations in severe cases than in milder forms of the disease (z = 22.35). IL-22, part of the IL-10 family, and a proinflammatory Th17 cytokine, was detected more often in severe cases than in milder forms of AK (P < 0.02). Conclusions: Profiling patients with AK during disease shows differences in cytokine levels between severe and milder disease that may inform clinical management. The Toll-like receptor 4 and IL-10/Th17 inflammatory pathways should be included in further investigations of this disease.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Acanthamoeba", "Contact lens", "Cytokine", "Keratitis", "Tear"], "IndexKeywords": ["Acanthamoeba Keratitis", "Adult", "Case-Control Studies", "Contact Lenses", "Cytokines", "Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay", "Eye Infections, Parasitic", "Eye Proteins", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Prospective Studies", "Tears"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85020889326", "SubjectAreas": [["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"]], "AuthorData": {"6507123040": {"Name": "Carnt N.", "AuthorID": "6507123040", "AffiliationID": "60025709, 60003992", "AffiliationName": "Westmead Institute for Medical Research, University of Sydney"}, "12772406600": {"Name": "Galatowicz G.", "AuthorID": "12772406600", "AffiliationID": "60013148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "7003742122": {"Name": "Calder V.", "AuthorID": "7003742122", "AffiliationID": "60016691, 60172638, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "National Institute of Health Research (NIHR), Biomedical Research Centre, Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "57194576133": {"Name": "Montanez V.M.", "AuthorID": "57194576133", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "55965756300": {"Name": "Veli N.", "AuthorID": "55965756300", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
