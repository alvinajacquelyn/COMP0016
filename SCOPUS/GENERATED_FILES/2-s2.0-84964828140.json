One way of making the problem more physically meaningful is to restrict the Hamiltonian in question by picking its terms from a fixed set S and scaling them by arbitrary weights. Examples of such special cases are the Heisenberg and Ising models from condensed-matter physics. In this work we characterize the complexity of this problem for all 2-local qubit Hamiltonians. Depending on the subset S, the problem falls into one of the following categories: in P; NP-complete; polynomial-time equivalent to the Ising model with transverse magnetic fields; or QMA-complete. The third of these classes has been shown to be StoqMA-complete by Bravyi and Hastings. The characterization holds even if S does not contain any 1-local terms; for example, we prove for the first time QMA-completeness of the Heisenberg and XY interactions in this setting. If S is assumed to contain all 1-local terms, which is the setting considered by previous work, we have a characterization that goes beyond 2-local interactions: for any constant k, all k-local qubit Hamiltonians whose terms are picked from a fixed set S correspond to problems either in P; polynomial-time equivalent to the Ising model with transverse magnetic fields; or QMA-complete. These results are a quantum analogue of the maximization variant of Schaefer's dichotomy theorem for Boolean constraint satisfaction problems.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Constraint satisfaction problems", "Local Hamiltonian problem", "Quantum complexity", "Quantum computation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Boolean constraint", "Dichotomy theorem", "Ground-state energies", "Local hamiltonians", "Physical systems", "Polynomial-time", "Quantum complexity", "Transverse magnetic field"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84964828140", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"], ["Mathematics (all)", "MATH", "2600"]], "AuthorData": {"23768101300": {"Name": "Cubitt T.", "AuthorID": "23768101300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "23028471900": {"Name": "Montanaro A.", "AuthorID": "23028471900", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "School of Mathematics, University of Bristol"}}}
