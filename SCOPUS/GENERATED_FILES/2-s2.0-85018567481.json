Although modified neuronal excitability is thought to be of significance, the contribution that alterations in GABAergic inhibition play in the pathophysiology of FXS are ill defined. Slow sustained neuronal inhibition is mediated by \u03b3-aminobutyric acid type B (GABAB) receptors, which are heterodimeric G-protein-coupled receptors constructed from R1a and R2 or R1b and R2 subunits. Via the activation of Gi/o, they limit cAMP accumulation, diminish neurotransmitter release, and induce neuronal hyperpolarization. Here we reveal that selective deficits in R1a subunit expression are seen in Fmr1 knock-out mice (KO) mice, a widely used animal model of FXS, but the levels of the respective mRNAs were unaffected. Similar trends of R1a expression were seen in a subset of FXS patients. GABAB receptors (GABABRs) exert powerful pre-and postsynaptic inhibitory effects on neurotransmission. R1a-containing GABABRs are believed to mediate presynaptic inhibition in principal neurons. In accordance with this result, deficits in the ability of GABABRs to suppress glutamate release were seen in Fmr1-KO mice. In contrast, the ability of GABABRs to suppress GABA release and induce postsynaptic hyperpolarization was unaffected. Significantly, this deficit contributes to the pathophysiology of FXS as the GABABR agonist (R)-baclofen rescued the imbalances between excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission evident in Fmr1-KO mice. Collectively, our results provided evidence that selective deficits in the activity of presynaptic GABABRs contribute to the pathophysiology of FXS.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Aminobutyric acids", "G protein coupled receptors", "Gamma-aminobutyric acids", "Hyperpolarization", "Inhibitory effect", "Neurotransmitter release", "Pathophysiology", "Relative strength", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Animals", "Behavior, Animal", "Disease Models, Animal", "Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein", "Fragile X Syndrome", "gamma-Aminobutyric Acid", "Glutamic Acid", "Hippocampus", "Humans", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Mice, Knockout", "Neurons", "Phosphorylation", "Receptors, GABA-B", "RNA, Messenger", "Serine", "Signal Transduction", "Synaptic Transmission"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85018567481", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"57194072116": {"Name": "Kang J.Y.", "AuthorID": "57194072116", "AffiliationID": "60015849, 60004219", "AffiliationName": "AstraZeneca Tufts Laboratory for Basic and Translational Neuroscience, Tufts University School of Medicine"}, "57193441226": {"Name": "Chadchankar J.", "AuthorID": "57193441226", "AffiliationID": "60015849, 60004219", "AffiliationName": "AstraZeneca Tufts Laboratory for Basic and Translational Neuroscience, Tufts University School of Medicine"}, "55965190000": {"Name": "Vien T.N.", "AuthorID": "55965190000", "AffiliationID": "60015849, 60004219", "AffiliationName": "AstraZeneca Tufts Laboratory for Basic and Translational Neuroscience, Tufts University School of Medicine"}, "13404206900": {"Name": "Deeb T.Z.", "AuthorID": "13404206900", "AffiliationID": "60015849, 60004219", "AffiliationName": "AstraZeneca Tufts Laboratory for Basic and Translational Neuroscience, Tufts University School of Medicine"}, "56132380200": {"Name": "Mighdoll M.I.", "AuthorID": "56132380200", "AffiliationID": "115785904", "AffiliationName": "Lieber Institute for Brain Development"}, "7102151375": {"Name": "Hyde T.M.", "AuthorID": "7102151375", "AffiliationID": "60001117", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology and Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine"}, "7005952466": {"Name": "Mather R.J.", "AuthorID": "7005952466", "AffiliationID": "60004219", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Innovative Medicines and Early Development, AstraZeneca"}, "7005362992": {"Name": "Brandon N.J.", "AuthorID": "7005362992", "AffiliationID": "60004219", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Innovative Medicines and Early Development, AstraZeneca"}, "14055994300": {"Name": "Dunlop J.", "AuthorID": "14055994300", "AffiliationID": "60004219", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Innovative Medicines and Early Development, AstraZeneca"}, "7402067232": {"Name": "Moss S.J.", "AuthorID": "7402067232", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology, University College"}, "35597337500": {"Name": "Pangalos M.N.", "AuthorID": "35597337500", "AffiliationID": "60004219", "AffiliationName": "Innovative Medicines and Early Development, AstraZeneca"}}}
