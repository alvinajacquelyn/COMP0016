Results indicate that this ca. 75 m in diameter, 5 m high mound, comprising over a dozen phases of earthen platforms, upon which were raised sophisticated wooden structures, was built in <200 years. While consuming domesticated millet, rice, and occasionally dogs and pigs, the main subsistence orientation included managed tubers and fruits and a range of mangrove ecosystem taxa: catfishes, turtles, crocodiles, monitor lizards, macaques and langurs, to name a few. This combined vegeculture-foraging lifeway in a mangrove forested environment, likely in the context of a tradable goods extractive industry, adds to a growing picture of significant diversity, and sophisticated construction skills in the Southeast Asian Neolithic.", "AuthorKeywords": ["building technology", "coastal adaptation", "mangrove ecosystem", "mound construction", "vegeculture-foraging subsistence"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84945456195", "SubjectAreas": [["Oceanography", "EART", "1910"], ["Archeology (arts and humanities)", "ARTS", "1204"], ["Ecology", "ENVI", "2303"], ["History", "ARTS", "1202"], ["Archeology", "SOCI", "3302"]], "AuthorData": {"8264446500": {"Name": "Oxenham M.", "AuthorID": "8264446500", "AffiliationID": "60008950", "AffiliationName": "School of Archaeology and Anthropology, Australian National University"}, "15849018500": {"Name": "Piper P.", "AuthorID": "15849018500", "AffiliationID": "60071491", "AffiliationName": "University of the Philippines"}, "6602236565": {"Name": "Bellwood P.", "AuthorID": "6602236565", "AffiliationID": "60008950", "AffiliationName": "School of Archaeology and Anthropology, Australian National University"}, "36094053800": {"Name": "Campos F.", "AuthorID": "36094053800", "AffiliationID": "60008950", "AffiliationName": "School of Archaeology and Anthropology, Australian National University"}, "55811966200": {"Name": "Sarjeant C.", "AuthorID": "55811966200", "AffiliationID": "60008950", "AffiliationName": "School of Archaeology and Anthropology, Australian National University"}, "25643381400": {"Name": "Willis A.", "AuthorID": "25643381400", "AffiliationID": "60008950", "AffiliationName": "School of Archaeology and Anthropology, Australian National University"}, "54951170500": {"Name": "Amano N.", "AuthorID": "54951170500", "AffiliationID": "60071491", "AffiliationName": "University of the Philippines"}, "56519536200": {"Name": "Bui C.", "AuthorID": "56519536200", "AffiliationID": "112656645", "AffiliationName": "Center for Archaeological Studies, Southern Institute of Sustainable Development"}, "56519085400": {"Name": "Nguyen K.", "AuthorID": "56519085400", "AffiliationID": "112656645", "AffiliationName": "Center for Archaeological Studies, Southern Institute of Sustainable Development"}, "56519115900": {"Name": "Nguyen Q.", "AuthorID": "56519115900", "AffiliationID": "112656645", "AffiliationName": "Center for Archaeological Studies, Southern Institute of Sustainable Development"}, "36117767700": {"Name": "Castillo C.", "AuthorID": "36117767700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Archaeology, University College London"}, "35202563700": {"Name": "Wood R.", "AuthorID": "35202563700", "AffiliationID": "60008950", "AffiliationName": "Research School of Earth Sciences, Australian National University"}, "56519485600": {"Name": "Ceron J.", "AuthorID": "56519485600", "AffiliationID": "60017311", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anthropology and Archaeology, University of Otago"}}}
