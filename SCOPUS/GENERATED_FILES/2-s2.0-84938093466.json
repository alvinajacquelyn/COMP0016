The observed spectrum is consistent with six magnetic modes and a single prominent gap, which is compatible with a single bilayer magnetic unit cell containing six spins. We model the magnon dispersion by linear spin-wave theory and find very good agreement with the domain-averaged spectrum of a spin-charge bilayer superstructure comprising one Fe3+-rich monolayer and one Fe2+-rich monolayer. These findings indicate the existence of polar bilayers in LuFe2O4. We also discuss a model of charge-segregated nonpolar bilayer order which we argue is not consistent with our data but which we cannot exclude definitively. Weak scattering observed below the magnon gap suggests that a fraction of the bilayers contain other combinations of charged monolayers not included in the model. Refined values for the dominant exchange interactions are reported.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84938093466", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"]], "AuthorData": {"55886581400": {"Name": "Gaw S.M.", "AuthorID": "55886581400", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of Oxford, Clarendon Laboratory"}, "25923938900": {"Name": "Lewtas H.J.", "AuthorID": "25923938900", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of Oxford, Clarendon Laboratory"}, "7004283781": {"Name": "Prabhakaran D.", "AuthorID": "7004283781", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of Oxford, Clarendon Laboratory"}, "7101618994": {"Name": "Boothroyd A.T.", "AuthorID": "7101618994", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of Oxford, Clarendon Laboratory"}, "7005535111": {"Name": "McMorrow D.F.", "AuthorID": "7005535111", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "London Centre for Nanotechnology and Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "7006488801": {"Name": "Kulda J.", "AuthorID": "7006488801", "AffiliationID": "60007109", "AffiliationName": "Institut Laue-Langevin"}, "12345526800": {"Name": "Ewings R.A.", "AuthorID": "12345526800", "AffiliationID": "60001724, 60009523, 60023254", "AffiliationName": "ISIS Facility, Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, STFC"}, "7005368625": {"Name": "Perring T.G.", "AuthorID": "7005368625", "AffiliationID": "60001724, 60009523, 60023254", "AffiliationName": "ISIS Facility, Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, STFC"}, "56135146000": {"Name": "McKinnon R.A.", "AuthorID": "56135146000", "AffiliationID": "60022020", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of Warwick"}, "7005288830": {"Name": "Balakrishnan G.", "AuthorID": "7005288830", "AffiliationID": "60022020", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of Warwick"}}}
