Published by Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA.Production of a biocompatible hyperpolarized bolus for signal amplification by reversible exchange (SABRE) could open the door to simple clinical diagnosis via magnetic resonance imaging. Essential to successful progression to preclinical/clinical applications is the determination of the toxicology profile of the SABRE reaction mixture. Herein, we exemplify the cytotoxicity of the SABRE approach using in vitro cell assays. We conclude that the main cause of the observed toxicity is due to the SABRE catalyst. We therefore illustrate two catalyst removal methods: one involving deactivation and ion-exchange chromatography, and the second using biphasic catalysis. These routes produce a bolus suitable for future in vivo study.", "AuthorKeywords": ["biocompatibility", "biphasic catalysis", "cytotoxicity", "hyperpolarization", "SABRE"], "IndexKeywords": ["Biocompatible Materials", "Catalysis", "Cell Line, Tumor", "Cell Survival", "Coordination Complexes", "Humans", "Iridium", "Nicotinic Acids", "Solvents", "Toxicity Tests"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85040736469", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Molecular Medicine", "BIOC", "1313"], ["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"], ["Drug Discovery", "PHAR", "3002"], ["Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics (all)", "PHAR", "3000"], ["Organic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1605"]], "AuthorData": {"57200307095": {"Name": "Manoharan A.", "AuthorID": "57200307095", "AffiliationID": "60016418", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of York"}, "55752826300": {"Name": "Rayner P.", "AuthorID": "55752826300", "AffiliationID": "60016418", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of York"}, "35791962700": {"Name": "Iali W.", "AuthorID": "35791962700", "AffiliationID": "60016418", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of York"}, "7201870639": {"Name": "Burns M.", "AuthorID": "7201870639", "AffiliationID": "60016418", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of York"}, "7101889481": {"Name": "Duckett S.", "AuthorID": "7101889481", "AffiliationID": "60016418", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of York"}, "7101787946": {"Name": "Perry V.", "AuthorID": "7101787946", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "School of Biological Sciences, University of Southampton"}}}
