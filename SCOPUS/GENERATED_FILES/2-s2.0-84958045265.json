Published by Taylor & Francis.ABSTRACT: Objective. Ethnic inequalities in cancer patient experience exist but variation within broad ethnic categories is under-explored. This study aimed to describe variation by ethnic sub-category in experiences of information provision and communication (key domains of patient experience) using National Cancer Patient Experience Survey (NCPES) data. Design. The NCPES 2012\u20132013 contained responses from 68,737 cancer patients treated at 155 NHS Trusts in England. Multivariate logistic regression was used to investigate associations between ethnicity and patients\u2019 ratings of overall care, information provision and communication. Results. Variation by and within broad ethnic categories was evident. Non-White patients (particularly Asian patients (ORadj:0.78; 95%CI:0.67-0.90, p=0.001)) were less likely than White patients to receive an understandable explanation of treatment side effects. Among Asian patients, those of Bangladeshi ethnicity were least likely to receive an understandable explanation. Conclusions. Effective communication and information provision are important to ensure patients are well informed, receive the best possible care and have a positive patient experience. However, ethnic inequalities exist in cancer patients\u2019 experiences of information provision and communication with variation evident both between and within broad ethnic categories. Further work to understand the causes of this variation is required to address ethnic inequalities at practice and policy level.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cancer", "communication", "ethnicity", "information provision", "patient experience"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Asian Continental Ancestry Group", "Attitude to Health", "Communication", "Comprehension", "England", "Ethnic Groups", "European Continental Ancestry Group", "Female", "Health Surveys", "Healthcare Disparities", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Neoplasms", "Nurse-Patient Relations", "Patient Satisfaction", "Physician-Patient Relations", "Regression Analysis", "Socioeconomic Factors", "State Medicine", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84958045265", "SubjectAreas": [["Cultural Studies", "SOCI", "3316"], ["Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)", "ARTS", "1201"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"57115376700": {"Name": "Trenchard L.", "AuthorID": "57115376700", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "School of Public Health, Imperial College London"}, "56082575000": {"Name": "Mc Grath-Lone L.", "AuthorID": "56082575000", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Patient Experience Research Centre, School of Public Health, Imperial College London"}, "57203106369": {"Name": "Ward H.", "AuthorID": "57203106369", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Patient Experience Research Centre, School of Public Health, Imperial College London"}}}
