Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) can aid the medical management of this pathology, yet its modelling and simulation are challenging. One aspect usually disregarded when modelling AD is the motion of the vessel wall, which has been shown to significantly impact simulation results. Fluid-structure interaction (FSI) methods are difficult to implement and are subject to assumptions regarding the mechanical properties of the vessel wall, which cannot be retrieved non-invasively. This paper presents a simplified \u2018moving-boundary method\u2019 (MBM) to account for the motion of the vessel wall in type-B AD CFD simulations, which can be tuned with non-invasive clinical images (e.g. 2D cine-MRI). The method is firstly validated against the 1D solution of flow through an elastic straight tube; it is then applied to a type-B AD case study and the results are compared to a state-of-the-art, full FSI simulation. Results show that the proposed method can capture the main effects due to the wall motion on the flow field: the average relative difference between flow and pressure waves obtained with the FSI and MBM simulations was less than 1.8% and 1.3%, respectively and the wall shear stress indices were found to have a similar distribution. Moreover, compared to FSI, MBM has the advantage to be less computationally expensive (requiring half of the time of an FSI simulation) and easier to implement, which are important requirements for clinical translation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Aortic dissection", "Blood flow", "Compliant model", "Computational fluid dynamics (CFD)", "Fluid-structure interaction (FSI)", "Moving boundary", "Windkessel model"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aortic dissections", "Blood flow", "Compliant model", "Moving boundaries", "Windkessel models"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85047103036", "SubjectAreas": [["Biophysics", "BIOC", "1304"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"]], "AuthorData": {"56814624000": {"Name": "Bonfanti M.", "AuthorID": "56814624000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "6602671760": {"Name": "Balabani S.", "AuthorID": "6602671760", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "55935595100": {"Name": "Alimohammadi M.", "AuthorID": "55935595100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "56266099800": {"Name": "Homer-Vanniasinkam S.", "AuthorID": "56266099800", "AffiliationID": "60006343, 60022020", "AffiliationName": "University of Warwick Medical School & University Hospitals Coventry and Warwickshire NHS Trust, CV4 7AL"}, "23984658900": {"Name": "D\u00edaz-Zuccarini V.", "AuthorID": "23984658900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "35075797600": {"Name": "Agu O.", "AuthorID": "35075797600", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "University College London Hospital"}}}
