All rights reserved.Proton pumping A-type cytochrome c oxidase (CcO) terminates the respiratory chains of mitochondria and many bacteria. Three possible proton transfer pathways (D, K, and H channels) have been identified based on structural, functional, and mutational data. Whereas the D channel provides the route for all pumped protons in bacterial A-type CcOs, studies of bovine mitochondrial CcO have led to suggestions that its H channel instead provides this route. Here, we have studied H-channel function by performing atomistic molecular dynamics simulations on the entire, as well as core, structure of bovine CcO in a lipid-solvent environment. The majority of residues in the H channel do not undergo large conformational fluctuations. Its upper and middle regions have adequate hydration and H-bonding residues to form potential proton-conducting channels, and Asp51 exhibits conformational fluctuations that have been observed crystallographically. In contrast, throughout the simulations, we do not observe transient water networks that could support proton transfer from the N phase toward heme a via neutral His413, regardless of a labile H bond between Ser382 and the hydroxyethylfarnesyl group of heme a. In fact, the region around His413 only became sufficiently hydrated when His413 was fixed in its protonated imidazolium state, but its calculated pKa is too low for this to provide the means to create a proton transfer pathway. Our simulations show that the electric dipole moment of residues around heme a changes with the redox state, hence suggesting that the H channel could play a more general role as a dielectric well.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cell respiration", "Dielectric well", "Electron transfer", "Protein hydration", "Proton pumping"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Biological Transport, Active", "Cattle", "Electromagnetic Phenomena", "Electron Transport", "Electron Transport Complex IV", "Heme", "Ion Transport", "Mitochondria", "Molecular Dynamics Simulation", "Protons", "Water"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85035779181", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"57199918682": {"Name": "Sharma V.", "AuthorID": "57199918682", "AffiliationID": "60022076, 60002952", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Biotechnology, University of Helsinki"}, "6602199096": {"Name": "Kaukonen M.", "AuthorID": "6602199096", "AffiliationID": "60002952", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of Helsinki"}, "26022381300": {"Name": "Jambrina P.G.", "AuthorID": "26022381300", "AffiliationID": "60026796", "AffiliationName": "Departamento de Qu\u00edmica F\u00edsica Aplicada, Facultad de Ciencias, Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Madrid"}, "8556311000": {"Name": "Rosta E.", "AuthorID": "8556311000", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, King\u2019s College London"}, "7102577604": {"Name": "Rich P.R.", "AuthorID": "7102577604", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London"}}}
