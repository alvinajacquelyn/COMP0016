However, the precise contributions of the medial septum's cholinergic neurones to these functions remain unknown. Here, we recorded neuronal firing and local field potentials from the medial entorhinal cortex of freely foraging mice, while modulating the excitability of medial septal cholinergic neurones. Alteration of cholinergic activity produced a reduction in the frequency of theta oscillations, without affecting the slope of the non-linear theta frequency vs running speed relationship observed. Modifying septal cholinergic tone in this way also led mice to exhibit behaviours associated with novelty or anxiety. However, grid cell firing patterns were unaffected, concordant with an absence of change in the slopes of the theta frequency and firing rate speed signals thought to be used by grid cells.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Action Potentials", "Animals", "Cholinergic Neurons", "Entorhinal Cortex", "Grid Cells", "Hippocampus", "Mice", "Septal Nuclei", "Theta Rhythm"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85032916395", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"56601199100": {"Name": "Carpenter F.", "AuthorID": "56601199100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, UCL"}, "23767252700": {"Name": "Burgess N.", "AuthorID": "23767252700", "AffiliationID": "60109771, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, UCL"}, "13405610800": {"Name": "Barry C.", "AuthorID": "13405610800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, UCL"}}}
