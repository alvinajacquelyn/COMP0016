Separate experiments were also carried out for three different sized sub-ranges of large aggregates (0.540\u20131.125 mm; 1.125\u20131.750 mm; 1.750\u20132.375 mm). Digital images were taken at a frequency of 10 Hz for 10 s for each different pairs of gradients of velocity (Gf) of 20 and 60 s\u2212 1 and flocculation times of 2; 3; 4; 5; 10; 20; 30; 60; 120 and 180 min. For the same conditions, particle size distribution (PSD) was also determined. Under the investigated conditions, the lowest Gf produced the greatest Df (1.69) at a flocculation time of 30 min for the whole range of aggregates. Also, the evolution of the longest length of aggregate (l) and Df with time, showed that the dynamic steady-state was reached at different times for each shear rate and l ranges. However, Df varied for each size sub-range (ca. 1.1 to 1.8). Finally, the behavior of the aggregate structure may be understood by the predominance of different aggregation mechanisms such as cluster-cluster for Gf of 60 s\u2212 1 and particle-cluster for Gf of 20 s\u2212 1.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Aggregates", "Flocculation", "Fractal dimension", "Shear rate"], "IndexKeywords": ["Acquisition systems", "Aggregate structures", "Aggregation mechanism", "Digital image", "Large aggregates", "Non-intrusive", "Particle clusters", "Shear flocculation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85026476600", "SubjectAreas": [["Environmental Engineering", "ENVI", "2305"], ["Environmental Chemistry", "ENVI", "2304"], ["Waste Management and Disposal", "ENVI", "2311"], ["Pollution", "ENVI", "2310"]], "AuthorData": {"23134988000": {"Name": "Moruzzi R.", "AuthorID": "23134988000", "AffiliationID": "60006028", "AffiliationName": "Universidade Estadual Paulista (UNESP), Instituto de Geoci\u00eancias e Ci\u00eancias Exatas"}, "56835042600": {"Name": "de Oliveira A.", "AuthorID": "56835042600", "AffiliationID": "60006028", "AffiliationName": "Universidade Estadual Paulista (UNESP), Instituto de Geoci\u00eancias e Ci\u00eancias Exatas"}, "14071095600": {"Name": "da Concei\u00e7\u00e3o F.", "AuthorID": "14071095600", "AffiliationID": "60006028", "AffiliationName": "Universidade Estadual Paulista (UNESP), Instituto de Geoci\u00eancias e Ci\u00eancias Exatas"}, "7402520277": {"Name": "Gregory J.", "AuthorID": "7402520277", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil, Environmental and Geomatic Engineering, University College London"}, "14043273200": {"Name": "Campos L.", "AuthorID": "14043273200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil, Environmental and Geomatic Engineering, University College London"}}}
