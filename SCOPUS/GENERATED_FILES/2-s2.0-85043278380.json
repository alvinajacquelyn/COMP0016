All rights reserved.Hydrogen could be a key alternative energy carrier to electricity and natural gas in future low-carbon economies but only if it can be produced sustainability. This article reviews a range of key hydrogen production technologies, including reforming, gasification, electrolysis, and several technologies at the laboratory stage. The development of production facilities with carbon capture and storage is identified as a key requirement to produce low-carbon, low-cost hydrogen. The development of a credible green hydrogen standard is needed to demonstrate that hydrogen produced in the future is sufficiently sustainable.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Biomass gasification", "Carbon capture and storage (CCS)", "Chlor-alkali", "Coal gasification", "Electrolysis", "Green hydrogen", "Hydrogen", "Steam methane reforming (SMR)", "Sustainable"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85043278380", "SubjectAreas": [["Environmental Science (all)", "ENVI", "2300"]], "AuthorData": {"56926717100": {"Name": "Velazquez Abad A.", "AuthorID": "56926717100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Sustainable Resources"}, "55224736800": {"Name": "Dodds P.", "AuthorID": "55224736800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Sustainable Resources"}}}
