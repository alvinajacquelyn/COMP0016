All rights reserved.Participants in dialogue often use clause fragments, such as At Camberwell or A cheap bottle, which are structurally incomplete but in fact make complete contributions to the discourse. Their interpretation depends on their links to other structures in the context. The hypothesis that will be explored in this chapter is that just a few different kinds of grammatical link are exploited recurrently to serve a wide range of discourse purposes. Based on systematic analysis of a set of data drawn from the dialogues in the ICE-GB corpus, we argue that two frequent grammatical sub-types can be distinguished, which we label 'extensions' and 'matches'. Extensions are interpretable as added constituents of antecedent structures in context, while matches are interpretable as alternative constituents of antecedent structures. These antecedents may be uttered by either the same speaker or another speaker. We show how fragments fulfil a wide range of discourse functions and contribute to discourse cohesion. Our study also provides evidence against what we call the 'strict ellipsis' account of clause fragments, which claims that the 'missing' material can be recovered directly from the preceding context. We use authentic corpus examples, rarely considered in ellipsis debates, to show that such an account is untenable.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Clause fragments", "Dialogue", "Ellipsis", "Fragments", "Non-sentential utterances", "Spoken discourse", "Theticals"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85014219304", "SubjectAreas": [["Arts and Humanities (all)", "ARTS", "1200"], ["Social Sciences (all)", "SOCI", "3300"]], "AuthorData": {"56572230000": {"Name": "Bowie J.", "AuthorID": "56572230000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "8776604500": {"Name": "Aarts B.", "AuthorID": "8776604500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
