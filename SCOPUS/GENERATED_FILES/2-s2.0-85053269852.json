Psycho-Oncology Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.Objective: According to the precaution adoption process model, cervical screening nonparticipants represent a heterogeneous group including those who are unaware of, unengaged with, or undecided about screening, as well as intenders and decliners. We aimed to explore beliefs about cervical screening among these different types of nonparticipant. Methods: Semistructured interviews were carried out with women aged 26 to 65 years living in Britain (n = 29). Women were purposively sampled to represent different nonparticipant types. Interviews were transcribed verbatim, and data were analysed thematically using framework analysis. Results: The salience of some barriers to screening varied between different types of nonparticipant. Bad experiences were prominent in the discussions of women who had decided not to attend, while practical barriers were more prominent among intenders. There was also some overlap between nonparticipant types. For example, many of the undecided women described not wanting to go for screening, but with less certainty than decliners. Some intenders (particularly those who had not been screened before) described not really wanting to attend but feeling they ought to. Women's views on the invitation/reminder process also varied; intenders and maintainers appreciated written reminders and general practitioner (GP) prompts but decliners sometimes perceived these as \u201cbadgering.\u201d Throughout the interviews, women described changing views on screening in the wider context of ageing and motherhood. Conclusions: The salience of screening barriers varies by nonparticipant type, offering possibilities for tailored interventions. However, the fluidity of women's stage of screening adoption might have implications for this approach to intervention design.", "AuthorKeywords": ["beliefs", "cancer", "cervical screening", "decision-making", "oncology", "PAPM", "precaution adoption process model", "qualitative", "tailored", "theory"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Comprehension", "Decision Making", "Early Detection of Cancer", "Female", "Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice", "Humans", "Mass Screening", "Middle Aged", "Patient Compliance", "Patient Participation", "Qualitative Research", "Uterine Cervical Neoplasms", "Vaginal Smears"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85053269852", "SubjectAreas": [["Experimental and Cognitive Psychology", "PSYC", "3205"], ["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"6508131110": {"Name": "Marlow L.", "AuthorID": "6508131110", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Communication and Screening Group, Research Department of Behavioural Science and Health, University College London"}, "57188823974": {"Name": "Chorley A.", "AuthorID": "57188823974", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Communication and Screening Group, Research Department of Behavioural Science and Health, University College London"}, "57190858490": {"Name": "Rockliffe L.", "AuthorID": "57190858490", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Communication and Screening Group, Research Department of Behavioural Science and Health, University College London"}, "57191898211": {"Name": "Waller J.", "AuthorID": "57191898211", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Communication and Screening Group, Research Department of Behavioural Science and Health, University College London"}}}
