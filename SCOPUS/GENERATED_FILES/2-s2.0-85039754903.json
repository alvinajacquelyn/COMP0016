There are high associated societal costs. Aims: A detailed analysis of health economic costs in the United Kingdom in a group manifesting a severe form of TRD in the 12 months before their participation in a major randomized controlled treatment trial. Methods: The sample consisted of 118 participants from the Tavistock Adult Depression Study. Recruitment was from primary care on the basis of current major depression disorder of at least 2 years\u2019 duration and two failed treatment attempts. Service utilization was assessed based on self-report and general practitioner (GP) medical records. Generalized linear models were used to identify predictors of cost. Results: All participants used GP services. Use of other doctors and practice nurses was also high. The mean total societal cost was \u00a322 124, 80% of which was due to lost work and care required of families. Level of general functioning was found to be the most consistent predictor of costs. Conclusions: Severe forms of TRD are associated with high costs in which unpaid care and lost work predominate. Treatments that improve functioning may reduce the large degree of burden.", "AuthorKeywords": ["burden", "cost economic analysis", "Treatment-resistant depression"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Depressive Disorder, Treatment-Resistant", "Female", "Health Care Costs", "Humans", "Male", "Mental Health Services", "Middle Aged", "Referral and Consultation", "Specialization", "United Kingdom", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85039754903", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"7003937597": {"Name": "McCrone P.", "AuthorID": "7003937597", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Health Services and Population Research Department, King\u2019s Health Economics, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King\u2019s College London"}, "55616828900": {"Name": "Koeser L.", "AuthorID": "55616828900", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Health Services and Population Research Department, King\u2019s Health Economics, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King\u2019s College London"}, "55246069500": {"Name": "Rost F.", "AuthorID": "55246069500", "AffiliationID": "60020150", "AffiliationName": "Portman Clinic, Tavistock and Portman NHS Foundation Trust"}, "55927032000": {"Name": "Koutoufa I.", "AuthorID": "55927032000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London"}, "7004981532": {"Name": "Fonagy P.", "AuthorID": "7004981532", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London"}, "57200108722": {"Name": "Stephanou S.", "AuthorID": "57200108722", "AffiliationID": "60020150", "AffiliationName": "Tavistock Clinic, Tavistock and Portman NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57194562739": {"Name": "Taylor D.", "AuthorID": "57194562739", "AffiliationID": "60020150", "AffiliationName": "Tavistock Clinic, Tavistock and Portman NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7202388606": {"Name": "Knapp M.", "AuthorID": "7202388606", "AffiliationID": "60003059", "AffiliationName": "Personal Social Services Research Unit, London School of Economics and Political Science"}, "56883772900": {"Name": "Goldberg D.", "AuthorID": "56883772900", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King\u2019s College London"}}}
