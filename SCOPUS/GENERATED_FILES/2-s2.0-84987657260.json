All rights reserved.Objective Pediatric traumatic brain injury is the most common cause of death and a major cause of morbidity in children and young adults worldwide. Despite this, our understanding of epidemiological factors relating to this type of injury is incomplete. The objective of this study was to explore a variety of factors relating to these injuries including mechanism, timing of emergency response, prehospital management, radiological diagnosis, neurosurgical care, and final outcomes. Methods A retrospective review of all pediatric traumas attending a single large, densely populated urban area within a 2-year period was undertaken, and all cases with significant pediatric traumatic brain injury, as defined by a computed tomography scan showing an intracranial injury, were included for further analysis. Various epidemiological and treatment factors were explored. Results One hundred sixteen patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria, and their injuries and management were explored further. A variety of key trends were identified. The most common mechanism of injury was pedestrian struck by car followed by falls from height. Males were injured 5 times more frequently than girls. A helicopter emergency trauma team attended 22% of the patients and intubated 11 in total. The most common intracranial injuries were skull fractures followed by contusions. Nineteen neurosurgical interventions were undertaken. Overall mortality in all patients was 8%. Conclusions An improved understanding of the epidemiology of pediatric brain injury will provide baselines for future outcome measurement and comparative analysis. This may improve service organization and delivery.", "AuthorKeywords": ["brain injury", "epidemiology", "prehospital", "Trauma"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Air Ambulances", "Brain Injuries, Traumatic", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Female", "Humans", "Infant", "Male", "Retrospective Studies", "United Kingdom", "Urban Population"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84987657260", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Emergency Medicine", "MEDI", "2711"]], "AuthorData": {"16746373000": {"Name": "Hill C.", "AuthorID": "16746373000", "AffiliationID": "60111489", "AffiliationName": "Department of London's Air Ambulance"}, "36993832000": {"Name": "McLean A.", "AuthorID": "36993832000", "AffiliationID": "60010088", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurosurgery, Royal London Hospital"}, "55627877867": {"Name": "Wilson M.", "AuthorID": "55627877867", "AffiliationID": "60022871", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurosurgery, St Mary's Hospital"}}}
