The compiled data are used to derive mathematical correlations based on the Abraham solvation parameter model. The derived expressions describe the experimental solvation enthalpies in acetic acid to within a standard deviation (SD) of 2.2 kJ mol\u22121. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the five equation coefficients from a derived Abraham model correlation shows that acetic acid does not resemble hydroxylic solvents in terms of enthalpic interactions, but is more akin to moderately polar solvents such as ethyl acetate or acetone.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Abraham model correlations", "acetic acid solvent", "Enthalpies of solvation", "solute transfer processes"], "IndexKeywords": ["Abraham model", "Abraham solvation parameter model", "Acid solvents", "Enthalpic interactions", "Equation coefficients", "Mathematical correlation", "Solute transfer", "Standard deviation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84953840183", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"], ["Materials Chemistry", "MATE", "2505"]], "AuthorData": {"56222214400": {"Name": "Hart E.", "AuthorID": "56222214400", "AffiliationID": "60024438", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of North Texas"}, "56538081100": {"Name": "Grover D.", "AuthorID": "56538081100", "AffiliationID": "60024438", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of North Texas"}, "56538213300": {"Name": "Zettl H.", "AuthorID": "56538213300", "AffiliationID": "60024438", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of North Texas"}, "56607210600": {"Name": "Koshevarova V.", "AuthorID": "56607210600", "AffiliationID": "60024438", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of North Texas"}, "35496753700": {"Name": "Acree W.", "AuthorID": "35496753700", "AffiliationID": "60024438", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of North Texas"}, "7202901240": {"Name": "Abraham M.", "AuthorID": "7202901240", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}}}
