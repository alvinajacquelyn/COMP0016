In order to help provide the construction industry with an additional incentive to adopt more automation, an investigation was undertaken to assess the effects of digital fabrication (dfab) on productivity by analyzing the cost and time required for the construction of a robotically-fabricated complex concrete wall onsite. After defining the different tasks for the conventional and robotically fabricated concrete wall, data was collected from different sources and used in a simulation to describe the distribution of time and cost for the different construction scenarios. In the example, it was found that productivity is higher when the robotic construction method is used for complex walls, indicating that it is possible to obtain significant economic benefit from the use of additive dfab to construct complex structures. Further research is required to assess the social impacts of using dfab.", "AuthorKeywords": ["3D printing", "Additive manufacturing", "Construction automation", "Construction industry", "Digital fabrication", "Industrialized construction", "Labor productivity", "Robot system", "Robotic construction"], "IndexKeywords": ["3-D printing", "Construction automation", "Digital fabrication", "Industrialized construction", "Labor productivity", "Robot system", "Robotic construction"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85046347842", "SubjectAreas": [["Control and Systems Engineering", "ENGI", "2207"], ["Civil and Structural Engineering", "ENGI", "2205"], ["Building and Construction", "ENGI", "2215"]], "AuthorData": {"57219474603": {"Name": "Garc\u00eda de Soto B.", "AuthorID": "57219474603", "AffiliationID": "60108318, 60021784", "AffiliationName": "New York University (NYU), Tandon School of Engineering"}, "56204634800": {"Name": "Agust\u00ed-Juan I.", "AuthorID": "56204634800", "AffiliationID": "60025858", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Construction and Infrastructure Management, ETH Zurich"}, "8391064400": {"Name": "Habert G.", "AuthorID": "8391064400", "AffiliationID": "60025858", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Construction and Infrastructure Management, ETH Zurich"}, "6602448661": {"Name": "Adey B.T.", "AuthorID": "6602448661", "AffiliationID": "60025858", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Construction and Infrastructure Management, ETH Zurich"}, "57217925661": {"Name": "Hunhevicz J.", "AuthorID": "57217925661", "AffiliationID": "60025858", "AffiliationName": "ETH Zurich, NCCR Digital Fabrication"}, "57201885481": {"Name": "Joss S.", "AuthorID": "57201885481", "AffiliationID": "60025858", "AffiliationName": "ETH Zurich, NCCR Digital Fabrication"}, "57193861254": {"Name": "Graser K.", "AuthorID": "57193861254", "AffiliationID": "60025858", "AffiliationName": "ETH Zurich, NCCR Digital Fabrication"}}}
