This study examined feasibility and acceptability, and provided an indication of behavioural impact, of a telephone-based, multimodal health behaviour intervention for CRC survivors. Method: Participants were recruited from five London hospitals. Patients (. n=29) who had recently completed treatment for CRC participated in a 12week intervention. Behavioural goals were to increase physical activity (PA) and fruit and vegetable (F&V) intake, and reduce consumption of red/processed meat and alcohol. Self-report measures of PA and diet were completed in all patients, supplemented by objective measures in a sub-set. Results: Uptake of the study when patients were approached by a researcher was high (72%), compared with 27% contacted by letter. Methods for identifying eligible patients were not optimal. Study completion rate was high (79%), and completers evaluated the intervention favourably. Significant improvements were observed in objectively-measured activity (+70min/week; p=.004). Gains were seen in diet:+3F&V portions a day (. p<.001),-147g of red meat a week (. p=.013),-0.83 portions of processed meat a week (. p=.002). Changes in serum vitamin levels were not statistically significant, but the small sample size provides limited power. Clinically meaningful improvement in quality of life (. p<.001) was observed. Conclusion: An intervention combining print materials and telephone consultations was feasible and acceptable, and associated with improvements in PA, diet and quality of life.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cancer survivors", "CRC", "Diet", "F&V", "Intervention", "MID", "MVPA", "PA", "Physical activity", "Quality of life", "SES"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Colorectal Neoplasms", "Diet", "Exercise", "Feasibility Studies", "Female", "Health Behavior", "Humans", "Life Style", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Patient Acceptance of Health Care", "Quality of Life", "Self Report", "Telephone"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84922843021", "SubjectAreas": [["Oncology (nursing)", "NURS", "2917"]], "AuthorData": {"24780619300": {"Name": "Grimmett C.", "AuthorID": "24780619300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Health Behaviour Research Centre, Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "8311204100": {"Name": "Simon A.", "AuthorID": "8311204100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Health Behaviour Research Centre, Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "57190868199": {"Name": "Lawson V.", "AuthorID": "57190868199", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Health Behaviour Research Centre, Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "7102146930": {"Name": "Wardle J.", "AuthorID": "7102146930", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Health Behaviour Research Centre, Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}}}
