All rights reserved.This paper considers for the first time whether there is school-type homogamy, and whether for women there are significant advantages from private schooling as a consequence of school-type homogamy. Its focus is Britain, where a private education is associated with substantial labour market advantages and where access is socially exclusive. We find that privately educated women are 7 percentage points more likely than observably similar state-educated women to marry privately educated men. Privately educated married women have husbands who earn 15% higher pay, according to the BHPS-UKHLS panel (20% at age 42, according to the British Cohort Study). Causation is not established and considerable caution would be needed if interpreting these associations as reflecting causal effects from private schools. The findings nevertheless raise anew the issue of the negative association between Britain\u2019s private schooling and social mobility.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Homogamy", "Marriage", "Pay", "Private school", "Social mobility"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85061831931", "SubjectAreas": [["Life-span and Life-course Studies", "SOCI", "3319"]], "AuthorData": {"35467454700": {"Name": "Green F.", "AuthorID": "35467454700", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Education"}, "55962784400": {"Name": "Henseke G.", "AuthorID": "55962784400", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Education"}, "57210814494": {"Name": "Parsons S.", "AuthorID": "57210814494", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Education"}, "56467722000": {"Name": "Sullivan A.", "AuthorID": "56467722000", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Education"}, "35821633600": {"Name": "Wiggins R.", "AuthorID": "35821633600", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Education"}}}
