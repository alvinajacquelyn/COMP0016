All rights reserved.The efficient certification of classically intractable quantum devices has been a central research question for some time. However, to observe a andquot;quantum advantageandquot;, it is believed that one does not need to build a large scale universal quantum computer, a task which has proven extremely challenging. Intermediate quantum models that are easier to implement, but which also exhibit this quantum advantage over classical computers, have been proposed. In this work, we present a certification technique for such a sub-universal quantum server which only performs commuting gates and requires very limited quantum memory. By allowing a verifying client to manipulate single qubits, we exploit properties of measurement based blind quantum computing to give them the tools to test the andquot;quantum superiorityandquot; of the server.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Hypothesis tests", "Information-theoretically secure", "Measurement-based", "Quantum Computing", "Quantum device", "Quantum memory", "Quantum models", "Research questions"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85048415440", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"]], "AuthorData": {"57202452696": {"Name": "Mills D.", "AuthorID": "57202452696", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "School of Informatics, University of Edinburgh"}, "54387248300": {"Name": "Pappa A.", "AuthorID": "54387248300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University College London"}, "48861585900": {"Name": "Kapourniotis T.", "AuthorID": "48861585900", "AffiliationID": "60022020", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of Warwick"}, "14048229900": {"Name": "Kashefi E.", "AuthorID": "14048229900", "AffiliationID": "60112307, 60008134, 60001422", "AffiliationName": "LIP6, CNRS, Pierre et Marie Curie University"}}}
