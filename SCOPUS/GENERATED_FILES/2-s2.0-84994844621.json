Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.The tortuosity of a structure plays a vital role in the transport of mass and charge in electrochemical devices. Concentration polarisation losses at high current densities are caused by mass transport limitations and are thus a function of microstructural characteristics. As tortuosity is notoriously difficult to ascertain, a wide and diverse range of methods have been developed to extract the tortuosity of a structure. These methods differ significantly in terms of calculation approach and data preparation techniques. Here, a review of tortuosity calculation procedures applied in the field of electrochemical devices is presented to better understand the resulting values presented in the literature. Visible differences between calculation methods are observed, especially when using porosity\u2013tortuosity relationships and when comparing geometric and flux-based tortuosity calculation approaches.", "AuthorKeywords": ["diffusion", "microstructure", "modelling", "tomography", "Tortuosity"], "IndexKeywords": ["Calculation approaches", "Calculation procedure", "Concentration polarisation", "Electrochemical devices", "High current densities", "Mass transport limitation", "Micro-structural characteristics", "nocv1", "Tortuosity"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84994844621", "SubjectAreas": [["Mechanics of Materials", "ENGI", "2211"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"], ["Metals and Alloys", "MATE", "2506"], ["Materials Chemistry", "MATE", "2505"]], "AuthorData": {"56372219400": {"Name": "Tjaden B.", "AuthorID": "56372219400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electrochemical Innovation Lab, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "13805905800": {"Name": "Brett D.", "AuthorID": "13805905800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electrochemical Innovation Lab, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "24178516700": {"Name": "Shearing P.", "AuthorID": "24178516700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electrochemical Innovation Lab, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}}}
