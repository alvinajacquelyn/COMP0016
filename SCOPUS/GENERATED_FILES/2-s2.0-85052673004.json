It is shown that the difference between the first- and third-order coefficient approximations is a good indicator of optimal base classifier complexity. When combining neural networks, the experimental results on a variety of artificial and real two-class problems demonstrate under what circumstances ensemble performance can be improved. For tuned base classifiers, the first-order coefficients provide performance similar to the majority vote. However, for weak/fast base classifiers, higher order coefficient approximation may give better performance. It is also shown that higher order coefficient approximation is superior to the Adaboost logarithmic weighting rule when boosting weak decision tree base classifiers.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Boolean functions", "boosting", "decision trees (DTs)", "ensemble classifier", "multilayer perceptrons (MLPs)", "pattern analysis", "spectral analysis", "supervised learning"], "IndexKeywords": ["Boosting", "Decision trees (DTs)", "Ensemble classifiers", "Multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs)", "Pattern analysis"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85052673004", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"], ["Artificial Intelligence", "COMP", "1702"]], "AuthorData": {"6603872952": {"Name": "Windeatt T.", "AuthorID": "6603872952", "AffiliationID": "60021097", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Vision, Speech, and Signal Processing, University of Surrey"}, "34871084000": {"Name": "Zor C.", "AuthorID": "34871084000", "AffiliationID": "60021097", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Vision, Speech, and Signal Processing, University of Surrey"}, "56565367100": {"Name": "Camgoz N.", "AuthorID": "56565367100", "AffiliationID": "60021097", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Vision, Speech, and Signal Processing, University of Surrey"}}}
