A two-stage reactor system was used with pyrolysis of the tyres followed by catalytic reaction. There was only a small difference in the total gas yield and hydrogen yield by changing the Al2O3 to SiO2 mole ratios in the Ni-Al2O3/SiO2 catalyst. The 1:1 ratio of Al2O3:SiO2 ratio produced the highest gas yield of 27.3 wt.% and a hydrogen production of 14.0 mmol g-1 tyre. Catalyst coke formation decreased from 19.0 to 13.0 wt.% as the Al2O3:SiO2 ratio was changed from 1:1 to 2:1, with more than 95% of the coke being filamentous-type carbon, a large proportion of which was multi-walled carbon nanotubes. Further experiments introduced steam to the second-stage reactor to investigate hydrogen production for the pyrolysis-catalytic steam reforming of the waste tyres using the 1:1 Al2O3/SiO2 nickel catalyst. The introduction of steam produced a marked increase in total gas yield from ~27 wt. % to ~58 wt.%; in addition, hydrogen production was increased to 34.5 mmol g-1 and there was a reduction in catalyst coke formation to 4.6 wt.%.", "AuthorKeywords": ["carbon nanotubes", "catalyst", "hydrogen", "pyrolysis", "tyres", "Waste"], "IndexKeywords": ["Carbon deposition", "Catalytic pyrolysis", "Catalytic reactions", "Catalytic steam reforming", "Hydrogen yields", "Production of hydrogen", "Two-stage reactors", "tyres", "Aluminum Oxide", "Catalysis", "Hydrogen", "Nanotubes, Carbon", "Silicon Dioxide"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85030099540", "SubjectAreas": [["Environmental Engineering", "ENVI", "2305"], ["Pollution", "ENVI", "2310"]], "AuthorData": {"56662820300": {"Name": "Zhang Y.", "AuthorID": "56662820300", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemical & Process Engineering, University of Leeds"}, "7404956386": {"Name": "Williams P.", "AuthorID": "7404956386", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemical & Process Engineering, University of Leeds"}, "57193524159": {"Name": "Tao Y.", "AuthorID": "57193524159", "AffiliationID": "60025709", "AffiliationName": "Australian Institute for Nanoscale Science and Technology, School of Chemical & Biomolecular Engineering, The University of Sydney"}, "36561736600": {"Name": "Huang J.", "AuthorID": "36561736600", "AffiliationID": "60025709", "AffiliationName": "Australian Institute for Nanoscale Science and Technology, School of Chemical & Biomolecular Engineering, The University of Sydney"}}}
