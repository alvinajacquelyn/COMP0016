The secondary objective was to compare accuracy of implant positioning in conventional jig-based UKA versus robotic-arm assisted UKA. Patients and Methods This prospective single-surgeon cohort study included 60 consecutive conventional jig-based UKAs compared with 60 consecutive robotic-arm assisted UKAs for medial compartment knee osteoarthritis. Patients undergoing conventional UKA and robotic-arm assisted UKA were well-matched for baseline characteristics including a mean age of 65.5 years (SD 6.8) vs 64.1 years (SD 8.7), (p = 0.31); a mean body mass index of 27.2 kg.m2 (SD 2.7) vs 28.1 kg.m2 (SD 4.5), (p = 0.25); and gender (27 males: 33 females vs 26 males: 34 females, p = 0.85). Surrogate measures of the learning curve were prospectively collected. These included operative times, the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) questionnaire to assess preoperative stress levels amongst the surgical team, accuracy of implant positioning, limb alignment, and postoperative complications. Results Robotic-arm assisted UKA was associated with a learning curve of six cases for operating time (p < 0.001) and surgical team confidence levels (p < 0.001). Cumulative robotic experience did not affect accuracy of implant positioning (p = 0.52), posterior condylar offset ratio (p = 0.71), posterior tibial slope (p = 0.68), native joint line preservation (p = 0.55), and postoperative limb alignment (p = 0.65). Robotic-arm assisted UKA improved accuracy of femoral (p < 0.001) and tibial (p < 0.001) implant positioning with no additional risk of postoperative complications compared to conventional jig-based UKA. Conclusion Robotic-arm assisted UKA was associated with a learning curve of six cases for operating time and surgical team confidence levels but no learning curve for accuracy of implant positioning.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Analysis of Variance", "Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee", "Female", "Humans", "Learning Curve", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Occupational Diseases", "Operative Time", "Orthopedic Surgeons", "Osteoarthritis, Knee", "Patient Care Team", "Postoperative Care", "Postoperative Complications", "Prospective Studies", "Prosthesis Fitting", "Robotic Surgical Procedures", "Stress, Psychological"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85051009737", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Orthopedics and Sports Medicine", "MEDI", "2732"]], "AuthorData": {"53979939900": {"Name": "Kayani B.", "AuthorID": "53979939900", "AffiliationID": "60027403", "AffiliationName": "Department of Trauma and Orthopaedics, University College Hospital"}, "24466324900": {"Name": "Konan S.", "AuthorID": "24466324900", "AffiliationID": "60027403", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Research Fellow Department of Trauma and Orthopaedics, University College Hospital, Princess Grace Hospital"}, "56504959400": {"Name": "Pietrzak J.R.T.", "AuthorID": "56504959400", "AffiliationID": "60027403", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Research Fellow Department of Trauma and Orthopaedics, University College Hospital, Princess Grace Hospital"}, "57203242935": {"Name": "Huq S.S.", "AuthorID": "57203242935", "AffiliationID": "60027403", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Research Fellow Department of Trauma and Orthopaedics, University College Hospital, Princess Grace Hospital"}, "55358759300": {"Name": "Tahmassebi J.", "AuthorID": "55358759300", "AffiliationID": "60027403", "AffiliationName": "Department of Trauma and Orthopaedics, University College Hospital"}, "7203033976": {"Name": "Haddad F.S.", "AuthorID": "7203033976", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Orthopaedic Surgery University College London Hospitals, Princess Grace Hospital, NIHR Biomedical Research Centre at UCLH"}}}
