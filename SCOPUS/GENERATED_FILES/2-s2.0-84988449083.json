While the model has been successful in describing SHI damage in metals, it fails to account for the presence of a bandgap in semiconductors and insulators. Here we explore the potential to overcome this limitation by explicitly incorporating the influence of the bandgap in the parameterisation of the electronic specific heat for Si. The specific heat as a function of electronic temperature is calculated using finite temperature density functional theory with three different exchange correlation functionals, each with a characteristic bandgap. These electronic temperature dependent specific heats are employed with two-temperature molecular dynamics to model ion track creation in Si. The results obtained using a specific heat derived from density functional theory showed dramatically reduced defect creation compared to models that used the free electron gas specific heat. As a consequence, the track radii are smaller and in much better agreement with experimental observations. We also observe a correlation between the width of the band gap and the track radius, arising due to the variation in the temperature dependence of the electronic specific heat.", "AuthorKeywords": ["density functional theory", "electronic effects", "molecular dynamics", "radiation damage", "silicon", "swift heavy ions"], "IndexKeywords": ["Electronic effects", "Electronic specific heat", "Electronic temperature", "Exchange-correlation functionals", "Swift heavy ion irradiation", "Swift heavy ion irradiations (SHI)", "Swift heavy ions", "Temperature dependence"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84988449083", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"]], "AuthorData": {"8619673600": {"Name": "Khara G.S.", "AuthorID": "8619673600", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, London Centre for Nanotechnology, University College London"}, "54179728500": {"Name": "Murphy S.T.", "AuthorID": "54179728500", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, London Centre for Nanotechnology, University College London"}, "36678730800": {"Name": "Daraszewicz S.L.", "AuthorID": "36678730800", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, London Centre for Nanotechnology, University College London"}, "7101657971": {"Name": "Duffy D.M.", "AuthorID": "7101657971", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, London Centre for Nanotechnology, University College London"}}}
