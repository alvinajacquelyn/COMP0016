Coated NPs with biocompatible surfactants can be incorporated into the natural metabolic pathway of the body and specifically favor delivery to the targeted cancerous cells versus normal cells. Polyethylene glycol (PEG) is an FDA approved, biocompatible synthetic polymer and PEGylated NPs are regarded as \u201cstealth\u201d nanoparticles, which are not recognized by the immune system. Herein, PEGylated cupric oxide nanoparticles (CuO NPs) with either PEG 1000 or PEG 8000 were hydrothermally prepared upon properly adjusting the reaction conditions. Depending on the reaction time CuO NPs in the range of core sizes 11\u201320 nm were formed, while hydrodynamic sizes substantially varied (330\u20131120 nm) with improved colloidal stability in PBS. The anticancer activity of the NPs was evaluated on human cervical carcinoma HeLa cells by using human immortalized embryonic kidney 293 FT cells as a control. Viability assays (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide, MTT) revealed that CuO NPs could selectively reduce viability of tumor cells (IC50 values 11.91\u201325.78 \u03bcg/mL). Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, cell membrane damage and apoptotic DNA laddering were also evident by nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) reduction, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release assays and DNA electrophoresis, respectively. CuO NPs strongly inhibited lipoxygenase (LOX) enzymatic activity with IC50 values 4\u20135.9 \u03bcg/mL, highlighting in that manner their anti-inflammatory activity.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Anti-inflammatory activity", "Anticancer activity", "Copper oxide nanoparticles"], "IndexKeywords": ["Apoptosis", "Cell Membrane", "Cell Survival", "Copper", "DNA Fragmentation", "HEK293 Cells", "HeLa Cells", "Humans", "L-Lactate Dehydrogenase", "Lipoxygenase", "Nanoparticles", "Polyethylene Glycols"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84994012254", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Inorganic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1604"]], "AuthorData": {"55903000400": {"Name": "Giannousi K.", "AuthorID": "55903000400", "AffiliationID": "60015331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki"}, "6602808703": {"Name": "Dendrinou-Samara C.", "AuthorID": "6602808703", "AffiliationID": "60015331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki"}, "6602969293": {"Name": "Hatzivassiliou E.", "AuthorID": "6602969293", "AffiliationID": "60015066", "AffiliationName": "School of Medicine, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki Medical School"}, "16507083500": {"Name": "Mourdikoudis S.", "AuthorID": "16507083500", "AffiliationID": "60026134", "AffiliationName": "Departamento de Quimica Fisica, Universidade de Vigo"}, "6505880169": {"Name": "Vourlias G.", "AuthorID": "6505880169", "AffiliationID": "60015331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki"}, "6601911470": {"Name": "Pantazaki A.", "AuthorID": "6601911470", "AffiliationID": "60015331", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Biochemistry, Department of Chemistry, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki"}}}
