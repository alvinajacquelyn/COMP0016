The release mechanism involved appears to be a combination of vesicular exocytosis and connexin and pannexin hemichannels. Purinergic receptors on cultured cells mediate both short-term purinergic signalling of secretion and long-term (trophic) signalling such as proliferation, migration, differentiation and apoptosis. We aim in this review to bring to the attention of non-purinergic researchers using tissue culture that the release of ATP in response to mechanical stress evoked by the unavoidable movement of the cells acting on functional purinergic receptors on the culture cells is likely to complicate the interpretation of their data.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Ectonucleotidases", "P1 receptors", "P2 receptors", "Purinoceptor", "Shear stress"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adenosine Triphosphate", "Animals", "Cell Culture Techniques", "Connexins", "Exocytosis", "Humans", "Receptors, Purinergic", "Stress, Mechanical"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85018857515", "SubjectAreas": [["Pathology and Forensic Medicine", "MEDI", "2734"], ["Histology", "MEDI", "2722"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"36037094600": {"Name": "Burnstock G.", "AuthorID": "36037094600", "AffiliationID": "60026553", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics, The University of Melbourne"}, "7203075925": {"Name": "Knight G.", "AuthorID": "7203075925", "AffiliationID": "60029950", "AffiliationName": "Autonomic Neuroscience Centre, Royal Free and University College Medical School"}}}
