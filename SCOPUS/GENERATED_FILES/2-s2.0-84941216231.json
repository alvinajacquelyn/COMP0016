Data Sources: Review of the literature, 2013 ONS Research Priorities Survey, National Institute of Nursing Research, and the National Cancer Institute research foci. Data Synthesis: Multimethod consensus-building approach by content leaders and content experts of the ONS Research Agenda Project Team. Conclusions: The 2014-2018 Research Agenda Project Team identified eight high-priority research areas: symptoms, late effects of cancer treatment and survivorship care, palliative and end-of-life care, self-management, aging, family and caregivers, improving healthcare systems, and risk reduction. In addition, four cross-cutting themes were identified: biomarkers, bioinformatics, comparative effectiveness research, and dissemination and implementation science. Implications for Nursing: The Research Agenda is a synthesis of the state of the science in cancer and identifies gaps and directions for the conduct and dissemination of research. Oncology nurses can use the agenda to inform clinical practice, develop research proposals, inform policy makers, support interdisciplinary research efforts, and promote scientist and clinician collaborations in targeted patient-centered research.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Nursing", "Oncology", "Research"], "IndexKeywords": ["Humans", "Neoplasms", "Nursing Research", "Oncology Nursing", "Research", "Societies, Nursing", "Time Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84941216231", "SubjectAreas": [["Oncology (nursing)", "NURS", "2917"]], "AuthorData": {"6603663157": {"Name": "Knobf M.T.", "AuthorID": "6603663157", "AffiliationID": "60005455", "AffiliationName": "School of Nursing, Yale University"}, "7006649879": {"Name": "McCorkle R.", "AuthorID": "7006649879", "AffiliationID": "60005455", "AffiliationName": "School of Nursing, Yale University"}, "7004535832": {"Name": "Cooley M.E.", "AuthorID": "7004535832", "AffiliationID": "60014334", "AffiliationName": "Dana Farber Cancer Center for Nursing Research"}, "7202066211": {"Name": "Duffy S.", "AuthorID": "7202066211", "AffiliationID": "60003500", "AffiliationName": "College of Nursing, Ohio State University"}, "36087734300": {"Name": "Menon U.", "AuthorID": "36087734300", "AffiliationID": "60003500", "AffiliationName": "College of Nursing, Ohio State University"}, "6603158463": {"Name": "Doorenbos A.", "AuthorID": "6603158463", "AffiliationID": "60015481", "AffiliationName": "School of Nursing, University of Washington"}, "56819833700": {"Name": "Eaton L.", "AuthorID": "56819833700", "AffiliationID": "60025488", "AffiliationName": "College of Nursing, University of Utah"}, "7005636680": {"Name": "Given B.", "AuthorID": "7005636680", "AffiliationID": "60031707", "AffiliationName": "College of Nursing, Michigan State University"}, "55353594900": {"Name": "Hershey D.", "AuthorID": "55353594900", "AffiliationID": "60031707", "AffiliationName": "College of Nursing, Michigan State University"}, "7202304130": {"Name": "Mayer D.K.", "AuthorID": "7202304130", "AffiliationID": "60025111", "AffiliationName": "School of Nursing, University of North Carolina"}, "7005529575": {"Name": "Miaskowski C.", "AuthorID": "7005529575", "AffiliationID": "60023691", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physiological Nursing, University of California"}, "15731098800": {"Name": "Mitchell S.", "AuthorID": "15731098800", "AffiliationID": "60013409", "AffiliationName": "Outcomes Research Branch of the National Cancer Institute"}, "7102607908": {"Name": "Sherwood P.", "AuthorID": "7102607908", "AffiliationID": "60015543", "AffiliationName": "School of Nursing, University of Pittsburgh"}, "7102455564": {"Name": "Bender C.", "AuthorID": "7102455564", "AffiliationID": "60015543", "AffiliationName": "School of Nursing, University of Pittsburgh"}, "55540834500": {"Name": "Cataldo J.", "AuthorID": "55540834500", "AffiliationID": "60023691", "AffiliationName": "School of Nursing, University of California"}, "6507548149": {"Name": "Katapodi M.", "AuthorID": "6507548149", "AffiliationID": "60023588", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Nursing Science, University of Basel"}, "7102807186": {"Name": "Schumacher K.", "AuthorID": "7102807186", "AffiliationID": "60016261", "AffiliationName": "College of Nursing, University of Nebraska Medical Center"}, "21935106600": {"Name": "Sun V.", "AuthorID": "21935106600", "AffiliationID": "60007474", "AffiliationName": "Nursing Education and Research Department, City of Hope National Medical Center"}, "14525766200": {"Name": "Ah D.V.", "AuthorID": "14525766200", "AffiliationID": "60024609", "AffiliationName": "College of Nursing, Indiana University"}, "6602622275": {"Name": "LoBiondo-Wood G.", "AuthorID": "6602622275", "AffiliationID": "60027512", "AffiliationName": "Health Science School of Nursing, University of Texas"}, "7004900780": {"Name": "Mallory G.", "AuthorID": "7004900780", "AffiliationID": "60084771", "AffiliationName": "Oncology Nursing Society"}}}
