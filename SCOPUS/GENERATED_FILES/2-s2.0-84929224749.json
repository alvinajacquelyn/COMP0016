We investigated the effect on learning of providing varying amounts of negative and positive feedback while listeners attempted to discriminate between three identical tones; an impossible task that nevertheless produces robust learning. Four feedback conditions were compared during training: 90% positive feedback or 10% negative feedback informed the participants that they were doing equally well, while 10% positive or 90% negative feedback informed them they were doing equally badly. In all conditions the feedback was random in relation to the listeners' responses (because the task was to discriminate three identical tones), yet both the valence (negative vs. positive) and the probability of feedback (10% vs. 90%) affected learning. Feedback that informed listeners they were doing badly resulted in better post-training performance than feedback that informed them they were doing well, independent of valence. In addition, positive feedback during training resulted in better post-training performance than negative feedback, but only positive feedback indicating listeners were doing badly on the task resulted in learning. As we have previously speculated, feedback that better reflected the difficulty of the task was more effective in driving learning than feedback that suggested performance was better than it should have been given perceived task difficulty. But contrary to expectations, positive feedback was more effective than negative feedback in driving learning. Feedback thus had two separable effects on learning: feedback valence affected motivation on a subjectively difficult task, and learning occurred only when feedback probability reflected the subjective difficulty. To optimize learning, training programs need to take into consideration both feedback valence and probability.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Acoustic Stimulation", "Adolescent", "Adult", "Auditory Perception", "Feedback", "Female", "Formative Feedback", "Humans", "Male", "Motivation", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84929224749", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"8722984000": {"Name": "Amitay S.", "AuthorID": "8722984000", "AffiliationID": "60015879", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council, Institute of Hearing Research"}, "35580993300": {"Name": "Moore D.", "AuthorID": "35580993300", "AffiliationID": "60030440", "AffiliationName": "Communication Sciences Research Center, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center"}, "55216487700": {"Name": "Molloy K.", "AuthorID": "55216487700", "AffiliationID": "60109771, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, University College London"}, "57210661508": {"Name": "Halliday L.", "AuthorID": "57210661508", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Developmental Science, Division of Psychology and Language Sciences, University College London"}}}
