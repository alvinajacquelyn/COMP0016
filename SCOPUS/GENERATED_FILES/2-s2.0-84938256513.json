The present study used a cross-informant approach to examine parent-child and marital relationships as potential mediators of links between parents' gendered attitudes and behaviours and sibling relationship quality. One hundred and twenty-four families with older (M=7.4years) and younger (M=5.2years) siblings were assessed. Parents reported on division of household labour, gender-role attitudes and marital satisfaction. Each child reported on sibling relationship quality and parental warmth and hostility. Results revealed a link between more egalitarian division of household labour and more positive sibling relationship quality. Furthermore, this association was not mediated by the marital nor parent-child relationship. We conclude that families with a more egalitarian division of household labour may model positive interactions for siblings.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Division of household labour", "Gender", "Marital satisfaction", "Middle childhood", "Parenting", "Sibling relationship"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84938256513", "SubjectAreas": [["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"]], "AuthorData": {"56742747200": {"Name": "Dawson A.", "AuthorID": "56742747200", "AffiliationID": "60116105", "AffiliationName": "NFER"}, "7006285069": {"Name": "Pike A.", "AuthorID": "7006285069", "AffiliationID": "60017317", "AffiliationName": "University of Sussex"}, "57203470789": {"Name": "Bird L.", "AuthorID": "57203470789", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
