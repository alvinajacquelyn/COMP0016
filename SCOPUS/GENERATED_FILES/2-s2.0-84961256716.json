HIV is no longer a death sentence with early diagnosis and effective treatment contributing to a good prognosis. Despite the availability of both venipuncture diagnostic and rapid saliva/finger prick screening tests for HIV infection, 25% of people living with HIV in the United Kingdom are undiagnosed and remain at risk of transmitting their infection if having unprotected sex. This paper highlights the international evidence that supports dentists' willingness to conduct HIV screening and dental patient acceptance, and explores whether this is an opportunity or a step too far.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Dental Care", "HIV Infections", "Humans", "Mass Screening", "Professional Role", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84961256716", "SubjectAreas": [["Dentistry (all)", "DENT", "3500"]], "AuthorData": {"55504831900": {"Name": "Santella A.J.", "AuthorID": "55504831900", "AffiliationID": "60029304", "AffiliationName": "Hofstra University, Department of Health Professions"}, "8224968500": {"Name": "Conway D.I.", "AuthorID": "8224968500", "AffiliationID": "60001490, 60019759", "AffiliationName": "University of Glasgow, Dental School"}, "7102907522": {"Name": "Watt R.G.", "AuthorID": "7102907522", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Department of Epidemiology and Public Health"}}}
