These can produce idiomatic sentences from a probabilistic model of the musical language and thus offer explanations of the musical structures they model. This chapter surveys historical and current work in musical analysis using grammars, based on computational linguistic approaches. We outline the theory of probabilistic grammars and illustrate their implementation in Prolog using PRISM. Our experiments on learning the probabilities for simple grammarsfrom pitch sequences in two kinds of symbolic musical corpora are summarized. The results support our claim the probabilistic grammars are a promising framework for computational music analysis, but also indicate that further work is required to establish their superiority over Markov models.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Further works", "Markov model", "Music analysis", "Musical analysis", "Musical structures", "Probabilistic grammars", "Probabilistic modeling", "Probabilistic models"], "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84956821521", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (miscellaneous)", "MEDI", "2701"]], "AuthorData": {"11540522000": {"Name": "Abdallah S.", "AuthorID": "11540522000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "7004798617": {"Name": "Gold N.", "AuthorID": "7004798617", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "15054644600": {"Name": "Marsden A.", "AuthorID": "15054644600", "AffiliationID": "60117606, 60023643", "AffiliationName": "Lancaster Institute for the Contemporary Arts, Lancaster University"}}}
