All rights reserved.Amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA), thought to reflect immune responses to vascular amyloid, have been detected in several amyloid-modifying therapy trials for Alzheimer's disease (AD). We report a case of ARIA developing spontaneously during the course of Presenilin 1 (PSEN1)-associated familial AD (FAD), in an APOE4 homozygous patient. Severe cerebral amyloid angiopathy with associated inflammation was subsequently found at autopsy. Recognition that ARIA may arise spontaneously during FAD and of the potential risk factors for its development are important observations given the recent launch of amyloid-modifying therapy trials for FAD.", "AuthorKeywords": ["APOE", "Cerebral amyloid angiopathy-related inflammation", "Familial Alzheimer's disease", "Magnetic resonance imaging", "Presenilin 1"], "IndexKeywords": ["Alzheimer Disease", "Apolipoprotein E4", "Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy", "Cognition Disorders", "Female", "Humans", "Inflammation", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Middle Aged", "Presenilin-1"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84937044153", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Clinical Psychology", "PSYC", "3203"], ["Geriatrics and Gerontology", "MEDI", "2717"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"33467902600": {"Name": "Ryan N.S.", "AuthorID": "33467902600", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Dementia Research Centre, Department of Neurodegenerative Diseases, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "7201444328": {"Name": "Fox N.C.", "AuthorID": "7201444328", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Dementia Research Centre, Department of Neurodegenerative Diseases, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "6602721075": {"Name": "Lashley T.", "AuthorID": "6602721075", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Queen Square Brain Bank, Department of Molecular Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "7102381695": {"Name": "Revesz T.", "AuthorID": "7102381695", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Queen Square Brain Bank, Department of Molecular Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "56955382200": {"Name": "Dantu K.", "AuthorID": "56955382200", "AffiliationID": "60189512", "AffiliationName": "Department of Old Age Psychiatry, Ysbyty Ystrad Fawr Hospital"}, "7401534782": {"Name": "Morris H.R.", "AuthorID": "7401534782", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology"}}}
