Theory and Methods: At very short echo time, the phase measured with each coil of an array approximates to the phase offset to which the image from that coil is subject. Subtracting this information from the phase of the scan of interest matches the phases from the coils, allowing them to be combined. The effectiveness of this approach is quantified in the brain, calf and breast with coils of diverse designs. Results: The quality of phase matching between coil elements was close to 100% with all coils assessed even in regions of low signal. This method of phase combination was similar in effectiveness to the Roemer method (which needs a reference coil) and was superior to the rival reference-coil-free approaches tested. Conclusion: The proposed approach\u2014COMbining Phase data using a Short Echo-time Reference scan (COMPOSER)\u2014is a simple and effective approach to reconstructing phase images from multichannel coils. It requires little additional scan time, is compatible with parallel imaging and is applicable to all coils, independent of configuration.
