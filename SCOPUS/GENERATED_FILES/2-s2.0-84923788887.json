Most mutations generate a cysteine at the transmembrane domain leading to receptor homodimerization through disulfide bond formation and ligand-independent activation of STAT5. We hypothesized that the reducing agent N-acetylcysteine (NAC), a well-tolerated drug used widely in clinical practice to treat acetaminophen overdose, would reduce disulfide bond formation, and inhibit mutant IL7R-mediated oncogenic signalling. We found that treatment with NAC disrupted IL7R homodimerization in IL7R-mutant DND-41 cells as assessed by non-reducing Western blot, as well as in a luciferase complementation assay. NAC led to STAT5 dephosphorylation and cell apoptosis at clinically achievable concentrations in DND-41 cells, and Ba/F3 cells transformed by an IL7R-mutant construct containing a cysteine insertion. The apoptotic effects of NAC could be rescued in part by a constitutively active allele of STAT5. Despite using doses lower than those tolerated in humans, NAC treatment significantly inhibited the progression of human DND-41 cells engrafted in immunodeficient mice. Thus, targeting leukaemogenic IL7R homodimerization with NAC offers a potentially effective and feasible therapeutic strategy that warrants testing in patients with T-ALL.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Acute leukaemia", "T-cell lymphoma", "Therapy"], "IndexKeywords": ["Acetylcysteine", "Animals", "Apoptosis", "Female", "Heterografts", "Humans", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred NOD", "Mice, SCID", "Mutation", "Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma", "Receptors, Laminin", "Ribosomal Proteins", "Signal Transduction"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84923788887", "SubjectAreas": [["Hematology", "MEDI", "2720"]], "AuthorData": {"16646833400": {"Name": "Mansour M.", "AuthorID": "16646833400", "AffiliationID": "60109234, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, UCL Cancer Institute, University College London"}, "55242141900": {"Name": "Reed C.", "AuthorID": "55242141900", "AffiliationID": "60002746, 60014334", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School"}, "56531526600": {"Name": "Eisenberg A.", "AuthorID": "56531526600", "AffiliationID": "60009343", "AffiliationName": "Molecular Pharmacology and Chemistry Program, Sloan-Kettering Institute, Department of Pediatrics, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center"}, "6603347471": {"Name": "Berezovskaya A.", "AuthorID": "6603347471", "AffiliationID": "60002746, 60014334", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School"}, "56255992700": {"Name": "Deangelo D.", "AuthorID": "56255992700", "AffiliationID": "60002746, 60014334", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School"}, "7005357420": {"Name": "Sallan S.", "AuthorID": "7005357420", "AffiliationID": "60002746, 60014334", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School"}, "6603086314": {"Name": "Kentsis A.", "AuthorID": "6603086314", "AffiliationID": "60009343", "AffiliationName": "Molecular Pharmacology and Chemistry Program, Sloan-Kettering Institute, Department of Pediatrics, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center"}, "7102132660": {"Name": "Look A.", "AuthorID": "7102132660", "AffiliationID": "60030521", "AffiliationName": "Division of Hematology/Oncology, Children's Hospital"}, "7102232513": {"Name": "Tseng J.", "AuthorID": "7102232513", "AffiliationID": "60002746, 60014334", "AffiliationName": "Lurie Family Imaging Center, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School"}, "6508275704": {"Name": "Twizere J.", "AuthorID": "6508275704", "AffiliationID": "60000964", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Protein Signalling and Interactions, Interdisciplinary Cluster for Applied Genoproteomics (GIGA-R), University of Li\u00e8ge"}, "55144181400": {"Name": "Daakour S.", "AuthorID": "55144181400", "AffiliationID": "60000964", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Protein Signalling and Interactions, Interdisciplinary Cluster for Applied Genoproteomics (GIGA-R), University of Li\u00e8ge"}, "36784674400": {"Name": "Yoda A.", "AuthorID": "36784674400", "AffiliationID": "60002746, 60014334", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School"}, "35508182100": {"Name": "Weinstock D.", "AuthorID": "35508182100", "AffiliationID": "60002746, 60014334", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School"}, "35600877200": {"Name": "Rodig S.", "AuthorID": "35600877200", "AffiliationID": "60016782, 60002746", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School"}, "15924580900": {"Name": "Tal N.", "AuthorID": "15924580900", "AffiliationID": "60005037, 60011766", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Research Centre, Sheba Medical Centre, Tel Hashomer and Tel Aviv University Medical School"}, "23989473200": {"Name": "Shochat C.", "AuthorID": "23989473200", "AffiliationID": "115028245", "AffiliationName": "Migal-Galilee Bio-Technology Centre and Tel Hai Academic College"}, "26643118300": {"Name": "Izraeli S.", "AuthorID": "26643118300", "AffiliationID": "60005037, 60011766", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Research Centre, Sheba Medical Centre, Tel Hashomer and Tel Aviv University Medical School"}, "26642922400": {"Name": "Kung A.", "AuthorID": "26642922400", "AffiliationID": "60030162", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University"}}}
