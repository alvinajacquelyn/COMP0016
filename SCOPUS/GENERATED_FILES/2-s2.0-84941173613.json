Object recognition, however, relies on distinct mid-level processes of perceptual organization that are only implicitly tested in classical tests. Furthermore, the psychometric properties of the existing instruments are limited. To fill this gap, the Leuven perceptual organization screening test (L-POST) was developed, in which a wide range of mid-level phenomena are measured in 15 subtests. In this study, we evaluated reliability and validity of the L-POST. Performance on the test is evaluated relative to a norm sample of more than 1,500 healthy control participants. Cronbach's alpha of the norm sample and test-retest correlations for 20 patients provide evidence for adequate reliability of L-POST performance. The convergent and discriminant validity of the test was assessed in 40 brain-damaged patients, whose performance on the L-POST was compared with standard clinical tests of visual perception and other measures of cognitive function. The L-POST showed high sensitivity to visual dysfunction and decreased performance was specific to visual problems. In conclusion, the L-POST is a reliable and valid screening test for perceptual organization. It offers a useful online tool for researchers and clinicians to get a broader overview of the mid-level processes that are preserved or disrupted in a given patient.", "AuthorKeywords": ["brain damage", "confirmatory factor analysis", "convergent and discriminant validity", "gestalts", "mid-level vision", "neuropsychology", "perception", "perceptual organization", "reliability", "screening test"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Cognition", "Discrimination (Psychology)", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Neuropsychological Tests", "Psychometrics", "Recognition (Psychology)", "Reference Values", "Reproducibility of Results", "Visual Perception", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84941173613", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuropsychology and Physiological Psychology", "PSYC", "3206"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"], ["Behavioral Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2802"]], "AuthorData": {"36465603500": {"Name": "Vancleef K.", "AuthorID": "36465603500", "AffiliationID": "60025063", "AffiliationName": "Department of Experimental Psychology, University of Leuven"}, "56276558200": {"Name": "Acke E.", "AuthorID": "56276558200", "AffiliationID": "60025063", "AffiliationName": "Department of Experimental Psychology, University of Leuven"}, "7006148651": {"Name": "Wagemans J.", "AuthorID": "7006148651", "AffiliationID": "60025063", "AffiliationName": "Department of Experimental Psychology, University of Leuven"}, "22984662400": {"Name": "De-Wit L.", "AuthorID": "22984662400", "AffiliationID": "60025063", "AffiliationName": "Department of Experimental Psychology, University of Leuven"}, "25422820600": {"Name": "Torfs K.", "AuthorID": "25422820600", "AffiliationID": "60000874", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neuroscience, University of Louvain"}, "22978827300": {"Name": "Demeyere N.", "AuthorID": "22978827300", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Experimental Psychology, University of Oxford"}, "56409494400": {"Name": "Humphreys G.", "AuthorID": "56409494400", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Experimental Psychology, University of Oxford"}, "6602973905": {"Name": "Lafosse C.", "AuthorID": "6602973905", "AffiliationID": "115599754", "AffiliationName": "Scientific Unit Rehabilitation, Hospital RevArte"}}}
