A number of limiting factors are thought to contribute to the scaling problem over and above the simple combinatorial explosion, but the key ones relate to the lack of exploration of properly diverse protein folds, and to an acute form of \u201cdeception\u201d in the energy function, whereby low-energy conformations do not reliably equate with native structures. In this article, solutions to both of these problems are investigated through a multistagememetic algorithm incorporating the successful Rosetta method as a local search routine.We found that specialised genetic operators significantly add to structural diversity and that this translates well to reaching low energies. The use of a generalised stochastic ranking procedure for selection enables the memetic algorithm to hand le and traverse deep energy wells that can be considered deceptive, which further adds to the ability of the algorithm to obtain a much-improved diversity of folds. The results should translate to a tangible improvement in the performance of protein structure prediction algorithms in blind experiments such as CASP, and potentially to a further step towards the more challenging problem of predicting the three-dimensional shape of large proteins.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Fragment assembly", "Memetic algorithms", "Protein structure prediction"], "IndexKeywords": ["Combinatorial explosion", "Computational approach", "Fragment assembly", "Low-energy conformations", "Memetic algorithms", "Protein structure prediction", "Structural diversity", "Three-dimensional shape", "Algorithms", "Computational Biology", "Evolution, Molecular", "Molecular Dynamics Simulation", "Peptide Fragments", "Protein Conformation", "Protein Structure, Secondary", "Protein Structure, Tertiary", "Proteins", "Stochastic Processes"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85002044950", "SubjectAreas": [["Computational Mathematics", "MATH", "2605"]], "AuthorData": {"35184964500": {"Name": "Garza-Fabre M.", "AuthorID": "35184964500", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "Decision and Cognitive Sciences Research Centre, University of Manchester"}, "8594745900": {"Name": "Handl J.", "AuthorID": "8594745900", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "Decision and Cognitive Sciences Research Centre, University of Manchester"}, "55748763500": {"Name": "Kandathil S.", "AuthorID": "55748763500", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Life Sciences, University of Manchester"}, "7005933940": {"Name": "Lovell S.", "AuthorID": "7005933940", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Life Sciences, University of Manchester"}, "8987723000": {"Name": "Knowles J.", "AuthorID": "8987723000", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "School of Computer Science, University of Birmingham"}}}
