To investigate whether GJH influences functional movement control and explore whether symptoms of dysautonomia are reported in this population. Design: Observational within-subject cross-sectional design. Setting: Field based study. Participants: 27 elite level netballers (14-26 years). Main outcome measures: GJH and JHS were assessed using the Beighton scale, 5 point questionnaire and the Brighton Criteria. Functional movement control was measured using posturography on a force platform and the Star Excursion Balance Test (SEBT). Results: The prevalence of GJH was 63% (n=17) (Beighton score \u22654/9) and JHS was 15% (n=4). Symptoms of dysautonomia were minimally prevalent. A trend was observed in which participants with GJH demonstrated increased postural instability on the functional tests. Following Bonferroni adjustment, this was statistically significant only when comparing posturographic data between the distinctly hypermobile participants and the rest of the group for path area (p=0.002) and velocity (p=0.002) on the left side. Conclusions: A high prevalence of GJH was observed. A trend towards impairment of functional movement control was observed in the netballers with GJH. This observation did not reach statistical significance except for posturographic path area and velocity.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Balance", "Hypermobility", "Laxity", "Sport"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Athletes", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Female", "Humans", "Joint Instability", "Male", "Postural Balance", "Prevalence", "Range of Motion, Articular", "Sports", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84928566172", "SubjectAreas": [["Orthopedics and Sports Medicine", "MEDI", "2732"], ["Physical Therapy, Sports Therapy and Rehabilitation", "HEAL", "3612"]], "AuthorData": {"56606943400": {"Name": "Soper K.", "AuthorID": "56606943400", "AffiliationID": "60032760", "AffiliationName": "Bodybalance Physiotherapy and Sports Injuries Clinic, University of Hertfordshire"}, "20434379700": {"Name": "Simmonds J.V.", "AuthorID": "20434379700", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "56607399200": {"Name": "Kaz Kaz H.", "AuthorID": "56607399200", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "University College London Hospital"}, "8612114500": {"Name": "Ninis N.", "AuthorID": "8612114500", "AffiliationID": "60022871, 60111785", "AffiliationName": "Imperial Healthcare NHS trust, St Mary's Hospital"}}}
