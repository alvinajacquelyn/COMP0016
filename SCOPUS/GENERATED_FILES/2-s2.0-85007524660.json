The Economic Journal published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of Royal Economic Society.Using large longitudinal survey data from the UK Millennium Cohort Study, this article estimates the relationship between maternal time inputs and early child development. We find that maternal time is a quantitatively important determinant of skill formation and that its effect declines with child age. There is evidence of long-term effects of early maternal time inputs on later outcomes, especially in the case of cognitive skill development. In the case of non-cognitive development, the evidence of this long-term impact disappears when we account for skill persistence.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85007524660", "SubjectAreas": [["Economics and Econometrics", "ECON", "2002"]], "AuthorData": {"14018950600": {"Name": "Bono E.D.", "AuthorID": "14018950600", "AffiliationID": "60029622, 60102147", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Social and Economic Research, University of Essex and University of Bergen"}, "7005431414": {"Name": "Francesconi M.", "AuthorID": "7005431414", "AffiliationID": "60012327, 60001359", "AffiliationName": "University of Essex and Institute for Fiscal Studies"}, "6602886147": {"Name": "Kelly Y.", "AuthorID": "6602886147", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "6603689750": {"Name": "Sacker A.", "AuthorID": "6603689750", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
