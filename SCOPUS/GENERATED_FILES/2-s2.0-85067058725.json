By correcting for individual optical aberrations, AO offers an improvement in transverse resolution from 10\u201315 \u03bcm to ~2 \u03bcm, enabling assessment of individual retinal cell types. One of the settings in which its utility has been recognised is that of the inherited retinal diseases (IRDs), the genetic and clinical heterogeneity of which warrants better cellular characterisation. In this review, we provide a summary of the basic principles of AO, its integration into multiple retinal imaging modalities and its clinical applications, focusing primarily on IRDs. Furthermore, we present a comprehensive summary of AO-based cellular findings in IRDs according to their associated disease-causing genes.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85067058725", "SubjectAreas": [["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"], ["Sensory Systems", "NEUR", "2809"]], "AuthorData": {"57203278618": {"Name": "Gill J.S.", "AuthorID": "57203278618", "AffiliationID": "60013148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "6506942455": {"Name": "Moosajee M.", "AuthorID": "6506942455", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children"}, "34876470600": {"Name": "Dubis A.M.", "AuthorID": "34876470600", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60016691", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre at Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Trust and UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}}}
