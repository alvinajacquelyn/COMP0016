We have only a limited understanding of the consequences of migration for migrants and their descendants, relative to staying behind; and our insights of intergenerational transmission is limited to two generations of those living in the destination countries. These limitations stem from a paucity of studies that incorporate comparison with nonmigrants - and return migrants - in countries of origin and which trace processes of intergenerational transmission over multiple generations. This paper outlines the theoretical and methodological discussions in the field, design and data of the 2,000 Families study. The study comprises almost 50,000 members of migrant and non-migrant Turkish families across three family generations, living in Turkey and eight European countries. We provide indicative findings from the study, framed within a theoretical perspective of \u201cdissimilation\u201d from origins, and reflect on its potential for future migration research.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Dissimilation from origins", "Europe", "Intergenerational transmission", "International migration", "Origins-of-migration study", "Turkish migration"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84990243236", "SubjectAreas": [["Cultural Studies", "SOCI", "3316"], ["Anthropology", "SOCI", "3314"], ["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"]], "AuthorData": {"56556849600": {"Name": "Guveli A.", "AuthorID": "56556849600", "AffiliationID": "60001359", "AffiliationName": "Department of Sociology, University of Essex"}, "6602907627": {"Name": "Ganzeboom H.B.G.", "AuthorID": "6602907627", "AffiliationID": "60008734", "AffiliationName": "Department of Sociology, Free University Amsterdam"}, "57190606438": {"Name": "Sozeri E.K.", "AuthorID": "57190606438", "AffiliationID": "60008734", "AffiliationName": "Department of Sociology, Free University Amsterdam"}, "55212186500": {"Name": "Baykara-Krumme H.", "AuthorID": "55212186500", "AffiliationID": "60008069", "AffiliationName": "Department of Sociology, Chemnitz University of Technology"}, "8542398900": {"Name": "Nauck B.", "AuthorID": "8542398900", "AffiliationID": "60008069", "AffiliationName": "Department of Sociology, Chemnitz University of Technology"}, "35944497300": {"Name": "Platt L.", "AuthorID": "35944497300", "AffiliationID": "60003059", "AffiliationName": "Department of Social Policy, London School of Economics and Political Science"}, "16066792300": {"Name": "Ero\u011flu \u015e.", "AuthorID": "16066792300", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "School for Social Policy, University Bristol"}, "24722302300": {"Name": "Spierings N.", "AuthorID": "24722302300", "AffiliationID": "60016529", "AffiliationName": "Department of Sociology, Radboud University Nijmegen"}, "57190610607": {"Name": "Bayrakdar S.", "AuthorID": "57190610607", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Sociology, University of Cambridge"}}}
