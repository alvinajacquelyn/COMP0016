This provides for the first time an objective measure of whether or not a particular value of modularity is meaningful. In particular, our results quantify the strength of the relation between observed community structure and the interactions in a network. Our technical contribution is to provide limit theorems for modularity when a community assignment is given by nodal features or co-variates. These theorems hold for a broad class of network models over a range of sparsity regimes, as well as for weighted, multiedge, and power-law networks. This allows us to assign p-values to observed community structure, which we validate using several benchmark examples from the literature. We conclude by applying this methodology to investigate a multiedge network of corporate email interactions.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Degree-based network models", "Limit theorems", "Network community structure", "Statistical network analysis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Community structures", "Limit theorem", "Network community structures", "Network models", "Network modularity", "Power-law networks", "Statistical network analysis", "Technical contribution"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85067029371", "SubjectAreas": [["Theoretical Computer Science", "MATH", "2614"], ["Computational Mathematics", "MATH", "2605"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"57209241677": {"Name": "Ehrhardt B.", "AuthorID": "57209241677", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Statistical Science, University College London"}, "7103083673": {"Name": "Wolfe P.J.", "AuthorID": "7103083673", "AffiliationID": "60028629, 60009254", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Statistics, Computer Science, and Electrical and Computer Engineering, Purdue University"}}}
