Design A new community-based cross-sectional study and a systematic literature review. Settings Urban and rural communities in China; population-based studies systematically searched from worldwide literature. Subjects Chinese adults aged \u226560 years in six provinces (n 6981) took part in a household health survey of dementia prevalence and risk factors. In addition, 33 964 participants from eleven published and eligible studies were included in the systematic review and meta-analysis. Results In the new study in China, 326 participants were diagnosed with dementia (4\u00b77 %); those who consumed any amount of fish in the past two years v. those who consumed no fish had reduced risk of dementia (adjusted OR=0\u00b773, 95 % CI 0\u00b764, 0\u00b799), but the dose-response relationship was not statistically significant. The meta-analysis of available data from the literature and the new study showed relative risk (RR) of dementia of 0\u00b780 (95 % CI 0\u00b774, 0\u00b787) for people with fish consumption; the impact was similar among countries with different levels of income. Pooled dose-response data revealed RR (95 % CI) of 0\u00b784 (0\u00b772, 0\u00b798), 0\u00b778 (0\u00b768, 0\u00b790) and 0\u00b777 (0\u00b761, 0\u00b798) in people with low, middle and high consumption of fish, respectively. Corresponding figures for Alzheimer's disease were 0\u00b788 (0\u00b774, 1\u00b704), 0\u00b779 (0\u00b765, 0\u00b796) and 0\u00b767 (0\u00b758, 0\u00b778), respectively. Conclusions Greater consumption of fish is associated with a lower risk of dementia. Increasing fish consumption may help prevent dementia worldwide regardless of income level.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alzheimer's disease", "Dementia", "Fish consumption"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "China", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Dementia", "Diet", "Fishes", "Humans", "Middle Aged", "Seafood"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85044183108", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (miscellaneous)", "MEDI", "2701"], ["Nutrition and Dietetics", "NURS", "2916"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"57201286979": {"Name": "Bakre A.T.", "AuthorID": "57201286979", "AffiliationID": "60007173", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Education Health and Wellbeing, University of Wolverhampton"}, "8898530700": {"Name": "Chen R.", "AuthorID": "8898530700", "AffiliationID": "60007173", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Education Health and Wellbeing, University of Wolverhampton"}, "57190071820": {"Name": "Khutan R.", "AuthorID": "57190071820", "AffiliationID": "60007173", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Education Health and Wellbeing, University of Wolverhampton"}, "57201300936": {"Name": "Smith T.", "AuthorID": "57201300936", "AffiliationID": "60007173", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Education Health and Wellbeing, University of Wolverhampton"}, "57193196670": {"Name": "Danat I.M.", "AuthorID": "57193196670", "AffiliationID": "60007173", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Education Health and Wellbeing, University of Wolverhampton"}, "57193198882": {"Name": "Zhou W.", "AuthorID": "57193198882", "AffiliationID": "60007173", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Education Health and Wellbeing, University of Wolverhampton"}, "35179194800": {"Name": "Clifford A.", "AuthorID": "35179194800", "AffiliationID": "60007173", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Education Health and Wellbeing, University of Wolverhampton"}, "8448863300": {"Name": "Wei L.", "AuthorID": "8448863300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Practice and Policy, University College London"}, "57201291387": {"Name": "Qin G.", "AuthorID": "57201291387", "AffiliationID": "60006255", "AffiliationName": "Royal Wolverhampton NHS Trust"}, "57192805324": {"Name": "Schofield P.", "AuthorID": "57192805324", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Primary Care and Public Health Sciences, King's College London"}, "55928281300": {"Name": "Wang J.", "AuthorID": "55928281300", "AffiliationID": "60013156", "AffiliationName": "Department of Preventive Medicine, School of Public Health, Guangzhou Medical University"}, "57220966997": {"Name": "Verma A.", "AuthorID": "57220966997", "AffiliationID": "60172345", "AffiliationName": "Division of Population Health, Health Services Research and Primary Care, Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, University of Manchester"}, "55646336600": {"Name": "Zhang C.", "AuthorID": "55646336600", "AffiliationID": "60017777, 60006577", "AffiliationName": "Epidemiology Branch, Division of Intramural Population Health Research, Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, National Institutes of Health"}, "57210745502": {"Name": "Ni J.", "AuthorID": "57210745502", "AffiliationID": "60020918", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Guangdong Medical University"}}}
