Yet many of the technicalities underpinning these datasets are misunderstood by applied researchers, who sometimes fail to take their complex sample and test designs into account. The aim of this paper is to generate a better understanding among economists about how such databases are created, and what this implies for the empirical methodologies one should (or should not) apply. We explain how some of the modeling strategies preferred by economists seem to be at odds with the complex test design, and provide clear advice on the types of robustness tests that are therefore needed when analyzing these datasets. In doing so, we hope to generate a better understanding of international large-scale education databases, and promote better practice in their use.", "AuthorKeywords": ["PISA", "Plausible values", "Replicate weights", "Sample design", "Test design", "Weights"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85033552979", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["Economics and Econometrics", "ECON", "2002"]], "AuthorData": {"54418736800": {"Name": "Jerrim J.", "AuthorID": "54418736800", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Social Science, UCL Institute of Education, University College London"}, "57195424413": {"Name": "Shure N.", "AuthorID": "57195424413", "AffiliationID": "60007893", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Labor Economics (IZA)"}, "56401035700": {"Name": "Lopez-Agudo L.", "AuthorID": "56401035700", "AffiliationID": "60003662", "AffiliationName": "Departamento de Econom\u00eda Aplicada (Estad\u00edstica y Econometr\u00eda), Facultad de Ciencias Econ\u00f3micas y Empresariales, Universidad de M\u00e1laga"}, "16425869300": {"Name": "Marcenaro-Gutierrez O.", "AuthorID": "16425869300", "AffiliationID": "60003662", "AffiliationName": "Departamento de Econom\u00eda Aplicada (Estad\u00edstica y Econometr\u00eda), Facultad de Ciencias Econ\u00f3micas y Empresariales, Universidad de M\u00e1laga"}}}
