Methods: Platelet concentrates (n = 20) were tested on days 1, 5 and 7 of storage at 22\u00b0C and RTFP24 (n = 10) immediately following thawing and after 4 and 6 days storage at 4\u00b0C. Coagulation factor activity, thrombin generation \u00b1 an activator of protein C (PROTAC) and rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM) were assessed. Results: In plasma and buffy-coat derived PC, there was a < 10% loss of factors II, IX and FX, but much higher loss of factors FV, FVII and FVIII. In plasma, the total or peak amount of thrombin generated was unaffected by storage for 6 days, with or without Protac\u00ae, but there was an increase in lag time and decreased rate of clot formation by ROTEM. In PC, but not plasma, there was a 16% increase in FXII activity and increase in resistance to activated protein C, co-incidental to 30% loss of free protein S. Conclusions: These data suggest thrombin generation is relatively unaltered when RTFP24 is thawed and stored for 6 days, and that the supernatant of PC has significant haemostatic capacity.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Blood components", "Blood processing", "Platelet concentrates plasma"], "IndexKeywords": ["Blood Coagulation", "Blood Coagulation Factors", "Blood Platelets", "Freezing", "Humans", "Plasma", "Thrombin"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84921314384", "SubjectAreas": [["Hematology", "MEDI", "2720"]], "AuthorData": {"7004638851": {"Name": "Cookson P.", "AuthorID": "7004638851", "AffiliationID": "60030968", "AffiliationName": "Component Development Laboratory, NHS Blood and Transplant"}, "56481525400": {"Name": "Proffitt S.", "AuthorID": "56481525400", "AffiliationID": "60030968", "AffiliationName": "Component Development Laboratory, NHS Blood and Transplant"}, "7005333405": {"Name": "Bashir S.", "AuthorID": "7005333405", "AffiliationID": "60030968", "AffiliationName": "Component Development Laboratory, NHS Blood and Transplant"}, "57214059943": {"Name": "Thomas S.", "AuthorID": "57214059943", "AffiliationID": "60030968", "AffiliationName": "Component Development Laboratory, NHS Blood and Transplant"}, "6701900956": {"Name": "Cardigan R.", "AuthorID": "6701900956", "AffiliationID": "60030968", "AffiliationName": "Component Development Laboratory, NHS Blood and Transplant"}, "35554664300": {"Name": "Lawrie A.", "AuthorID": "35554664300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Haemostasis Research Unit, Department of Haematology, University College London"}, "35179311300": {"Name": "Green L.", "AuthorID": "35179311300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Haemostasis Research Unit, Department of Haematology, University College London"}, "56485492000": {"Name": "Dent E.", "AuthorID": "56485492000", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
