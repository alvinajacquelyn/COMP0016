All rights reserved.All mammals depend on lung surfactant (LS) to reduce surface tension at the alveolar interface and facilitate respiration. The inactivation of LS in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is generally accompanied by elevated levels of fibrinogen and other blood plasma proteins in the alveolar space. Motivated by the mechanical role fibrinogen may play in LS inactivation, we measure the interfacial rheology of mixed monolayers of fibrinogen and dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC), the main constituent of LS, and compare these to the single species monolayers. We find DPPC to be ineffective at displacing preadsorbed fibrinogen, which gives the resulting mixed monolayer a strongly elastic shear response. By contrast, how effectively a pre-existing DPPC monolayer prevents fibrinogen adsorption depends upon its surface pressure. At low DPPC surface pressures, fibrinogen penetrates DPPC monolayers, imparting a mixed viscoelastic shear response. At higher initial DPPC surface pressures, this response becomes increasingly viscous-dominated, and the monolayer retains a more fluid, DPPC-like character. Fluorescence microscopy reveals that the mixed monolayers exhibit qualitatively different morphologies. Fibrinogen has a strong, albeit preparation-dependent, mechanical effect on phospholipid monolayers, which may contribute to LS inactivation and disorders such as ARDS.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Fibrinogen", "Interfacial rheology", "Lung surfactant", "Monolayers", "Protein adsorption"], "IndexKeywords": ["Acute respiratory distress syndrome", "Dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine", "Fibrinogen", "Fibrinogen adsorption", "Interfacial rheology", "Lung surfactants", "Phospholipid monolayers", "Protein adsorption", "1,2-Dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine", "Adsorption", "Fibrinogen", "Phospholipids", "Pulmonary Surfactants", "Respiration", "Surface Properties", "Surface Tension"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85045056599", "SubjectAreas": [["Biotechnology", "BIOC", "1305"], ["Biophysics", "BIOC", "1304"], ["Bioengineering", "CENG", "1502"], ["Biomaterials", "MATE", "2502"], ["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"]], "AuthorData": {"57206923926": {"Name": "Williams I.", "AuthorID": "57206923926", "AffiliationID": "60029241", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University of California"}, "7005606427": {"Name": "Squires T.M.", "AuthorID": "7005606427", "AffiliationID": "60029241", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University of California"}}}
