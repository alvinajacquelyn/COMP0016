Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the European Society for Medical Oncology.Introduction: Immunotherapy is regarded as one of the major breakthroughs in cancer treatment. Despite its success, only a subset of patients responds - urging the quest for predictive biomarkers. We hypothesize that artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms can automatically quantify radiographic characteristics that are related to and may therefore act as noninvasive radiomic biomarkers for immunotherapy response. Patients and methods: In this study, we analyzed 1055 primary and metastatic lesions from 203 patients with advanced melanoma and non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) undergoing anti-PD1 therapy. We carried out an AI-based characterization of each lesion on the pretreatment contrast-enhanced CT imaging data to develop and validate a noninvasive machine learning biomarker capable of distinguishing between immunotherapy responding and nonresponding. To define the biological basis of the radiographic biomarker, we carried out gene set enrichment analysis in an independent dataset of 262 NSCLC patients. Results: The biomarker reached significant performance on NSCLC lesions (up to 0.83 AUC, P < 0.001) and borderline significant for melanoma lymph nodes (0.64 AUC, P = 0.05). Combining these lesion-wide predictions on a patient level, immunotherapy response could be predicted with an AUC of up to 0.76 for both cancer types (P < 0.001), resulting in a 1-year survival difference of 24% (P = 0.02). We found highly significant associations with pathways involved in mitosis, indicating a relationship between increased proliferative potential and preferential response to immunotherapy. Conclusions: These results indicate that radiographic characteristics of lesions on standard-of-care imaging may function as noninvasive biomarkers for response to immunotherapy, and may show utility for improved patient stratification in both neoadjuvant and palliative settings.", "AuthorKeywords": ["artificial intelligence", "immunotherapy", "machine learning", "medical imaging", "radiomics", "response prediction"], "IndexKeywords": ["Algorithms", "Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols", "Artificial Intelligence", "Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung", "Follow-Up Studies", "Humans", "Immunotherapy", "Lung Neoplasms", "Machine Learning", "Melanoma", "Predictive Value of Tests", "Prognosis", "Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor", "Survival Rate", "Tomography, X-Ray Computed"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85070450750", "SubjectAreas": [["Hematology", "MEDI", "2720"], ["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"]], "AuthorData": {"57194020299": {"Name": "Trebeschi S.", "AuthorID": "57194020299", "AffiliationID": "60016782, 60002746, 60014334", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Radiology, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School"}, "57210569814": {"Name": "Drago S.G.", "AuthorID": "57210569814", "AffiliationID": "60014378, 60012306", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Milano-Bicocca University, San Gerardo Hospital"}, "57195905645": {"Name": "Kurilova I.", "AuthorID": "57195905645", "AffiliationID": "116553495", "AffiliationName": "GROW School of Oncology and Developmental Biology"}, "57210725349": {"Name": "C\u01celin A.M.", "AuthorID": "57210725349", "AffiliationID": "123017278", "AffiliationName": "Affidea Romania"}, "56910081700": {"Name": "Delli Pizzi A.", "AuthorID": "56910081700", "AffiliationID": "60004638", "AffiliationName": "ITAB Institute for Advanced Biomedical Technologies, University G. d'Annunzio"}, "57194194282": {"Name": "Lalezari F.", "AuthorID": "57194194282", "AffiliationID": "60015205", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Netherlands Cancer Institute"}, "36522132000": {"Name": "Lambregts D.M.J.", "AuthorID": "36522132000", "AffiliationID": "60015205", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Netherlands Cancer Institute"}, "6602873920": {"Name": "Beets-Tan R.G.H.", "AuthorID": "6602873920", "AffiliationID": "116553495", "AffiliationName": "GROW School of Oncology and Developmental Biology"}, "16479697600": {"Name": "Aerts H.J.W.L.", "AuthorID": "16479697600", "AffiliationID": "60016782, 60002746, 60014334", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Radiology, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School"}, "55862758900": {"Name": "Parmar C.", "AuthorID": "55862758900", "AffiliationID": "60016782, 60002746, 60014334", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Radiology, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School"}, "37005365300": {"Name": "Birkbak N.J.", "AuthorID": "37005365300", "AffiliationID": "60029616", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Medicine, Aarhus University"}, "7005912775": {"Name": "Swanton C.", "AuthorID": "7005912775", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "57204094161": {"Name": "Rohaan M.W.", "AuthorID": "57204094161", "AffiliationID": "60015205", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Medical Oncology, Netherlands Cancer Institute"}, "57192573821": {"Name": "Rozeman E.A.", "AuthorID": "57192573821", "AffiliationID": "60015205", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Medical Oncology, Netherlands Cancer Institute"}, "7003526080": {"Name": "Haanen J.B.A.G.", "AuthorID": "7003526080", "AffiliationID": "60015205", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Medical Oncology, Netherlands Cancer Institute"}, "7007139510": {"Name": "Blank C.U.", "AuthorID": "7007139510", "AffiliationID": "60015205", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Medical Oncology, Netherlands Cancer Institute"}, "6506626374": {"Name": "Hartemink K.J.", "AuthorID": "6506626374", "AffiliationID": "60015205", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Surgery, Netherlands Cancer Institute"}, "57192200071": {"Name": "Smit E.F.", "AuthorID": "57192200071", "AffiliationID": "60015205", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Thoracic Oncology, Netherlands Cancer Institute"}}}
