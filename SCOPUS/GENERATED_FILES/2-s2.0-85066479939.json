Published by ECS.In this work, a porous silicon nanostructure has been fabricated by electrochemical means and used as a thermal sensor. The thermo-optic effect in the near infrared region has been experimentally studied based on spectroscopy measurements. Values of the thermo-optic coefficient between 3.2 and 7.9\u00b710\u22125 K\u22121 have been obtained, depending on the porosity, reaching a maximum thermal sensitivity of 91 \u00b1 3 pm/\u00b0C during the experiments carried out with the fabricated samples. Additionally, the oxidation process of the sensor at temperatures below 500 K has been studied, showing that the growth of the silicon oxide was dependent on the characteristics of the porous layers. Based on the experimental results, a mathematical model was developed to estimate the evolution of the oxidation process as a function of porosity and thickness.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Low temperatures", "Near infrared region", "Oxidation process", "Porous silicon nanostructures", "Spectroscopy measurements", "Thermal sensitivity", "Thermo-optic coefficients", "Thermooptic effects"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85066479939", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment", "ENER", "2105"], ["Surfaces, Coatings and Films", "MATE", "2508"], ["Electrochemistry", "CHEM", "1603"], ["Materials Chemistry", "MATE", "2505"]], "AuthorData": {"57203977738": {"Name": "Mart\u00edn-S\u00e1nchez D.", "AuthorID": "57203977738", "AffiliationID": "60011476", "AffiliationName": "Nanophotonics Technology Center (NTC), Universitat Polit\u00e8cnica de Val\u00e8ncia"}, "26435389200": {"Name": "Kovylina M.", "AuthorID": "26435389200", "AffiliationID": "60011476", "AffiliationName": "Nanophotonics Technology Center (NTC), Universitat Polit\u00e8cnica de Val\u00e8ncia"}, "8404569400": {"Name": "Ponce-Alc\u00e1ntara S.", "AuthorID": "8404569400", "AffiliationID": "60011476", "AffiliationName": "Nanophotonics Technology Center (NTC), Universitat Polit\u00e8cnica de Val\u00e8ncia"}, "35799566800": {"Name": "Garc\u00eda-Rup\u00e9rez J.", "AuthorID": "35799566800", "AffiliationID": "60011476", "AffiliationName": "Nanophotonics Technology Center (NTC), Universitat Polit\u00e8cnica de Val\u00e8ncia"}}}
