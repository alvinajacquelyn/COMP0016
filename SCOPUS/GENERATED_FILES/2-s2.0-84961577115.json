This study was an exploratory examination of whether 10 weeks of group drumming could improve depression, anxiety and social resilience among service users compared with a non-music control group (with participants allocated to group by geographical location.) Significant improvements were found in the drumming group but not the control group: by week 6 there were decreases in depression (-2.14 SE 0.50 CI -3.16 to -1.11) and increases in social resilience (7.69 SE 2.00 CI 3.60 to 11.78), and by week 10 these had further improved (depression: -3.41 SE 0.62 CI -4.68 to -2.15; social resilience: 10.59 SE 1.78 CI 6.94 to 14.24) alongside significant improvements in anxiety (-2.21 SE 0.50 CI -3.24 to -1.19) and mental wellbeing (6.14 SE 0.92 CI 4.25 to 8.04). All significant changes were maintained at 3 months follow-up. Furthermore, it is now recognised that many mental health conditions are characterised by underlying inflammatory immune responses. Consequently, participants in the drumming group also provided saliva samples to test for cortisol and the cytokines interleukin (IL) 4, IL6, IL17, tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFa), and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP) 1. Across the 10 weeks there was a shift away from a pro-inflammatory towards an anti-inflammatory immune profile. Consequently, this study demonstrates the psychological benefits of group drumming and also suggests underlying biological effects, supporting its therapeutic potential for mental health.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Anxiety", "Cytokines", "Depression", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Humans", "Inflammation", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Music Therapy", "Time Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84961577115", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"55911947100": {"Name": "Fancourt D.", "AuthorID": "55911947100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Psychobiology Group, Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "55602471100": {"Name": "Perkins R.", "AuthorID": "55602471100", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London, South Kensington Campus"}, "56983033800": {"Name": "Ascenso S.", "AuthorID": "56983033800", "AffiliationID": "60113750, 60175882", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Performance Science, Royal College of Music"}, "6602890097": {"Name": "Williamon A.", "AuthorID": "6602890097", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London, South Kensington Campus"}, "55440517500": {"Name": "Carvalho L.A.", "AuthorID": "55440517500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Psychobiology Group, Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "7102289942": {"Name": "Steptoe A.", "AuthorID": "7102289942", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Psychobiology Group, Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}}}
