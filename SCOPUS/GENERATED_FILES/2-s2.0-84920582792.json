Colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) mutations were looked for in primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS) patients and the clinical features of a family with a novel CSF1R mutation are reported. Methods: CSF1R exons 12-22 in a cohort of 220 PPMS patients from the Swedish and Norwegian national multiple sclerosis registries were sequenced. Results: One patient had a novel mutation, c.2562T>A; p.Asn854Lys, in the CSF1R gene. Her symptoms started at the age of 29 years with insidious onset of pyramidal weakness in the left leg. The cerebrospinal fluid examination showed four intrathecal immunoglobulin G bands. A magnetic resonance imaging scan performed 4 years after symptom onset demonstrated patchy deep WM lesions. She was diagnosed as having PPMS and treated with intramuscular interferon beta 1a. Due to slow disease progression, the development of memory decline and cerebellar signs, she was given subcutaneous interferon beta 1a without any benefit. The updated pedigree indicated that five siblings also had the CSF1R gene mutation; one was diagnosed with PPMS. Six more distant relatives also had a neurological disorder; four were clinically diagnosed with PPMS. Conclusions: Our study indicates that a chronic course of HDLS may mimic PPMS. Genetic testing for CSF1R gene mutations in PPMS cases with a positive family history of neurological disorders may establish the diagnosis of HDLS.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Hereditary diffuse leukoencephalopathy with spheroids", "White matter lesions"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Exons", "Female", "Humans", "Leukoencephalopathies", "Multiple Sclerosis, Chronic Progressive", "Mutation", "Norway", "Pedigree", "Phenotype", "Receptor, Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor", "Registries", "Siblings", "Sweden"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84920582792", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"35811142100": {"Name": "Sundal C.", "AuthorID": "35811142100", "AffiliationID": "60030280", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Haukeland University Hospital"}, "26321426800": {"Name": "Andersen O.", "AuthorID": "26321426800", "AffiliationID": "60027675, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience and Physiology, Sahlgrenska Academy, Gothenburg University"}, "13611578000": {"Name": "Haugarvoll K.", "AuthorID": "13611578000", "AffiliationID": "60030280", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Haukeland University Hospital"}, "35372403500": {"Name": "Baker M.", "AuthorID": "35372403500", "AffiliationID": "60002333", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurosciences and Neurology, Mayo Clinic"}, "7005313394": {"Name": "Wszolek Z.", "AuthorID": "7005313394", "AffiliationID": "60002333", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurosciences and Neurology, Mayo Clinic"}, "6602533808": {"Name": "Rademakers R.", "AuthorID": "6602533808", "AffiliationID": "60002333", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurosciences and Neurology, Mayo Clinic"}, "8659004400": {"Name": "Karrenbauer V.", "AuthorID": "8659004400", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Neuroscience, Center for Molecular Medicine, Karolinska Institutet"}, "56471800600": {"Name": "Bedri S.", "AuthorID": "56471800600", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Neuroscience, Center for Molecular Medicine, Karolinska Institutet"}, "8064561900": {"Name": "Glaser A.", "AuthorID": "8064561900", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Neuroscience, Center for Molecular Medicine, Karolinska Institutet"}, "7003874276": {"Name": "Kockum I.", "AuthorID": "7003874276", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Neuroscience, Center for Molecular Medicine, Karolinska Institutet"}, "7004645696": {"Name": "Hillert J.", "AuthorID": "7004645696", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Neuroscience, Center for Molecular Medicine, Karolinska Institutet"}, "28767613700": {"Name": "Gustavsen M.", "AuthorID": "28767613700", "AffiliationID": "60068729, 60010348", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Oslo University Hospital, Ullev\u00e5l and University of Oslo"}, "55666344500": {"Name": "Harbo H.", "AuthorID": "55666344500", "AffiliationID": "60068729, 60010348", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Oslo University Hospital, Ullev\u00e5l and University of Oslo"}, "7005382096": {"Name": "Myhr K.", "AuthorID": "7005382096", "AffiliationID": "60030280", "AffiliationName": "Norwegian MS Registry and Biobank, Department of Neurology, Haukeland University Hospital"}, "6701454676": {"Name": "Zetterberg H.", "AuthorID": "6701454676", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Neurology, Queen Square"}}}
