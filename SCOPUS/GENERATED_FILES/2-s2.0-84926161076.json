However, owing to the inherent high-dimensionality of networks themselves, modelling transmission through networks is mathematically and computationally challenging. Even the simplest network epidemic models present unanswered questions. Attempts to improve the practical usefulness of network models by including realistic features of contact networks and of host-pathogen biology (e.g. waning immunity) have made some progress, but robust analytical results remain scarce. A more general theory is needed to understand the impact of network structure on the dynamics and control of infection. Here we identify a set of challenges that provide scope for active research in the field of network epidemic models.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Contact networks", "Control measures", "Dynamic networks", "Infectious disease models", "Random graphs", "Transmission dynamics"], "IndexKeywords": ["Communicable Disease Control", "Communicable Diseases", "Epidemics", "Host-Pathogen Interactions", "Humans", "Models, Statistical"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84926161076", "SubjectAreas": [["Parasitology", "IMMU", "2405"], ["Epidemiology", "MEDI", "2713"], ["Microbiology", "IMMU", "2404"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"], ["Virology", "IMMU", "2406"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"25030661700": {"Name": "Pellis L.", "AuthorID": "25030661700", "AffiliationID": "60163091, 60022020", "AffiliationName": "Warwick Infectious Disease Epidemiology Research Centre (WIDER), Warwick Mathematics Institute, University of Warwick"}, "6701370105": {"Name": "House T.", "AuthorID": "6701370105", "AffiliationID": "60163091, 60022020", "AffiliationName": "Warwick Infectious Disease Epidemiology Research Centre (WIDER), Warwick Mathematics Institute, University of Warwick"}, "7006744795": {"Name": "Ball F.", "AuthorID": "7006744795", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "School of Mathematical Sciences, University of Nottingham, University Park"}, "55422179700": {"Name": "Bansal S.", "AuthorID": "55422179700", "AffiliationID": "60028170, 60006577", "AffiliationName": "Fogarty International Center, National Institutes of Health"}, "36144973400": {"Name": "Eames K.", "AuthorID": "36144973400", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "6701600227": {"Name": "Isham V.", "AuthorID": "6701600227", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Statistical Science, University College London"}, "6506713784": {"Name": "Trapman P.", "AuthorID": "6506713784", "AffiliationID": "60028378", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, Stockholm University"}}}
