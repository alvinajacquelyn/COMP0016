This UK study provides a contemporary reassessment in one of the few countries in the world with a nationally representative PCI registry. Methods and Results - A nationwide cohort study was performed using the national British Cardiovascular Intervention Society registry. All adult patients undergoing PCI in 93 English and Welsh NHS hospitals between 2007 and 2013 were analyzed using hierarchical modeling with adjustment for patient risk. Of 427 467 procedures (22.0% primary PCI) in 93 hospitals, 30-day mortality was 1.9% (4.8% primary PCI). 87.1% of centers undertook between 200 and 2000 procedures annually. Case mix varied with center volume. In centers with 200 to 399 PCI cases per year, a smaller proportion were PCI for ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction (8.4%) than in centers with 1500 to 1999 PCI cases per year (24.2%), but proportionally more were for ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction with cardiogenic shock (8.4% versus 4.3%). For the overall PCI cohort, after risk adjustment, there was no significant evidence of worse, or better, outcomes in lower volume centers from our own study, or in combination with results from other studies. For primary PCI, there was also no evidence for increased or decreased mortality in lower volume centers. Conclusions - After adjustment for differences in case mix and clinical presentation, this study supports the conclusion of no trend for increased mortality in lower volume centers for PCI in the UK healthcare system.", "AuthorKeywords": ["angioplasty", "cardiology", "mortality", "myocardial infarction", "percutaneous coronary intervention"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Coronary Artery Disease", "Female", "Hospitals, High-Volume", "Hospitals, Low-Volume", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Percutaneous Coronary Intervention", "Process Assessment (Health Care)", "Registries", "Risk Assessment", "Risk Factors", "Shock, Cardiogenic", "ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction", "Time Factors", "Treatment Outcome", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85015993381", "SubjectAreas": [["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"57203534931": {"Name": "O'Neill D.", "AuthorID": "57203534931", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "41461757300": {"Name": "Nicholas O.", "AuthorID": "41461757300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "35837808000": {"Name": "Gale C.P.", "AuthorID": "35837808000", "AffiliationID": "112681382", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, York Teaching Hospital"}, "7004079970": {"Name": "Ludman P.", "AuthorID": "7004079970", "AffiliationID": "60012191", "AffiliationName": "Queen Elizabeth Hospital"}, "7005701907": {"Name": "De Belder M.A.", "AuthorID": "7005701907", "AffiliationID": "60030723", "AffiliationName": "James Cook University Hospital"}, "7006508725": {"Name": "Timmis A.", "AuthorID": "7006508725", "AffiliationID": "107313137", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Cardiovascular Biomedical Research Unit, Barts Heart Centre"}, "35377460800": {"Name": "Fox K.A.A.", "AuthorID": "35377460800", "AffiliationID": "60110825, 60027272", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cardiovascular Science, University of Edinburgh"}, "7102735784": {"Name": "Simpson I.A.", "AuthorID": "7102735784", "AffiliationID": "60002967, 60000703", "AffiliationName": "Wessex Cardiac Unit, University Hospital Southampton"}, "7004926172": {"Name": "Redwood S.", "AuthorID": "7004926172", "AffiliationID": "60004111, 60177635", "AffiliationName": "King's College London, St Thomas' Hospital"}, "7402324379": {"Name": "Ray S.G.", "AuthorID": "7402324379", "AffiliationID": "60120605", "AffiliationName": "University Hospitals of South Manchester"}}}
