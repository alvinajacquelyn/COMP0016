Methods: We performed a Rasch analysis of the survey answers of 430 carers of patients with atypical parkinsonism. Results: All of the scale items demonstrated acceptable goodness of fit to the Rasch model. The scale was unidimensional and no notable differential item functioning was detected in the items regarding age and disease type. Rating categories were functioning adequately in all scale items. The scale had high reliability (.95) and construct validity and a high degree of precision, distinguishing between 5 distinct groups of carers with different levels of quality of life. A cut-off score of 62 was found to have the optimal screening accuracy based on Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale subscores. Conclusion: The results suggest that the Carers Quality of Life Questionnaire for Parkinsonism is a useful scale to assess carers' quality of life and allows analyses requiring interval scaling of variables. \u00a9 2016 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.", "AuthorKeywords": ["carer's quality of life", "Multiple system atrophy", "progressive supranuclear palsy", "Rasch modeling"], "IndexKeywords": ["Caregivers", "Data Interpretation, Statistical", "Humans", "Multiple System Atrophy", "Parkinsonian Disorders", "Psychometrics", "Quality of Life", "Reproducibility of Results", "Supranuclear Palsy, Progressive", "Surveys and Questionnaires"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85005808144", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"56780172700": {"Name": "Pillas M.", "AuthorID": "56780172700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London Institute of Neurology, University College London, Department of Clinical Neurosciences"}, "8412764200": {"Name": "Selai C.", "AuthorID": "8412764200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London Institute of Neurology, University College London, Department of Clinical Neurosciences"}, "55802371060": {"Name": "Schrag A.", "AuthorID": "55802371060", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London Institute of Neurology, University College London, Department of Clinical Neurosciences"}}}
