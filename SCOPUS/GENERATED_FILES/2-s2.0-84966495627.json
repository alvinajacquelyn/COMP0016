We have obtained the required partition coefficients for neutral molecules from solubilities in water and water\u2013methanol mixtures, and partition coefficients for ions from literature data. Log10P values for ionic species, that are deprotonated acid anions and protonated base cations, were calculated from known data on pKa values in water and water\u2013methanol mixtures, and we list these new partition coefficients. We have also used the pKa method to determine log10P for the transfer of the hydrogen ion from water to water\u2013methanol mixtures. Our equations can describe the transfer of neutral molecules, ions and ionic species with a standard deviation in log10P from 0.06 to 0.18 log units for a total of 118 species.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Acid dissociation constants", "Ionic descriptors", "Ionic species", "Partition coefficients", "Water\u2013methanol"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84966495627", "SubjectAreas": [["Biophysics", "BIOC", "1304"], ["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"]], "AuthorData": {"7202901240": {"Name": "Abraham M.", "AuthorID": "7202901240", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "35496753700": {"Name": "Acree W.", "AuthorID": "35496753700", "AffiliationID": "60024438", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of North Texas"}}}
