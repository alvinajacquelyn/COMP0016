Therefore it was felt that it was a good time to look back and reflect on the developments in the use of the scale as well as to look forward to what new research is being done and could be done with the measure. To this end we are extremely grateful for the editors for allowing us to bring together a collection of papers that represent cutting edge research using the CASP scale. These papers cover a wide variety of issues, from working conditions to religiosity, from a range of countries, covering Western and Eastern Europe as well as Africa. Each makes an important individual contribution to our understanding of the factors that influence quality of life in later life as well as pointing to the limitations of the measure and future work that can be done in this area.", "AuthorKeywords": ["CASP-19", "psychological and social aspects", "quality of life"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aging", "Biomedical Research", "Humans", "Psychometrics", "Quality of Life", "Questionnaires"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84928102600", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychiatric Mental Health", "NURS", "2921"], ["Gerontology", "NURS", "2909"], ["Geriatrics and Gerontology", "MEDI", "2717"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"7005382627": {"Name": "Hyde M.", "AuthorID": "7005382627", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "Department of Sociology, University of Manchester"}, "35726525300": {"Name": "Higgs P.", "AuthorID": "35726525300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, UCL"}, "35821633600": {"Name": "Wiggins R.D.", "AuthorID": "35821633600", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "Department of Quantitative Social Science, Institute of Education, University of London"}, "57195814716": {"Name": "Blane D.", "AuthorID": "57195814716", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "School of Public Health, Imperial College London"}}}
