A significant increase of the macroscopic bulk flow properties is observed with increasing temperature, in particular with regards to the unconfined yield strength. Two different modelling approaches are proposed with the aim to relate the measured properties to the microscopic interactions between particles. The results indicate that both the model provides a good match with the experimental data when proper values for the models\u2019 parameters are taken into account. To this end, the sensitivity analysis for the main parameters of the models is performed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["High temperature", "Interparticle forces", "Powder flow properties"], "IndexKeywords": ["High temperature", "Increasing temperatures", "Interparticle force", "Measured properties", "Microscopic interaction", "Powder Flow", "Titanium dioxide powder", "Unconfined yield strength"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85017597344", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"], ["Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering", "ENGI", "2209"]], "AuthorData": {"57095884600": {"Name": "Macr\u00ec D.", "AuthorID": "57095884600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "35572355100": {"Name": "Lettieri P.", "AuthorID": "35572355100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "6602080548": {"Name": "Barletta D.", "AuthorID": "6602080548", "AffiliationID": "60007061", "AffiliationName": "Department of Industrial Engineering, University of Salerno"}, "7004488661": {"Name": "Poletto M.", "AuthorID": "7004488661", "AffiliationID": "60007061", "AffiliationName": "Department of Industrial Engineering, University of Salerno"}}}
