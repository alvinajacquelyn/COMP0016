Methods: We simulate the integrated depth\u2013dose curve of realistic proton pencil beams in a water phantom using the Geant4 Monte Carlo toolkit. We independently characterize the electronic and protonic components of dose buildup as a function of proton beam energy from 40 to 400 MeV, both with and without an air gap. Results: At clinical energies, electronic buildup over a distance of about 1 mm leads to a dose reduction at depth of the basal layer (0.07 mm) by up to 6% compared to if no buildup effect were present. Protonic buildup reduces the dose to the basal layer by up to 16% and has effects at depths of up to 150 mm. Secondary particles with a mass number A > 1 do not contribute to dose buildup. An air gap of 1 m has no significant effect on protonic buildup but reduces electronic buildup below 1%. Conclusions: Protonic and electronic dose buildup are relevant for accurate dosimetry in proton therapy although a realistic air gap reduces the electronic buildup to levels where it can be safely neglected. We recommend including electrons and secondary protons in Monte Carlo-based treatment planning systems down to a predicted range of 10\u201320 \u03bc m in order to accurately model the dose at depths of the basal layer, no matter the size of the air gap between nozzle and patient.", "AuthorKeywords": ["dose buildup", "proton therapy", "secondary particles", "skin sparing"], "IndexKeywords": ["dose buildup", "Proton beam energy", "Proton therapy", "Protonic components", "Secondary particles", "Secondary protons", "Skin sparing", "Treatment planning systems", "Monte Carlo Method", "Proton Therapy", "Radiation Dosage", "Radiotherapy Dosage", "Radiotherapy Planning, Computer-Assisted"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85068476498", "SubjectAreas": [["Biophysics", "BIOC", "1304"], ["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"57191869458": {"Name": "Kelleter L.", "AuthorID": "57191869458", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "15081116100": {"Name": "Saakyan R.", "AuthorID": "15081116100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "55884949000": {"Name": "Jolly S.", "AuthorID": "55884949000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "57209683437": {"Name": "Zhen-Hong Tham B.", "AuthorID": "57209683437", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "56216563500": {"Name": "Griffiths J.", "AuthorID": "56216563500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "7006652036": {"Name": "Amos R.", "AuthorID": "7006652036", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "7202353675": {"Name": "Gibson A.", "AuthorID": "7202353675", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}}}
