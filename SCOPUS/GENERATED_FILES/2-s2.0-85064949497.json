This review is focused on the pathophysiology, efficacy and criticism of low Fermentable Oligosaccharides Disaccharides Monosaccharides and Polyols diet in children. Sources: Cochrane Database, Pubmed and Embase were searched using specific terms for Fermentable Oligosaccharides Disaccharides Monosaccharides and Polyols diet interventions and functional abdominal pain disorders. Summary of the findings: In children, only one Randomized Control Trial and one open-label study reported positive results of low Fermentable Oligosaccharides Disaccharides Monosaccharides and Polyols diet; one Randomized Control Trial showed exacerbation of symptoms with fructans in children with Irritable Bowel Syndrome; no effect was found for the lactose-free diet whilst fructose-restricted diets were effective in 5/6 studies. Conclusions: In children there are few trials evaluating low Fermentable Oligosaccharides Disaccharides Monosaccharides and Polyols in functional abdominal pain disorders, with encouraging data on the therapeutic efficacy particularly of fructose-restricted diet. Additional efforts are still needed to fill this research gap and clarify the most efficient way for tailoring dietary restrictions based on the patient's tolerance and/or identification of potential biomarkers of low Fermentable Oligosaccharides Disaccharides Monosaccharides and Polyols efficacy, to maintain nutritional adequacy and to simplify the adherence to diet by labeling Fermentable Oligosaccharides Disaccharides Monosaccharides and Polyols content in commercial products.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Children", "Disaccharides", "Fermentable oligosaccharides", "Functional abdominal pain disorders", "Monosaccharides", "Polyol diet"], "IndexKeywords": ["Abdominal Pain", "Diet", "Diet, Carbohydrate-Restricted", "Disaccharides", "Humans", "Irritable Bowel Syndrome", "Monosaccharides", "Oligosaccharides"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85064949497", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"]], "AuthorData": {"6603636934": {"Name": "Pensabene L.", "AuthorID": "6603636934", "AffiliationID": "60069616", "AffiliationName": "University \u201cMagna Graecia\u201d of Catanzaro, Pediatric Unit, Department of Medical and Surgical Sciences"}, "57208494450": {"Name": "Tarsitano F.", "AuthorID": "57208494450", "AffiliationID": "60069616", "AffiliationName": "University \u201cMagna Graecia\u201d of Catanzaro, Pediatric Unit, Department of Medical and Surgical Sciences"}, "6603378437": {"Name": "Concolino D.", "AuthorID": "6603378437", "AffiliationID": "60069616", "AffiliationName": "University \u201cMagna Graecia\u201d of Catanzaro, Pediatric Unit, Department of Medical and Surgical Sciences"}, "55390678300": {"Name": "Salvatore S.", "AuthorID": "55390678300", "AffiliationID": "60005400", "AffiliationName": "University of Insubria, Section of Pediatrics, Department of Medicine and Surgery"}, "26642248900": {"Name": "Turco R.", "AuthorID": "26642248900", "AffiliationID": "60017293", "AffiliationName": "University of Naples \u201cFederico II,\u201d Section of Pediatrics, Department of Translational Medical Science"}, "7005889428": {"Name": "Staiano A.", "AuthorID": "7005889428", "AffiliationID": "60017293", "AffiliationName": "University of Naples \u201cFederico II,\u201d Section of Pediatrics, Department of Translational Medical Science"}, "16681048900": {"Name": "Baldassarre M.E.", "AuthorID": "16681048900", "AffiliationID": "60022778", "AffiliationName": "Aldo Moro University of Bari, Department of Biomedical Science and Human Oncology"}, "6602467294": {"Name": "Borrelli O.", "AuthorID": "6602467294", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children, Neurogastroenterology and Motility Unit, Department of Gastroenterology"}, "8337607800": {"Name": "Thapar N.", "AuthorID": "8337607800", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children, Neurogastroenterology and Motility Unit, Department of Gastroenterology"}, "57202569212": {"Name": "Vandenplas Y.", "AuthorID": "57202569212", "AffiliationID": "60069985, 60026810", "AffiliationName": "Universitair Ziekenhuis Brussel, Vrije Universiteit Brussel, KidZ Health Castle"}, "9248105800": {"Name": "Saps M.", "AuthorID": "9248105800", "AffiliationID": "60021519, 60029251", "AffiliationName": "University of Miami, Holtz Children's Hospital, Miller School of Medicine, Division of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition"}}}
