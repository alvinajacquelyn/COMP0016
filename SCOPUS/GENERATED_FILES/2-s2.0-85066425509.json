We assess how early life risk factors might mediate the increased risk of being bullied at age seven for children living in disadvantaged circumstances. Material and methods Using data from 5,857 children in the UK Millennium Cohort Study (MCS) we calculate risk ratios (RR) for being bullied at age seven (child-reported), by household income quintile. Socially patterned risk factors for being bullied relating to social networks, family relationships and child characteristics from birth to age five were adjusted for to assess if they mediated any association between SEC and being bullied. Results 48.6% of children reported having been bullied. Children living in the lowest income households were at 20% greater risk of being bullied compared to those from the highest (RR1.20, 95%CI 1.06,1.36). Controlling for social networks, family relationships and child characteristics attenuated the increased risk for children in low income households to aRR 1.19 (95%CI 1.05, 1.35), aRR 1.16 (95%CI 1.02,1.32) and aRR 1.13 (95%CI 1.00,1.28) respectively. Our final model adjusted for risk factors across all domains attenuated the RR by 45% (aRR 1.11,95%CI 0.97,1.26). Conclusions About half of children reported being bullied by age seven with a clear social gradient. The excess risk in children growing up in disadvantaged circumstances was partially explained by differences in their early years relating to their social network, family relationships and the child's own abilities and behaviours. Policies to reduce inequalities in these risk factors may also reduce inequalities in the risk of being bullied in childhood.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Bullying", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Cohort Studies", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Risk Factors", "Socioeconomic Factors", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85066425509", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"57158254800": {"Name": "Campbell M.", "AuthorID": "57158254800", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "University of Liverpool, Public Health and Policy"}, "56469813400": {"Name": "Straatmann V.S.", "AuthorID": "56469813400", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "University of Liverpool, Public Health and Policy"}, "57208760814": {"Name": "Lai E.T.C.", "AuthorID": "57208760814", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "University of Liverpool, Public Health and Policy"}, "55544250600": {"Name": "Wickham S.L.", "AuthorID": "55544250600", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "University of Liverpool, Public Health and Policy"}, "23475904400": {"Name": "Taylor-Robinson D.C.", "AuthorID": "23475904400", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "University of Liverpool, Public Health and Policy"}, "57209070740": {"Name": "Potier J.", "AuthorID": "57209070740", "AffiliationID": "60024857", "AffiliationName": "Alder Hey Children's NHS Foundation Trust, Liverpool Fresh Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS)"}, "54969700200": {"Name": "Pereira S.M.P.", "AuthorID": "54969700200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Institute of Epidemiology and Health Care"}}}
