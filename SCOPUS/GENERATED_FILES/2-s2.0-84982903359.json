Of those that have, most employ time courses of functional maturation that are rather protracted, and none have fully characterized all aspects of neuronal function, from spontaneous action potential generation through to postsynaptic receptor maturation. Here, we describe a simple protocol that employs the sequential addition of just two supplemented media that have been formulated to separate the two key phases of neural differentiation, the neurogenesis and synaptogenesis, each characterized by different signaling requirements. Employing these media, this new protocol synchronized neurogenesis and enhanced the rate of maturation of pluripotent stem cell-derived neural precursors. Neurons differentiated using this protocol exhibited large cell capacitance with relatively hyperpolarized resting membrane potentials; moreover, they exhibited augmented: 1) spontaneous electrical activity; 2) regenerative induced action potential train activity; 3) Na+ current availability, and 4) synaptic currents. This was accomplished by rapid and uniform development of a mature, inhibitory GABAA receptor phenotype that was demonstrated by Ca2+ imaging and the ability of GABAA receptor blockers to evoke seizurogenic network activity in multielectrode array recordings. Furthermore, since this protocol can exploit expanded and frozen prepatterned neural progenitors to deliver mature neurons within 21 days, it is both scalable and transferable to highthroughput platforms for the use in functional screens.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Embryonic stem cells", "EPSCs", "GABAA", "Induced pluripotent stem cells", "IPSCs", "Neural differentiation", "Neuronal maturation", "Patch clamp"], "IndexKeywords": ["Blotting, Western", "Cell Culture Techniques", "Cell Cycle", "Cell Differentiation", "Cell Line", "Coculture Techniques", "Culture Media", "Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein", "Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3", "Humans", "Image Processing, Computer-Assisted", "Immunohistochemistry", "Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells", "Microscopy, Electron, Scanning", "Neural Stem Cells", "Neurogenesis", "Patch-Clamp Techniques", "Receptors, GABA-A"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84982903359", "SubjectAreas": [["Physiology", "BIOC", "1314"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"23398379900": {"Name": "Telezhkin V.", "AuthorID": "23398379900", "AffiliationID": "60170432, 60023998", "AffiliationName": "School of Biosciences, Cardiff University"}, "55026847400": {"Name": "Schnell C.", "AuthorID": "55026847400", "AffiliationID": "60170432, 60023998", "AffiliationName": "School of Biosciences, Cardiff University"}, "35079893300": {"Name": "Yarova P.", "AuthorID": "35079893300", "AffiliationID": "60170432, 60023998", "AffiliationName": "School of Biosciences, Cardiff University"}, "56609923800": {"Name": "Yung S.", "AuthorID": "56609923800", "AffiliationID": "60170432, 60023998", "AffiliationName": "School of Biosciences, Cardiff University"}, "57190751600": {"Name": "Cope E.", "AuthorID": "57190751600", "AffiliationID": "60170432, 60023998", "AffiliationName": "School of Biosciences, Cardiff University"}, "8124415500": {"Name": "Hughes A.", "AuthorID": "8124415500", "AffiliationID": "60170432, 60023998", "AffiliationName": "School of Biosciences, Cardiff University"}, "57217451107": {"Name": "Thompson B.A.", "AuthorID": "57217451107", "AffiliationID": "60170432, 60023998", "AffiliationName": "School of Biosciences, Cardiff University"}, "57190759256": {"Name": "Geater C.", "AuthorID": "57190759256", "AffiliationID": "60170432, 60023998", "AffiliationName": "School of Biosciences, Cardiff University"}, "57125760400": {"Name": "Joy S.", "AuthorID": "57125760400", "AffiliationID": "60170432, 60023998", "AffiliationName": "School of Biosciences, Cardiff University"}, "55624278600": {"Name": "Badder L.", "AuthorID": "55624278600", "AffiliationID": "60170432, 60023998", "AffiliationName": "School of Biosciences, Cardiff University"}, "37861074600": {"Name": "Connor-Robson N.", "AuthorID": "37861074600", "AffiliationID": "60170432, 60023998", "AffiliationName": "School of Biosciences, Cardiff University"}, "7202441188": {"Name": "Allen N.D.", "AuthorID": "7202441188", "AffiliationID": "60170432, 60023998", "AffiliationName": "School of Biosciences, Cardiff University"}, "7102163362": {"Name": "Kemp P.J.", "AuthorID": "7102163362", "AffiliationID": "60170432, 60023998", "AffiliationName": "School of Biosciences, Cardiff University"}, "56596190900": {"Name": "Sanders P.", "AuthorID": "56596190900", "AffiliationID": "60085102", "AffiliationName": "Centro de Investigaci\u00f3n Biom\u00e9dica en Red sobre Enfermedades Neurodegenerativas (CIBERNED)"}, "57216528468": {"Name": "Comella A.", "AuthorID": "57216528468", "AffiliationID": "60085102", "AffiliationName": "Centro de Investigaci\u00f3n Biom\u00e9dica en Red sobre Enfermedades Neurodegenerativas (CIBERNED)"}, "8353978200": {"Name": "Straccia M.", "AuthorID": "8353978200", "AffiliationID": "60085102", "AffiliationName": "Centro de Investigaci\u00f3n Biom\u00e9dica en Red sobre Enfermedades Neurodegenerativas (CIBERNED)"}, "36473137500": {"Name": "Bombau G.", "AuthorID": "36473137500", "AffiliationID": "60085102", "AffiliationName": "Centro de Investigaci\u00f3n Biom\u00e9dica en Red sobre Enfermedades Neurodegenerativas (CIBERNED)"}, "35585802400": {"Name": "Canals J.M.", "AuthorID": "35585802400", "AffiliationID": "60085102", "AffiliationName": "Centro de Investigaci\u00f3n Biom\u00e9dica en Red sobre Enfermedades Neurodegenerativas (CIBERNED)"}, "35366345800": {"Name": "Hancock J.M.", "AuthorID": "35366345800", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "School of Physiology and Pharmacology, University of Bristol"}, "7102425663": {"Name": "Randall A.D.", "AuthorID": "7102425663", "AffiliationID": "60111707", "AffiliationName": "Hatherly Laboratory, Institute of Biomedical and Clinical Sciences, University of Exeter Medical School"}, "56169451300": {"Name": "Brown J.T.", "AuthorID": "56169451300", "AffiliationID": "60111707", "AffiliationName": "Hatherly Laboratory, Institute of Biomedical and Clinical Sciences, University of Exeter Medical School"}}}
