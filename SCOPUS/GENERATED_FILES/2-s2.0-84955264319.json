However, transient ischaemia may also occur due to coronary spasm leading to acute and unexpected myocardial ischaemia without obvious visible coronary pathology. Aside from symptoms of chest pain, coronary spasm can cause infarction, LV impairment, promote life threatening arrhythmias and ultimately sudden cardiac death. While therapeutic options are available, controversies exist around diagnosis, pathology, management and prognosis. This review summarises some of the common questions in this area. In particular we explore and discuss the available evidence for the pharmacological treatment of coronary spasm, and strategies for identification and management of very high risk patients to try and reduce the incidence of sudden premature death.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Coronary spasm", "Printzmetal angina", "Variant angina"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84955264319", "SubjectAreas": [["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"15137580700": {"Name": "Slavich M.", "AuthorID": "15137580700", "AffiliationID": "60103762", "AffiliationName": "Unit\u00e0 Terapia Intensiva Coronarica, IRCCS Ospedale San Raffale"}, "23985899500": {"Name": "Patel R.S.", "AuthorID": "23985899500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences, University College London"}}}
