However, the current evidence came predominantly from Caucasians and the role of genomic ancestry has not been investigated. Objective We investigated the prognostic value of multiple citokynes and chemokines for incident disability in admixed older Brazilians and whether genomic African and Native American ancestry affects the association. Design Population-based longitudinal study. Setting The Bambui-Epigen (Brazil) Cohort Study of Aging. Subjects 1171 males and females aged \u226560 years over 15-year of follow-up. Methods Outcome examined was incident activity of daily living (ADL) disability assessed annually (10,039 measures were performed). Serum levels of citokynes (IL6, IL12, TNF, IL10, and IL1\u03b2) and chemokines (CCL2, CCL5, CXCL8, CXCL9 and CXCL10) were measured at baseline. We used 370,539 Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) to estimate each individual genomic ancestry proportions. Potential confounding variables included a wide range of socio-demographic variables and health indicators. Statistical analyses were based on competing risk framework. Results The incidence rate of disability was 57.9 per 1000 person-years. IL6 level at the highest quartile showed an independent association with ADL disability (SRH = 1.32; 95% CI: 1.03, 1.70). Other inflammatory markers showed no statistically significant associations with the outcome. Neither genomic African nor Native American ancestry had an effect modifier on the associations (P for interaction >0.05 for all). Conclusion Among multi-inflammatory markers, only IL6 had the potential to identify people at increased risk of ADL disability, independently of ethno-racial background.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Activity of daily living", "Ageing", "Disability", "Genomic african ancestry", "Inflammation", "Interleukin 6"], "IndexKeywords": ["Activities of Daily Living", "African Americans", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Disability Evaluation", "European Continental Ancestry Group", "Female", "Humans", "Interleukin-6", "Longitudinal Studies", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85020424667", "SubjectAreas": [["Health (social science)", "SOCI", "3306"], ["Aging", "BIOC", "1302"], ["Gerontology", "NURS", "2909"], ["Geriatrics and Gerontology", "MEDI", "2717"]], "AuthorData": {"7003633117": {"Name": "Lima-Costa M.", "AuthorID": "7003633117", "AffiliationID": "60026004", "AffiliationName": "Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, Rene Rachou Research Institute"}, "55971119700": {"Name": "Mambrini J.", "AuthorID": "55971119700", "AffiliationID": "60026004", "AffiliationName": "Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, Rene Rachou Research Institute"}, "8543822600": {"Name": "Torres K.", "AuthorID": "8543822600", "AffiliationID": "60026004", "AffiliationName": "Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, Rene Rachou Research Institute"}, "7004020400": {"Name": "Peixoto S.", "AuthorID": "7004020400", "AffiliationID": "60030074", "AffiliationName": "Federal University of Minas Gerais, School of Nursing"}, "56371544300": {"Name": "Andrade F.", "AuthorID": "56371544300", "AffiliationID": "60026004", "AffiliationName": "Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, Rene Rachou Research Institute"}, "15754774600": {"Name": "Teixeira-Carvalho A.", "AuthorID": "15754774600", "AffiliationID": "60026004", "AffiliationName": "Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, Rene Rachou Research Institute"}, "7004148391": {"Name": "Martins-Filho O.", "AuthorID": "7004148391", "AffiliationID": "60026004", "AffiliationName": "Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, Rene Rachou Research Institute"}, "7102223177": {"Name": "De Oliveira C.", "AuthorID": "7102223177", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Department of Epidemiology & Public Health"}, "6602570139": {"Name": "Tarazona-Santos E.", "AuthorID": "6602570139", "AffiliationID": "60030074", "AffiliationName": "Federal University of Minas Gerais, Institute of Biological Sciences"}}}
