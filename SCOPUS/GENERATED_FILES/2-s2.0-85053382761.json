The DAMOCLES Monte Carlo line radiative transfer code models the extent and shape of these dust-affected line profiles to determine the dust mass that has condensed, in addition to other properties of the dusty ejecta. I present here the application of an affine invariant Markov ChainMonte Carlo ensemble sampler (EMCEE) to the DAMOCLES code in order to investigate the multidimensional parameter space rigorously and characterize the posterior probability distribution. A likelihood function is formulated that handles both Monte Carlo and observational uncertainties. This Bayesian approach is applied to four simulated line profiles in order to test the method and investigate its efficacy. The majority of parameters can be tightly constrained using this method, and a strong (predictable) dependence between the grain size and the dust mass is quantified. The new approach is also applied to the H \u03b1 line and [OI] 6300, 6363\u00c5 doublet of SN 1987A at 714 d post-outburst, re-examining a previous 5D smooth model and also investigating a new, more complex, 10D model that treats both features simultaneously. The dust mass, dust grain size, and a range of other parameters can be well constrained using this technique, representing a significant improvement over the previous manual approach.", "AuthorKeywords": ["ISM: supernova remnants", "Line: profiles", "Methods: statistical", "Radiative transfer", "Supernovae: general", "Supernovae: individual: SN 1987A"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85053382761", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"57208853978": {"Name": "Bevan A.", "AuthorID": "57208853978", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}}}
