However, the adoption of new approaches by clinical laboratories requires careful evaluation of all potential sources of error and the development of strategies to ensure the highest accuracy. Timely and efficient clinical use of HTS platforms will depend on combining multiple samples (multiplexing) in each sequencing run. Here we examine the Ig heavy-chain gene HTS on the Illumina MiSeq platform for MRD. We identify errors associated with multiplexing that could potentially impact the accuracy of MRD analysis. We optimize a strategy that combines high-purity, sequence-optimized oligonucleotides, dual indexing, and an error-aware demultiplexing approach to minimize errors and maximize sensitivity. We present a probability-based, demultiplexing pipeline Error-Aware Demultiplexer that is suitable for all MiSeq strategies and accurately assigns samples to the correct identifier without excessive loss of data. Finally, using controls quantified by digital PCR, we show that HTS-MRD can accurately detect as few as 1 in 106 copies of specific leukemic MRD.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Computational Biology", "High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing", "Humans", "Multiplex Polymerase Chain Reaction", "Neoplasm, Residual", "Reference Values", "Reproducibility of Results", "Sensitivity and Specificity", "Software"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84992034190", "SubjectAreas": [["Pathology and Forensic Medicine", "MEDI", "2734"], ["Molecular Medicine", "BIOC", "1313"]], "AuthorData": {"57189756418": {"Name": "Bartram J.", "AuthorID": "57189756418", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children"}, "57203072549": {"Name": "Hubank M.", "AuthorID": "57203072549", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Genomics Centre, Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "55531982300": {"Name": "Brooks T.", "AuthorID": "55531982300", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Genomics Centre, Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "57193167578": {"Name": "Wright G.", "AuthorID": "57193167578", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children"}, "7003968157": {"Name": "Goulden N.", "AuthorID": "7003968157", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children"}, "57191613190": {"Name": "Mountjoy E.", "AuthorID": "57191613190", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "School of Social and Community Medicine, University of Bristol"}, "7202389355": {"Name": "Hancock J.", "AuthorID": "7202389355", "AffiliationID": "60016447, 60027676", "AffiliationName": "Bristol Genetics Laboratory, Southmead Hospital, North Bristol NHS Trust"}, "57191623438": {"Name": "Williamson H.", "AuthorID": "57191623438", "AffiliationID": "60016447, 60027676", "AffiliationName": "Bristol Genetics Laboratory, Southmead Hospital, North Bristol NHS Trust"}, "6602624239": {"Name": "Moppett J.", "AuthorID": "6602624239", "AffiliationID": "106748071", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Haematology/Oncology, Royal Hospital for Children"}}}
