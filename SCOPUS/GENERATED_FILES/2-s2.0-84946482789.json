We report on the acceptability/attitude of UK health professionals towards RRSDO. An anonymised web-based survey was sent to UK Cancer Genetics Group (CGG) and British Gynaecological Cancer Society (BGCS) members to assess attitudes towards RRSDO. Baseline characteristics were described using descriptive statistics. A Chi square test was used to compare categorical, Kendal-tau-b test for ordinal and Mann\u2013Whitney test for continuous variables between two groups. 173/708 (24.4 %) of invitees responded. 71 % respondents (CGG = 57 %/BGCS = 83 %, p = 0.005) agreed with the tubal hypothesis for OC, 55 % (CGG = 42 %/BGCS = 66 %, p = 0.003) had heard of RRSDO and 48 % (CGG = 46 %/BGCS = 50 %) felt evidence was not currently strong enough for introduction into clinical practice. However, 60 % respondents\u2019 (CGG = 48 %/BGCS = 71 %, p = 0.009) favoured offering RRSDO to high-risk women declining RRSO, 77 % only supported RRSDO within a clinical trial (CGG = 78 %/BGCS = 76 %) and 81 % (CGG = 76 %/BGCS = 86 %) advocated a UK-wide registry. Vasomotor symptoms (72 %), impact on sexual function (63 %), osteoporosis (59 %), hormonal-therapy (55 %) and subfertility (48 %) related to premature menopause influenced their choice of RRSDO. Potential barriers to offering the two-stage procedure included lack of data on precise level of benefit (83 %), increased surgical morbidity (79 %), loss of breast cancer risk reduction associated with oophorectomy (68 %), need for long-term follow-up (61 %) and a proportion not undergoing DO (66 %). There were variations in perception between BGCS/CGG members which are probably attributable to differences in clinical focus/expertise between these two groups. Despite concerns, there is reasonable support amongst UK clinicians to offering RRSDO to premenopausal high-risk women wishing to avoid RRSO, within a prospective clinical trial.", "AuthorKeywords": ["BRCA", "Delayed oophorectomy", "High-risk", "Ovarian cancer", "Risk reducing salpingectomy", "RRSDO"], "IndexKeywords": ["Attitude of Health Personnel", "BRCA1 Protein", "BRCA2 Protein", "Female", "Genetic Counseling", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Germ-Line Mutation", "Humans", "Ovarian Neoplasms", "Ovariectomy", "Practice Patterns, Physicians'", "Prognosis", "Risk Reduction Behavior", "Salpingectomy"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84946482789", "SubjectAreas": [["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Genetics (clinical)", "MEDI", "2716"], ["Cancer Research", "BIOC", "1306"]], "AuthorData": {"56721050600": {"Name": "Chandrasekaran D.", "AuthorID": "56721050600", "AffiliationID": "60023346", "AffiliationName": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Northampton General Hospital"}, "55318584600": {"Name": "Menon U.", "AuthorID": "55318584600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Women\u2019s Cancer, EGA Institute for Women\u2019s Health, Gynaecological Cancer Research Centre, University College London"}, "7006828259": {"Name": "Manchanda R.", "AuthorID": "7006828259", "AffiliationID": "60010088, 60159931", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gynaecological Oncology, Bartshealth NHS Trust, Royal London Hospital"}, "12781274600": {"Name": "Evans G.", "AuthorID": "12781274600", "AffiliationID": "60022871", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genetic Medicine, St Mary\u2019s Hospital"}, "7402584619": {"Name": "Crawford R.", "AuthorID": "7402584619", "AffiliationID": "60017488", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gynaecological Oncology, Addenbrookes Hospital"}, "6701499033": {"Name": "Saridogan E.", "AuthorID": "6701499033", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gynaecology, University College London Hospital"}, "7004871743": {"Name": "Jurkovic D.", "AuthorID": "7004871743", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gynaecology, University College London Hospital"}, "7202179356": {"Name": "Jacobs C.", "AuthorID": "7202179356", "AffiliationID": "60009797", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Genetics, Guys Hospital"}, "55646821200": {"Name": "Tischkowitz M.", "AuthorID": "55646821200", "AffiliationID": "60031101, 60017488", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Genetics, University of Cambridge, Addenbrookes Hospital"}, "35168788400": {"Name": "Brockbank E.", "AuthorID": "35168788400", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Experimental Cancer Medicine, Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London"}, "7003994115": {"Name": "Kalsi J.", "AuthorID": "7003994115", "AffiliationID": "60010088, 60159931", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gynaecological Oncology, Bartshealth NHS Trust, Royal London Hospital"}}}
