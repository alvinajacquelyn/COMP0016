We investigate the high-pressure electronic and structural ground state of K, Rb, and Cs using x-ray absorption spectroscopy and x-ray diffraction measurements together with abinitio theoretical calculations. The sequence of phase transitions under pressure observed at low temperature is similar in all three heavy alkalis except for the absence of the oC84 phase in Cs. Both the experimental and theoretical results point to pressure-enhanced localization of the valence electrons characterized by pseudogap formation near the Fermi level and strong spd hybridization. Although the crystal structures predicted to host magnetic order in K are not observed, the localization process appears to drive these alkalis closer to a strongly correlated electron state.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84923264969", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"]], "AuthorData": {"36645777500": {"Name": "Fabbris G.", "AuthorID": "36645777500", "AffiliationID": "60010261", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Washington University"}, "54959901300": {"Name": "Veiga L.", "AuthorID": "54959901300", "AffiliationID": "60029570", "AffiliationName": "Instituto de F\u00edsica Gleb Wataghin, UNICAMP"}, "57204337680": {"Name": "Haskel D.", "AuthorID": "57204337680", "AffiliationID": "60005498, 60028609", "AffiliationName": "Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory"}, "55876712700": {"Name": "Lim J.", "AuthorID": "55876712700", "AffiliationID": "60010261", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Washington University"}, "56203661300": {"Name": "Schilling J.", "AuthorID": "56203661300", "AffiliationID": "60010261", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Washington University"}}}
