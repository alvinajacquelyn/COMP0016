The oxidative stability and the lipid profile of non-fermented and fermented sarshir were compared, in addition to radical scavenging activity, as well as peroxide, anisidine and carbonyl values (PV, AnV and CV, respectively). RESULTS: The strong antibacterial activity of fermented sarshir against common pathogenic bacteria, including Gram-negative Escherichia coli O157: H7 ATCC 35150 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, as well as Gram-positive Bacillus cereus ATCC 10876 and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, was established. Among the strains examined, L. plantarum LP3 exhibited the highest radical scavenging activity (53.1 \u00b1 1.8%) and lowest PV (3.0 meq kg\u20131), AnV (1.31 \u00b1 0.06) and CV (1.4 \u00b1 0.08). The pH of sarshir decreased from 6.2 \u00b1 0 to 3.5 \u00b1 0.1 during 14 h of fermentation. Incorporated bacterial cells exhibited notable viability during 10 days of cold storage (4 \u00b0C). CONCLUSION: The fermentation of sarshir by L. plantarum strains, especially LP3, resulted in beneficial changes in radical scavenging activity, as well as PV, AnV and carbonyl values, in addition to a broad spectrum of inhibitory activity against strains of P. aeruginosa, E. coli O157:H7, B. cereus and S. aureus. \u00a9 2017 Society of Chemical Industry.", "AuthorKeywords": ["antibacterial activity", "antioxidant capacity", "fermentation", "Lactobacillus plantarum", "probiotic", "sarshir"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Anti-Bacterial Agents", "Antioxidants", "Cattle", "Dairy Products", "Escherichia coli O157", "Fatty Acids", "Fermentation", "Lactobacillus plantarum", "Lipids", "Milk", "Milk Proteins", "Oxidation-Reduction", "Pseudomonas aeruginosa", "Staphylococcus aureus"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85018436163", "SubjectAreas": [["Biotechnology", "BIOC", "1305"], ["Food Science", "AGRI", "1106"], ["Agronomy and Crop Science", "AGRI", "1102"], ["Nutrition and Dietetics", "NURS", "2916"]], "AuthorData": {"55927243400": {"Name": "Hashemi S.M.B.", "AuthorID": "55927243400", "AffiliationID": "60109046", "AffiliationName": "Department of Food Science and Technology, College of Agriculture, Fasa University"}, "57203634349": {"Name": "Mousavi Khaneghah A.", "AuthorID": "57203634349", "AffiliationID": "60029570", "AffiliationName": "Department of Food Science, Faculty of Food Engineering, University of Campinas (UNICAMP)"}, "57192073087": {"Name": "Sant'Ana A.S.", "AuthorID": "57192073087", "AffiliationID": "60029570", "AffiliationName": "Department of Food Science, Faculty of Food Engineering, University of Campinas (UNICAMP)"}, "57217321900": {"Name": "Martinez R.R.", "AuthorID": "57217321900", "AffiliationID": "60029570", "AffiliationName": "Department of Food Science, Faculty of Food Engineering, University of Campinas (UNICAMP)"}, "7004189818": {"Name": "Kontominas M.G.", "AuthorID": "7004189818", "AffiliationID": "60004716", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Food Chemistry, Department of Chemistry, University of Ioannina"}, "56507330400": {"Name": "E\u015f I.", "AuthorID": "56507330400", "AffiliationID": "60029570", "AffiliationName": "Department of Material and Bioprocess Engineering, Faculty of Chemical Engineering, University of Campinas (UNICAMP)"}, "6603389799": {"Name": "Drider D.", "AuthorID": "6603389799", "AffiliationID": "60104665", "AffiliationName": "University Lille 1 Sciences and Technologies, Charles Viollette Institute"}}}
