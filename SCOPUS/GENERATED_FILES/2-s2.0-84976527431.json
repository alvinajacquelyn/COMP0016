The strategy was designed to encourage the supply chain to develop and apply genuinely beneficial new products, processes and services \u2212 then to ensure these were shared throughout the project. The authors identify the steps taken, the managerial process created and the lessons learnt in developing and implementing the strategy. The aim is to contribute to a wider discussion on innovation in the infrastructure community: shifting from mantras about the intrinsic benefits of innovation to evidence about the most effective methods for managing it.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Project management", "Railway systems", "Transport management"], "IndexKeywords": ["Innovation strategy", "London , UK", "Managing innovation", "Railway system", "Transport management"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84976527431", "SubjectAreas": [["Civil and Structural Engineering", "ENGI", "2205"]], "AuthorData": {"56422362400": {"Name": "DeBarro T.", "AuthorID": "56422362400", "AffiliationID": "109478653", "AffiliationName": "Nichols Group"}, "56421857500": {"Name": "MacAulay S.", "AuthorID": "56421857500", "AffiliationID": "60160279, 60031004", "AffiliationName": "UQ Business School, University of Queensland"}, "57210968448": {"Name": "Davies A.", "AuthorID": "57210968448", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "24336498100": {"Name": "Wolstenholme A.", "AuthorID": "24336498100", "AffiliationID": "60111669", "AffiliationName": "Crossrail Ltd"}, "7101878435": {"Name": "Gann D.", "AuthorID": "7101878435", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Imperial College London"}, "7006602657": {"Name": "Pelton J.", "AuthorID": "7006602657", "AffiliationID": "60111669", "AffiliationName": "Crossrail Ltd and CH2M Hill"}}}
