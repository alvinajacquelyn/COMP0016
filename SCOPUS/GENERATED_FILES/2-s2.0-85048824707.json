The current study investigates the effects of language dominance switch in Galician new speakers (neofalantes) who are raised with Spanish as a primary language and learn Galician at an early age in a bilingual environment, but in adolescence, decide to switch to using Galician almost exclusively, for ideological reasons. Results showed that neofalantes pattern with Spanish-dominants in their perception and production of mid-vowel and fricative contrasts, but with Galician-dominants in their realisation of unstressed word-final vowels, a highly salient feature of Galician. These results are taken to suggest that despite early exposure to Galician, high motivation and almost exclusive Galician language use post-switch, there are limitations to what neofalantes can learn in both production and perception, but that the hybrid categories they appear to develop may function as opportunities to mark identity within a particular community.", "AuthorKeywords": ["language dominance switch", "new speakers", "speech perception", "speech production"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85048824707", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["Language and Linguistics", "ARTS", "1203"], ["Linguistics and Language", "SOCI", "3310"]], "AuthorData": {"57188875782": {"Name": "Lourido G.T.", "AuthorID": "57188875782", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Speech, Hearing and Phonetic Sciences, University College London"}, "36922341100": {"Name": "Evans B.G.", "AuthorID": "36922341100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Speech, Hearing and Phonetic Sciences, University College London"}}}
