Open Access article distributed under the terms of CC BY.Background: Working long hours might have adverse health effects, but whether this is true for all socioeconomic status groups is unclear. In this meta-analysis stratified by socioeconomic status, we investigated the role of long working hours as a risk factor for type 2 diabetes. Methods: We identified four published studies through a systematic literature search of PubMed and Embase up to April 30, 2014. Study inclusion criteria were English-language publication; prospective design (cohort study); investigation of the effect of working hours or overtime work; incident diabetes as an outcome; and relative risks, odds ratios, or hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% CIs, or sufficient information to calculate these estimates. Additionally, we used unpublished individual-level data from 19 cohort studies from the Individual-Participant-Data Meta-analysis in Working-Populations Consortium and international open-access data archives. Effect estimates from published and unpublished data from 222120 men and women from the USA, Europe, Japan, and Australia were pooled with random-effects meta-analysis. Findings: During 1.7 million person-years at risk, 4963 individuals developed diabetes (incidence 29 per 10000 person-years). The minimally adjusted summary risk ratio for long (\u226555 h per week) compared with standard working hours (35-40 h) was 1.07 (95% CI 0.89-1.27, difference in incidence three cases per 10000 person-years) with significant heterogeneity in study-specific estimates (I<sup>2</sup>=53%, p=0.0016). In an analysis stratified by socioeconomic status, the association between long working hours and diabetes was evident in the low socioeconomic status group (risk ratio 1.29, 95% CI 1.06-1.57, difference in incidence 13 per 10000 person-years, I<sup>2</sup>=0%, p=0.4662), but was null in the high socioeconomic status group (1.00, 95% CI 0.80-1.25, incidence difference zero per 10000 person-years, I<sup>2</sup>=15%, p=0.2464). The association in the low socioeconomic status group was robust to adjustment for age, sex, obesity, and physical activity, and remained after exclusion of shift workers. Interpretation: In this meta-analysis, the link between longer working hours and type 2 diabetes was apparent only in individuals in the low socioeconomic status groups.
