Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of Association for Child and Adolescent Mental HealthBackground: Among adults with schizophrenia, evidence suggests that premorbid deficits in different cognitive domains follow distinct developmental courses during childhood and adolescence. The aim of this study was to delineate trajectories of adolescent cognitive functions prospectively among different groups of youth at-risk for schizophrenia, relative to their typically developing (TD) peers. Method: Using linear mixed models adjusted for sex, ethnicity, parental occupation and practice effects, cognitive development between ages 9 and 16 years was compared for youth characterised by a triad of well-replicated developmental antecedents of schizophrenia (ASz; N = 32) and youth with a least one affected relative with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder (FHx; N = 29), relative to TD youth (N = 45). Participants completed measures of IQ, scholastic achievement, memory and executive function at three time-points, separated by approximately 24-month intervals. Results: Compared to TD youth, both ASz and FHx youth displayed stable developmental deficits in verbal working memory and inhibition/switching executive functions. ASz youth additionally presented with stable deficits in measures of vocabulary (IQ), word reading, numerical operations, and category fluency executive function, and a slower rate of growth (developmental lag) on spelling from 9 to 16 years than TD peers. Conversely, faster rates of growth relative to TD peers (developmental delay) were observed on visual and verbal memory, and on category fluency executive function (ASz youth only) and on matrix reasoning (IQ) and word reading (FHx youth only). Conclusions: These differential patterns of deviation from normative adolescent cognitive development among at-risk youth imply potential for cognitive rehabilitation targeting of specific cognitive deficits at different developmental phases.", "AuthorKeywords": ["academic performance", "executive function", "intelligence", "memory", "Psychosis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adolescent Development", "Child", "Child Development", "Cognition", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Medical History Taking", "Neuropsychological Tests", "Risk Factors", "Schizophrenia"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85055077836", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"25824928700": {"Name": "Dickson H.", "AuthorID": "25824928700", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Forensic and Neurodevelopmental Sciences, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience, King's College London"}, "56146760000": {"Name": "Roberts R.E.", "AuthorID": "56146760000", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Forensic and Neurodevelopmental Sciences, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience, King's College London"}, "6602372494": {"Name": "Laurens K.R.", "AuthorID": "6602372494", "AffiliationID": "60028333", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychiatry, University of New South Wales"}, "36135229700": {"Name": "Cullen A.E.", "AuthorID": "36135229700", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychosis Studies, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience, King's College London"}, "55782719300": {"Name": "Reichenberg A.", "AuthorID": "55782719300", "AffiliationID": "60012981", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry and Preventive Medicine, The Freidman Brain Institute, Ichan School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"}, "57192098590": {"Name": "Jones R.", "AuthorID": "57192098590", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, University College London"}, "57206133272": {"Name": "Hodgins S.", "AuthorID": "57206133272", "AffiliationID": "60009507", "AffiliationName": "D\u00e9partement de Psychiatrie, Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al"}, "7404060505": {"Name": "Morris R.G.", "AuthorID": "7404060505", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience, Kings College London"}}}
