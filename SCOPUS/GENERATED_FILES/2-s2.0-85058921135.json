PPMI is a strong predictor of outcomes following coronary intervention, but its impact in the context of TAVR remains unclear. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to ascertain the association between PPMI and short- or long-term outcomes. METHODS AND RESULTS: Electronic searches identified studies reporting PPMI following TAVR. Primary end point was 30-day all-cause mortality, with secondary end points, including 1-year all-cause mortality, neurological events, post-TAVR pacemaker implantation, and aortic regurgitation. Analyses were performed using random effects modeling and reported as summary odds ratio (OR) with 95% CI. Nine studies comprising 3442 patients (mean age 81.0\u00b16.6 years, 51.2% female) were included. PPMI occurred in 25.5% of patients following TAVR. The pooled all-cause mortality at 30-days and 1-year was 5.2% and 18.6%, respectively. The occurrence of PPMI following TAVR was associated with significantly increased risk of both 30-day (OR, 4.23; CI, 1.95-9.19; P<0.001) and 1-year all-cause mortality (OR, 1.77; CI, 1.05-2.99; P<0.001). Similarly, PPMI was associated with post-TAVR neurological events (OR, 2.72; CI, 1.69-4.37; P<0.001) and post-TAVR permanent pacing (OR, 1.43; CI, 1.02-2.00; P=0.04) but not with a statistically significant increase in aortic regurgitation post-TAVR (OR, 1.39; CI, 0.93-2.08; P=0.11). CONCLUSIONS: PPMI is common following TAVR and is strongly associated with 30-day and 1-year mortality. Detection of PPMI has potential to identify TAVR patients at highest risk of subsequent adverse events.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Coronary artery disease", "Mortality", "Myocardial infarction", "Percutaneous coronary intervention", "Transcatheter aortic valve replacement"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged, 80 and over", "Aortic Valve Stenosis", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Myocardial Infarction", "Risk Assessment", "Risk Factors", "Severity of Illness Index", "Time Factors", "Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85058921135", "SubjectAreas": [["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"56378442500": {"Name": "Michail M.", "AuthorID": "56378442500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}, "44461754500": {"Name": "Nerlekar N.", "AuthorID": "44461754500", "AffiliationID": "60012932, 60019578", "AffiliationName": "Monash Cardiovascular Research Centre, Monash University, MonashHeart, Monash Health"}, "56162680200": {"Name": "Ihdayhid A.R.", "AuthorID": "56162680200", "AffiliationID": "60012932, 60019578", "AffiliationName": "Monash Cardiovascular Research Centre, Monash University, MonashHeart, Monash Health"}, "26644071400": {"Name": "McCormick L.M.", "AuthorID": "26644071400", "AffiliationID": "60012932, 60019578", "AffiliationName": "Monash Cardiovascular Research Centre, Monash University, MonashHeart, Monash Health"}, "55646597000": {"Name": "Gooley R.", "AuthorID": "55646597000", "AffiliationID": "60012932, 60019578", "AffiliationName": "Monash Cardiovascular Research Centre, Monash University, MonashHeart, Monash Health"}, "55482900700": {"Name": "Brown A.J.", "AuthorID": "55482900700", "AffiliationID": "60012932, 60019578", "AffiliationName": "Monash Cardiovascular Research Centre, Monash University, MonashHeart, Monash Health"}, "57214392450": {"Name": "Cameron J.N.", "AuthorID": "57214392450", "AffiliationID": "60029329", "AffiliationName": "St George's University of London"}, "6602001209": {"Name": "Niccoli G.", "AuthorID": "6602001209", "AffiliationID": "60073799, 60031984", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiovascular and Thoracic Sciences, Fondazione Policlinico A.
