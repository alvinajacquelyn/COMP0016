Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Nucleic Acids Research.The IUPHAR/BPS Guide to PHARMACOLOGY (GtoPdb, www.guidetopharmacology.org) and its precursor IUPHAR-DB, have captured expert-curated interactions between targets and ligands from selected papers in pharmacology and drug discovery since 2003. This resource continues to be developed in conjunction with the International Union of Basic and Clinical Pharmacology (IUPHAR) and the British Pharmacological Society (BPS). As previously described, our unique model of content selection and quality control is based on 96 target-class subcommittees comprising 512 scientists collaborating with in-house curators. This update describes content expansion, new features and interoperability improvements introduced in the 10 releases since August 2015. Our relationship matrix now describes 1/49000 ligands, 1/415 000 binding constants, 1/46000 papers and 1/41700 human proteins. As an important addition, we also introduce our newly funded project for the Guide to IMMUNOPHARMACOLOGY (GtoImmuPdb, www.guidetoimmunopharmacology.org). This has been 'forked' from the well-established GtoPdb data model and expanded into new types of data related to the immune system and inflammatory processes. This includes new ligands, targets, pathways, cell types and diseases for which we are recruiting new IUPHAR expert committees. Designed as an immunopharmacological gateway, it also has an emphasis on potential therapeutic interventions.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Databases, Pharmaceutical", "Humans", "Immune System", "Immune System Diseases", "Immune System Phenomena", "Ligands", "Pharmacology", "Proteins"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85040925105", "SubjectAreas": [["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"]], "AuthorData": {"57196118114": {"Name": "Harding S.D.", "AuthorID": "57196118114", "AffiliationID": "60110825, 60027272", "AffiliationName": "Deanery of Biomedical Sciences, University of Edinburgh"}, "18038776000": {"Name": "Sharman J.L.", "AuthorID": "18038776000", "AffiliationID": "60110825, 60027272", "AffiliationName": "Deanery of Biomedical Sciences, University of Edinburgh"}, "6507010871": {"Name": "Faccenda E.", "AuthorID": "6507010871", "AffiliationID": "60110825, 60027272", "AffiliationName": "Deanery of Biomedical Sciences, University of Edinburgh"}, "7004000701": {"Name": "Southan C.", "AuthorID": "7004000701", "AffiliationID": "60110825, 60027272", "AffiliationName": "Deanery of Biomedical Sciences, University of Edinburgh"}, "6602157478": {"Name": "Pawson A.J.", "AuthorID": "6602157478", "AffiliationID": "60110825, 60027272", "AffiliationName": "Deanery of Biomedical Sciences, University of Edinburgh"}, "7404983017": {"Name": "Davies J.A.", "AuthorID": "7404983017", "AffiliationID": "60110825, 60027272", "AffiliationName": "Deanery of Biomedical Sciences, University of Edinburgh"}, "57193588135": {"Name": "Ireland S.", "AuthorID": "57193588135", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London"}, "25521946600": {"Name": "Gray A.J.G.", "AuthorID": "25521946600", "AffiliationID": "60019656", "AffiliationName": "School of Mathematical and Computer Sciences, Heriot-Watt University"}, "57200331158": {"Name": "Bruce L.", "AuthorID": "57200331158", "AffiliationID": "60019656", "AffiliationName": "School of Mathematical and Computer Sciences, Heriot-Watt University"}, "10539802900": {"Name": "Alexander S.P.H.", "AuthorID": "10539802900", "AffiliationID": "60099153", "AffiliationName": "School of Life Sciences, University of Nottingham Medical School"}, "7003918967": {"Name": "Anderton S.", "AuthorID": "7003918967", "AffiliationID": "60017780, 60027272", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Inflammation Research, University of Edinburgh"}, "7103310191": {"Name": "Bryant C.", "AuthorID": "7103310191", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Veterinary Medicine, University of Cambridge"}, "35271461400": {"Name": "Davenport A.P.", "AuthorID": "35271461400", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Experimental Medicine and Immunotherapeutics, University of Cambridge"}, "7004356579": {"Name": "Doerig C.", "AuthorID": "7004356579", "AffiliationID": "60019578", "AffiliationName": "Department of Microbiology, Monash University"}, "7006688468": {"Name": "Fabbro D.", "AuthorID": "7006688468", "AffiliationID": "60112123", "AffiliationName": "PIQUR Therapeutics"}, "7006608156": {"Name": "Levi-Schaffer F.", "AuthorID": "7006608156", "AffiliationID": "60007903", "AffiliationName": "Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics Unit, School of Pharmacy, Institute for Drug Research, Hebrew University of Jerusalem"}, "7005213217": {"Name": "Spedding M.", "AuthorID": "7005213217", "AffiliationID": "60115286", "AffiliationName": "Spedding Research Solutions SAS"}, "null": {"Name": null, "AuthorID": null, "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
