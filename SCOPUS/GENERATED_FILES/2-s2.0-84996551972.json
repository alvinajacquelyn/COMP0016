The motional sidebands of the output of a cavity offer ultra-sensitive probes of the dynamics. We introduce a scheme whereby these sidebands split asymmetrically and show how they may be used as experimental diagnostics and signatures of quantum noise limited dynamics. We show split-sidebands with controllable asymmetry occur by simultaneously modulating the light-mechanical coupling g and the mechanical frequency, - slowly and out-of-phase. Such modulations are generic but already occur in optically trapped set-ups where the equilibrium point of the oscillator is varied cyclically. We analyse recently observed, but overlooked, experimental split-sideband asymmetries; although not yet in the quantum regime, the data suggests that split sideband structures are easily accessible to future experiments.", "AuthorKeywords": ["cavity optomechanics", "levitated nanoparticles", "quantum noise"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cavity optomechanics", "Experimental diagnostics", "Experimental investigations", "Mechanical coupling", "Mechanical frequency", "Mechanical oscillators", "Motional sidebands", "Sideband asymmetries"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84996551972", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"57191829340": {"Name": "Aranas E.", "AuthorID": "57191829340", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "56576042000": {"Name": "Fonseca P.", "AuthorID": "56576042000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "57203084776": {"Name": "Barker P.", "AuthorID": "57203084776", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "55950044400": {"Name": "Monteiro T.", "AuthorID": "55950044400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}}}
