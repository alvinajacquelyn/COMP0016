The cooperative agents are partitioned into independent robots, providing the control inputs, and dependent robots, controlled by local interaction laws. The proposed state estimation algorithm allows the independent robots to estimate the state of the dependent robots in a completely decentralized way. To do that, it is necessary for each independent robot to estimate the control input components computed by the other independent robots, without requiring communication among the independent robots. The decentralized state estimator, including an input estimator, is developed and the convergence properties are studied. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Convergence properties", "Cooperative agents", "Decentralized state estimation", "Heterogeneous multi-agent systems", "Local interactions", "Networked systems", "State estimation algorithms", "State Estimators"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84962026555", "SubjectAreas": [["Control and Systems Engineering", "ENGI", "2207"], ["Modeling and Simulation", "MATH", "2611"], ["Control and Optimization", "MATH", "2606"]], "AuthorData": {"54411982800": {"Name": "Boem F.", "AuthorID": "54411982800", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Dept. of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Imperial College London"}, "55210391800": {"Name": "Sabattini L.", "AuthorID": "55210391800", "AffiliationID": "60004591", "AffiliationName": "Department of Sciences and Methods for Engineering (DISMI), University of Modena and Reggio Emilia"}, "7006311975": {"Name": "Secchi C.", "AuthorID": "7006311975", "AffiliationID": "60004591", "AffiliationName": "Department of Sciences and Methods for Engineering (DISMI), University of Modena and Reggio Emilia"}}}
