Due to the in situ rectifying charge carrier separation and enhanced conductivity, the composites present superior photocatalytic activity, leading to more than 90% mineralisation of the toxic 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid herbicide. This result was confirmed by both TOC and UV-vis absorption measurements. The effect of active radicals on the photodegradation of the herbicide was further investigated in order to clarify the underlying mechanism, based on which a hole-dominated photooxidation mechanism was proposed. These results not only offer a green and economical method for constructing triple junction photocatalyst materials, but also shed new insight on the rational design of a low cost and high-efficiency photocatalyst for environmental remediation.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84918788499", "SubjectAreas": [["Catalysis", "CENG", "1503"], ["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Materials Chemistry", "MATE", "2505"]], "AuthorData": {"7102948838": {"Name": "An X.", "AuthorID": "7102948838", "AffiliationID": "60010689, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of Drinking Water Science and Technology, Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "35722558900": {"Name": "Moniz S.J.A.", "AuthorID": "35722558900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, UCL"}, "7404638641": {"Name": "Tang J.", "AuthorID": "7404638641", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, UCL"}, "36067405700": {"Name": "Liu H.", "AuthorID": "36067405700", "AffiliationID": "60010689, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of Drinking Water Science and Technology, Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "55427866900": {"Name": "Qu J.", "AuthorID": "55427866900", "AffiliationID": "60010689, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of Drinking Water Science and Technology, Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}}}
