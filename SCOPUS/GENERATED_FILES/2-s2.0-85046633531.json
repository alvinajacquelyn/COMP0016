We have reviewed 52 quantitative studies, released between 2000 and 2015 and codified 1,133 estimates. We run a regression of regressions which measures the strength of the FDI\u2013productivity relationship. Taking advantage of large number of high-quality studies on FDI and its role in explaining the growth in firms\u2019 productivity in Europe, we adopt recent meta-regression analysis methods\u2014funnel asymmetry and precision estimate tests and precision-effect estimate with standard errors\u2014to explain the heterogeneous impact of FDI. This paper assesses the country-specific impact of FDI on firms\u2019 performance, after taking publication selection bias, econometric modelling and the individual studies\u2019 characteristics fully into account. Our results show that on average FDI has a positive indirect impact on productivity. The impact is especially significant in selected European countries, and we interpret this as a sign of better absorptive capacities in those countries.", "AuthorKeywords": ["enlarged Europe", "firm performance", "foreign direct investment", "meta-regression analysis"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85046633531", "SubjectAreas": [["Accounting", "BUSI", "1402"], ["Finance", "ECON", "2003"], ["Economics and Econometrics", "ECON", "2002"], ["Political Science and International Relations", "SOCI", "3320"]], "AuthorData": {"13606033800": {"Name": "Bruno R.", "AuthorID": "13606033800", "AffiliationID": "60007893", "AffiliationName": "IZA-Bonn Institute of Labor"}, "24376256000": {"Name": "Cipollina M.", "AuthorID": "24376256000", "AffiliationID": "60014096", "AffiliationName": "Universit\u00e0 del Molise"}}}
