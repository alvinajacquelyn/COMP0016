Few studies, however, have investigated the potential co-dependency of multiple factors in determining level of insight, but such a model is necessary in order to account for patients with good cognitive functioning who have very poor awareness. As evidence suggests that set-shifting and cognitive insight (self-reflection (SR) and self-certainty) are strong predictors of awareness we proposed that these factors are key mediators in the relationship between cognition and awareness. We hypothesised that deficits specifically in SR and set-shifting determine level of awareness in the context of good cognition. Methods: Thirty schizophrenia patients were stratified by high and low awareness of illness and executive functioning scores. Cognitive insight, cognition, mood and symptom measures were compared between sub-groups. Results: A low insight/high executive functioning (LI\u2013HE) group, a high insight/high executive functioning (HI\u2013HE) group and a low insight/low executive functioning (LI\u2013LE) group were revealed. As anticipated, the LI\u2013HE patients showed significantly lower capacity for SR and set-shifting than the HI\u2013HE patients. Conclusions: This study indicates that good cognitive functioning is necessary but not sufficient for good awareness; good awareness specifically demands preserved capacity to self-reflect and shift-set. Results support Nelson and Narens\u2019 [1990. Metamemory: A theoretical framework and new findings. The Psychology of Learning and Motivation, 26, 125\u2013173] model of metacognition by which awareness is founded on control (set-shifting) and monitoring (SR) processes. These specific factors could be targeted to improve insight in patients with otherwise unimpaired cognitive function.", "AuthorKeywords": ["awareness", "cognition", "Insight", "metacognition", "schizophrenia"], "IndexKeywords": ["Awareness", "Cognition", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Neuropsychological Tests", "Psychiatric Status Rating Scales", "Schizophrenia", "Schizophrenic Psychology", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84976412152", "SubjectAreas": [["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"16636122000": {"Name": "Gilleen J.", "AuthorID": "16636122000", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Psychosis Studies, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, Kings College London"}, "7402606754": {"Name": "David A.", "AuthorID": "7402606754", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Psychosis Studies, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, Kings College London"}, "35556649600": {"Name": "Greenwood K.", "AuthorID": "35556649600", "AffiliationID": "60170299", "AffiliationName": "Early Intervention in Psychosis Service, Sussex Partnership NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
