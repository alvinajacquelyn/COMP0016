The aim of this study was to define the natural variability in spirometry in young children after an interval of 12 months. The Size and Lung function In Children study was a prospective study designed to assess spirometry and body size, shape and composition in a multi-ethnic population of London school children. 14 schools with a wide range of socioeconomic circumstances were recruited. Spirometric and anthropometric assessments and parental questionnaires pertaining to respiratory symptoms, previous medical history, pubertal status and socioeconomic circumstances were completed at baseline and \u223c1 year later. Technically acceptable spirometry data on two occasions \u223c1 year apart (range 9-16 months) were available in 758 children (39% boys, mean\u00b1SD age 8.1\u00b11.6 years), 593 of whom were classified as \"healthy\". Mean\u00b1SD within-subject between-test variability was 0.05\u00b10.6 z-scores, with 95% of all the children achieving a between-test variability within \u00b11.2 z-scores (equating to \u223c13% predicted). Natural variations of up to 1.2 z-scores occur in healthy children over \u223c1 year. These must be considered when interpreting results from annual reviews in those with lung disease who are otherwise stable, if unnecessary further investigations or changes in treatment are to be avoided.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Body Composition", "Body Size", "Child", "Ethnic Groups", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Forced Expiratory Volume", "Healthy Volunteers", "Humans", "London", "Lung", "Male", "Parents", "Prospective Studies", "Puberty", "Reference Values", "Reproducibility of Results", "Social Class", "Spirometry", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "Vital Capacity"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84979997860", "SubjectAreas": [["Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine", "MEDI", "2740"]], "AuthorData": {"57205934792": {"Name": "Kirkby J.", "AuthorID": "57205934792", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}, "21833569800": {"Name": "Bountziouka V.", "AuthorID": "21833569800", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Respiratory, Critical Care and Anaesthesia Section in Portex Unit, University College London, Institute of Child Health"}, "57203103925": {"Name": "Lum S.", "AuthorID": "57203103925", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Respiratory, Critical Care and Anaesthesia Section in Portex Unit, University College London, Institute of Child Health"}, "7102577078": {"Name": "Stocks J.", "AuthorID": "7102577078", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Respiratory, Critical Care and Anaesthesia Section in Portex Unit, University College London, Institute of Child Health"}, "7202754332": {"Name": "Wade A.", "AuthorID": "7202754332", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Population,Policy and Practice Programme, University College London, Institute of Child Health"}}}
