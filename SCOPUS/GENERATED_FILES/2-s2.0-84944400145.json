All rights reserved.Uveitic glaucoma is an umbrella term for a range of disorders whose common end result is glaucomatous optic neuropathy. Glaucoma in uveitis is distinguished from other glaucomas by its episodic, partly iatrogenic nature and very high intraocular pressures that, untreated, may result in much more rapid glaucoma progression than is commonly seen in POAG. Most patients are young and of working age and may be greatly debilitated by their glaucoma. Rapid diagnosis and high-quality care are required to safeguard their vision in the long term and keep these patients in employment. Management of uveitic glaucoma requires careful diagnosis and management of both uveitis and glaucoma. It is essential to identify the mechanisms of IOP elevation so the correct treatment can be instituted. Management of the patient in a multidisciplinary fashion with the involvement of both uveitis and glaucoma specialists offers the best chance of a successful outcome. Acute angle closure from pupillary block is relatively rare in uveitis but potentially devastating, requiring urgent treatment. Laser iridotomy is poorly effective. The authors advise emergency surgical iridectomy rather than attempting laser iridotomy in eyes with active inflammation. It is not uncommon for patients to require both IOP-lowering surgery and cataract surgery. It is therefore imperative that the first procedure is performed optimally to afford the best chance of long-term IOP control. Finally, uveitic glaucoma patients require lifelong care and supervision, which should be undertaken in dedicated, specialized centers which are appropriately staffed and equipped.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84944400145", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"24766175000": {"Name": "Kulkarni A.", "AuthorID": "24766175000", "AffiliationID": "60029685", "AffiliationName": "King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7007041047": {"Name": "Barton K.", "AuthorID": "7007041047", "AffiliationID": "60016691, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "Glaucoma Service and NIHR Biomedical Research Centre for Ophthalmology, Moorfields Eye Hospital and Department of Genetics and Epidemiology, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}}}
