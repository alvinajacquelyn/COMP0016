In this study, we performed metabolomics analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from cognitively intact elderly patients (N = 28) with MDD and age- and gender-matched healthy controls (N = 18). The CSF levels of 177 substances were measured, while 288 substances were below the detection limit. Only ascorbic acid was significantly different, with higher levels in the MDD group at baseline. There were no correlations between CSF ascorbic acid levels and clinical variables in MDD patients at baseline. At the 3-year follow-up, there was no difference of CSF ascorbic acid levels between the two groups. There was a negative correlation between CSF ascorbic acid and CSF amyloid-\u03b242 levels in all subjects. However, there were no correlations between ascorbic acid and other biomarkers (e.g., amyloid-\u03b240, total and phosphorylated tau protein). This preliminary study suggests that abnormalities in the transport and/or release of ascorbic acid might play a role in the pathogenesis of late-life depression.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Amyloid beta-Peptides", "Ascorbic Acid", "Biomarkers", "Depressive Disorder, Major", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Metabolomics", "Neuropsychological Tests", "Peptide Fragments"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85020510224", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"55365316700": {"Name": "Hashimoto K.", "AuthorID": "55365316700", "AffiliationID": "60002787", "AffiliationName": "Division of Clinical Neuroscience, Chiba University Center for Forensic Mental Health"}, "23034786100": {"Name": "Ishima T.", "AuthorID": "23034786100", "AffiliationID": "60002787", "AffiliationName": "Division of Clinical Neuroscience, Chiba University Center for Forensic Mental Health"}, "55607613800": {"Name": "Sato Y.", "AuthorID": "55607613800", "AffiliationID": "60002787", "AffiliationName": "Department of Global Clinical Research, Chiba University, Graduate School of Medicine"}, "37114115000": {"Name": "Bruno D.", "AuthorID": "37114115000", "AffiliationID": "60028355", "AffiliationName": "School of Natural Sciences and Psychology, Liverpool John Moores University"}, "6601979992": {"Name": "Nierenberg J.", "AuthorID": "6601979992", "AffiliationID": "60032105, 60021784", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, New York University, Langone Medical Center"}, "7005360684": {"Name": "Pomara N.", "AuthorID": "7005360684", "AffiliationID": "60032105, 60021784", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, New York University, Langone Medical Center"}, "7006075848": {"Name": "Marmar C.R.", "AuthorID": "7006075848", "AffiliationID": "60032105, 60021784", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, New York University, Langone Medical Center"}, "6701454676": {"Name": "Zetterberg H.", "AuthorID": "6701454676", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, UCL, Institute of Neurology"}, "56415176000": {"Name": "Blennow K.", "AuthorID": "56415176000", "AffiliationID": "60016437", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry and Neurochemistry, Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, University of Gothenburg"}}}
