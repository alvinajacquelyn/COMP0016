Objectives: To identify a functional role of platelets in the innate inflammatory and matrix-degrading response in TB. Methods: Markers of platelet activation were examined in plasma from 50 patients with TB before treatment and 50 control subjects. Twenty-five patients were followed longitudinally. Platelet\u2013monocyte interactions were studied in a coculture model infected with live, virulent Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) and dissected using qRT-PCR, Luminex multiplex arrays, matrix degradation assays, and colony counts. Immunohistochemistry detected CD41 (cluster of differentiation 41) expression in a pulmonary TB murine model, and secreted platelet factors were measured in BAL fluid from 15 patients with TB and matched control subjects. Measurements and Main Results: Five of six platelet-associated mediators were upregulated in plasma of patients with TB compared with control subjects, with concentrations returning to baseline by Day 60 of treatment. Gene expression of the monocyte collagenase MMP-1 (matrix metalloproteinase-1) was upregulated by platelets in M.tb infection. Platelets also enhanced M.tb-induced MMP-1 and -10 secretion, which drove type I collagen degradation. Platelets increased monocyte IL-1 and IL-10 and decreased IL-12 and MDC (monocyte-derived chemokine; also known as CCL-22) secretion, as consistent with an M2 monocyte phenotype. Monocyte killing of intracellular M.tb was decreased. In the lung, platelets were detected in a TB mouse model, and secreted platelet mediators were upregulated in human BAL fluid and correlated with MMP and IL-1b concentrations. Conclusions: Platelets drive a proinflammatory, tissue-degrading phenotype in TB.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Human", "Innate immunity", "Matrix metalloproteinases", "Platelets", "Tuberculosis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Apoptosis", "Blood Platelets", "Cell Proliferation", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Mycobacterium tuberculosis", "Pneumonia", "Tuberculosis"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85048513433", "SubjectAreas": [["Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine", "MEDI", "2740"], ["Critical Care and Intensive Care Medicine", "MEDI", "2706"]], "AuthorData": {"57202983268": {"Name": "Fox K.A.", "AuthorID": "57202983268", "AffiliationID": "60022106, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "Infectious Diseases and Immunity, Wellcome Trust Centre for Global Health Research, Imperial College London"}, "33067968600": {"Name": "Kirwan D.E.", "AuthorID": "33067968600", "AffiliationID": "60022106, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "Infectious Diseases and Immunity, Wellcome Trust Centre for Global Health Research, Imperial College London"}, "57201007125": {"Name": "Whittington A.M.", "AuthorID": "57201007125", "AffiliationID": "60022106, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "Infectious Diseases and Immunity, Wellcome Trust Centre for Global Health Research, Imperial College London"}, "57199223794": {"Name": "Singh S.", "AuthorID": "57199223794", "AffiliationID": "60022106, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "Infectious Diseases and Immunity, Wellcome Trust Centre for Global Health Research, Imperial College London"}, "7102333663": {"Name": "Friedland J.S.", "AuthorID": "7102333663", "AffiliationID": "60022106, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "Infectious Diseases and Immunity, Wellcome Trust Centre for Global Health Research, Imperial College London"}, "7005786232": {"Name": "Krishnan N.", "AuthorID": "7005786232", "AffiliationID": "60015150, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council Centre for Molecular Bacteriology and Infection, Department of Medicine, Imperial College London"}, "7201834614": {"Name": "Robertson B.D.", "AuthorID": "7201834614", "AffiliationID": "60015150, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council Centre for Molecular Bacteriology and Infection, Department of Medicine, Imperial College London"}, "57202677769": {"Name": "Gilman R.H.", "AuthorID": "57202677769", "AffiliationID": "60071237", "AffiliationName": "Laboratorio de Investigaci\u00f3n en Enfermedades Infecciosas, Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia"}, "54787994000": {"Name": "L\u00f3pez J.W.", "AuthorID": "54787994000", "AffiliationID": "60071245", "AffiliationName": "Instituto Nacional de Salud del Ni\u00f1o"}, "7403426976": {"Name": "Porter J.C.", "AuthorID": "7403426976", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Inflammation and Tissue Repair, Respiratory Medicine, University College London"}}}
