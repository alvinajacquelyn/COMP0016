However, the molecular mechanisms responsible for transforming a normal brain into an epileptic one remain largely unknown. Hyperpolarizing inhibition mediated by type A GABA (GABAA) receptors is dependent on chloride extrusion by the neuron-specific type 2 K+\u2013Cl\u2212 cotransporter (KCC2). Loss-of-function mutations in KCC2 are a known cause of infantile epilepsy in humans and KCC2 dysfunction is present in patients with both idiopathic and acquired epilepsy. Here we discuss the growing evidence that KCC2 dysfunction has a central role in the development and severity of the epilepsies.", "AuthorKeywords": ["chloride", "epilepsy", "GABA", "KCC2", "phosphorylation", "seizures"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Epilepsy", "Humans", "Symporters"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85028090060", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"]], "AuthorData": {"56158357900": {"Name": "Moore Y.", "AuthorID": "56158357900", "AffiliationID": "60015849", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Tufts University School of Medicine"}, "7402067232": {"Name": "Moss S.", "AuthorID": "7402067232", "AffiliationID": "60004219", "AffiliationName": "AstraZeneca Tufts Laboratory for Basic and Translational Neuroscience"}, "56562418200": {"Name": "Kelley M.", "AuthorID": "56562418200", "AffiliationID": "60015849", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Tufts University School of Medicine"}, "13404206900": {"Name": "Deeb T.", "AuthorID": "13404206900", "AffiliationID": "60004219", "AffiliationName": "AstraZeneca Tufts Laboratory for Basic and Translational Neuroscience"}, "7005362992": {"Name": "Brandon N.", "AuthorID": "7005362992", "AffiliationID": "60004219", "AffiliationName": "AstraZeneca Neuroscience, Innovative Medicines and Early Development Biotech Unit, R&D Boston"}}}
