After surgery, the excised tissue is sliced at the pathology department, where specimen radiographs of the slices are typically acquired. Representative parts of the tissue are then sampled for further processing, staining and examination under the microscope. The results of histopathological imaging are used for tumour characterisation. As the 3D structure of the specimen is inevitably lost during specimen handling, reconstructing a volume from individual specimen slices could facilitate the correlation of histology to radiological imaging. This work proposes a novel method for a whole specimen volume reconstruction and is validated on six mastectomy cases. We also demonstrate how these volumes can be used as a means to map multiple histology slides to a whole mastectomy image (MRI or CT).", "AuthorKeywords": ["3D volume reconstruction", "Breast histology-radiology registration"], "IndexKeywords": ["3D Structure", "Breast Cancer", "Breast histology-radiology registration", "Histology slides", "Radiological imaging", "Volume reconstruction"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84977551458", "SubjectAreas": [["Theoretical Computer Science", "MATH", "2614"], ["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"]], "AuthorData": {"36172530200": {"Name": "Mertzanidou T.", "AuthorID": "36172530200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Image Computing, University College London"}, "6602192523": {"Name": "Hipwell J.", "AuthorID": "6602192523", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Image Computing, University College London"}, "56694014000": {"Name": "Reis S.", "AuthorID": "56694014000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Image Computing, University College London"}, "35464300200": {"Name": "Hawkes D.", "AuthorID": "35464300200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Image Computing, University College London"}, "56986708300": {"Name": "Bejnordi B.", "AuthorID": "56986708300", "AffiliationID": "60002573", "AffiliationName": "Diagnostic Image Analysis Group, Radboud University Medical Centre"}, "56257647300": {"Name": "Dalmis M.", "AuthorID": "56257647300", "AffiliationID": "60002573", "AffiliationName": "Diagnostic Image Analysis Group, Radboud University Medical Centre"}, "56644971600": {"Name": "Vreemann S.", "AuthorID": "56644971600", "AffiliationID": "60002573", "AffiliationName": "Diagnostic Image Analysis Group, Radboud University Medical Centre"}, "8730673600": {"Name": "Platel B.", "AuthorID": "8730673600", "AffiliationID": "60002573", "AffiliationName": "Diagnostic Image Analysis Group, Radboud University Medical Centre"}, "6701833644": {"Name": "van der Laak J.", "AuthorID": "6701833644", "AffiliationID": "60002573", "AffiliationName": "Diagnostic Image Analysis Group, Radboud University Medical Centre"}, "24332021400": {"Name": "Karssemeijer N.", "AuthorID": "24332021400", "AffiliationID": "60002573", "AffiliationName": "Diagnostic Image Analysis Group, Radboud University Medical Centre"}, "23397838900": {"Name": "Mann R.", "AuthorID": "23397838900", "AffiliationID": "60002573", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Radboud University Medical Centre"}, "56694305400": {"Name": "Hermsen M.", "AuthorID": "56694305400", "AffiliationID": "60002573", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, Radboud University Medical Centre"}, "6602193995": {"Name": "Bult P.", "AuthorID": "6602193995", "AffiliationID": "60002573", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, Radboud University Medical Centre"}}}
