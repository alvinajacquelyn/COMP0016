Linearly polarised lasers of various wavelengths are propagated through a glass tube containing corn syrup. The rotation of the plane of polarisation of the light is visible with the naked eye, making the experiment dramatic and engaging and aiding understanding of the phenomenon of optical rotation. In addition, we present a simple approach to quantitatively analyse data using only equipment commonly found in undergraduate teaching laboratories.", "AuthorKeywords": ["laser", "lecture demonstration", "light", "optical rotation", "polarisation", "undergraduate laboratory"], "IndexKeywords": ["Corn syrup", "Glass tubes", "Lecture demonstrations", "Naked-eye", "Quantitative techniques", "Simple approach", "Undergraduate laboratory", "Undergraduate teaching"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85021184195", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"57197318357": {"Name": "Nixon M.", "AuthorID": "57197318357", "AffiliationID": "60022175", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Durham University"}, "7102392183": {"Name": "Hughes I.", "AuthorID": "7102392183", "AffiliationID": "60022175", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Durham University"}}}
