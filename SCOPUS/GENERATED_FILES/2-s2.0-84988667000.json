Little is known about the relation between memory abilities as measured in the laboratory versus naturalistic settings in this population, and no questionnaire assessments of everyday memory have been formally validated for this group. The current study\u2019s aims were twofold: 1) to describe the psychometric characteristics of a parent-reported everyday memory measure (the Observer Memory Questionnaire\u2013Parent Form, OMQ-PF) in this population with known hippocampal and memory impairment (i.e., DS, ages 7\u201335 years), and 2) to determine if the measure has the sensitivity to detect impairments, thus providing some of the first data to document parent reports of everyday memory in individuals with DS. The results indicate that this scale is a reliable instrument for detecting and tracking memory deficits over time in this population. We found a correlation between parent reports of everyday memory difficulties and well-replicated deficits in a laboratory-based memory task (i.e., place\u2013object paired associates learning). Our results suggest that the OMQ-PF has the potential to be used as a tool to help to track the status of memory function in this group both for use in descriptive studies and in studies of behavior and pharmacological intervention.", "AuthorKeywords": ["caregiver report", "Down syndrome", "everyday memory", "laboratory memory tasks", "questionnaire"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Child", "Down Syndrome", "Female", "Humans", "Learning", "Male", "Memory", "Memory Disorders", "Parents", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84988667000", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Neuropsychology and Physiological Psychology", "PSYC", "3206"], ["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"]], "AuthorData": {"35094651100": {"Name": "Span\u00f2 G.", "AuthorID": "35094651100", "AffiliationID": "60010065", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, University of Arizona"}, "8059139900": {"Name": "Edgin J.", "AuthorID": "8059139900", "AffiliationID": "60010065", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, University of Arizona"}}}
