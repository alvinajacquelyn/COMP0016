The flow dynamics in brain arteries, both during periods of rest and increased activity, are known to be a major factor in the risk of aneurysm formation and rupture. The precise relation is however still an open field of investigation. We present an automated ensemble simulation method for modelling cerebrovascular blood flow under a range of flow regimes. By automatically constructing and performing an ensemble of multiscale simulations, where we unidirectionally couple a 1D solver with a 3D lattice-Boltzmann code, we are able to model the blood flow in a patient artery over a range of flow regimes. We apply the method to a model of a middle cerebral artery, and find that this approach helps us to fine-tune our modelling techniques, and opens up new ways to investigate cerebrovascular flow properties.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Blood flow", "Ensemble simulation", "High-performance computing", "Multiscale modelling", "Parallel programming"], "IndexKeywords": ["Blood flow", "Cerebrovascular disease", "Cerebrovascular flow", "Ensemble simulation", "High performance computing", "Middle cerebral artery", "Multi-scale modelling", "Multi-scale simulation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84930934949", "SubjectAreas": [["Theoretical Computer Science", "MATH", "2614"], ["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"], ["Modeling and Simulation", "MATH", "2611"]], "AuthorData": {"56681917600": {"Name": "Itani M.A.", "AuthorID": "56681917600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Computational Science, University College London"}, "6701642358": {"Name": "Schiller U.D.", "AuthorID": "6701642358", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Computational Science, University College London"}, "36995082000": {"Name": "Schmieschek S.", "AuthorID": "36995082000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Computational Science, University College London"}, "23477084400": {"Name": "Hetherington J.", "AuthorID": "23477084400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Computational Science, University College London"}, "14053541200": {"Name": "Bernabeu M.O.", "AuthorID": "14053541200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Computational Science, University College London"}, "7005747590": {"Name": "Coveney P.V.", "AuthorID": "7005747590", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Computational Science, University College London"}, "23049787700": {"Name": "Groen D.", "AuthorID": "23049787700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "CoMPLEX, University College London"}, "6603067631": {"Name": "Chandrashekar H.", "AuthorID": "6603067631", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Lysholm Department of Neuroradiology, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, University College London"}, "36015499300": {"Name": "Robertson F.", "AuthorID": "36015499300", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Lysholm Department of Neuroradiology, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, University College London"}}}
