All rights reserved. No commercial use is permitted unless otherwise expressly granted.Adaptive optics (AO) ophthalmoscopy allows for non-invasive retinal phenotyping on a microscopic scale, thereby helping to improve our understanding of retinal diseases. An increasing number of natural history studies and ongoing/planned interventional clinical trials exploit AO ophthalmoscopy both for participant selection, stratification and monitoring treatment safety and efficacy. In this review, we briefly discuss the evolution of AO ophthalmoscopy, recent developments and its application to a broad range of inherited retinal diseases, including Stargardt disease, retinitis pigmentosa and achromatopsia. Finally, we describe the impact of this in vivo microscopic imaging on our understanding of disease pathogenesis, clinical trial design and outcome metrics, while recognising the limitation of the small cohorts reported to date.", "AuthorKeywords": ["genetics", "imaging", "retina", "vision"], "IndexKeywords": ["Eye Diseases, Hereditary", "Humans", "Ophthalmoscopy", "Optics and Photonics", "Retinal Diseases"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85047410220", "SubjectAreas": [["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"], ["Sensory Systems", "NEUR", "2809"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"]], "AuthorData": {"57200827164": {"Name": "Georgiou M.", "AuthorID": "57200827164", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "36490013200": {"Name": "Kalitzeos A.", "AuthorID": "36490013200", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57202482672": {"Name": "Michaelides M.", "AuthorID": "57202482672", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57190489812": {"Name": "Patterson E.J.", "AuthorID": "57190489812", "AffiliationID": "60012553", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences, Medical College of Wisconsin"}, "7402034918": {"Name": "Carroll J.", "AuthorID": "7402034918", "AffiliationID": "60012553", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences, Medical College of Wisconsin"}, "35605657700": {"Name": "Dubra A.", "AuthorID": "35605657700", "AffiliationID": "60012708", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, Stanford University"}}}
