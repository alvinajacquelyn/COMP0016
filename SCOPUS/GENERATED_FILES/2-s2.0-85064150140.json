Previous literature suggests that higher tongue pressure amplitudes are generated for extremely thick liquids compared with thin liquids. The purpose of this study was to collect detailed information about the modulation of tongue pressure amplitude and timing across the range from thin to moderately thick liquids. Method: Tongue pressure patterns were measured in 38 healthy adults (aged under 60 years) during swallowing with 4 levels of progressively thicker liquid consistency (International Dysphagia Diet Standardisation Initiative, Levels 0 = thin, 1 = slightly thick, 2 = mildly thick, and 3 = moderately thick). Stimuli with matching gravity flow (measured using the International Dysphagia Diet Standardisation Initiative Flow Test; Cichero et al., 2017; Hanson, 2016) were prepared both with/without barium (20% weight per volume concentration) and thickened with starch and xanthan gum thickeners. Results: After controlling for variations in sip volume, thicker liquids were found to elicit significantly higher amplitudes of peak tongue pressure and a pattern of higher (i.e., steeper) pressure rise and decay slopes (change in pressure per unit time). Explorations across stimuli with similar flow but prepared with different thickeners and with/without barium revealed very few differences in tongue pressure, with the exception of significantly higher pressure amplitudes and rise slopes for nonbarium, starch-thickened slightly and mildly thick liquids. Conclusions: There was no evidence that the addition of barium led to systematic differences in tongue pressure parameters across liquids with closely matched gravity flow. Additionally, no significant differences in tongue pressure parameters were found across thickening agents.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Barium", "Deglutition", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Polysaccharides, Bacterial", "Pressure", "Tongue", "Viscosity", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85064150140", "SubjectAreas": [["Language and Linguistics", "ARTS", "1203"], ["Linguistics and Language", "SOCI", "3310"], ["Speech and Hearing", "HEAL", "3616"]], "AuthorData": {"7101798810": {"Name": "Steele C.M.", "AuthorID": "7101798810", "AffiliationID": "60016849", "AffiliationName": "Speech-Language Pathology, Rehabilitation Sciences Institute, University of Toronto"}, "55693894500": {"Name": "Peladeau-Pigeon M.", "AuthorID": "55693894500", "AffiliationID": "60030951, 60014468", "AffiliationName": "Toronto Rehabilitation Institute\u2014University Health Network, Swallowing Rehabilitation Research Laboratory"}, "56403137100": {"Name": "Barbon C.A.E.", "AuthorID": "56403137100", "AffiliationID": "60016849", "AffiliationName": "Speech-Language Pathology, Rehabilitation Sciences Institute, University of Toronto"}, "57201378475": {"Name": "Guida B.T.", "AuthorID": "57201378475", "AffiliationID": "60030951, 60014468", "AffiliationName": "Toronto Rehabilitation Institute\u2014University Health Network, Swallowing Rehabilitation Research Laboratory"}, "57208222867": {"Name": "Tapson M.S.", "AuthorID": "57208222867", "AffiliationID": "60016849", "AffiliationName": "Speech-Language Pathology, Rehabilitation Sciences Institute, University of Toronto"}, "57190169807": {"Name": "Valenzano T.J.", "AuthorID": "57190169807", "AffiliationID": "60016849", "AffiliationName": "Speech-Language Pathology, Rehabilitation Sciences Institute, University of Toronto"}, "57151260500": {"Name": "Wolkin T.S.", "AuthorID": "57151260500", "AffiliationID": "60030951, 60014468", "AffiliationName": "Toronto Rehabilitation Institute\u2014University Health Network, Swallowing Rehabilitation Research Laboratory"}, "36009511800": {"Name": "Waito A.A.", "AuthorID": "36009511800", "AffiliationID": "60016849", "AffiliationName": "Speech-Language Pathology, Rehabilitation Sciences Institute, University of Toronto"}, "7102037062": {"Name": "Hanson B.", "AuthorID": "7102037062", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London Mechanical Engineering"}, "57193851218": {"Name": "Ong J.J.X.", "AuthorID": "57193851218", "AffiliationID": "60015881", "AffiliationName": "Department of Food Science, University of Guelph"}, "6603504862": {"Name": "Duizer L.M.", "AuthorID": "6603504862", "AffiliationID": "60015881", "AffiliationName": "Department of Food Science, University of Guelph"}}}
