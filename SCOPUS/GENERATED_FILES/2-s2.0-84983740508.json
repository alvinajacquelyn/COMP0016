Of 4658 patients attending during the inclusion period, 385 were newly diagnosed first-time attendees and routine tuberculosis screening was recommended in 165. Of these, only 6.1% of patients had a completed tuberculosis screening prompt, and 12.1% underwent routine tuberculosis screening. This audit represents the first published UK data on routine screening rates for tuberculosis in HIV and demonstrates low rates of tuberculosis screening despite an electronic screening prompt designed to simplify adherence to the national guideline. Reasons why tuberculosis screening rates were low, and the prompt ineffective, are unclear. A national audit is ongoing, and we await the results to see if our data reflect a lack of routine tuberculosis screening in HIV-infected patients at a national level.", "AuthorKeywords": ["audit", "HIV", "screening", "Tuberculosis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Clinical Audit", "Electronic Health Records", "Female", "Guideline Adherence", "HIV Infections", "Humans", "Male", "Mass Screening", "Middle Aged", "Practice Guidelines as Topic", "Retrospective Studies", "Tuberculosis", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84983740508", "SubjectAreas": [["Dermatology", "MEDI", "2708"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"37661229300": {"Name": "Fox-Lewis A.", "AuthorID": "37661229300", "AffiliationID": "60023116, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "Hospital for Tropical Diseases, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7402445866": {"Name": "Grant A.D.", "AuthorID": "7402445866", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Research Department, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "56601072600": {"Name": "Edwards S.G.", "AuthorID": "56601072600", "AffiliationID": "60162114, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Mortimer Market Centre, Central and North West London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "55547118657": {"Name": "Miller R.F.", "AuthorID": "55547118657", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Research Department, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "7004714193": {"Name": "Pett S.L.", "AuthorID": "7004714193", "AffiliationID": "60026655, 60028333", "AffiliationName": "Kirby Institute, University of New South Wales"}, "55285767300": {"Name": "Brima N.", "AuthorID": "55285767300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Infection and Population Health, University College London"}, "56535359500": {"Name": "Muniina P.", "AuthorID": "56535359500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Infection and Population Health, University College London"}}}
