This study defines evolution of coagulopathy in 10 pigs with acetaminophen (APAP)-induced ALI compared to 3 Controls. APAP administration began at 0 h and continued to 'ALF', defined as INR >3. In APAP pigs, INR was 1.05 \u00b1 0.02 at 0 h, 2.15 \u00b1 0.43 at 16 h and > 3 at 18 \u00b1 1 h. At 12 h thromboelastography (TEG) demonstrated increased clot formation rate, associated with portal vein platelet aggregates and reductions in protein C, protein S, antithrombin and A Disintegrin and Metalloprotease with Thrombospondin type 1 repeats-13 (ADAMTS-13) to 60%, 24%, 47% and 32% normal respectively. At 18 \u00b1 1 h, INR > 3 was associated with: hypocoagulable TEG profile with heparin-like effect; falls in thrombin generation, Factor V and Factor VIII to 52%, 19% and 17% normal respectively; further decline in anticoagulants; thrombocytopenia; neutrophilia and endotoxemia. Multivariate analysis, found that ADAMTS-13 was an independent predictor of a hypercoagulable TEG profile and platelet count, endotoxin, Protein C and fibrinogen were independent predictors of a hypocoagulable TEG profile. INR remained normal in Controls. Dynamic changes in coagulation occur with progression of ALI: a pro-thrombotic state progresses to hypocoagulability.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Acetaminophen", "Animals", "Biomarkers", "Blood Cell Count", "Blood Coagulation", "Blood Coagulation Factors", "Blood Coagulation Tests", "Chemical and Drug Induced Liver Injury", "Disease Models, Animal", "Disease Progression", "Endotoxins", "Female", "Immunohistochemistry", "International Normalized Ratio", "Liver Function Tests", "Platelet Count", "Prothrombin Time", "Swine", "Thrombelastography", "Thrombophilia", "Time Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85028057339", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"55949753800": {"Name": "Lee K.C.L.", "AuthorID": "55949753800", "AffiliationID": "60029950", "AffiliationName": "Liver Failure Group, Institute of Liver and Digestive Health, University College London Medical School Royal Free Campus"}, "55989373000": {"Name": "Baker L.", "AuthorID": "55989373000", "AffiliationID": "60026530", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Science and Services, Royal Veterinary College, University of London"}, "6602505771": {"Name": "Alibhai H.", "AuthorID": "6602505771", "AffiliationID": "60026530", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Science and Services, Royal Veterinary College, University of London"}, "47761541500": {"Name": "Stanzani G.", "AuthorID": "47761541500", "AffiliationID": "60026530", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Science and Services, Royal Veterinary College, University of London"}, "7202610468": {"Name": "Davies N.", "AuthorID": "7202610468", "AffiliationID": "60029950", "AffiliationName": "Liver Failure Group, Institute of Liver and Digestive Health, University College London Medical School Royal Free Campus"}, "6603672216": {"Name": "Mookerjee R.", "AuthorID": "6603672216", "AffiliationID": "60029950", "AffiliationName": "Liver Failure Group, Institute of Liver and Digestive Health, University College London Medical School Royal Free Campus"}, "7005505892": {"Name": "Jalan R.", "AuthorID": "7005505892", "AffiliationID": "60029950", "AffiliationName": "Liver Failure Group, Institute of Liver and Digestive Health, University College London Medical School Royal Free Campus"}, "7004053133": {"Name": "Mallett S.", "AuthorID": "7004053133", "AffiliationID": "60032819, 60170516", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anaesthesia, Royal Free Hospital, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "55950236200": {"Name": "Riddell A.", "AuthorID": "55950236200", "AffiliationID": "60032819, 60170516", "AffiliationName": "Katherine Dormandy Haemophilia and Thrombosis Centre, Royal Free Hospital, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57193134405": {"Name": "Chowdary P.", "AuthorID": "57193134405", "AffiliationID": "60032819, 60170516", "AffiliationName": "Katherine Dormandy Haemophilia and Thrombosis Centre, Royal Free Hospital, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57188648757": {"Name": "Chang Y.M.", "AuthorID": "57188648757", "AffiliationID": "60026530", "AffiliationName": "Department of Research Support, Royal Veterinary College, University of London"}, "6508041786": {"Name": "Priestnall S.", "AuthorID": "6508041786", "AffiliationID": "60026530", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathobiology and Population Sciences, Royal Veterinary College, University of London"}, "15749911500": {"Name": "Agarwal B.", "AuthorID": "15749911500", "AffiliationID": "60032819, 60170516", "AffiliationName": "Department of Intensive Care Medicine, Royal Free Hospital, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
