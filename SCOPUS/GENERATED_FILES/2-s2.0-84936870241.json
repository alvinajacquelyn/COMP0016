This study proposes an energy-enhanced BIM framework that integrates the carbon finance theory. With the integrated cost evaluation according to the carbon finance theory, the proposed eeBIM-based platform can help achieve lower carbon emission cost while enhancing the energy efficiency and further estimate the carbon consumption of the building design during its construction. The project team thus will be able to evaluate the overall sustainability and develop an optimized building design solution at the design stage. In particular, this paper discusses the analysis of existing sustainable building design systems through intensive literature review, identifies key challenges and gaps remained unaddressed, and introduces the model proposed to address these challenges and gaps.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Carbon finance", "Cost evaluation", "eeBIM", "Energy efficiency", "Sustainable construction"], "IndexKeywords": ["Carbon consumption", "Carbon finance", "Construction information", "Cost evaluations", "eeBIM", "Energy performance", "Sustainable building design", "Sustainable construction"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84936870241", "SubjectAreas": [["Civil and Structural Engineering", "ENGI", "2205"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"]], "AuthorData": {"56717065200": {"Name": "Lu Q.", "AuthorID": "56717065200", "AffiliationID": "60006541", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil Engineering, University of Hong Kong"}, "57221452702": {"Name": "Lee S.", "AuthorID": "57221452702", "AffiliationID": "60006541", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil Engineering, University of Hong Kong"}}}
