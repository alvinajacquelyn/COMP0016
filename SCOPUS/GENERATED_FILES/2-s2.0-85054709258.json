Here we argue that this intuitive framework is contradicted by neurophysiological and behavioural data. First, PPS-related measures are not binary, but graded with proximity. Second, they are strongly influenced by factors other than proximity, such as walking, tool use, stimulus valence, and social cues. Third, many different PPS-related responses exist, and each can be used to describe a different space. Here, we reconceptualise PPS as a set of graded fields describing behavioural relevance of actions aiming to create or avoid contact between objects and the body. This reconceptualisation incorporates PPS into mainstream theories of action selection and behaviour.", "AuthorKeywords": ["action selection", "defence", "egocentric coding", "goal-oriented actions", "motor system", "perception and action"], "IndexKeywords": ["Action selection", "defence", "egocentric coding", "Goal-oriented", "Motor systems", "Perception and actions", "Animals", "Brain", "Humans", "Perception", "Personal Space", "Psychological Theory"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85054709258", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuropsychology and Physiological Psychology", "PSYC", "3206"], ["Experimental and Cognitive Psychology", "PSYC", "3205"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"]], "AuthorData": {"57060570800": {"Name": "Bufacchi R.", "AuthorID": "57060570800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Mathematics and Physics in the Life Sciences and Experimental Biology (CoMPLEX), University College London"}, "55226971800": {"Name": "Iannetti G.", "AuthorID": "55226971800", "AffiliationID": "60102151", "AffiliationName": "Neuroscience and Behaviour Laboratory, Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia"}}}
