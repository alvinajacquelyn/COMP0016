FXa signalling via activation of protease-activated receptors (PAR) leads to increased intracellular calcium (Ca2+). Therefore, we measured alterations in Ca2+ levels in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) following FXa-mediated PAR activation and investigated whether FXa reactive IgG from patients with APS or SLE/APS- A lter these responses. We observed concentration-dependent induction of Ca2+ release by FXa that was potentiated by APS-IgG and SLE/APS-IgG compared to healthy control subjects' IgG, and FXa alone. APS-IgG and SLE/APS-IgG increased FXa mediated NF\u03baB signalling and this effect was fully-retained in the affinity purified anti-FXa IgG sub-fraction. Antagonism of PAR-1 and PAR-2 reduced FXa-induced Ca2+ release. Treatment with a specific FXa inhibitor, hydroxychloroquine or fluvastatin significantly reduced FXa-induced and IgG-potentiated Ca2+ release. In conclusion, PAR-1 and PAR-2 are involved in FXa-mediated intracellular Ca2+ release in HUVEC and FXa reactive IgG from patients with APS and/or SLE potentiate this effect. Further work is required to explore the potential use of IgG FXa reactivity as a novel biomarker to stratify treatment with FXa inhibitors in these patients.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Antiphospholipid Syndrome", "Biomarkers", "Calcium", "Case-Control Studies", "Endothelial Cells", "Factor Xa", "Female", "Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells", "Humans", "Immunoglobulin G", "Intracellular Space", "Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic", "Male", "Receptor, PAR-1", "Receptor, PAR-2", "Signal Transduction"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85028958432", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"8668635900": {"Name": "Artim-Esen B.", "AuthorID": "8668635900", "AffiliationID": "60012324, 60028502", "AffiliationName": "Division of Rheumatology, Department of Internal Medicine, Istanbul Faculty of Medicine, Istanbul University"}, "56042622600": {"Name": "McDonnell T.", "AuthorID": "56042622600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Center for Rheumatology Research, Rayne Institute, University College"}, "8504949600": {"Name": "Ripoll V.M.", "AuthorID": "8504949600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Center for Rheumatology Research, Rayne Institute, University College"}, "15766296400": {"Name": "Pericleous C.", "AuthorID": "15766296400", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Imperial College London"}, "57201108555": {"Name": "Isenberg D.", "AuthorID": "57201108555", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Center for Rheumatology Research, Rayne Institute, University College"}, "57212819228": {"Name": "Rahman A.", "AuthorID": "57212819228", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Center for Rheumatology Research, Rayne Institute, University College"}, "7003289700": {"Name": "Ioannou Y.", "AuthorID": "7003289700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Center for Rheumatology Research, Rayne Institute, University College"}, "56506767800": {"Name": "Giles I.", "AuthorID": "56506767800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Center for Rheumatology Research, Rayne Institute, University College"}, "55318032600": {"Name": "Smoktunowicz N.", "AuthorID": "55318032600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Center for Inflammation and Tissue Repair, Rayne Institute, University College"}, "35478426700": {"Name": "Chambers R.C.", "AuthorID": "35478426700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Center for Inflammation and Tissue Repair, Rayne Institute, University College"}, "7101821252": {"Name": "MacKie I.", "AuthorID": "7101821252", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Haemostasis Research Unit, Department of Haematology, University College London"}, "56708061100": {"Name": "Robinson E.", "AuthorID": "56708061100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Maths and Physical Sciences, University College London"}}}
