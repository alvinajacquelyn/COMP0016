PubMed, EMBASE, ISI Web of Science and PsychInfo were searched on July 2014. Existing data were sparse; 15 were suitable for qualitative review and six for meta-analysis (four quality of life [QOL], two depression). One study was a randomized controlled trial. A total of 139 subjects underwent Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, 202 underwent adjustable gastric band and 64 underwent sleeve gastrectomy. Overall QOL improved after bariatric surgery, regardless of surgical type with peak improvement at 6-12 months. Meta-analysis of four studies showed changed in overall QOL at latest follow-up of 2.80 standard deviation (SD) (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.23-4.37). Depression improved across all studies, regardless of procedure (effect size -0.47 SD [95% CI -0.76, -0.18] at 4-6 months). Two cohorts reported changes in both overall QOL and depression following a quadratic trajectory, with overall improvement over 2 years and deterioration in the second post-operative year. There were limited data on other psychological and social outcomes. There were insufficient data on psychosocial predictors of outcome to form evidence-based recommendations for patient selection for bariatric surgery at this time.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bariatric surgery", "depression", "obesity", "quality of life"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Bariatric Surgery", "Evidence-Based Medicine", "Humans", "Obesity, Morbid", "Pediatric Obesity", "Quality of Life", "Treatment Outcome", "Weight Loss"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85050579203", "SubjectAreas": [["Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism", "MEDI", "2712"]], "AuthorData": {"35197136000": {"Name": "White B.", "AuthorID": "35197136000", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Feeding and Eating Disorders Service, Department of Child and Adolescent Mental Health, Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "7005899067": {"Name": "Viner R.M.", "AuthorID": "7005899067", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Feeding and Eating Disorders Service, Department of Child and Adolescent Mental Health, Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "7102638286": {"Name": "Christie D.", "AuthorID": "7102638286", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Feeding and Eating Disorders Service, Department of Child and Adolescent Mental Health, Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "56714729100": {"Name": "Doyle J.", "AuthorID": "56714729100", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Feeding and Eating Disorders Service, Department of Child and Adolescent Mental Health, Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "57188752439": {"Name": "Colville S.", "AuthorID": "57188752439", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Feeding and Eating Disorders Service, Department of Child and Adolescent Mental Health, Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "7202972172": {"Name": "Nicholls D.", "AuthorID": "7202972172", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Feeding and Eating Disorders Service, Department of Child and Adolescent Mental Health, Great Ormond Street Hospital"}}}
