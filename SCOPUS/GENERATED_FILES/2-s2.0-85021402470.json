Among the various types of motions which researchers are attempting to detect and recognize, fall detection has gained significant interest. In this paper, we investigate the application of high-frequency (24 GHz) FMCW radar for multi-perspective micro-Doppler (\u03bc-D) activity recognition. Data from two different types of motion; falling and picking-up an object, were collected from three aspect angles and put through a fine-grained classifier to not only differentiate the motions, but to also identify their aspect towards the radar receivers. A key novel component of this work is the application of the fine-grained classification task, where a label discriminate sparse representation classifier is proposed to improve recognition performance over very similar \u03bc-D signatures. This is achieved by learning a discriminate dictionary constrained by the label information and meanwhile preventing the overfitting problem. The greatest increase in classification performance was found to be of the order of 8 %.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Aspect Angles", "Fall Recognition", "Fine-Grained Micro-Doppler Classification", "Label Discriminate", "Sparse Representation Classifier"], "IndexKeywords": ["Activity recognition", "Ambient assisted living", "Aspect angles", "Classification performance", "Classification tasks", "Fall recognition", "Micro-Doppler", "Sparse representation"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85021402470", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"], ["Signal Processing", "COMP", "1711"], ["Instrumentation", "PHYS", "3105"]], "AuthorData": {"56939438700": {"Name": "Chen Q.", "AuthorID": "56939438700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Security and Crime Science, University College London"}, "34867832000": {"Name": "Chetty K.", "AuthorID": "34867832000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Security and Crime Science, University College London"}, "36186273500": {"Name": "Ritchie M.", "AuthorID": "36186273500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "7003652416": {"Name": "Woodbridge K.", "AuthorID": "7003652416", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "57192561393": {"Name": "Liu Y.", "AuthorID": "57192561393", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Computer Laboratory, University of Cambridge"}}}
