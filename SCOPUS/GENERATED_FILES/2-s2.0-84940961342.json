All rights reserved.Burning mouth syndrome (BMS) is a distinct clinical condition that causes oral pain and burning in morphologically normal oral mucosa, with patients often complaining of a scalding sensation in the affected areas. Therapy includes the use of antifungal medication to treat candidiasis, antidepressants in cases of anxiety and depression, and vitamin replacement in cases of nutritional deficiency. Laser therapy has been considered one of the greatest technological advances in the field of dentistry. Many studies have demonstrated that low level laser therapy (LLLT) promotes a cellular biomodulation in healing injuries (proliferation of fibroblasts, collagen synthesis, regeneration of bone, nerve tissues), with significant clinical and histological modifications during the inflammatory process, as well as the healing irradiated biological tissues. From reports in the scientific literature, it is possible to conclude that LLLT is an alternative treatment for BMS, which promises to establish a scientific basis for future treatment of this condition.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Burning mouth syndrome (BMS)", "Low level laser therapy (LLLT)"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84940961342", "SubjectAreas": [["Dentistry (all)", "DENT", "3500"]], "AuthorData": {"55207693600": {"Name": "Dos Santos L.", "AuthorID": "55207693600", "AffiliationID": "60070422", "AffiliationName": "Real Center of Systemic Dentistry, Real Hospital Portugu\u00eas de Pernambuco"}, "7003789865": {"Name": "Le\u00e3o J.", "AuthorID": "7003789865", "AffiliationID": "60031482", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinic and Preventive Dentistry, Pernambuco Federal University"}}}
