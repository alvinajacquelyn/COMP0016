All rights reserved.Background:Thymidine analogs and didanosine (ddI) have been associated with redistribution of body fat from subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) to visceral adipose tissue (VAT), which, in turn, is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. We explored differences in adipose tissue distribution between people living with HIV (PLWH) with prior exposure to thymidine analogs and/or ddI, without exposure, and uninfected controls and the association with cardiovascular disease risk factors.Methods:In all, 761 PLWH from the Copenhagen Comorbidity in HIV Infection study, and 2283 age and sex-matched uninfected controls from the Copenhagen General Population Study were included. PLWH were stratified according to prior exposure to thymidine analogs and/or ddI. VAT and SAT were determined by abdominal computed tomography scan. Hypotheses were tested using regression analyses.Results:Exposure to thymidine analogs and/or ddI was associated with 21.6cm2 larger VAT (13.8-29.3) compared to HIV infection without exposure. HIV-negative status was associated with similar VAT compared to HIV infection without exposure. Cumulative exposure to thymidine analogs and/or ddI [3.7cm2 per year (2.3-5.1)], but not time since discontinuation [-1.1cm2 per year (-3.4 to 1.1)], was associated with VAT. Prior exposure to thymidine analogs and/or ddI was associated with excess risk of hypertension [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 1.62 (1.13-2.31)], hypercholesterolemia [aOR 1.49 (1.06-2.11)], and low high-density lipoprotein [aOR 1.40 (0.99-1.99)].Conclusions:This study suggests a potentially irreversible and harmful association of thymidine analogs and ddI with VAT accumulation, which appears be involved in the increased risk of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and low high-density lipoprotein found in PLWH with prior exposure to thymidine analogs and/or ddI, even years after treatment discontinuation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["cardiovascular risk factors", "didanosine", "fat redistribution", "thymidine analogs", "visceral adipose tissue"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adipose Tissue", "Adult", "Aged", "Anti-HIV Agents", "Cardiovascular Diseases", "Denmark", "Didanosine", "Female", "HIV Infections", "Humans", "Longitudinal Studies", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Risk Factors", "Thymidine"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85062397805", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"57191625235": {"Name": "Gelpi M.", "AuthorID": "57191625235", "AffiliationID": "60015199", "AffiliationName": "VIRO-immunology Research Unit, Department of Infectious Diseases 8632, Copenhagen University Hospital"}, "35307337700": {"Name": "Lundgren J.", "AuthorID": "35307337700", "AffiliationID": "60030840, 60006564", "AffiliationName": "CHIP, Department of Infectious Diseases, University of Copenhagen"}, "26767923100": {"Name": "Knudsen A.D.", "AuthorID": "26767923100", "AffiliationID": "60015199", "AffiliationName": "VIRO-immunology Research Unit, Department of Infectious Diseases 8632, Copenhagen University Hospital"}, "57207304232": {"Name": "Drivsholm N.", "AuthorID": "57207304232", "AffiliationID": "60015199", "AffiliationName": "VIRO-immunology Research Unit, Department of Infectious Diseases 8632, Copenhagen University Hospital"}, "7003337508": {"Name": "Lebech A.M.", "AuthorID": "7003337508", "AffiliationID": "60015199", "AffiliationName": "VIRO-immunology Research Unit, Department of Infectious Diseases 8632, Copenhagen University Hospital"}, "55666326400": {"Name": "Nielsen S.D.", "AuthorID": "55666326400", "AffiliationID": "60015199", "AffiliationName": "VIRO-immunology Research Unit, Department of Infectious Diseases 8632, Copenhagen University Hospital"}, "37013024000": {"Name": "Afzal S.", "AuthorID": "37013024000", "AffiliationID": "60014959, 60015199", "AffiliationName": "Copenhagen General Population Study, Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Herlev and Gentofte Hospital, Copenhagen University Hospital"}, "7007170557": {"Name": "Nordestgaard B.G.", "AuthorID": "7007170557", "AffiliationID": "60030840", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Health and Medical Scienses, University of Copenhagen"}, "15050124500": {"Name": "Fuchs A.", "AuthorID": "15050124500", "AffiliationID": "60006564", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology"}, "26031036500": {"Name": "K\u00fchl J.T.", "AuthorID": "26031036500", "AffiliationID": "60006564", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology"}, "57191964807": {"Name": "Sigvardsen P.E.", "AuthorID": "57191964807", "AffiliationID": "60006564", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology"}, "57209093328": {"Name": "K\u00f8ber L.", "AuthorID": "57209093328", "AffiliationID": "60006564", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology"}, "55665737500": {"Name": "Kofoed K.F.", "AuthorID": "55665737500", "AffiliationID": "60030840, 60006564", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Rigshospitalet, University of Copenhagen"}, "7006513758": {"Name": "Mocroft A.", "AuthorID": "7006513758", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "HIV Epidemiology and Biostatistics Unit, Department of Infection and Population Health, UCL"}, "6603328668": {"Name": "Lindegaard B.", "AuthorID": "6603328668", "AffiliationID": "60022645", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pulmonary and Infectious Diseases, Nordsjllands Hospital"}}}
