We focus on the scenario where there is one information decoder with a targeted SINR and several separate energy receivers with energy harvesting thresholds. Based on the observation that the fully-digital beamformer consists of only the information beamformer, we propose an iterative hybrid analog-digital beamforming scheme, where we design the analog beamformer by minimizing the difference between the fully-digital beamformer and the hybrid beamformer, and the optimal solution can be obtained via a geometrical interpretation. Numerical results show that the proposed scheme can achieve a close-to-optimal performance with significant gains in the total power consumption over fully-digital SWIPT.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Hybrid beamforming", "Iterative design", "MIMO", "SWIPT"], "IndexKeywords": ["Digital beam forming", "Digital beamformers", "Geometrical interpretation", "Hybrid beamforming", "Iterative design", "Simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT)", "SWIPT", "Total power consumption"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85044223942", "SubjectAreas": [["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Information Systems", "COMP", "1710"]], "AuthorData": {"56453725100": {"Name": "Li A.", "AuthorID": "56453725100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dept. of Electronic and Electrical Eng., University College London"}, "23009493900": {"Name": "Masouros C.", "AuthorID": "23009493900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dept. of Electronic and Electrical Eng., University College London"}}}
