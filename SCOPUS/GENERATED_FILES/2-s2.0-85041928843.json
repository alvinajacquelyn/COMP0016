Telomerase is composed of an RNA component and reverse transcriptase. However, additional factors required during biogenesis vary between species. Here we have identified fission yeast Lar7 as a member of the conserved LARP7 family, which includes the Tetrahymena telomerase-binding protein p65 and human LARP7. We show that Lar7 has conserved RNA-recognition motifs, which bind telomerase RNA to protect it from exosomal degradation. In addition, Lar7 is required to stabilise the association of telomerase RNA with the protective complex LSm2-8, and telomerase reverse transcriptase. Lar7 remains a component of the mature telomerase complex and is required for telomerase localisation to the telomere. Collectively, we demonstrate that Lar7 is a crucial player in fission yeast telomerase biogenesis, similarly to p65 in Tetrahymena, and highlight the LARP7 family as a conserved factor in telomere maintenance.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Amino Acid Motifs", "Conserved Sequence", "Gene Expression", "Humans", "Isoenzymes", "Nuclear Proteins", "Phosphoproteins", "Protein Binding", "Protozoan Proteins", "Ribonucleoproteins", "RNA", "RNA Stability", "RNA, Fungal", "RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase", "Schizosaccharomyces", "Telomerase", "Telomere", "Tetrahymena thermophila"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85041928843", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"56242817700": {"Name": "Collopy L.C.", "AuthorID": "56242817700", "AffiliationID": "60109234, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Chromosome Maintenance Group, UCL Cancer Institute, University College London"}, "14525921000": {"Name": "Ware T.L.", "AuthorID": "14525921000", "AffiliationID": "60017402", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biology, Salem State University"}, "57200614234": {"Name": "Goncalves T.", "AuthorID": "57200614234", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60177635", "AffiliationName": "Division of Biosciences, Faculty of Life Sciences, University College London"}, "57103608000": {"Name": "\u00cd Kongsstovu S.", "AuthorID": "57103608000", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "MSc Human Molecular Genetics, Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London"}, "57200226515": {"Name": "Yang Q.", "AuthorID": "57200226515", "AffiliationID": "60109234, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Chromosome Maintenance Group, UCL Cancer Institute, University College London"}, "16644645100": {"Name": "Amelina H.", "AuthorID": "16644645100", "AffiliationID": "60109234, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Chromosome Maintenance Group, UCL Cancer Institute, University College London"}, "57200621229": {"Name": "Pinder C.", "AuthorID": "57200621229", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60177635", "AffiliationName": "Division of Biosciences, Faculty of Life Sciences, University College London"}, "57200621380": {"Name": "Alenazi A.", "AuthorID": "57200621380", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "MSc Human Molecular Genetics, Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London"}, "56313069200": {"Name": "Moiseeva V.", "AuthorID": "56313069200", "AffiliationID": "60109234, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Chromosome Maintenance Group, UCL Cancer Institute, University College London"}, "56386797300": {"Name": "Pearson S.R.", "AuthorID": "56386797300", "AffiliationID": "60109234, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Chromosome Maintenance Group, UCL Cancer Institute, University College London"}, "56386785300": {"Name": "Armstrong C.A.", "AuthorID": "56386785300", "AffiliationID": "60109234, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Chromosome Maintenance Group, UCL Cancer Institute, University College London"}, "57141675200": {"Name": "Tomita K.", "AuthorID": "57141675200", "AffiliationID": "60109234, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Chromosome Maintenance Group, UCL Cancer Institute, University College London"}}}
