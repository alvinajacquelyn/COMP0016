Varying the amplitude of the postsynaptic response is one mechanism that generates flexible signaling in neural circuits. The timing of the synaptic response may also play a role. Here, we investigated whether weakening and loss of an entire connection between excitatory cortical neurons was foreshadowed in the timing of the postsynaptic response. We made electrophysiological recordings in rat primary somatosensory cortex that was undergoing experience-dependent loss of complete local excitatory connections. The synaptic latency of pyramid-pyramid connections, which typically comprise multiple synapses, was longer and more variable. Connection strength and latency were not correlated. Instead, prolonged latency was more closely related to progression of connection loss. The action potential waveform and axonal conduction velocity were unaffected, suggesting that the altered timing of neurotransmission was attributable to a synaptic mechanism. Modeling studies indicated that increasing the latency and jitter at a subset of synapses reduced the number of action potentials fired by a postsynaptic neuron. We propose that prolonged synaptic latency and diminished temporal precision of neurotransmission are hallmarks of impending loss of a cortical connection.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Latency", "Neural code", "Plasticity", "Presynaptic", "Rewiring", "Synapse"], "IndexKeywords": ["Action Potentials", "Animals", "Cerebral Cortex", "Excitatory Postsynaptic Potentials", "Female", "Male", "Nerve Net", "Organ Culture Techniques", "Rats", "Synaptic Transmission", "Time Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84931465176", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"]], "AuthorData": {"36999204300": {"Name": "Barnes S.J.", "AuthorID": "36999204300", "AffiliationID": "60009797, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Developmental Neurobiology, King\u2019s College London, Guy\u2019s Hospital Campus"}, "16174353000": {"Name": "Cheetham C.E.", "AuthorID": "16174353000", "AffiliationID": "60027950", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biological Sciences, Carnegie Mellon University"}, "56689821200": {"Name": "Liu Y.", "AuthorID": "56689821200", "AffiliationID": "60010269", "AffiliationName": "MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology"}, "56689188600": {"Name": "Bennett S.H.", "AuthorID": "56689188600", "AffiliationID": "60011520, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre Neurodegeneration Research, King\u2019s College London"}, "56071366000": {"Name": "Albieri G.", "AuthorID": "56071366000", "AffiliationID": "60011520, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre Neurodegeneration Research, King\u2019s College London"}, "6603657578": {"Name": "Finnerty G.T.", "AuthorID": "6603657578", "AffiliationID": "60011520, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre Neurodegeneration Research, King\u2019s College London"}, "26423839400": {"Name": "Jorstad A.A.", "AuthorID": "26423839400", "AffiliationID": "60028186", "AffiliationName": "Centre of Interdisciplinary Electron Microscopy, EPFL"}, "7003946171": {"Name": "Knott G.W.", "AuthorID": "7003946171", "AffiliationID": "60028186", "AffiliationName": "Centre of Interdisciplinary Electron Microscopy, EPFL"}}}
