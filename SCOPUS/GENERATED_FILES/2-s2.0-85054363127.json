Different variations of this method are compared to demonstrate possible results of a fully automatic and general approach. The results can be used as a reference, for example when evaluating the performance of methods that are specifically developed for ultrasound to MRI registration.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Block-matching", "Brain shift", "Fully automatic", "iUS", "MRI", "Symmetric registration"], "IndexKeywords": ["Block Matching", "Brain shifts", "Fully automatic", "Symmetric registration"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85054363127", "SubjectAreas": [["Theoretical Computer Science", "MATH", "2614"], ["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"]], "AuthorData": {"57204489643": {"Name": "Drobny D.", "AuthorID": "57204489643", "AffiliationID": "60004111, 60109217, 60177635", "AffiliationName": "School of Biomedical Engineering and Imaging Sciences, King\u2019s College London, King\u2019s Health Partners, St Thomas\u2019 Hospital"}, "23010613000": {"Name": "Vercauteren T.", "AuthorID": "23010613000", "AffiliationID": "60004111, 60109217, 60177635", "AffiliationName": "School of Biomedical Engineering and Imaging Sciences, King\u2019s College London, King\u2019s Health Partners, St Thomas\u2019 Hospital"}, "6602233595": {"Name": "Ourselin S.", "AuthorID": "6602233595", "AffiliationID": "60004111, 60109217, 60177635", "AffiliationName": "School of Biomedical Engineering and Imaging Sciences, King\u2019s College London, King\u2019s Health Partners, St Thomas\u2019 Hospital"}, "24376919100": {"Name": "Modat M.", "AuthorID": "24376919100", "AffiliationID": "60004111, 60109217, 60177635", "AffiliationName": "School of Biomedical Engineering and Imaging Sciences, King\u2019s College London, King\u2019s Health Partners, St Thomas\u2019 Hospital"}}}
