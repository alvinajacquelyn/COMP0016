However, such integration is challenging: databases are stored in disparate locations, make use of different identifiers, have variable data quality, record information in bespoke purpose-specific formats and have different levels of metadata. Novel computational methods are required to integrate them and enable their statistical analyses for epidemiological research purposes. In this paper, we describe a probabilistic approach for constructing a very large population-based cohort comprised of 114 million individuals using linkages between clinical databases from the National Health System and administrative databases from governmental social programmes. We present our data integration model for creating data marts (epidemiological data) and discuss our evaluation results in controlled and uncontrolled scenarios, which demonstrate that our model and tools achieve high accuracy (minimum of 91%) in different probabilistic data integration scenarios.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Accuracy assessment", "Data integration", "Health and social care data", "Probabilistic linkage"], "IndexKeywords": ["Accuracy assessment", "Evaluation results", "Health and social care", "Integration models", "National health system", "Probabilistic approaches", "Probabilistic integration", "Probabilistic linkage"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85040334926", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"]], "AuthorData": {"56556051800": {"Name": "Pinto C.", "AuthorID": "56556051800", "AffiliationID": "60026004", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Data and Knowledge Integration for Health (CIDACS), FIOCRUZ"}, "56557135700": {"Name": "Pita R.", "AuthorID": "56557135700", "AffiliationID": "60026004", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Data and Knowledge Integration for Health (CIDACS), FIOCRUZ"}, "57211219184": {"Name": "Barbosa G.", "AuthorID": "57211219184", "AffiliationID": "60026004", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Data and Knowledge Integration for Health (CIDACS), FIOCRUZ"}, "57213278142": {"Name": "Araujo B.", "AuthorID": "57213278142", "AffiliationID": "60026004", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Data and Knowledge Integration for Health (CIDACS), FIOCRUZ"}, "57200222797": {"Name": "Bertoldo J.", "AuthorID": "57200222797", "AffiliationID": "60026004", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Data and Knowledge Integration for Health (CIDACS), FIOCRUZ"}, "57200221660": {"Name": "Sena S.", "AuthorID": "57200221660", "AffiliationID": "60026004", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Data and Knowledge Integration for Health (CIDACS), FIOCRUZ"}, "57195491714": {"Name": "Reis S.", "AuthorID": "57195491714", "AffiliationID": "60026004", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Data and Knowledge Integration for Health (CIDACS), FIOCRUZ"}, "25626250200": {"Name": "Fiaccone R.", "AuthorID": "25626250200", "AffiliationID": "60026004", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Data and Knowledge Integration for Health (CIDACS), FIOCRUZ"}, "21734349500": {"Name": "Amorim L.", "AuthorID": "21734349500", "AffiliationID": "60026004", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Data and Knowledge Integration for Health (CIDACS), FIOCRUZ"}, "7004716395": {"Name": "Ichihara M.Y.", "AuthorID": "7004716395", "AffiliationID": "60026004", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Data and Knowledge Integration for Health (CIDACS), FIOCRUZ"}, "7004455625": {"Name": "Barreto M.", "AuthorID": "7004455625", "AffiliationID": "60026004", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Data and Knowledge Integration for Health (CIDACS), FIOCRUZ"}, "55314441500": {"Name": "Barreto M.", "AuthorID": "55314441500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Farr Institute of Health Informatics Research, University College London (UCL)"}, "54902667300": {"Name": "Denaxas S.", "AuthorID": "54902667300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Farr Institute of Health Informatics Research, University College London (UCL)"}}}
