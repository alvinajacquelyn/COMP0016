This letter addresses the design of such architectures from an energy efficiency (EE) perspective. We provide closed-form expressions to compare several promising hybrid beamforming architectures, and also derive optimal numbers of antennas required for maximizing the EE. Our results indicate that the asymptotic closed-forms provide a good approximation even for a relatively small number of antennas. Moreover, the combination of phase shifters and switches offers significantly higher EE versus conventional phase shifter-only architectures, while nearly preserving spectral efficiency.", "AuthorKeywords": ["hybrid beamforming", "Massive MIMO", "phase shifter selection"], "IndexKeywords": ["Array signal processing", "Hybrid beamforming", "Massive MIMO", "MIMO communication", "Power demands", "Radio frequencies"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85048556099", "SubjectAreas": [["Control and Systems Engineering", "ENGI", "2207"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"55263519600": {"Name": "Payami S.", "AuthorID": "55263519600", "AffiliationID": "60019656", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Sensors, Signals and Systems, Heriot-Watt University"}, "25122382400": {"Name": "Balasubramanya N.", "AuthorID": "25122382400", "AffiliationID": "60019656", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Sensors, Signals and Systems, Heriot-Watt University"}, "6701538512": {"Name": "Sellathurai M.", "AuthorID": "6701538512", "AffiliationID": "60019656", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Sensors, Signals and Systems, Heriot-Watt University"}, "23009493900": {"Name": "Masouros C.", "AuthorID": "23009493900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}}}
