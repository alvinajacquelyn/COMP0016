However, these approaches come with an at least quadratic computational cost in the number of observations, which can be prohibitive in many applications. Arguably, it is exactly in such large-scale datasets that capturing any type of dependence is of interest, so striking a favourable trade-off between computational efficiency and test performance for kernel independence tests would have a direct impact on their applicability in practice. In this contribution, we provide an extensive study of the use of large-scale kernel approximations in the context of independence testing, contrasting block-based, Nystr\u00f6m and random Fourier feature approaches. Through a variety of synthetic data experiments, it is demonstrated that our large-scale methods give comparable performance with existing methods while using significantly less computation time and memory.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Hilbert\u2013Schmidt independence criteria", "Independence testing", "Large-scale kernel method", "Nystr\u00f6m method", "Random Fourier features"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85010755767", "SubjectAreas": [["Theoretical Computer Science", "MATH", "2614"], ["Statistics and Probability", "MATH", "2613"], ["Statistics, Probability and Uncertainty", "DECI", "1804"], ["Computational Theory and Mathematics", "COMP", "1703"]], "AuthorData": {"57193094321": {"Name": "Zhang Q.", "AuthorID": "57193094321", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Statistics, University of Oxford"}, "24725805500": {"Name": "Sejdinovic D.", "AuthorID": "24725805500", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Statistics, University of Oxford"}, "6603257032": {"Name": "Gretton A.", "AuthorID": "6603257032", "AffiliationID": "60084280, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit, University College of London"}, "55241604600": {"Name": "Filippi S.", "AuthorID": "55241604600", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Imperial College"}}}
