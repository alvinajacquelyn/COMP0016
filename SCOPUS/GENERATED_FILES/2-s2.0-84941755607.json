However, patient responses to CD28-ligand blockade by abatacept (CTLA-4-Ig) in conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis are variable and often suboptimal. In this study, we show that the extent to which abatacept suppresses T cell activation is influenced by the strength of TCR stimulation, with high-strength TCR stimulation being associated with relative abatacept insensitivity. Accordingly, cyclosporin A, an inhibitor of T cell stimulation via the TCR, synergized with abatacept to inhibit T cell activation. We also observed that 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 enhanced the inhibition of T cell activation by abatacept, strongly inhibiting T cell activation driven by cross-linked anti-CD3, but with no effect upon anti-CD28 driven stimulation. Thus, like cyclosporin A, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 inhibits TCR-driven activation, thereby promoting abatacept sensitivity. Vitamin D3 supplementation may therefore be a useful adjunct for the treatment of conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis in combination with abatacept to promote the efficacy of treatment.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Abatacept", "Animals", "Antigens, CD28", "Apoptosis", "Arthritis, Rheumatoid", "Calcitriol", "Cell Line", "Cell Proliferation", "CHO Cells", "Cricetulus", "Cyclosporine", "Immunosuppressive Agents", "Inflammation", "Lymphocyte Activation", "Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell", "T-Lymphocytes"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84941755607", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"]], "AuthorData": {"56637168100": {"Name": "Gardner D.H.", "AuthorID": "56637168100", "AffiliationID": "60019702, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council Centre for Immune Regulation, School of Immunity and Infection, Institute of Biomedical Research, University of Birmingham"}, "36186958400": {"Name": "Jeffery L.E.", "AuthorID": "36186958400", "AffiliationID": "60019702, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council Centre for Immune Regulation, School of Immunity and Infection, Institute of Biomedical Research, University of Birmingham"}, "37071804800": {"Name": "Briggs Z.", "AuthorID": "37071804800", "AffiliationID": "60019702, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council Centre for Immune Regulation, School of Immunity and Infection, Institute of Biomedical Research, University of Birmingham"}, "24169603700": {"Name": "Raza K.", "AuthorID": "24169603700", "AffiliationID": "60017140", "AffiliationName": "Department of Rheumatology, Sandwell and West Birmingham Hospitals National Health Service Trust"}, "56342499100": {"Name": "Soskic B.", "AuthorID": "56342499100", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60032819", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Immunity and Transplantation, University College London, Royal Free Hospital"}, "16834798100": {"Name": "Hou T.Z.", "AuthorID": "16834798100", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60032819", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Immunity and Transplantation, University College London, Royal Free Hospital"}, "7005289543": {"Name": "Sansom D.M.", "AuthorID": "7005289543", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60032819", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Immunity and Transplantation, University College London, Royal Free Hospital"}}}
