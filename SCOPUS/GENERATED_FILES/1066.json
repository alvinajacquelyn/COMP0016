An illness-death model for history of stroke is presented, where time-dependent transition intensities are regressed on a latent variable representing cognitive function. The change of this function over time is described by a linear growth model with random effects. Occasion-specific cognitive function is measured by an item response model for longitudinal scores on the Mini-Mental State Examination, a questionnaire used to screen for cognitive impairment. The illness-death model will be used to identify and to explore the relationship between occasion-specific cognitive function and stroke. Combining a multi-state model with the latent growth model defines a joint model which extends current statistical inference regarding disease progression and cognitive function. Markov chain Monte Carlo methods are used for Bayesian inference. Data stem from the Medical Research Council Cognitive Function and Ageing Study in the UK (1991-2005).", "AuthorKeywords": ["item-response theory", "Markov chain Monte Carlo", "mini-mental state examination", "multi-state model", "random effects"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Bayes Theorem", "Cognition Disorders", "Humans", "Markov Chains", "Models, Statistical", "Monte Carlo Method", "Risk Factors", "Stroke", "Time Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84948416898", "SubjectAreas": [["Epidemiology", "MEDI", "2713"], ["Statistics and Probability", "MATH", "2613"], ["Health Information Management", "HEAL", "3605"]], "AuthorData": {"6603479955": {"Name": "Van Den Hout A.", "AuthorID": "6603479955", "AffiliationID": "60009587, 60006654", "AffiliationName": "MRC Biostatistics Unit, Institute of Public Health"}, "7404280363": {"Name": "Fox J.", "AuthorID": "7404280363", "AffiliationID": "60020599", "AffiliationName": "Department of Research Methodology, Measurement and Data Analysis, Faculty of Behavioral Sciences, Twente University"}, "16024777300": {"Name": "Klein Entink R.", "AuthorID": "16024777300", "AffiliationID": "60019984", "AffiliationName": "TNO Quality and Safety"}}}
