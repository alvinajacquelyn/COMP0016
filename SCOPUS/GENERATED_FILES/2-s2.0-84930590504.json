Our framework allows one to compute the average price trajectory in the presence of a meta-order that consistently generalizes previously proposed propagator models. We account for the universally observed square-root impact law, and predict non-trivial trajectories when trading is interrupted or reversed. We prove that our framework is free of price manipulation and that prices can be made diffusive (albeit with a generic short-term mean-reverting contribution). Our model suggests that prices can be decomposed into a transient \u2018mechanical\u2019 impact component and a permanent \u2018informational\u2019 component.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Limit order book", "Market impact model", "Market microstructure", "Non-arbitrage", "Price formation", "Reaction\u2013diffusion"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84930590504", "SubjectAreas": [["Finance", "ECON", "2003"], ["Economics, Econometrics and Finance (all)", "ECON", "2000"]], "AuthorData": {"56672943900": {"Name": "Donier J.", "AuthorID": "56672943900", "AffiliationID": "60001422, 60111003", "AffiliationName": "Laboratoire de Probabilit\u00e9s et Mod\u00e8les Al\u00e9atoires, Universit\u00e9 Pierre et Marie Curie (Paris 6)"}, "54976318700": {"Name": "Bonart J.", "AuthorID": "54976318700", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, CFM-Imperial Institute of Quantitative Finance, Imperial College"}, "35585798700": {"Name": "Bouchaud J.P.", "AuthorID": "35585798700", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, CFM-Imperial Institute of Quantitative Finance, Imperial College"}, "12244667800": {"Name": "Mastromatteo I.", "AuthorID": "12244667800", "AffiliationID": "60105987, 60013425, 60008134", "AffiliationName": "Centre de Math\u00e9matiques Appliqu\u00e9es, CNRS"}}}
