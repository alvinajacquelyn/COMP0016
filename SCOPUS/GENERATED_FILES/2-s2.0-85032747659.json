Methods: We investigated a Greek HSP family using whole exome sequencing (WES). Results: A novel AP4M1A frameshift insertion, and a very rare missense variant were identified in all three affected siblings in the compound heterozygous state (p.V174fs and p.C319R); the unaffected parents were carriers of only one variant. Patients were affected with a combination of: (a) febrile seizures with onset in the first year of life (followed by epileptic non-febrile seizures); (b) distinctive facial appearance (e.g., coarse features, bulbous nose and hypomimia); (c) developmental delay and intellectual disability; (d) early-onset spastic weakness of the lower limbs; and (e) cerebellar hypoplasia/atrophy on brain MRI. Conclusions: We review genotype-phenotype correlations and discuss clinical overlaps between different AP4-related diseases. The AP4M1 belongs to a complex that mediates vesicle trafficking of glutamate receptors, being likely involved in brain development and neurotransmission.", "AuthorKeywords": ["AP4 complex", "Cerebellar hypoplasia", "Epilepsy", "Hereditary spastic paraplegia", "Whole exome sequencing"], "IndexKeywords": ["Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors", "Female", "Genetic Association Studies", "Humans", "Male", "Mutation", "Pedigree", "Spastic Paraplegia, Hereditary"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85032747659", "SubjectAreas": [["Genetics (clinical)", "MEDI", "2716"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"8581587200": {"Name": "Bettencourt C.", "AuthorID": "8581587200", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Experimental Epilepsy, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "6507973880": {"Name": "Salpietro V.", "AuthorID": "6507973880", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "55567766600": {"Name": "Efthymiou S.", "AuthorID": "55567766600", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Experimental Epilepsy, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "57188682705": {"Name": "Chelban V.", "AuthorID": "57188682705", "AffiliationID": "60071302", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Medical State University N"}, "57208749034": {"Name": "Hughes D.", "AuthorID": "57208749034", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "57196045273": {"Name": "Pittman A.M.", "AuthorID": "57196045273", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "25929874000": {"Name": "Federoff M.", "AuthorID": "25929874000", "AffiliationID": "60017252, 60006577", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Neurogenetics, National Institute on Aging, National Institutes of Health"}, "7003363686": {"Name": "Houlden H.", "AuthorID": "7003363686", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, University College London Hospitals"}, "7006092717": {"Name": "Singleton A.B.", "AuthorID": "7006092717", "AffiliationID": "60017252, 60006577", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Neurogenetics, National Institute on Aging, National Institutes of Health"}, "57196355245": {"Name": "Bourinaris T.", "AuthorID": "57196355245", "AffiliationID": "60013207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Papageorgiou Hospital"}, "35229376500": {"Name": "Deretzi G.", "AuthorID": "35229376500", "AffiliationID": "60013207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Papageorgiou Hospital"}, "57196354002": {"Name": "Kalantzakou T.", "AuthorID": "57196354002", "AffiliationID": "60013207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Papageorgiou Hospital"}, "57207896453": {"Name": "Xiromerisiou G.", "AuthorID": "57207896453", "AffiliationID": "60013207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Papageorgiou Hospital"}, "6506087235": {"Name": "Spilioti M.", "AuthorID": "6506087235", "AffiliationID": "60015331, 60026834", "AffiliationName": "Neurology Department of Aristotle, University of Thessaloniki, AHEPA University Hospital"}}}
