KGaA, Weinheim.Patients with Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) exhibit prominent defects in splenic marginal zone (MZ), resulting in abnormal T-cell-independent antibody responses and increased bacterial infections. B-cell-intrinsic deletion of the affected gene WAS protein (WASp) markedly reduces splenic MZ B cells, without impacting the rate of MZ B-cell development, suggesting that abnormal B-cell retention within the MZ accounts for MZ defects in WAS. Since WASp regulates integrin-dependent actin cytoskeletal rearrangement, we previously hypothesized that defective B-cell integrin function promotes MZ depletion. In contrast, we now report that B-cell-intrinsic deletion of the TLR signaling adaptor MyD88 is sufficient to restore the MZ in WAS. We further identify TLR7, an endosomal single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) receptor, as the MyD88-dependent receptor responsible for WAS MZ depletion. These findings implicate spontaneous activation of MZ B cells by ssRNA-containing self-ligands (likely derived from circulating apoptotic material) as the mechanism underlying MZ depletion in WAS. Together, these data suggest a previously unappreciated role for B-cell intrinsic TLR signals in MZ homeostasis, of relevance to both pathogen responses and to the development of systemic autoimmunity.", "AuthorKeywords": ["B cells", "Cell trafficking", "Marginal zone", "Toll-like receptors", "Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "B-Lymphocytes", "Cytoskeleton", "Disease Models, Animal", "Integrins", "Lymphocyte Depletion", "Membrane Glycoproteins", "Mice", "Mice, Knockout", "Myeloid Differentiation Factor 88", "Signal Transduction", "Spleen", "Toll-Like Receptor 7", "Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84943200305", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"]], "AuthorData": {"28567831900": {"Name": "Kolhatkar N.S.", "AuthorID": "28567831900", "AffiliationID": "60028548", "AffiliationName": "Department of Immunology, University of Washington School of Medicine"}, "55331143600": {"Name": "Scharping N.E.", "AuthorID": "55331143600", "AffiliationID": "60018922", "AffiliationName": "Seattle Children's Research Institute"}, "56816352700": {"Name": "Jacobs H.M.", "AuthorID": "56816352700", "AffiliationID": "60018922", "AffiliationName": "Seattle Children's Research Institute"}, "55083690900": {"Name": "Schwartz M.A.", "AuthorID": "55083690900", "AffiliationID": "60028548", "AffiliationName": "Department of Immunology, University of Washington School of Medicine"}, "15839253500": {"Name": "Khim S.", "AuthorID": "15839253500", "AffiliationID": "60018922", "AffiliationName": "Seattle Children's Research Institute"}, "35461145700": {"Name": "Rawlings D.J.", "AuthorID": "35461145700", "AffiliationID": "60028548", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatrics, University of Washington School of Medicine"}, "55419786200": {"Name": "Jackson S.W.", "AuthorID": "55419786200", "AffiliationID": "60028548", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatrics, University of Washington School of Medicine"}, "37361644200": {"Name": "Sullivan J.M.", "AuthorID": "37361644200", "AffiliationID": "60028548", "AffiliationName": "Department of Immunology, University of Washington School of Medicine"}, "34768650200": {"Name": "Notarangelo L.D.", "AuthorID": "34768650200", "AffiliationID": "60030521, 60002746", "AffiliationName": "Division of Immunology, Children's Hospital Boston, Harvard Medical School"}, "7005085037": {"Name": "Thrasher A.J.", "AuthorID": "7005085037", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Immunodeficiency, Molecular and Cellular Immunology, Institute of Child Health, University College London"}}}
