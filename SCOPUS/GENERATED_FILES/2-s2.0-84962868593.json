(ACM).In this workshop, we will review and discub opportunities, technical challenges and problems with crob-device interactions in interactive multi-surface and multidevice ecologies. We aim to bring together researchers and practitioners currently working on novel techniques for crob-surface interactions, focusing both on technical as well as interaction challenges for introducing these technologies into the wild, and highlighting opportunities for further research. The workshop will help to facilitate knowledge exchange on the inherent challenges of building robust and intuitive crob-surface interactions, identify application domains and enabling technologies for crob-surface interactions in the wild, and establish a research community to develop effective strategies for succebful design of crob-device interactions.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Crob-Surface Interaction", "Multi-Device Interactions", "Multi-Screen Workplaces", "Multisurface Interactions", "Spatial Reconfigurations Of Displays", "Spatially Distributed Interfaces", "Ubicomp Ecologies", "Wearable Devices"], "IndexKeywords": ["Distributed interfaces", "Multi screens", "Multi-devices", "Multi-surface interaction", "Surface interactions", "Ubicomp", "Wearable devices"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84962868593", "SubjectAreas": [["Hardware and Architecture", "COMP", "1708"], ["Human-Computer Interaction", "COMP", "1709"]], "AuthorData": {"55247206500": {"Name": "Houben S.", "AuthorID": "55247206500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, UCL Interaction Centre / ICRI Cities"}, "55921115600": {"Name": "Marquardt N.", "AuthorID": "55921115600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, UCL Interaction Centre / ICRI Cities"}, "25723878600": {"Name": "Vermeulen J.", "AuthorID": "25723878600", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "HCI Centre, University of Birmingham"}, "23392583100": {"Name": "Klokmose C.", "AuthorID": "23392583100", "AffiliationID": "60029616", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, Aarhus University"}, "57200009317": {"Name": "Sch\u00f6ning J.", "AuthorID": "57200009317", "AffiliationID": "116517863", "AffiliationName": "Expertise Centre for Digital Media, Habelt University-TUL - IMinds"}, "23398200600": {"Name": "Reiterer H.", "AuthorID": "23398200600", "AffiliationID": "60025525", "AffiliationName": "HCI Group, University of Konstanz"}}}
