It occurs because of the persistence of the right sinus venosus valve, resulting in partitioning of the right atrium. Most of the described cases of cor triatriatum dexter in the literature were incidental findings on echocardiogram or at necropsy. We present a case report of a 7-year-old girl who was referred to us for further assessment, with a possible diagnosis of coarctation of the aorta. Initial investigations confirmed not only the presence of a long segment coarctation of the aorta, but also a large obstructive membrane in the right atrium. A catheter intervention was performed to stent the coarctation segment, and the fibro-muscular shelf in the right atrium was surgically resected.", "AuthorKeywords": ["coarctation of the aorta", "Cor triatriatum", "right atrium"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aortic Coarctation", "Child", "Cor Triatriatum", "Female", "Humans", "Neurofibromatosis 1"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84927690641", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"7801462613": {"Name": "Omeje I.", "AuthorID": "7801462613", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children, NHS Foundation Trust"}, "54883432300": {"Name": "Hsia T.Y.", "AuthorID": "54883432300", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children, NHS Foundation Trust"}, "55963563800": {"Name": "Christov G.", "AuthorID": "55963563800", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children, NHS Foundation Trust"}, "6603345564": {"Name": "Khambadkone S.", "AuthorID": "6603345564", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children, NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
