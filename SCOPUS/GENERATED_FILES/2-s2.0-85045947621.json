Here we show that astrocytes of the mouse somatosensory cortex manifest layer-specific morphological and molecular differences. Two- and three-dimensional observations revealed that astrocytes in the different layers possess distinct morphologies as reflected by differences in cell orientation, territorial volume, and arborization. The extent of ensheathment of synaptic clefts by astrocytes in layer II/III was greater than that by those in layer VI. Moreover, differences in gene expression were observed between upper-layer and deep-layer astrocytes. Importantly, layer-specific differences in astrocyte properties were abrogated in reeler and Dab1 conditional knockout mice, in which neuronal layers are disturbed, suggesting that neuronal layers are a prerequisite for the observed morphological and molecular differences of neocortical astrocytes. This study thus demonstrates the existence of layer-specific interactions between neurons and astrocytes, which may underlie their layer-specific functions.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Astrocytes", "Cell Adhesion Molecules, Neuronal", "Extracellular Matrix Proteins", "Female", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Mice, Knockout", "Neocortex", "Nerve Tissue Proteins", "Neurons", "Serine Endopeptidases", "Somatosensory Cortex"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85045947621", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"55618093900": {"Name": "Lanjakornsiripan D.", "AuthorID": "55618093900", "AffiliationID": "60025272", "AffiliationName": "Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Tokyo"}, "57201720820": {"Name": "Pior B.J.", "AuthorID": "57201720820", "AffiliationID": "60025272", "AffiliationName": "Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Tokyo"}, "14050144900": {"Name": "Kawaguchi D.", "AuthorID": "14050144900", "AffiliationID": "60025272", "AffiliationName": "Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Tokyo"}, "55616896400": {"Name": "Furutachi S.", "AuthorID": "55616896400", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60020649", "AffiliationName": "Sainsbury Wellcome Centre for Neural Circuits and Behaviour, University College London"}, "57201723149": {"Name": "Tahara T.", "AuthorID": "57201723149", "AffiliationID": "60025272", "AffiliationName": "Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Tokyo"}, "7201963275": {"Name": "Gotoh Y.", "AuthorID": "7201963275", "AffiliationID": "60025272", "AffiliationName": "Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Tokyo"}, "35600124500": {"Name": "Katsuyama Y.", "AuthorID": "35600124500", "AffiliationID": "60007524", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anatomy, Shiga University of Medical Science"}, "55626680600": {"Name": "Suzuki Y.", "AuthorID": "55626680600", "AffiliationID": "60025272", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computational Biology, Graduate School of Frontier Sciences, University of Tokyo"}, "7101987129": {"Name": "Fukazawa Y.", "AuthorID": "7101987129", "AffiliationID": "60010848", "AffiliationName": "Graduate School of Medical Sciences, University of Fukui"}}}
