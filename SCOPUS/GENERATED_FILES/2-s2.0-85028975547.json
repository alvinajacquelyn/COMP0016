Studies in the fungal pathogen, Cryptococcus neoformans, have shown that loss of GlcCer synthase activity results in complete loss of virulence in the mouse model. However, whether the loss of virulence is due to the lack of the enzyme or to the loss of the sphingolipid is not known. In this study, we used genetic engineering to alter the chemical structure of fungal GlcCer and studied its effect on fungal growth and pathogenicity. Here we show that unsaturation in C8 and methylation in C9 is required for virulence in the mouse model without affecting fungal growth in vitro or common virulence factors. However, changes in GlcCer structure led to a dramatic susceptibility to membrane stressors resulting in increased cell membrane permeability and rendering the fungal mutant unable to grow within host macrophages. Biophysical studies using synthetic vesicles containing GlcCer revealed that the saturated and unmethylated sphingolipid formed vesicles with higher lipid order that were more likely to phase separate into ordered domains. Taken together, these studies show for the first time that a specific structure of GlcCer is a major regulator of membrane permeability required for fungal pathogenicity.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cryptococcus", "Fungi", "Glucosylceramide", "Infectious disease", "Plasma membrane", "Sphingolipid"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Biophysical Phenomena", "Cell Membrane", "Cryptococcosis", "Cryptococcus neoformans", "Female", "Glucosylceramides", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred CBA", "Organisms, Genetically Modified", "Virulence"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85028975547", "SubjectAreas": [["Biophysics", "BIOC", "1304"], ["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"57061880600": {"Name": "Raj S.", "AuthorID": "57061880600", "AffiliationID": "60001772", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mycology, Institut Pasteur"}, "56868631000": {"Name": "Nazemidashtarjandi S.", "AuthorID": "56868631000", "AffiliationID": "60011132", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, Ohio University"}, "57188754254": {"Name": "Farnoud A.M.", "AuthorID": "57188754254", "AffiliationID": "60011132", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, Ohio University"}, "57191682208": {"Name": "Kim J.", "AuthorID": "57191682208", "AffiliationID": "60026415", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Stony Brook University"}, "55940708500": {"Name": "Zhang X.", "AuthorID": "55940708500", "AffiliationID": "60026415", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Stony Brook University"}, "7006500064": {"Name": "Raleigh D.P.", "AuthorID": "7006500064", "AffiliationID": "60026415", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Stony Brook University"}, "7102121768": {"Name": "London E.", "AuthorID": "7102121768", "AffiliationID": "60026415", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Stony Brook University"}, "36237411500": {"Name": "Joffe L.", "AuthorID": "36237411500", "AffiliationID": "60000036", "AffiliationName": "Departamento de Microbiologia Geral, Instituto de Microbiologia Paulo de G\u00f3es, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ)"}, "35512285800": {"Name": "Rodrigues M.L.", "AuthorID": "35512285800", "AffiliationID": "60026004", "AffiliationName": "Centro de Desenvolvimento Tecnol\u00f3gico em Sa\u00fade (CDTS) da Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Oswaldo Cruz (Fiocruz)"}, "56687913900": {"Name": "Singh A.", "AuthorID": "56687913900", "AffiliationID": "60026415", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Genetics and Microbiology, Stony Brook University"}, "55643794400": {"Name": "Mor V.", "AuthorID": "55643794400", "AffiliationID": "60026415", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Genetics and Microbiology, Stony Brook University"}, "6603814179": {"Name": "Del Poeta M.", "AuthorID": "6603814179", "AffiliationID": "60026415", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infectious Diseases, Stony Brook University"}, "48361123500": {"Name": "Desmarini D.", "AuthorID": "48361123500", "AffiliationID": "60003992", "AffiliationName": "Fungal Pathogenesis Laboratory, Centre for Infectious Diseases and Microbiology, The Westmead Institute for Medical Research"}, "7003424997": {"Name": "Djordjevic J.", "AuthorID": "7003424997", "AffiliationID": "60025709", "AffiliationName": "Marie Bashir Institute for Infectious Diseases and Biosecurity, University of Sydney"}}}
