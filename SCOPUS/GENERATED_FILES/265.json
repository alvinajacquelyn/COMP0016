The brain is the mind\u2019s body and not all the connections that psychological experience makes with subsequent function can be made available through the study of a single domain. Similarly, the impact of psychoanalysis cannot be fully appreciated from clinical material alone. It may be that difficulty in pinpointing the curative factors in psychoanalytic treatment is directly related to the limitations of uniquely clinical basis for inquiry. A cultural shift characterizes the last decades of this century, with both professionals and the lay public switching from an environmental model of psychopathology to a genetic\u2013biological frame of reference that excludes consideration of psychodynamic aspects.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85078972299", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychology (all)", "PSYC", "3200"]], "AuthorData": {"7004981532": {"Name": "Fonagy P.", "AuthorID": "7004981532", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Sub-Department of Clinical Health Psychology at University College"}, "7004479898": {"Name": "Target M.", "AuthorID": "7004479898", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College"}}}
