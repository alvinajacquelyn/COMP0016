Thermodynamic analysis of the protease (+NP) showed decreases in Km and activation energy (Ea) with increased Vmax and deactivation energy (Ed) at both 40 \u00b0C and 90 \u00b0C. The protease (+NP) exhibited compatibility with various laboratory and commercial detergents (1%) at both 40 \u00b0C and 90 \u00b0C. The protease (+NP) was utilized to efficiently degrade feather to produce amino acids, removal of blood stains from cloth and tenderization of raw meat within a short time.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Alkaline pH", "Bacillus Subtilis", "Hydroxyapatite nanoparticles", "Metallo-protease", "Nano-hydroxyapatite", "PH stability", "Raw meats", "Thermo dynamic analysis"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84945926462", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"]], "AuthorData": {"22633379300": {"Name": "Chakrabarti K.", "AuthorID": "22633379300", "AffiliationID": "60024232", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemistry, University College of Science, Calcutta University"}, "55195045900": {"Name": "Mukhopadhyay A.", "AuthorID": "55195045900", "AffiliationID": "60026548", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemistry and Microbiology, Rhodes University"}}}
