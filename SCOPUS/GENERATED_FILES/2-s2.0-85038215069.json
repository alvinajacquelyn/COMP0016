Longitudinal chromatic aberration (LCA) can be induced in the lens by means of dual wavelength illumination. The EDOF region is then constructed from the sum of the adjacent depths of field from each wavelength illumination. The lens parameters can be found analytically with paraxial raytracing. The extended depth of field is dependant on the glass chosen and position of the near object point.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Chromatic aberration", "Extended depth of eld", "Iris imaging", "Optical design"], "IndexKeywords": ["Chromatic aberration", "Conventional lens", "Dual wavelength", "Extended depth of eld", "Extended depth of field", "Iris recognition", "Lens parameters", "Smart-phone cameras"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85038215069", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"57195409595": {"Name": "Fitzgerald N.", "AuthorID": "57195409595", "AffiliationID": "60008539", "AffiliationName": "Applied Optics Group, School of Physics, National University of Ireland"}, "7102116596": {"Name": "Goncharov A.", "AuthorID": "7102116596", "AffiliationID": "60008539", "AffiliationName": "Applied Optics Group, School of Physics, National University of Ireland"}, "55397057100": {"Name": "Dainty C.", "AuthorID": "55397057100", "AffiliationID": "60016633", "AffiliationName": "FotoNation Ltd, Parkmore East Ind.
