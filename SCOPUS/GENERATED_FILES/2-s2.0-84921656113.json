Feistle.Background: Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) is associated with significant mortality, progression to end-stage renal disease and recurrence post transplantation. The deficiency of CFHR plasma proteins and autoantibody-positive hemolytic uremic syndrome (DEAP-HUS) has a more favorable outcome. Guidelines suggest plasma therapy be initiated within 24 hours of presentation of aHUS. Presentation of aHUS, particularly, DEAP-HUS is associated with a diarrheal prodrome in up to 53% of patients and initiation of appropriate therapies is frequently delayed. Cases: We report on 3 patients with DEAP-HUS, who presented with a diarrheal prodrome that delayed diagnosis and initiation of plasma therapy past the 24-hour window recommended. C3 was low in 2 cases at presentation. All patients had positive complement factor H (CFH) autoantibodies. Despite delay in initiating plasma therapy, all 3 cases remitted with restoration of normal renal function following initial presentation. One patient had a relapse but responded to further plasma exchange and immunosuppression. The remaining 2 patients were relapse-free without maintenance immunosuppression. Conclusion: Our cases highlight the complexity of diagnosing DEAP-HUS due to the common occurrence of diarrhea in the prodromal phase and the subsequent delay in initiating of plasma therapy. We therefore advocate a low threshold for testing CFH autoantibodies in ambiguous cases where there is no history of bloody diarrhea or Shiga-toxin exposure.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome", "Complement factor-H autoantibodies", "DEAP-HUS", "Eculizumab", "Plasma exchange", "Virus-inactivated fresh frozen plasma"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Atypical Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome", "Autoantibodies", "Child", "Complement Factor H", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Plasma Exchange"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84921656113", "SubjectAreas": [["Nephrology", "MEDI", "2727"]], "AuthorData": {"56337055200": {"Name": "Kim J.J.", "AuthorID": "56337055200", "AffiliationID": "60107269", "AffiliationName": "Pediatric Nephrology, Evelina Children's Hospital"}, "8889557300": {"Name": "Marks S.D.", "AuthorID": "8889557300", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nephro-Urology, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Trust"}, "24170359900": {"Name": "Waters A.", "AuthorID": "24170359900", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Child Health, University College"}, "55813948800": {"Name": "Noone D.", "AuthorID": "55813948800", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nephro-Urology, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Trust"}, "7102869548": {"Name": "McCulloch M.", "AuthorID": "7102869548", "AffiliationID": "60107269", "AffiliationName": "Pediatric Nephrology, Evelina Children's Hospital"}}}
