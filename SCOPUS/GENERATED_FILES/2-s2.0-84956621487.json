Increased expression of genes involved in xenobiotic metabolism, together with resistance to xenobiotics, are frequent correlates of lifespan extension in the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans, the fruit fly Drosophila, and mice. The Green Theory of Aging suggests that this association is causal, with the ability of cells to rid themselves of lipophilic toxins limiting normal lifespan. To test this idea, we experimentally increased resistance of Drosophila to the xenobiotic dichlordiphenyltrichlorethan (DDT), by artificial selection or by transgenic expression of a gene encoding a cytochrome P450. Although both interventions increased DDT resistance, neither increased lifespan. Furthermore, dietary restriction increased lifespan without increasing xenobiotic resistance, confirming that the two traits can be uncoupled. Reduced activity of the insulin/Igf signaling (IIS) pathway increases resistance to xenobiotics and extends lifespan in Drosophila, and can also increase longevity in C. elegans, mice, and possibly humans. We identified a nuclear hormone receptor, DHR96, as an essential mediator of the increased xenobiotic resistance of IIS mutant flies. However, the IIS mutants remained long-lived in the absence of DHR96 and the xenobiotic resistance that it conferred. Thus, in Drosophila IIS mutants, increased xenobiotic resistance and enhanced longevity are not causally connected. The frequent co-occurrence of the two traits may instead have evolved because, in nature, lowered IIS can signal the presence of pathogens. It will be important to determine whether enhanced xenobiotic metabolism is also a correlated, rather than a causal, trait in long-lived mice.", "AuthorKeywords": ["DHR96", "IIS", "Lifespan", "Nuclear hormone receptor", "Xenobiotic resistance"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Drosophila", "Drosophila Proteins", "Drug Resistance", "Insulin", "Life Expectancy", "Mutation", "Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear", "Transcription, Genetic", "Xenobiotics"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84956621487", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"57090940100": {"Name": "Afschar S.", "AuthorID": "57090940100", "AffiliationID": "60103814", "AffiliationName": "Max Planck Institute for Biology of Ageing"}, "57214433169": {"Name": "Hoffmann J.", "AuthorID": "57214433169", "AffiliationID": "60103814", "AffiliationName": "Max Planck Institute for Biology of Ageing"}, "24173766800": {"Name": "Tain L.", "AuthorID": "24173766800", "AffiliationID": "60103814", "AffiliationName": "Max Planck Institute for Biology of Ageing"}, "57213258173": {"Name": "Finlayson A.", "AuthorID": "57213258173", "AffiliationID": "60103814", "AffiliationName": "Max Planck Institute for Biology of Ageing"}, "57090543100": {"Name": "Stinn J.", "AuthorID": "57090543100", "AffiliationID": "60103814", "AffiliationName": "Max Planck Institute for Biology of Ageing"}, "57089998100": {"Name": "Froehlich J.", "AuthorID": "57089998100", "AffiliationID": "60103814", "AffiliationName": "Max Planck Institute for Biology of Ageing"}, "57202667589": {"Name": "Partridge L.", "AuthorID": "57202667589", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Institute of Healthy Ageing, Department of Genetics, Evolution and Environment, University College London"}, "7005701629": {"Name": "Toivonen J.", "AuthorID": "7005701629", "AffiliationID": "60023452, 60016809", "AffiliationName": "Laboratorio de Gen\u00e9tica Bioqu\u00edmica, Departamento de Anatom\u00eda, Embriolog\u00eda y Gen\u00e9tica Animal, Facultad de Veterinaria, Instituto Agroalimentario de Arag\u00f3n, Instituto de Investigaci\u00f3n Sanitaria Arag\u00f3n, Universidad de Zaragoza"}, "24176323400": {"Name": "Wieser D.", "AuthorID": "24176323400", "AffiliationID": "60022106, 60026124", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Trust Genome Campus, European Bioinformatics Institute"}, "8286569900": {"Name": "Driege Y.", "AuthorID": "8286569900", "AffiliationID": "60033316", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomedical Molecular Biology, Ghent University"}, "6602213773": {"Name": "Alic N.", "AuthorID": "6602213773", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Institute of Healthy Ageing, Department of Genetics, Evolution and Environment, University College London"}, "56192349200": {"Name": "Emran S.", "AuthorID": "56192349200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Institute of Healthy Ageing, Department of Genetics, Evolution and Environment, University College London"}, "7005784113": {"Name": "Piper M.", "AuthorID": "7005784113", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Institute of Healthy Ageing, Department of Genetics, Evolution and Environment, University College London"}}}
