MPS\u2013IVa (mucopolysaccharidosis IVa, Morquio) and tyrosinemia type III individuals were assessed using tasks of attention, language and oculomotor function. MPS\u2013IVa individuals were slower in visual search, but the display size effects were normal, and slowing was not due to long reaction times (ruling out slow item processing or distraction). Maintaining gaze in an oculomotor task was difficult. Results implicated sustained attention and task initiation or response processing. Shifting attention, accumulating evidence and selecting targets were unaffected. Visual search was also slowed in tyrosinemia type III, and patterns in visual search and fixation tasks pointed to sustained attention impairments, although there were differences from MPS\u2013IVa. Language was impaired in tyrosinemia type III but not MPS\u2013IVa. Metabolic diseases produced selective cognitive effects. Our results, incorporating new methods for developmental data and model selection, illustrate how cognitive data can contribute to understanding function in biochemical brain systems.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Attention", "developmental disorder", "language", "morquio", "tyrosinemia"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cognition", "Humans", "Metabolic Diseases", "Mucopolysaccharidosis IV", "Tyrosinemias"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85046777311", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuropsychology and Physiological Psychology", "PSYC", "3206"], ["Experimental and Cognitive Psychology", "PSYC", "3205"], ["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"], ["Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)", "ARTS", "1201"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"]], "AuthorData": {"57197847725": {"Name": "Blundell J.", "AuthorID": "57197847725", "AffiliationID": "60017326", "AffiliationName": "Mobility and Transport Faculty Research Centre, Faculty of Engineering, Environment and Computing, Coventry University"}, "9335253500": {"Name": "Frisson S.", "AuthorID": "9335253500", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, University of Birmingham"}, "35965895600": {"Name": "Olson A.", "AuthorID": "35965895600", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, University of Birmingham"}, "57205589935": {"Name": "Chakrapani A.", "AuthorID": "57205589935", "AffiliationID": "60022357", "AffiliationName": "Birmingham Children\u2019s Hospital"}, "57090176100": {"Name": "Kearney S.", "AuthorID": "57090176100", "AffiliationID": "60022357", "AffiliationName": "Birmingham Children\u2019s Hospital"}, "55329348900": {"Name": "Vijay S.", "AuthorID": "55329348900", "AffiliationID": "60022357", "AffiliationName": "Birmingham Children\u2019s Hospital"}, "7401581465": {"Name": "MacDonald A.", "AuthorID": "7401581465", "AffiliationID": "60022357", "AffiliationName": "Birmingham Children\u2019s Hospital"}, "6602308059": {"Name": "Gissen P.", "AuthorID": "6602308059", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "55907064300": {"Name": "Hendriksz C.", "AuthorID": "55907064300", "AffiliationID": "60021902", "AffiliationName": "Steve Biko Academic Unit, University of Pretoria"}}}
