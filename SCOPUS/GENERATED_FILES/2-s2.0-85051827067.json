Design: Systematic review and Delphi consensus method. Methods: Systematic review of glaucoma surgical trials published from January 2010 until July 2017 with a quality assessment against the CONSORT checklist for harm. A Delphi method was employed to generate consensus grading (interquartile range \u2264 2) among international glaucoma experts (n = 43) on severity of glaucoma surgical complications, and specifically for trabeculectomy and aqueous shunt complications, from 1 (no clinical significance) to 10 (most severe complication). Results: Forty-seven studies were eligible. The items of the CONSORT checklist for harm that were most frequently missing were use of a validated instrument to report severity (0%), withdrawals due to harm, and subgroup analyses, both reported in 3 publications (6.4%). Most glaucoma experts participating in the Delphi process (80%) completed the second round, and consensus was achieved for all but 1 complication. The least severe complications (graded 2) were \u201ctransient loss of vision,\u201d \u201cearly low intraocular pressure,\u201d \u201cchoroidal detachment anterior to equator,\u201d \u201csmall layered hyphema < 1 mm,\u201d and \u201cincreased lens opacity not clinically significant.\u201d The most severe complications (graded 10) were \u201cendophthalmitis\u201d and \u201cpermanent severe loss of vision (hand movements or worse).\u201d Conclusions: Glaucoma surgical randomized controlled trials report frequency of complications, but their severity is rarely reported. The quality of harm reporting is poor. We propose the use of a newly developed system of classification for assessing the severity of surgical complications based on consensus.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Consensus", "Data Accuracy", "Data Interpretation, Statistical", "Delphi Technique", "Glaucoma", "Glaucoma Drainage Implants", "Humans", "Intraocular Pressure", "Postoperative Complications", "Practice Guidelines as Topic", "Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic", "Risk Management", "Trabeculectomy"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85051827067", "SubjectAreas": [["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"]], "AuthorData": {"57201589027": {"Name": "Sii S.", "AuthorID": "57201589027", "AffiliationID": "60030456", "AffiliationName": "Belfast Health and Social Care Trust"}, "7007041047": {"Name": "Barton K.", "AuthorID": "7007041047", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "7003824401": {"Name": "Pasquale L.R.", "AuthorID": "7003824401", "AffiliationID": "60002746", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, Harvard Medical School"}, "55619315580": {"Name": "Yamamoto T.", "AuthorID": "55619315580", "AffiliationID": "60171746", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, Gifu University Graduate School of Medicine"}, "8117351100": {"Name": "King A.J.", "AuthorID": "8117351100", "AffiliationID": "60025016", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, Nottingham University Hospital"}, "7006394568": {"Name": "Azuara-Blanco A.", "AuthorID": "7006394568", "AffiliationID": "60029738", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Public Health, Queen's University Belfast"}}}
