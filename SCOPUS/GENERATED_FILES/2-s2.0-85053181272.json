By assuming the availability of only time-independent single and two-qubit interactions, we introduce and describe a supervised learning strategy implemented through momentum-stochastic gradient descent with automatic differentiation methods. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the scheme by discussing the implementation of nontrivial three qubit operations, including a QFT and a half-adder gate.", "AuthorKeywords": ["quantum-computation", "quantum-gates", "Quantum-information"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85053181272", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (miscellaneous)", "PHYS", "3101"]], "AuthorData": {"55668289300": {"Name": "Innocenti L.", "AuthorID": "55668289300", "AffiliationID": "60029738", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Theoretical Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics, School of Mathematics and Physics, Queen's University Belfast"}, "7005220927": {"Name": "Ferraro A.", "AuthorID": "7005220927", "AffiliationID": "60029738", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Theoretical Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics, School of Mathematics and Physics, Queen's University Belfast"}, "8550716400": {"Name": "Paternostro M.", "AuthorID": "8550716400", "AffiliationID": "60029738", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Theoretical Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics, School of Mathematics and Physics, Queen's University Belfast"}, "8910867800": {"Name": "Banchi L.", "AuthorID": "8910867800", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "QOLS, Blackett Laboratory"}, "7401626610": {"Name": "Bose S.", "AuthorID": "7401626610", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}}}
