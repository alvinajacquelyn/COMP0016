The plan was quickly rejected as impracticable and Wren\u2019s creative energy went into the design of St Paul\u2019s Cathedral and more than fifty parish churches. But his scheme was memorialized by his son and grandson as a scandal of lost opportunity, a noble vision \u2018unhappily defeated by faction\u2019. Widely reproduced by print-makers, it gained iconic status, influencing street improvement in eighteenth-century London, nineteenth-century public health reform, late-Victorian advocacy of municipal autonomy, and twentieth-century planning controversies including the Paternoster Square redevelopments of 1955 and 2000. The paper shows how archival research disproving the received narrative of Wren\u2019s plan opened the way for different understandings both of the planning legacy of reconstruction after the Great Fire, and of his own accomplishments as a Renaissance architect working within a mediaeval street plan.", "AuthorKeywords": ["baroque urbanism", "Great Fire", "London", "post-disaster reconstruction", "Sir Christopher Wren", "urban morphology"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85058231127", "SubjectAreas": [["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"]], "AuthorData": {"6602831353": {"Name": "Hebbert M.", "AuthorID": "6602831353", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Bartlett School of Planning, University College London"}}}
