The brown tumor is an unusual presentation of fibrous osteitis that represents a serious complication of renal osteodystrophy, affecting predominantly the hands, feet, skull, and facial bones. Case report: The aim of this paper is to describe the case of a 53-year-old female patient, with renal failure who has been on dialysis for 6 years and developed severe secondary hyperparathyroidism and brown tumor of the maxilla and mandible, confirmed by incisional biopsy. Parathyroidectomy was indicated as a result of rapid growth of the tumor and the maintenance of laboratory findings. Despite the normalization of serum parathyroid hormone and alkaline phosphatase, tumor regression was slow and patient\u2019s important functional and esthetic deficits persisted. Excision of the mandible tumor was conservative. Osteoplasty was recommended because during a 5-year follow-up there was regression of the lesion, decreased pain, bleeding, and tooth mobility.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bone diseases", "Osteitis fibrosa cystica", "Parathyroidectomy", "Renal osteodystrophy", "Secondary hyperparathyroidism"], "IndexKeywords": ["Chronic Kidney Disease-Mineral and Bone Disorder", "Facial Asymmetry", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Humans", "Hyperparathyroidism, Secondary", "Kidney Failure, Chronic", "Mandibular Diseases", "Maxillary Diseases", "Middle Aged", "Osteitis Fibrosa Cystica", "Parathyroidectomy", "Tomography, X-Ray Computed"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84988405313", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Oral Surgery", "DENT", "3504"], ["Otorhinolaryngology", "MEDI", "2733"]], "AuthorData": {"40262305700": {"Name": "Queiroz I.", "AuthorID": "40262305700", "AffiliationID": "60013710", "AffiliationName": "Federal University of Bahia"}, "57191260909": {"Name": "Queiroz S.", "AuthorID": "57191260909", "AffiliationID": "60013710", "AffiliationName": "Federal University of Bahia"}, "57191259356": {"Name": "Ribeiro R.", "AuthorID": "57191259356", "AffiliationID": "60013710", "AffiliationName": "Federal University of Bahia"}, "6508280536": {"Name": "Cruso\u00e9-Rebello I.", "AuthorID": "6508280536", "AffiliationID": "60013710", "AffiliationName": "Federal University of Bahia"}, "46561287700": {"Name": "Medeiros R.", "AuthorID": "46561287700", "AffiliationID": "60021980", "AffiliationName": "Federal University of Pernambuco"}, "7003789865": {"Name": "Le\u00e3o J.", "AuthorID": "7003789865", "AffiliationID": "60021980", "AffiliationName": "Federal University of Pernambuco"}}}
