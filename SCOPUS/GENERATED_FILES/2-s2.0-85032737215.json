We hypothesized that adolescents with high levels of albumin excretion might benefit from angiotensin-converting\u2013enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and statins, drugs that have not been fully evaluated in adolescents. METHODS: We screened 4407 adolescents with type 1 diabetes between the ages of 10 and 16 years of age and identified 1287 with values in the upper third of the albumin-to-creatinine ratios; 443 were randomly assigned in a placebo-controlled trial of an ACE inhibitor and a statin with the use of a 2-by-2 factorial design minimizing differences in baseline characteristics such as age, sex, and duration of diabetes. The primary outcome for both interventions was the change in albumin excretion, assessed according to the albumin-to-creatinine ratio calculated from three early-morning urine samples obtained every 6 months over 2 to 4 years, and expressed as the area under the curve. Key secondary outcomes included the development of microalbuminuria, progression of retinopathy, changes in the glomerular filtration rate, lipid levels, and measures of cardiovascular risk (carotid intima\u2013media thickness and levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and asymmetric dimethylarginine). RESULTS: The primary outcome was not affected by ACE inhibitor therapy, statin therapy, or the combination of the two. The use of an ACE inhibitor was associated with a lower incidence of microalbuminuria than the use of placebo; in the context of negative findings for the primary outcome and statistical analysis plan, this lower incidence was not considered significant (hazard ratio, 0.57; 95% confidence interval, 0.35 to 0.94). Statin use resulted in significant reductions in total, low-density lipoprotein, and non\u2013high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, in triglyceride levels, and in the ratio of apolipoprotein B to apolipoprotein A1, whereas neither drug had significant effects on carotid intima\u2013media thickness, other cardiovascular markers, the glomerular filtration rate, or progression of retinopathy. Overall adherence to the drug regimen was 75%, and serious adverse events were similar across the groups. CONCLUSIONS: The use of an ACE inhibitor and a statin did not change the albumin-to-creatinine ratio over time.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Albuminuria", "Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors", "Area Under Curve", "Child", "Creatinine", "Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1", "Double-Blind Method", "Drug Therapy, Combination", "Female", "Humans", "Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors", "Lipids", "Male", "Medication Adherence"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85032737215", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"9243301200": {"Name": "Marcovecchio M.L.", "AuthorID": "9243301200", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatrics, University of Cambridge"}, "56908198700": {"Name": "Dunger D.B.", "AuthorID": "56908198700", "AffiliationID": "60031101, 60015879, 60120909, 60022106", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Trust, Medical Research Council Institute of Metabolic Science, University of Cambridge"}, "7101790365": {"Name": "Bond S.", "AuthorID": "7101790365", "AffiliationID": "60017488, 60016390", "AffiliationName": "Cambridge Clinical Trials Unit, Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Addenbrooke\u2019s Hospital"}, "57203217732": {"Name": "Dawson S.", "AuthorID": "57203217732", "AffiliationID": "60017488, 60016390", "AffiliationName": "Cambridge Clinical Trials Unit, Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Addenbrooke\u2019s Hospital"}, "56190407900": {"Name": "Chiesa S.T.", "AuthorID": "56190407900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "National Centre for Cardiovascular Prevention and Outcomes, University College London"}, "7004333788": {"Name": "Deanfield J.", "AuthorID": "7004333788", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "National Centre for Cardiovascular Prevention and Outcomes, University College London"}, "57207516991": {"Name": "Dalton R.N.", "AuthorID": "57207516991", "AffiliationID": "60004111, 60107269", "AffiliationName": "WellChild Laboratory, Evelina London Children\u2019s Hospital, St. Thomas\u2019 Hospital"}, "7401823584": {"Name": "Marshall S.M.", "AuthorID": "7401823584", "AffiliationID": "60026712, 60006222", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cellular Medicine (Diabetes), Faculty of Clinical Medical Sciences, Newcastle University"}, "7004935222": {"Name": "Neil H.A.W.", "AuthorID": "7004935222", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Oxford Centre for Diabetes, Endocrinology and Metabolism, University of Oxford"}, "16136328200": {"Name": "Daneman D.", "AuthorID": "16136328200", "AffiliationID": "60030319, 60016849", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatrics, Hospital for Sick Children, University of Toronto"}, "13807128900": {"Name": "Mahmud F.H.", "AuthorID": "13807128900", "AffiliationID": "60030319, 60016849", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatrics, Hospital for Sick Children, University of Toronto"}, "7003470857": {"Name": "Donaghue K.C.", "AuthorID": "7003470857", "AffiliationID": "60025709, 60026571", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Endocrinology and Diabetes, Children\u2019s Hospital at Westmead, University of Sydney"}, "35315843900": {"Name": "Jones T.W.", "AuthorID": "35315843900", "AffiliationID": "60000096, 60031806", "AffiliationName": "Telethon Kids Institute, University of Western Australia"}, "null": {"Name": null, "AuthorID": null, "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
