All display changes that can be assigned to their E242 (bovine numbering) equivalent and to weakly H-bonded water molecules. The additional redox-sensitive band reported at 1736 cm \u22121 in bovine CcO and previously assigned to D51 is absent from yeast CcO and couldn't be restored by introduction of a D residue at the equivalent position of the yeast protein. Redox spectra of yeast CcO also show much smaller changes in the amide I region, which may relate to structural differences in the region around D51 and the subunit I/II interface.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Carboxyl groups", "Cytochrome c oxidase", "Infrared spectroscopy", "Mitochondria", "Oxidoreduction", "Site-directed mutagenesis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Carbon Monoxide", "Catalytic Domain", "Cattle", "Electron Transport Complex IV", "Kinetics", "Light", "Mutation", "Oxidation-Reduction", "Photolysis", "Protein Conformation", "Saccharomyces cerevisiae", "Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins", "Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85048217203", "SubjectAreas": [["Biophysics", "BIOC", "1304"], ["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"57197458979": {"Name": "Mar\u00e9chal A.", "AuthorID": "57197458979", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London"}, "56711685200": {"Name": "Hartley A.M.", "AuthorID": "56711685200", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biological Sciences, Birkbeck, University of London"}, "16040824600": {"Name": "Warelow T.P.", "AuthorID": "16040824600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London"}, "7102577604": {"Name": "Rich P.R.", "AuthorID": "7102577604", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London"}, "57191155754": {"Name": "Meunier B.", "AuthorID": "57191155754", "AffiliationID": "60106129, 60106017, 60008134, 60007816", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Integrative Biology of the Cell (I2BC), CEA, CNRS, Universit\u00e9 Paris-Sud, Universit\u00e9 Paris-Saclay"}}}
