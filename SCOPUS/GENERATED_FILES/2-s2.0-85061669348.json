One work package of the I-CAN-CARE research programme investigates this in UK palliative care. Aims: To investigate current practices when using sedative medication at the end of life in London, UK, by (1) qualitatively exploring the understandings of palliative care clinicians, (2) examining documented sedative use in patient records and (3) comparing findings from both investigations. Design: We conducted focus groups with experienced palliative care physicians and nurses, and simultaneously reviewed deceased patient records. Setting/participants: In total, 10 physicians and 17 senior nurses in London hospice or hospital/community palliative care took part in eight focus groups. Simultaneously, 50 patient records for people who received continuous sedation at end of life in the hospice and hospital were retrieved and reviewed. Results: Focus group participants all said that they used sedative medication chiefly for managing agitation or distress; selecting drugs and dosages as appropriate for patients\u2019 individual needs; and aiming to use the lowest possible dosages for patients to be \u2018comfortable\u2019, \u2018calm\u2019 or \u2018relaxed\u2019. None used structured observational tools to assess sedative effects, strongly preferring clinical observation and judgement. The patient records\u2019 review corroborated these qualitative findings, with the median continuous dose of midazolam administered being 10 mg/24 h (range: 0.4\u201369.5 mg/24 h). Conclusion: Clinical practice in these London settings broadly aligns with the European Association for Palliative Care framework for using sedation at the end of life, but lacks any objective monitoring of depth of sedation. Our follow-on study explores the utility and feasibility of objectively monitoring sedation in practice.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Focus groups", "hypnotics and sedatives", "medical records", "midazolam", "nurses", "palliative care", "patient comfort", "physicians"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Attitude of Health Personnel", "Decision Making", "Female", "Focus Groups", "Health Personnel", "Hospice and Palliative Care Nursing", "Humans", "Hypnotics and Sedatives", "London", "Longitudinal Studies", "Male", "Midazolam", "Middle Aged", "Palliative Care", "Terminal Care"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85061669348", "SubjectAreas": [["Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine", "MEDI", "2703"]], "AuthorData": {"15043369800": {"Name": "Vivat B.", "AuthorID": "15043369800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Marie Curie Palliative Care Research Department, UCL"}, "57206276058": {"Name": "Bemand-Qureshi L.", "AuthorID": "57206276058", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Marie Curie Palliative Care Research Department, UCL"}, "55703138200": {"Name": "Harrington J.", "AuthorID": "55703138200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Marie Curie Palliative Care Research Department, UCL"}, "57211183430": {"Name": "Davis S.", "AuthorID": "57211183430", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Marie Curie Palliative Care Research Department, UCL"}, "55837129400": {"Name": "Stone P.", "AuthorID": "55837129400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Marie Curie Palliative Care Research Department, UCL"}}}
