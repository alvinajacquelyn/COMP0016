These flexible and soft robotic systems allow bending around organs, navigating through complex anatomical pathways inside the human body and interacting inherently safe with its soft environment. Shape sensing in such systems is a challenge and one essential requirement for precise position feedback control of soft robots. This paper builds on our previous work integrating multiple optical fibres into a soft manipulator to estimate the robot's pose using light intensity modulation. Here, we present an enhanced version of our embedded bending/shape sensor based on electro-conductive yarn. The new system is miniaturised and able to measure bending behaviour as well as elongation. The integrated yarn material is helically wrapped around an elastic strap and protected inside a 1.5mm outer-diameter stretchable pipe. Three of these resulting stretch sensors are integrated in the periphery of a pneumatically actuated soft manipulator for direct measurement of the actuation chamber lengths. The capability of the sensing system in measuring the bending curvature and elongation of the arm is evaluated.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Equipment Design", "Feedback", "Laparoscopy", "Minimally Invasive Surgical Procedures", "Robotics"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84953225826", "SubjectAreas": [["Signal Processing", "COMP", "1711"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"], ["Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition", "COMP", "1707"], ["Health Informatics", "MEDI", "2718"]], "AuthorData": {"35119695800": {"Name": "Wurdemann H.A.", "AuthorID": "35119695800", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Robotics Research, Department of Informatics, King's College London"}, "55533013500": {"Name": "Sareh S.", "AuthorID": "55533013500", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Robotics Research, Department of Informatics, King's College London"}, "56183259000": {"Name": "Shafti A.", "AuthorID": "56183259000", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Robotics Research, Department of Informatics, King's College London"}, "56637802700": {"Name": "Noh Y.", "AuthorID": "56637802700", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Robotics Research, Department of Informatics, King's College London"}, "55921235900": {"Name": "Faragasso A.", "AuthorID": "55921235900", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Robotics Research, Department of Informatics, King's College London"}, "55719408400": {"Name": "Liu H.", "AuthorID": "55719408400", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Robotics Research, Department of Informatics, King's College London"}, "6701489118": {"Name": "Althoefer K.", "AuthorID": "6701489118", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Robotics Research, Department of Informatics, King's College London"}, "55849308300": {"Name": "Chathuranga D.S.", "AuthorID": "55849308300", "AffiliationID": "60105159", "AffiliationName": "Department of Robotics, Ritsumeikan University"}, "35562104800": {"Name": "Hirai S.", "AuthorID": "35562104800", "AffiliationID": "60105159", "AffiliationName": "Department of Robotics, Ritsumeikan University"}}}
