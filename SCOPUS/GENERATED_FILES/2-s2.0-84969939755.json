More specifically, this is performed in terms of the high-order statistics (HOS) of the channel capacity over \u03b7-\u03bc fading channels. A generic analytic expression is derived for the corresponding nth statistical moment, which is subsequently employed for deducing exact closed-form expressions for the first four moments. Using these expressions, important statistical metrics, such as the amount of dispersion, amount of fading, skewness, and kurtosis, are derived in closed form and can be efficiently used in providing insights on the performance of dispersed CR systems. The obtained numerical results reveal interesting outcomes that could be useful for the channel selection, either for sharing or aggregation in heterogeneous networks, which is the core structure of future wireless communication systems.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Amount of dispersion", "channel capacity", "cognitive radio (CR)", "dispersed spectrum", "high-order statistics (HOS)"], "IndexKeywords": ["Analytic expressions", "Closed-form expression", "dispersed spectrum", "Generalized fading channels", "High order statistics", "Numerical results", "Statistical moments", "Wireless communication system"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84969939755", "SubjectAreas": [["Automotive Engineering", "ENGI", "2203"], ["Aerospace Engineering", "ENGI", "2202"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"35613331800": {"Name": "Tsiftsis T.A.", "AuthorID": "35613331800", "AffiliationID": "100514889", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical Engineering, Technological Educational Institute of Central Greece"}, "55952568500": {"Name": "Foukalas F.", "AuthorID": "55952568500", "AffiliationID": "60072749", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical Engineering, Qatar University"}, "8334317300": {"Name": "Khattab T.", "AuthorID": "8334317300", "AffiliationID": "60072749", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical Engineering, Qatar University"}, "7004027126": {"Name": "Karagiannidis G.K.", "AuthorID": "7004027126", "AffiliationID": "60015331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki"}}}
