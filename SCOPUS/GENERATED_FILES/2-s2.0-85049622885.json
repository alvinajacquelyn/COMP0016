However, the nature of these relationships and how they change across the parents\u2019 bereavement journey is currently unknown. This article explores early and ongoing relationships between parents and health care staff when a child dies in intensive care. Constructivist grounded theory methods were used to recruit 26 bereaved parents from four Australian pediatric intensive care units into the study. Data were collected via audio-recorded, semistructured interviews and analyzed using the constant comparative methods and theoretical memoing. Findings show that these relationships focus on Gradually disengaging, commonly moving through three phases after the child dies: Saying goodbye, Going home, and Seeking supports. These findings provide guidance to health care staff on what families need as they leave the intensive care unit and move through bereavement.", "AuthorKeywords": ["death", "grounded theory", "parent\u2013health care provider relationship", "pediatric intensive care"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Australia", "Bereavement", "Child", "Child Mortality", "Child, Preschool", "Female", "Grief", "Health Personnel", "Humans", "Infant", "Infant, Newborn", "Intensive Care Units, Pediatric", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Nurses, Pediatric", "Parents", "Professional-Family Relations"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85049622885", "SubjectAreas": [["Community and Home Care", "NURS", "2905"], ["Family Practice", "MEDI", "2714"]], "AuthorData": {"56274310900": {"Name": "Butler A.E.", "AuthorID": "56274310900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Louis Dundas Centre for Children\u2019s Palliative Care, University College London Institute for Child Health"}, "36240708500": {"Name": "Hall H.", "AuthorID": "36240708500", "AffiliationID": "60019578", "AffiliationName": "Monash University"}, "6603356377": {"Name": "Copnell B.", "AuthorID": "6603356377", "AffiliationID": "60006925", "AffiliationName": "La Trobe University"}}}
