Drawing on quantitative and qualitative data, we explore some factors that lead young people to disengage from\u2013and potentially re-engage with\u2013schooling. The research employed a sequential design with a quantitative survey of students, followed by two rounds of interviews with a sub-sample of young people. Statistical analysis of our survey confirmed that, for our respondents, school engagement is mediated through perceptions of support. Through longitudinal qualitative data, we consider which sources of support appear to be most important for participants, how changes in perceptions of support affect levels of engagement and how these may change over time. We aim to contribute to the literature by showing that increasing perceptions of support can positively influence school engagement. Drawing on theories of social capital, we illustrate how complex and dynamic interplays between diffuse actors can provide access to differentiated resources, including economic, social and cultural capital, with varied outcomes for school engagement. We also show how fluid and dynamic processes of engagement and the interplay with support can provide opportunities for promoting positive educational outcomes.", "AuthorKeywords": ["mixed methods", "perceived support", "School engagement", "social capital", "youth transitions"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85060609396", "SubjectAreas": [["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"], ["Social Sciences (all)", "SOCI", "3300"], ["Life-span and Life-course Studies", "SOCI", "3319"]], "AuthorData": {"7201612172": {"Name": "Ryan L.", "AuthorID": "7201612172", "AffiliationID": "60001881", "AffiliationName": "Department of Sociological Studies, University of Sheffield"}, "57202229057": {"Name": "Lorinc M.", "AuthorID": "57202229057", "AffiliationID": "60001881", "AffiliationName": "Department of Sociological Studies, University of Sheffield"}, "57202236648": {"Name": "D\u2019Angelo A.", "AuthorID": "57202236648", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "University of Nottingham"}, "57202234989": {"Name": "Kaye N.", "AuthorID": "57202234989", "AffiliationID": "60014105", "AffiliationName": "Middlesex University"}}}
