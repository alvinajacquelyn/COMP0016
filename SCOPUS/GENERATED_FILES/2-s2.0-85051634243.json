The problem involves decisions concerning the optimal spatial arrangement of process plant equipment and/or auxiliary units considering equipment connectivity, pumping and construction costs, and other factors. These considerations are extended to account for tall equipment items that span across floors and the availability of predefined production sections. The proposed models determine simultaneously the number of floors per section, floor areas per section, plot layout and site layout, and are applied to two case studies with up to 22 units and 6 production sections to demonstrate their applicability.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Mixed integer linear programming (MILP)", "Multi-floor process plant layout", "Optimisation", "Production sections"], "IndexKeywords": ["Case-studies", "Construction costs", "Layout problems", "Mixed integer linear programming model", "Mixed-integer linear programming", "Optimisations", "Process plants", "Spatial arrangements"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85051634243", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"]], "AuthorData": {"57202766424": {"Name": "Ejeh J.O.", "AuthorID": "57202766424", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Process Systems Engineering, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "7003608896": {"Name": "Papageorgiou L.G.", "AuthorID": "7003608896", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Process Systems Engineering, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "25628253900": {"Name": "Liu S.", "AuthorID": "25628253900", "AffiliationID": "60170469", "AffiliationName": "School of Management, Swansea University, Bay Campus, Fabian Way"}}}
