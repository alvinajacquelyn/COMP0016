Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.An accelerometer utilising the optomechanical coupling between an optical whispering gallery mode (WGM) resonance and the motion of the WGM cavity itself was prototyped and field-tested on a vehicle. We describe the assembly of this portable, battery operated sensor and the field-programmable gate array automation. Pre-trial testing using an electrodynamic shaker demonstrated linear scale-factors with <0.3% standard deviation (\u00b16 g range where g = 9.81 ms\u22122), and a strong normalised cross-correlation coefficient (NCCC) of rICP/WGM = 0.997 when compared with an integrated circuit piezoelectric (ICP) accelerometer. A noise density of 40 \u00b5g Hz\u22121/2 was obtained for frequencies of 2\u20137 kHz, increasing to 130 \u00b5g Hz\u22121/2 at 200 Hz, and 250 \u00b5g Hz\u22121/2 at 100 Hz. A reduction in the cross-correlation was found during the trial, rICP/WGM = 0.36, which we attribute to thermal fluctuations, mounting differences, and the noisy vehicle environment. The deployment of this hand-fabricated sensor, shown to operate and survive during \u00b160 g shocks, demonstrates important steps towards the development of a chip-scale device.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Accelerometer", "Cavity", "Field trial", "Optical sensing", "Optical sensors", "Optomechanics", "Prototype", "Resonator", "Whispering gallery mode"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cavity", "Cross-correlation coefficient", "Electrodynamic shakers", "Field trial", "Integrated circuit piezoelectric", "Optical sensing", "Prototype", "Thermal fluctuations"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85058122150", "SubjectAreas": [["Analytical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1602"], ["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"], ["Instrumentation", "PHYS", "3105"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"56737280500": {"Name": "Li Y.", "AuthorID": "56737280500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics & Astronomy, University College London"}, "57203084776": {"Name": "Barker P.", "AuthorID": "57203084776", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics & Astronomy, University College London"}}}
