The main aim of this study was to quantify the agreement in measurements of cup version of large-diameter MoM hips obtained by EBRA and by 3D computed tomography (3D-CT). The secondary aim was to quantify the agreement for cup inclination. Lastly, we wanted to determine the inter- and intra-observer reliability of both methods.Patients and methods-87 MoM hips in 81 patients were analyzed for cup inclination and version in 2D on conventional radiographs using EBRA software. The results were compared with 3D measurements using CT.Results-Cup version was underestimated by EBRA when compared to 3D-CT, by 6\u00b0 on average with the pelvis supine and by 8\u00b0 on average with the pelvis orientated to the anterior pelvic plane (APP). For inclination, the mean difference was no more than 1\u00b0. 53% of hips were within a 10\u00b0 safe zone of 45\u00b0 inclination and 20\u00b0 version when measured by 3D-CT with the pelvis supine (and 54% with the pelvis in the APP). The proportion was only 24% when measured by EBRA. Inter- and intra-observer reliability of cup version is poorer using 2D analysis than when using 3D-CT.Interpretation-Errors in version in 2D were due to the difficulty in delineating the cup rim, which was obscured by a large-diameter metal head of the same radio-opacity. This can be overcome with 3D analysis. The present study demonstrates that measurements using EBRA have poor agreement and are less reliable than those with 3D-CT when measuring cup version and inclination in MoM hips.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Acetabulum", "Adult", "Aged", "Arthrography", "Arthroplasty, Replacement, Hip", "Bone Malalignment", "Femur", "Hip Joint", "Hip Prosthesis", "Humans", "Imaging, Three-Dimensional", "Male", "Metals", "Middle Aged", "Observer Variation", "Reproducibility of Results", "Retrospective Studies", "Tomography, X-Ray Computed"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84937926868", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Orthopedics and Sports Medicine", "MEDI", "2732"]], "AuthorData": {"27967530200": {"Name": "Davda K.", "AuthorID": "27967530200", "AffiliationID": "60012558, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "Imperial College, Charing Cross Hospital"}, "7202728836": {"Name": "Cobb J.P.", "AuthorID": "7202728836", "AffiliationID": "60012558, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "Imperial College, Charing Cross Hospital"}, "55091372400": {"Name": "Smyth N.", "AuthorID": "55091372400", "AffiliationID": "106543182", "AffiliationName": "Hospital for Special Services"}, "24597673100": {"Name": "Hart A.J.", "AuthorID": "24597673100", "AffiliationID": "60024067", "AffiliationName": "Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital"}}}
