All rights reserved.Purpose of reviewSummarize the literature on the social skills and relationships of women with Turner syndrome and examine the biological and psychological factors that may contribute to social interaction difficulties.Recent findingsTurner syndrome is often associated with impaired social-cognitive processing and executive function deficits. These cognitive abnormalities, together with a range of physical differences, may adversely affect social communication skills, which typically begin to impair quality of life during early adolescence. Parental accounts of their daughter's social skills frequently highlight interaction problems, both in the home and beyond; in contrast, self-reports are usually far more positive. At present, we do not know the extent to which such self-reports reflect a lack of social awareness, or a lack of concern about social difficulties.SummaryWomen with Turner syndrome are likely to experience social interaction challenges (especially in friendships and relationships) across the lifespan. Providing appropriate guidance and support to them demands a better understanding of their strengths and weaknesses.", "AuthorKeywords": ["relationships", "sex chromosome aneuploidy", "social cognition", "social skills", "Turner syndrome"], "IndexKeywords": ["Executive Function", "Female", "Humans", "Interpersonal Relations", "Quality of Life", "Social Skills", "Social Support", "Turner Syndrome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85060642297", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"57191861000": {"Name": "Wolstencroft J.", "AuthorID": "57191861000", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL GOS Institute of Child Health"}, "7004857206": {"Name": "Skuse D.", "AuthorID": "7004857206", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL GOS Institute of Child Health"}}}
