Early proof of concept for efficacy of T cells in paediatric cancer was seen in the \u201cgraft-versus-leukaemia\u201d effects following allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. Subsequently, the approach has been trialled in solid tumours following genetic modification of T-cells to retarget them against cancer. Optimised T-cell products can be derived from tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes, or bulk populations of T-cells can be engineered by gene therapy techniques to express tumour antigen-specific recognition receptors that redirect T cell to tumour. Engineered T-cell stimulating receptors lead to activation in the presence of the tumour with subsequent inflammatory response and amplification of the T cell clones. Following clinical success of chimeric antigen receptors modified T cells in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, T cell immunotherapeutics are now a preclinical growth area in the field of childhood cancer immunotherapeutics.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Adoptive transfer", "Chimeric antigen receptor", "Immunotherapy", "T-cell", "TCR-transfer"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85042607847", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"], ["Immunology and Microbiology (all)", "IMMU", "2400"]], "AuthorData": {"56108105900": {"Name": "Fisher J.", "AuthorID": "56108105900", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Section, GOSH/UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "55731054400": {"Name": "Anderson J.", "AuthorID": "55731054400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Oncology, Great Ormond Street Hospital and Institute of Child Health, University College London"}}}
