There is some knowledge about which clock neuronal groups are important for temperature synchronization, but we currently lack knowledge on the temperature receptors and their signaling pathways that feed temperature information to the (neuronal) clock. Since TRPA1 is a well-known thermosensor that functions in a range of temperature-related behaviors, and it is potentially expressed in clock neurons, we set out to test the putative role of TRPA1 in temperature synchronization of the circadian clock. We found that flies lacking TRPA1 are still able to synchronize their behavioral activity to TCs comparable to wild-type flies, both in 16\u00b0C: 25\u00b0C and 20\u00b0C: 29\u00b0C TCs. In addition, we found that flies lacking TRPA1 show higher activity levels during the middle of the warm phase of 20\u00b0C: 29\u00b0C TCs, and we show that this TRPA1-mediated repression of locomotor activity during the \"siesta\" is caused by a lack of sleep. Based on these data, we conclude that the TRPA1 channel is not required for temperature synchronization in this broad temperature range but instead is required to repress activity during the warm part of the day.", "AuthorKeywords": ["circadian clocks", "Drosophila melanogaster", "sleep", "temperature entrainment", "thermo TRP channels", "TRPA1"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Circadian Clocks", "Circadian Rhythm", "Cues", "Drosophila melanogaster", "Drosophila Proteins", "Motor Activity", "Mutation", "Neurons", "Sleep", "Temperature", "Transcription Factors", "TRPC Cation Channels"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84947289412", "SubjectAreas": [["Physiology", "BIOC", "1314"], ["Physiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2737"]], "AuthorData": {"56964487500": {"Name": "Roessingh S.", "AuthorID": "56964487500", "AffiliationID": "60105356, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "School of Biological and Chemical Sciences, Queen Mary College"}, "6701778379": {"Name": "Stanewsky R.", "AuthorID": "6701778379", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University College London"}, "55815730900": {"Name": "Wolfgang W.", "AuthorID": "55815730900", "AffiliationID": "60105356, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "School of Biological and Chemical Sciences, Queen Mary College"}}}
