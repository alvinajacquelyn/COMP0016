Cancer patients can present with a variety of cardiovascular problems not all of which are directly related to cancer therapy (medications or radiotherapy). The cardiovascular problems of oncology patients can range from ischaemia to arrhythmias and can also include valve problems and heart failure. As such, within cardiology, teamwork is required with members of different cardiology subspecialties. The way forward will be to adopt a multidisciplinary approach to produce optimal individual care. Close collaboration between cardiology and oncology specialists in a Cardio-Oncology setting can make this happen.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cardio-Oncology", "Cardio-Oncology Imaging", "Cardio-toxicity"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cardiology", "Cardiovascular Diseases", "Disease Management", "Humans", "Interdisciplinary Communication", "Medical Oncology", "Neoplasms"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85019654344", "SubjectAreas": [["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"47161200500": {"Name": "Ghosh A.K.", "AuthorID": "47161200500", "AffiliationID": "60004093, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "Barts Heart Centre, St Bartholomew's Hospital and Hatter Cardiovascular Institute, University College London Hospital"}, "56611084900": {"Name": "Walker J.M.", "AuthorID": "56611084900", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Hatter Cardiovascular Institute, University College London Hospital"}}}
