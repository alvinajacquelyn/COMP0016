We compare the quality of the distributional semantic NLP models against phrase-based semantic IR. The evaluation is based on the correlation between human judgements and model scores on a distributional phrase similarity task. We experiment with four NLP and two IR model variants. On the NLP side, models vary over normalization schemes and composition operators. On the IR side, models vary with respect to estimation of the probability of a term being in a document, namely P(t|d) where only term co-occurrence information is used and P(t|d, sim) which incorporates term distributional similarity. A mixture of the two methods is presented and evaluated. For both methods, word meanings are derived from large corpora of data: the BNC and uk WaC. One of the main findings is that grammatical distributional models give better scores than the IR models. This suggests that an IR model enriched with distributional linguistic information performs better in the long standing problem in IR of document retrieval where there is no direct symbolic relationship between query and document concepts.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Distributional semantics", "NLP", "Semantic IR", "Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) phrases"], "IndexKeywords": ["Composition operators", "Distributional models", "Distributional semantics", "Distributional similarities", "Linguistic information", "NAtural language processing", "Semantic similarity", "Subject verb objects (SVO)"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84964330365", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Science (miscellaneous)", "COMP", "1701"], ["Information Systems", "COMP", "1710"]], "AuthorData": {"56016647200": {"Name": "Milajevs D.", "AuthorID": "56016647200", "AffiliationID": "60022109", "AffiliationName": "School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science, Queen Mary University of London"}, "24339612000": {"Name": "Sadrzadeh M.", "AuthorID": "24339612000", "AffiliationID": "60022109", "AffiliationName": "School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science, Queen Mary University of London"}, "55885031800": {"Name": "Roelleke T.", "AuthorID": "55885031800", "AffiliationID": "60022109", "AffiliationName": "School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science, Queen Mary University of London"}}}
