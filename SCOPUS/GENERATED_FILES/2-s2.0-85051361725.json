Karger AG, Basel.Background: Medulloepithelioma is a rare congenital neoplasm derived from precursors of the nonpigmented ciliary epithelium of the ciliary body. The average patient age at clinical presentation is 3.8 years. Case Presentation: We present the case of a 78-year-old male with progressive lens subluxation and ocular hypertension who was found to have a ciliary body mass. After enucleation for presumed ciliary body melanoma, histopathology showed a nonteratoid medulloepithelioma. Cytogenetic analysis revealed abnormalities in chromosomes 3 and 8. Conclusion: Medulloepithelioma is often initially misdiagnosed. Though congenital in nature, it can exhibit rapid growth, have chromosomal abnormalities, and must be considered in all age groups.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Genetics", "Intraocular medulloepithelioma", "Tumor"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85051361725", "SubjectAreas": [["Nursing (all)", "NURS", "2900"]], "AuthorData": {"55646772400": {"Name": "Burris C.K.H.", "AuthorID": "55646772400", "AffiliationID": "60032179", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, University of Wisconsin-Madison"}, "36841094900": {"Name": "Papastefanou V.P.", "AuthorID": "36841094900", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ocular Oncology, Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "55759644400": {"Name": "Hay G.", "AuthorID": "55759644400", "AffiliationID": "60004093", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ocular Oncology, St. Bartholomew's Hospital"}, "54790539900": {"Name": "Cohen V.M.L.", "AuthorID": "54790539900", "AffiliationID": "60016691, 60004093", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, St. Bartholomew's Hospital, Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "6602525615": {"Name": "Thaung C.", "AuthorID": "6602525615", "AffiliationID": "60013148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Eye Pathology, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "56306343400": {"Name": "Grantham M.", "AuthorID": "56306343400", "AffiliationID": "60010088", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Medicine, Royal London Hospital"}}}
