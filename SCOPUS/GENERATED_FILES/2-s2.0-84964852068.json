Calexcitin possesses four EF-hand motifs, but only the first three (EF-1 to EF-3) are involved in binding metal ions. Past work has indicated that under physiological conditions EF-1 and EF-2 bind Mg2+ and Ca2+, while EF-3 is likely to bind only Ca2+. The fourth EF-hand is nonfunctional owing to a lack of key metal-binding residues. The aim of this study was to use a crystallographic approach to determine which of the three metal-binding sites of calexcitin is most readily replaced by exogenous metal ions, potentially shedding light on which of the EF-hands play a 'sensory' role in neuronal calcium signalling. By co-crystallizing recombinant calexcitin with equimolar Gd3+ in the presence of trace Ca2+, EF-1 was shown to become fully occupied by Gd3+ ions, while the other two sites remain fully occupied by Ca2+. The structure of the Gd3+-calexcitin complex has been refined to an R factor of 21.5% and an Rfree of 30.4% at 2.2 \u00c5 resolution. These findings suggest that EF-1 of calexcitin is the Ca2+-binding site with the lowest selectivity for Ca2+, and the implications of this finding for calcium sensing in neuronal signalling pathways are discussed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["co-crystallization", "EF-hand", "heavy-atom complex", "Neuronal calcium signalling", "protein structure"], "IndexKeywords": ["Binding Sites", "Calcium", "Calcium-Binding Proteins", "Crystallization", "Crystallography, X-Ray", "Gadolinium", "Neurons", "Signal Transduction"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84964852068", "SubjectAreas": [["Biophysics", "BIOC", "1304"], ["Structural Biology", "BIOC", "1315"], ["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"]], "AuthorData": {"57189049343": {"Name": "Chataigner L.", "AuthorID": "57189049343", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Medicine, UCL"}, "56308857100": {"Name": "Guo J.", "AuthorID": "56308857100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Medicine, UCL"}, "6701413559": {"Name": "Erskine P.T.", "AuthorID": "6701413559", "AffiliationID": "60033387", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biological Sciences, University of London"}, "8442382500": {"Name": "Coker A.R.", "AuthorID": "8442382500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Medicine, UCL"}, "57217261061": {"Name": "Wood S.P.", "AuthorID": "57217261061", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Medicine, UCL"}, "55471740700": {"Name": "Cooper J.B.", "AuthorID": "55471740700", "AffiliationID": "60033387", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biological Sciences, University of London"}, "54970764900": {"Name": "Gombos Z.", "AuthorID": "54970764900", "AffiliationID": "116601230", "AffiliationName": "Marketed Health Products Dirct., Health Products and Food Branch"}}}
