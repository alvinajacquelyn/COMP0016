Design: The model was based on several strands of evidence: a metareview and realist synthesis of quantitative and qualitative evidence on telehealth for chronic conditions; a qualitative study of patients' and health professionals' experience of telehealth; a quantitative survey of patients' interest in using telehealth; and review of existing models of chronic condition management and evidence-based treatment guidelines. Based on these evidence strands, a model was developed and then refined at a stakeholder workshop. Then a telehealth intervention ('Healthlines') was designed by incorporating strategies to address each of the model components. The model also provided a framework for evaluation of this intervention within parallel randomised controlled trials in the two exemplar conditions, and the accompanying process evaluations and economic evaluations. Setting: Primary care. Results: The TElehealth in CHronic Disease (TECH) model proposes that attention to four components will offer interventions the best chance of success: (1) engagement of patients and health professionals, (2) effective chronic disease management (including subcomponents of self-management, optimisation of treatment, care coordination), (3) partnership between providers and (4) patient, social and health system context. Key intended outcomes are improved health, access to care, patient experience and cost-effective care. Conclusions: A conceptual model has been developed based on multiple sources of evidence which articulates how telehealth may best provide benefits for patients with chronic health conditions. It can be used to structure the design and evaluation of telehealth programmes which aim to be acceptable to patients and providers, and cost-effective.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Cardiovascular Diseases", "Chronic Disease", "Concept Formation", "Cost-Benefit Analysis", "Depression", "Depressive Disorder", "Humans", "Models, Theoretical", "Primary Health Care", "Telemedicine"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84922341012", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"20935682000": {"Name": "Salisbury C.", "AuthorID": "20935682000", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "University of Bristol, Centre for Academic Primary Care, School of Social and Community Medicine"}, "56010615900": {"Name": "Thomas C.", "AuthorID": "56010615900", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "University of Bristol, Centre for Academic Primary Care, School of Social and Community Medicine"}, "14028415700": {"Name": "Hollinghurst S.", "AuthorID": "14028415700", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "University of Bristol, Centre for Academic Primary Care, School of Social and Community Medicine"}, "7201757955": {"Name": "Edwards L.", "AuthorID": "7201757955", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "University of Bristol, Centre for Academic Primary Care, School of Social and Community Medicine"}, "7004887052": {"Name": "O'Cathain A.", "AuthorID": "7004887052", "AffiliationID": "60176589, 60001881", "AffiliationName": "University of Sheffield, Medical Care Research Unit, School of Health and Related Research (ScHARR)"}, "6603289208": {"Name": "Brownsell S.", "AuthorID": "6603289208", "AffiliationID": "60176589, 60001881", "AffiliationName": "University of Sheffield, Medical Care Research Unit, School of Health and Related Research (ScHARR)"}, "55339123500": {"Name": "Rogers A.", "AuthorID": "55339123500", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "University of Southampton, School of Health Sciences"}, "7201777281": {"Name": "Pope C.", "AuthorID": "7201777281", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "University of Southampton, School of Health Sciences"}, "7005996141": {"Name": "Yardley L.", "AuthorID": "7005996141", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "University of Southampton, Centre for Applications of Health Psychology"}, "56036384800": {"Name": "Rowsell A.", "AuthorID": "56036384800", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "University of Southampton, Centre for Applications of Health Psychology"}, "7103180589": {"Name": "Fahey T.", "AuthorID": "7103180589", "AffiliationID": "60000050", "AffiliationName": "Department of General Practice, HRB Centre for Primary Care Research, Royal College of Ireland"}, "7402636617": {"Name": "Lewis G.", "AuthorID": "7402636617", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, University College London"}, "24478064000": {"Name": "Large S.", "AuthorID": "24478064000", "AffiliationID": "60103094", "AffiliationName": "NHS Direct"}, "55260410600": {"Name": "Segar J.", "AuthorID": "55260410600", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "University of Manchester, Centre for Primary Care, Institute of Population Health"}, "7101801762": {"Name": "Montgomery A.A.", "AuthorID": "7101801762", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "Nottingham Clinical Trials Unit, University of Nottingham, Nottingham Health Science Partners"}}}
