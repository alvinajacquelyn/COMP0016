We used these tests to assess retinal function in eight young adults and children with earlyonset severe retinal dystrophy from Phase II of a clinical gene-therapy trial for RPE65 deficiency that involved the subretinal delivery of a recombinant adeno-associated viral vector carrying RPE65. We found substantial improvements in rod sensitivity in two participants: dark-adapted spectral sensitivity was rod-like after treatment and was cone-like before rods had recovered after a bleach. After 40 min of dark adaptation, one participant showed up to 1,000-fold sensitivity improvements 4 months after treatment and the second up to 100-fold improvements 6 months after treatment. The dark-adapted spectral sensitivities of the other six participants remained cone-like and showed little improvement in sensitivity.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Flicker sensitivity", "Gene therapy", "Rods and cones", "RPE65", "Scotopic", "Temporal processing"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Child", "cis-trans-Isomerases", "Dark Adaptation", "Dependovirus", "Genetic Therapy", "Genetic Vectors", "Humans", "Leber Congenital Amaurosis", "Light", "Middle Aged", "Photic Stimulation", "Retinal Rod Photoreceptor Cells", "Vision, Ocular", "Visual Acuity", "Visual Fields", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84950297196", "SubjectAreas": [["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"], ["Sensory Systems", "NEUR", "2809"]], "AuthorData": {"19737698100": {"Name": "Ripamonti C.", "AuthorID": "19737698100", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}, "7102449400": {"Name": "Henning G.", "AuthorID": "7102449400", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}, "14420317400": {"Name": "Robbie S.", "AuthorID": "14420317400", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}, "8962224100": {"Name": "Sundaram V.", "AuthorID": "8962224100", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}, "56573251100": {"Name": "Moore A.", "AuthorID": "56573251100", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}, "57203012241": {"Name": "Smith A.", "AuthorID": "57203012241", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}, "7005169657": {"Name": "Bainbridge J.", "AuthorID": "7005169657", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}, "7201812544": {"Name": "Ali R.", "AuthorID": "7201812544", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}, "7006086539": {"Name": "Stockman A.", "AuthorID": "7006086539", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}, "6602839807": {"Name": "van den Born L.", "AuthorID": "6602839807", "AffiliationID": "60070145", "AffiliationName": "Rotterdam Eye Hospital"}, "7003459388": {"Name": "Casteels I.", "AuthorID": "7003459388", "AffiliationID": "60031069", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, University Hospitals Leuven"}, "22134312900": {"Name": "de Ravel T.", "AuthorID": "22134312900", "AffiliationID": "60031069", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Human Genetics, University Hospitals Leuven"}}}
