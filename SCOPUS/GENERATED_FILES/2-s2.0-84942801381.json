TB caused 1.3 million deaths including 320,000 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected people; three-quarters of deaths occurred in Africa and Southeast Asia. With one-third of the world\u2019s population latently infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), active TB disease is primarily associated with a break down in immune surveillance. This explains the strong link between active TB disease and other communicable diseases (CDs) or noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) that exert a toll on the immune system. Comorbid NCD risk factors include diabetes, smoking, malnutrition, and chronic lung disease, all of which have increased relentlessly over the past decade in developing countries. The huge overlap between killer infections such as TB, HIV, malaria, and severe viral infections with NCDs, results in a \u201cdouble burden of disease\u201d in developing countries. The current focus on vertical disease programs fails to recognize comorbidities or to encourage joint management approaches. This review highlights major disease overlaps and discusses the rationale for better integration of tuberculosis care with services for NCDs and other infectious diseases to enhance the overall efficiency of the public health responses.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Communicable Diseases", "Comorbidity", "Diabetes Mellitus", "Helminthiasis", "HIV Infections", "Humans", "Influenza, Human", "Malaria", "Malnutrition", "Risk Factors", "Tuberculosis, Pulmonary"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84942801381", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"20336943700": {"Name": "Bates M.", "AuthorID": "20336943700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Center for Clinical Microbiology, Department of Infection, Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London"}, "6701466274": {"Name": "Marais B.J.", "AuthorID": "6701466274", "AffiliationID": "60121699, 60026571, 60025709", "AffiliationName": "Marie Bashir Institute for Infectious Diseases and Biosecurity (MBI) and The Children\u2019s Hospital at Westmead, Sydney Medical School, University of Sydney"}, "7006170723": {"Name": "Zumla A.", "AuthorID": "7006170723", "AffiliationID": "60024544, 60172638", "AffiliationName": "National Institute of Health Research, Biomedical Research Centre, University College London Hospitals"}}}
