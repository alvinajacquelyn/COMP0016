Both inter- and intrafamilial variable expressivity are commonly observed. We present clinical, immunohistochemical, and genetic data on four COL6-RD families with marked intergenerational phenotypic heterogeneity. This variable expression seemingly masquerades as anticipation is due to parental mosaicism for a dominant mutation, with subsequent full inheritance and penetrance of the mutation in the heterozygous offspring. We also present an additional fifth simplex patient identified as a mosaic carrier. Parental mosaicism was confirmed in the four families through quantitative analysis of the ratio of mutant versus wild-type allele (COL6A1, COL6A2, and COL6A3) in genomic DNA from various tissues, including blood, dermal fibroblasts, and saliva. Consistent with somatic mosaicism, parental samples had lower ratios of mutant versus wild-type allele compared with the fully heterozygote offspring. However, there was notable variability of the mutant allele levels between tissues tested, ranging from 16% (saliva) to 43% (fibroblasts) in one mosaic father. This is the first report demonstrating mosaicism as a cause of intrafamilial/intergenerational variability of COL6-RD, and suggests that sporadic and parental mosaicism may be more common than previously suspected.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bethlem myopathy", "COL6A1", "COL6A2", "COL6A3", "Collagen VI", "Genetic counseling", "Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Child", "Collagen Type VI", "Contracture", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Mosaicism", "Muscles", "Muscular Dystrophies", "Mutation", "Pedigree", "Sclerosis", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84920087240", "SubjectAreas": [["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Genetics (clinical)", "MEDI", "2716"]], "AuthorData": {"55604781800": {"Name": "Donkervoort S.", "AuthorID": "55604781800", "AffiliationID": "60013780, 60006577", "AffiliationName": "National Institutes of Health, National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, Neurogenetics Branch, Neuromuscular and Neurogenetic Disorders of Childhood Section"}, "55695380100": {"Name": "Hu Y.", "AuthorID": "55695380100", "AffiliationID": "60013780, 60006577", "AffiliationName": "National Institutes of Health, National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, Neurogenetics Branch, Neuromuscular and Neurogenetic Disorders of Childhood Section"}, "37059349600": {"Name": "Leach M.E.", "AuthorID": "37059349600", "AffiliationID": "60005723", "AffiliationName": "Children's National association: Children's National Health System"}, "26431718200": {"Name": "Dastgir J.", "AuthorID": "26431718200", "AffiliationID": "60013780, 60006577", "AffiliationName": "National Institutes of Health, National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, Neurogenetics Branch, Neuromuscular and Neurogenetic Disorders of Childhood Section"}, "8840040600": {"Name": "Bolduc V.", "AuthorID": "8840040600", "AffiliationID": "60013780, 60006577", "AffiliationName": "National Institutes of Health, National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, Neurogenetics Branch, Neuromuscular and Neurogenetic Disorders of Childhood Section"}, "53364534700": {"Name": "Schindler A.B.", "AuthorID": "53364534700", "AffiliationID": "60013780, 60006577", "AffiliationName": "National Institutes of Health, National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, Neurogenetics Branch, Neuromuscular and Neurogenetic Disorders of Childhood Section"}, "7003763204": {"Name": "B\u00f6nnemann C.G.", "AuthorID": "7003763204", "AffiliationID": "60013780, 60006577", "AffiliationName": "National Institutes of Health, National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, Neurogenetics Branch, Neuromuscular and Neurogenetic Disorders of Childhood Section"}, "7003682797": {"Name": "Stojkovic T.", "AuthorID": "7003682797", "AffiliationID": "60015622, 60018487", "AffiliationName": "AP-HP, H\u00f4pitaux universitaires la Piti\u00e9-Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re-Charles Foix, Centre de R\u00e9f\u00e9rence de Pathologie Neuromusculaire Paris Est"}, "57203226094": {"Name": "Voermans N.C.", "AuthorID": "57203226094", "AffiliationID": "60002573", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Radboud university medical center"}, "24491653200": {"Name": "Foley A.R.", "AuthorID": "24491653200", "AffiliationID": "60018207, 60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dubowitz Neuromuscular Centre, University College London Institute of Child Health and Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children"}, "7102038246": {"Name": "Muntoni F.", "AuthorID": "7102038246", "AffiliationID": "60018207, 60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dubowitz Neuromuscular Centre, University College London Institute of Child Health and Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children"}, "14012171300": {"Name": "Cullup T.", "AuthorID": "14012171300", "AffiliationID": "60009797", "AffiliationName": "DNA Laboratory, GSTS Pathology, Guy's Hospital"}, "23979609000": {"Name": "de Becdeli\u00e8vre A.", "AuthorID": "23979609000", "AffiliationID": "60015622, 60018487", "AffiliationName": "AP-HP, H\u00f4pitaux Universitaires La Piti\u00e9 Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re - Charles Foix, U.F.
