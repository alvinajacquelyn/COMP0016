However, few studies have integrated the advantages of such approach with the brain network model given by graph theory. Furthermore, the use of such methods has rarely been explored with fixed frequency stimulation resting-state protocols. In this paper, we propose a method to model functional connectivity using both a frequency domain approach and a network model. By estimating coherence with the Welch method, it is possible to represent the brain activity using binary connectivity matrices, and to characterize such networks in terms of global and local measures. We tested our method with experimental data from an autonomic stimulation protocol and compared the results with the more common correlation analysis. We were able to see significant differences between the two sessions in the frequency range of the stimulation. Such differences involved brain areas associated with the central autonomic network and didn't show up in the time domain approach.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Autonomic network", "Brain connectivity", "Correlation analysis", "Frequency domain approaches", "Functional connectivity", "Spectral coherence", "Stimulation protocols", "Time-domain approach"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84940394712", "SubjectAreas": [["Artificial Intelligence", "COMP", "1702"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"]], "AuthorData": {"56647524300": {"Name": "Mancini M.", "AuthorID": "56647524300", "AffiliationID": "60012630", "AffiliationName": "Department of Engineering, University of Rome Roma Tre"}, "6602688693": {"Name": "Conforto S.", "AuthorID": "6602688693", "AffiliationID": "60012630", "AffiliationName": "Department of Engineering, University of Rome Roma Tre"}, "22935173800": {"Name": "Mattei E.", "AuthorID": "22935173800", "AffiliationID": "60010062", "AffiliationName": "Department of Technology and Health, Italian National Institute of Health"}, "56240603000": {"Name": "Censi F.", "AuthorID": "56240603000", "AffiliationID": "60010062", "AffiliationName": "Department of Technology and Health, Italian National Institute of Health"}, "7005890135": {"Name": "Calcagnini G.", "AuthorID": "7005890135", "AffiliationID": "60010062", "AffiliationName": "Department of Technology and Health, Italian National Institute of Health"}, "6701548417": {"Name": "Bozzali M.", "AuthorID": "6701548417", "AffiliationID": "60014416", "AffiliationName": "Neuroimaging Laboratory, Santa Lucia Foundation"}}}
