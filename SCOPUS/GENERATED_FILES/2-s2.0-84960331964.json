Methods: EEGs of 20 term neonates were recorded (10 seizure, 10 non-seizure). Seizures were annotated by an expert and characterized using a novel set of 10 criteria.ANSeR seizure detection algorithm (SDA) seizure annotations were compared to the expert to derive detected and non-detected seizures at three SDA sensitivity thresholds. Differences in seizure characteristics between groups were compared using univariate and multivariate analysis. False detections were characterized. Results: The expert detected 421 seizures. The SDA at thresholds 0.4, 0.5, 0.6 detected 60%, 54% and 45% of seizures. At all thresholds, multivariate analyses demonstrated that the odds of detecting seizure increased with 4 criteria: seizure amplitude, duration, rhythmicity and number of EEG channels involved at seizure peak. Major causes of false detections included respiration and sweat artefacts or a highly rhythmic background, often during intermediate sleep. Conclusion: This rigorous analysis allows estimation of how key seizure features are exploited by SDAs. Significance: This study resulted in a beta version of ANSeR with significantly improved performance.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Automated seizure detection", "Neonatal seizures"], "IndexKeywords": ["Algorithms", "Asphyxia Neonatorum", "Brain", "Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted", "Electroencephalography", "Female", "Humans", "Hypoxia, Brain", "Infant, Newborn", "Intracranial Hemorrhages", "Male", "Meconium Aspiration Syndrome", "Seizures"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84960331964", "SubjectAreas": [["Sensory Systems", "NEUR", "2809"], ["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Physiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2737"]], "AuthorData": {"54906442400": {"Name": "Mathieson S.", "AuthorID": "54906442400", "AffiliationID": "60113732, 60025160", "AffiliationName": "Neonatal Brain Research Group, Irish Centre for Fetal and Neonatal Translational Research, Department of Paediatrics and Child Health, University College Cork"}, "7102446358": {"Name": "Rennie J.", "AuthorID": "7102446358", "AffiliationID": "60113732, 60025160", "AffiliationName": "Neonatal Brain Research Group, Irish Centre for Fetal and Neonatal Translational Research, Department of Paediatrics and Child Health, University College Cork"}, "24067510000": {"Name": "Livingstone V.", "AuthorID": "24067510000", "AffiliationID": "60113732, 60025160", "AffiliationName": "Neonatal Brain Research Group, Irish Centre for Fetal and Neonatal Translational Research, Department of Paediatrics and Child Health, University College Cork"}, "12143283200": {"Name": "Temko A.", "AuthorID": "12143283200", "AffiliationID": "60025160", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University College Cork"}, "26663546300": {"Name": "Low E.", "AuthorID": "26663546300", "AffiliationID": "60113732, 60025160", "AffiliationName": "Neonatal Brain Research Group, Irish Centre for Fetal and Neonatal Translational Research, Department of Paediatrics and Child Health, University College Cork"}, "6602292136": {"Name": "Boylan G.B.", "AuthorID": "6602292136", "AffiliationID": "60113732, 60025160", "AffiliationName": "Neonatal Brain Research Group, Irish Centre for Fetal and Neonatal Translational Research, Department of Paediatrics and Child Health, University College Cork"}, "6602252366": {"Name": "Pressler R.M.", "AuthorID": "6602252366", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Neurophysiology, Great Ormond Street Hospital"}}}
