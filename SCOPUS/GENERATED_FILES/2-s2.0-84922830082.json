Lysosome dysfunction features in several diseases exemplified by the lysosomal storage disorders and is often associated with marked changes in lysosome structure. Lysosomal morphology may therefore serve as a sensitive readout of endocytic well-being. Here we describe methods for monitoring lysosome morphology in fixed and live cells using fluorescent probes and electron microscopy.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Electron microscopy", "Endocytosis", "Fluorescence microscopy", "Immunofluorescence", "LAMP1", "Lysosome", "Membrane traffic", "NAADP", "Two-pore channels"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cells, Cultured", "Cryoelectron Microscopy", "Fluorescent Antibody Technique, Indirect", "Fluorescent Dyes", "Humans", "Lysosomes", "Microscopy, Electron", "Microscopy, Electron, Transmission", "Microscopy, Fluorescence", "Organelle Shape", "Single-Cell Analysis", "Staining and Labeling", "Tissue Fixation"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84922830082", "SubjectAreas": [["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"55915788000": {"Name": "Kilpatrick B.", "AuthorID": "55915788000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University College London"}, "56487542500": {"Name": "Hockey L.", "AuthorID": "56487542500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University College London"}, "7403902620": {"Name": "Patel S.", "AuthorID": "7403902620", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University College London"}, "7004743246": {"Name": "Eden E.", "AuthorID": "7004743246", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell Biology, Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}, "8854249500": {"Name": "Futter C.", "AuthorID": "8854249500", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell Biology, Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}}}
