In this paper we consider the use of structural information in the form of edge directions coming from an auxiliary image of the same object being reconstructed. In order to allow for cases where the auxiliary image does not provide complete information we consider in addition a sparsity regularization for the edges appearing in the EIT image. The combination of these approaches is conveniently described through the parallel level sets approach. We present an overview of previous methods for structural regularisation and then provide a variational setting for our approach and explain the numerical implementation. We present results on simulations and experimental data for different cases with accurate and inaccurate prior information. The results demonstrate that the structural prior information improves the reconstruction accuracy, even in cases when there is reasonable uncertainty in the prior about the location of the edges or only partial edge information is available.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Computational inverse problem", "Electrical impedance tomography", "Finite element method", "Regularization", "Structural prior"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85065742548", "SubjectAreas": [["Analysis", "MATH", "2603"], ["Modeling and Simulation", "MATH", "2611"], ["Discrete Mathematics and Combinatorics", "MATH", "2607"], ["Control and Optimization", "MATH", "2606"]], "AuthorData": {"6601968005": {"Name": "Kolehmainen V.", "AuthorID": "6601968005", "AffiliationID": "60103673", "AffiliationName": "Department of Applied Physics, University of Eastern Finland"}, "55248138800": {"Name": "Ehrhardt M.J.", "AuthorID": "55248138800", "AffiliationID": "60030480", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Mathematical Innovation, University of Bath"}, "7005759823": {"Name": "Arridge S.R.", "AuthorID": "7005759823", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Image Computing, University College London"}}}
