Both WT and genetic variants of the normal plasma protein transthyretin (TTR) form amyloid, but neither the misfolding leading to fibrillogenesis nor the anatomical localization of TTR amyloid deposition are understood. Wehave previously shown that, under physiological conditions, trypsin cleaves human TTR in a mechano-enzymatic mechanism that generates abundant amyloid fibrils in vitro. In sharp contrast, the widely used in vitro model of denaturation and aggregation of TTR by prolonged exposure to pH 4.0 yields almost no clearly defined amyloid fibrils. However, the exclusive duodenal location of trypsin means that this enzyme cannot contribute to systemic extracellular TTR amyloid deposition in vivo. Here, we therefore conducted a bioinformatics search for systemically active tryptic proteases with appropriate tissue distribution, which unexpectedly identified plasmin as the leading candidate. We confirmed that plasmin, just as trypsin, selectively cleaves human TTR between residues 48 and 49 under physiological conditions in vitro. Truncated and full-length protomers are then released from the native homotetramer and rapidly aggregate into abundant fibrils indistinguishable from ex vivo TTR amyloid. Our findings suggest that physiological fibrinolysis is likely to play a critical role in TTR amyloid formation in vivo. Identification of this surprising intersection between two hitherto unrelated pathways opens new avenues for elucidating the mechanisms of TTR amyloidosis, for seeking susceptibility risk factors, and for therapeutic innovation.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Amyloid deposition", "Amyloid formation", "Enzymatic mechanisms", "Extracellular accumulations", "Genetic variants", "Physiological condition", "Systemic amyloidosis", "Tissue distributions", "Amyloid", "Amyloidosis", "Databases, Protein", "Fibrinolysin", "Humans", "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration", "In Vitro Techniques", "Plasminogen", "Prealbumin", "Protein Denaturation", "Protein Folding", "Proteolysis", "Trypsin"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85053084151", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"7003800223": {"Name": "Mangione P.P.", "AuthorID": "7003800223", "AffiliationID": "60015197", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Medicine, Institute of Biochemistry, University of Pavia"}, "56502017200": {"Name": "Verona G.", "AuthorID": "56502017200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Medicine, Wolfson Drug Discovery Unit, University College London"}, "6701582903": {"Name": "Corazza A.", "AuthorID": "6701582903", "AffiliationID": "60082163", "AffiliationName": "Istituto Nazionale Biostrutture E Biosistemi"}, "57202845706": {"Name": "Canetti D.", "AuthorID": "57202845706", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Medicine, Wolfson Drug Discovery Unit, University College London"}, "57203872729": {"Name": "Esposito M.", "AuthorID": "57203872729", "AffiliationID": "60032819, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "National Amyloidosis Centre, University College London and Royal Free Hospital"}, "35493762000": {"Name": "Taylor G.W.", "AuthorID": "35493762000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Medicine, Wolfson Drug Discovery Unit, University College London"}, "56848974700": {"Name": "Pepys M.B.", "AuthorID": "56848974700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Medicine, Wolfson Drug Discovery Unit, University College London"}, "7006438238": {"Name": "Bellotti V.", "AuthorID": "7006438238", "AffiliationID": "60015197", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Medicine, Institute of Biochemistry, University of Pavia"}, "6701844245": {"Name": "Giorgetti S.", "AuthorID": "6701844245", "AffiliationID": "60015197", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Medicine, Institute of Biochemistry, University of Pavia"}, "55335681200": {"Name": "Raimondi S.", "AuthorID": "55335681200", "AffiliationID": "60015197", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Medicine, Institute of Biochemistry, University of Pavia"}, "6603825748": {"Name": "Stoppini M.", "AuthorID": "6603825748", "AffiliationID": "60015197", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Medicine, Institute of Biochemistry, University of Pavia"}, "7102248244": {"Name": "Valli M.", "AuthorID": "7102248244", "AffiliationID": "60015197", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Medicine, Institute of Biochemistry, University of Pavia"}, "9247602200": {"Name": "Marchese L.", "AuthorID": "9247602200", "AffiliationID": "60015197", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Medicine, Institute of Biochemistry, University of Pavia"}, "57191057996": {"Name": "Faravelli G.", "AuthorID": "57191057996", "AffiliationID": "60015197", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Medicine, Institute of Biochemistry, University of Pavia"}, "7005643766": {"Name": "Marcoux J.", "AuthorID": "7005643766", "AffiliationID": "60102124, 60020129", "AffiliationName": "Institut de Pharmacologie et de Biologie Structurale, Universit\u00e9 de Toulouse"}, "6701765355": {"Name": "Relini A.", "AuthorID": "6701765355", "AffiliationID": "60025153", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry and Industrial Chemistry, University of Genoa"}, "8094719200": {"Name": "Canale C.", "AuthorID": "8094719200", "AffiliationID": "60025153", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of Genoa"}, "6602110619": {"Name": "Obici L.", "AuthorID": "6602110619", "AffiliationID": "60025153", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of Genoa"}, "35464959200": {"Name": "Hawkins P.N.", "AuthorID": "35464959200", "AffiliationID": "60026556", "AffiliationName": "Amyloidosis Research and Treatment Center, Foundation IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo"}, "7003539031": {"Name": "Gillmore J.D.", "AuthorID": "7003539031", "AffiliationID": "60026556", "AffiliationName": "Amyloidosis Research and Treatment Center, Foundation IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo"}}}
