Although ToM performance in both clinical groups was impaired, only participants with WS showed small differences in looking behaviour at the start of the video. Furthermore, while TD children who passed the ToM task looked longer at the original hiding place there was no such contrast in the clinical groups. This shows that looking behaviour in ASD and WS is not necessarily atypical when saliency aspects such as language, background, and colour are removed and that differences in looking behaviour cannot explain ToM performance.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Autism Spectrum Disorders", "Eye movements", "Theory of mind", "Williams syndrome"], "IndexKeywords": ["Autism Spectrum Disorder", "Case-Control Studies", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Eye Movement Measurements", "Face", "Facial Recognition", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Neuropsychological Tests", "Theory of Mind", "Williams Syndrome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84938848983", "SubjectAreas": [["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"], ["Clinical Psychology", "PSYC", "3203"]], "AuthorData": {"14631196700": {"Name": "Van Herwegen J.", "AuthorID": "14631196700", "AffiliationID": "60033359", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Kingston University"}, "55568512084": {"Name": "Smith T.J.", "AuthorID": "55568512084", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychological Sciences, University of London, Birkbeck"}, "12799328500": {"Name": "Dimitriou D.", "AuthorID": "12799328500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Lifespan Learning and Sleep Laboratory, UCL, Institute of Education"}}}
