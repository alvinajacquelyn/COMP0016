The present study investigates how auditory efferent activation (via the medial olivocochlear system) affects binaural frequency selectivity in normal-hearing listeners. Thresholds were measured for a 1-kHz signal embedded in a diotic notched-noise masker for various notch widths. The signal was either presented in phase (diotic) or in antiphase (dichotic), gated with the noise. Stimulus duration was 25 ms, in order to avoid efferent activation due to the masker or the signal. A bandpass-filtered noise precursor was presented prior to the masker and signal stimuli to activate the efferent system. The silent interval between the precursor and the masker-signal complex was 50 ms. For comparison, thresholds for detectability of the masked signal were also measured in a baseline condition without the precursor and, in addition, without the masker. On average, the results of the baseline condition indicate an effectively wider binaural filter, as expected. For both signal phases, the addition of the precursor results in effectively wider filters, which is in agreement with the hypothesis that cochlear gain is reduced due to the presence of the precursor.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Binaural", "Efferent", "Frequency selectivity", "MOC", "Precursor"], "IndexKeywords": ["Acoustic Stimulation", "Adult", "Auditory Pathways", "Auditory Threshold", "Cochlea", "Efferent Pathways", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Noise", "Olivary Nucleus", "Perceptual Masking", "Pitch Perception", "Psychoacoustics", "Signal Detection, Psychological", "Time Factors", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85018384024", "SubjectAreas": [["Sensory Systems", "NEUR", "2809"]], "AuthorData": {"7003818043": {"Name": "Verhey J.", "AuthorID": "7003818043", "AffiliationID": "60018362", "AffiliationName": "Department of Experimental Audiology, Otto von Guericke University"}, "57204983089": {"Name": "Kordus M.", "AuthorID": "57204983089", "AffiliationID": "60018362", "AffiliationName": "Department of Experimental Audiology, Otto von Guericke University"}, "6506821409": {"Name": "Drga V.", "AuthorID": "6506821409", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "57203606003": {"Name": "Yasin I.", "AuthorID": "57203606003", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}}}
