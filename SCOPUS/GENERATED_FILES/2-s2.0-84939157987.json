In order to achieve a high information spectral density (ISD), while simultaneously maintaining transmission reach, multi-channel fibre nonlinearity compensation and spectrally efficient data encoding must be utilised. In this work, we use a single coherent super-receiver to simultaneously receive a DP-16QAM super-channel, consisting of seven spectrally shaped 10GBd sub-carriers spaced at the Nyquist frequency. Effective nonlinearity mitigation is achieved using multi-channel digital back-propagation (MC-DBP) and this technique is combined with an optimised forward error correction implementation to demonstrate a record gain in transmission reach of 85%; increasing the maximum transmission distance from 3190 km to 5890 km, with an ISD of 6.60 b/s/Hz. In addition, this report outlines for the first time, the sensitivity of MC-DBP gain to linear transmission line impairments and defines a trade-off between performance and complexity.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84939157987", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"16053296900": {"Name": "Maher R.", "AuthorID": "16053296900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Optical Networks Group, University College London"}, "7401627190": {"Name": "Xu T.", "AuthorID": "7401627190", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Optical Networks Group, University College London"}, "36192836100": {"Name": "Galdino L.", "AuthorID": "36192836100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Optical Networks Group, University College London"}, "55626583400": {"Name": "Sato M.", "AuthorID": "55626583400", "AffiliationID": "60031293", "AffiliationName": "NEC Corporation"}, "23476771600": {"Name": "Alvarado A.", "AuthorID": "23476771600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Optical Networks Group, University College London"}, "36140432900": {"Name": "Shi K.", "AuthorID": "36140432900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Optical Networks Group, University College London"}, "13608129100": {"Name": "Savory S.", "AuthorID": "13608129100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Optical Networks Group, University College London"}, "7006614570": {"Name": "Thomsen B.", "AuthorID": "7006614570", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Optical Networks Group, University College London"}, "7003479201": {"Name": "Killey R.", "AuthorID": "7003479201", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Optical Networks Group, University College London"}, "7005053644": {"Name": "Bayvel P.", "AuthorID": "7005053644", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Optical Networks Group, University College London"}}}
