All rights reserved.Socially interactive systems are embodied agents that engage in social interactions with humans. From a design perspective, these systems are built by considering a biologically inspired design (Bio-inspired) that can mimic and simulate human-like communication cues and gestures. The design of a bio-inspired system usually consists of (i) studying biological characteristics, (ii) designing a similar biological robot, and (iii) motion planning, that can mimic the biological counterpart. In this article, we present a design, development, control-strategy and verification of our socially interactive bio-inspired robot, namely - Telepresence Mechatronic Robot (TEBoT). The key contribution of our work is an embodiment of a real human-neck movements by, i) designing a mechatronic platform based on the dynamics of a real human neck and ii) capturing the real head movements through our novel single-camera based vision algorithm. Our socially interactive bio-inspired system is based on an intuitive integration-design strategy that combines computer vision based geometric head pose estimation algorithm, model based design (MBD) approach and real-time motion planning techniques. We have conducted an extensive testing to demonstrate effectiveness and robustness of our proposed system.", "AuthorKeywords": ["biologically inspired robot", "embodied telepresence system", "head pose estimation", "model based design", "Socially interactive robot", "vision based robot control"], "IndexKeywords": ["Biologically-inspired robots", "Head Pose Estimation", "Interactive robot", "Model- based designs", "Robot controls", "Tele-presence systems"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84992110994", "SubjectAreas": [["Statistics and Probability", "MATH", "2613"], ["Engineering (all)", "ENGI", "2200"], ["Artificial Intelligence", "COMP", "1702"]], "AuthorData": {"56021985400": {"Name": "Khan M.", "AuthorID": "56021985400", "AffiliationID": "60031040", "AffiliationName": "Department of Applied Physics and Electronics, Ume\u00e5 University"}, "24476727800": {"Name": "Ur R\u00e9hman S.", "AuthorID": "24476727800", "AffiliationID": "60031040", "AffiliationName": "Department of Applied Physics and Electronics, Ume\u00e5 University"}, "56375326400": {"Name": "Li H.", "AuthorID": "56375326400", "AffiliationID": "60002014", "AffiliationName": "KTH Royal Institute of Technology"}}}
