The American Astronomical Society. All rights reserved..We present the second Swift Ultra-Violet/Optical Telescope (UVOT) gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglow catalog, greatly expanding on the first Swift UVOT GRB afterglow catalog. The second catalog is constructed from a database containing over 120,000 independent UVOT observations of 538 GRBs first detected by Swift, the High Energy Transient Explorer 2 (HETE2), the INTErnational Gamma-Ray Astrophysics Laboratory (INTEGRAL), the Interplanetary Network (IPN), Fermi, and Astro-rivelatore Gamma a Immagini Leggero (AGILE). The catalog covers GRBs discovered from 2005 January 17 to 2010 December 25. Using photometric information in three UV bands, three optical bands, and a \"white\" or open filter, the data are optimally coadded to maximize the number of detections and normalized to one band to provide a detailed light curve. The catalog provides positional, temporal, and photometric information for each burst, as well as Swift Burst Alert Telescope and X-ray Telescope (XRT) GRB parameters. Temporal slopes are provided for each UVOT filter. The temporal slope per filter of almost half the GRBs are fit with a single power law, but one to three breaks are required in the remaining bursts. Morphological comparisons with the X-ray reveal that of the UVOT light curves are similar to one of the four morphologies identified by Evans et al. (2009). The remaining have a newly identified morphology. For many bursts, redshift- and extinction-corrected UV/optical spectral slopes are also provided at 2 \u00d7 103, 2 \u00d7104, and 2 \u00d7105 s.", "AuthorKeywords": ["catalogs", "gamma-ray burst: general"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85014679703", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"6602759624": {"Name": "Roming P.W.A.", "AuthorID": "6602759624", "AffiliationID": "60003212", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Texas at San Antonio"}, "26639173500": {"Name": "Bayless A.J.", "AuthorID": "26639173500", "AffiliationID": "60003212", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Texas at San Antonio"}, "55143691400": {"Name": "Gronwall C.", "AuthorID": "55143691400", "AffiliationID": "60001439", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Gravitation and the Cosmos, Pennsylvania State University"}, "7402331052": {"Name": "Siegel M.H.", "AuthorID": "7402331052", "AffiliationID": "60001439", "AffiliationName": "Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics, Pennsylvania State University"}, "55429469500": {"Name": "Koch T.S.", "AuthorID": "55429469500", "AffiliationID": "60001439", "AffiliationName": "Classroom and Lab Computing, Pennsylvania State University"}, "22935361700": {"Name": "Oates S.R.", "AuthorID": "22935361700", "AffiliationID": "60084281, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Mullard Space Science Laboratory, University College London"}, "6603460192": {"Name": "Breeveld A.A.", "AuthorID": "6603460192", "AffiliationID": "60084281, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Mullard Space Science Laboratory, University College London"}, "6504237637": {"Name": "Kuin N.P.M.", "AuthorID": "6504237637", "AffiliationID": "60084281, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Mullard Space Science Laboratory, University College London"}, "8740690900": {"Name": "Page M.J.", "AuthorID": "8740690900", "AffiliationID": "60084281, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Mullard Space Science Laboratory, University College London"}, "15049906800": {"Name": "Pasquale M.D.", "AuthorID": "15049906800", "AffiliationID": "60084281, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Mullard Space Science Laboratory, University College London"}, "45361418800": {"Name": "Porterfield B.L.", "AuthorID": "45361418800", "AffiliationID": "60008158", "AffiliationName": "Space Telescope Science Institute"}, "43361752100": {"Name": "Swenson C.A.", "AuthorID": "43361752100", "AffiliationID": "60000984", "AffiliationName": "Science Systems and Applications, Inc."}, "57193538618": {"Name": "Tobler J.M.", "AuthorID": "57193538618", "AffiliationID": "60026161", "AffiliationName": "Department of Space Studies, University of North Dakota"}}}
