Various approaches have been suggested to overcome this problem. We propose a new approach to this problem by formulating an intrinsically two-dimensional model which does not require references to a higher dimensional one. We are able to model planar chiral materials starting from a geometrically nonlinear Cosserat-type elasticity theory. Our results are in agreement with previously derived equations of motion but can contain additional terms due to our nonlinear approach. Plane wave solutions are briefly discussed within this model.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Chiral materials", "Cosserat continuum", "Geometrically nonlinear micropolar elasticity", "Planar models"], "IndexKeywords": ["Chiral material", "Cosserat continuum", "Geometrically nonlinear", "Micropolar elasticity", "Planar model", "Three-dimensional theory", "Two dimensional model", "Two-dimensional problem"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85035754842", "SubjectAreas": [["Mechanics of Materials", "ENGI", "2211"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"55811800800": {"Name": "Bahamonde S.", "AuthorID": "55811800800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University College London"}, "56247935800": {"Name": "B\u00f6hmer C.", "AuthorID": "56247935800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University College London"}, "7004208059": {"Name": "Neff P.", "AuthorID": "7004208059", "AffiliationID": "60014264", "AffiliationName": "Lehrstuhl f\u00fcr Nichtlineare Analysis und Modellierung, Fakult\u00e4t f\u00fcr Mathematik, Universit\u00e4t Duisburg-Essen"}}}
