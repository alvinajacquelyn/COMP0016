The rectification is achieved by asymmetric modulation of effective Schottky barrier and carrier density in the channel during forward and reverse bias, and a rectification factor of 1.3 \u00d7 105 is achieved in I-V characteristics. The modulation of effective Schottky barrier is verified by temperature dependent measurement in a range of 173 to 373 K, and a difference of 300 meV is observed in effective Schottky barrier height for forward and reverse bias. The electrical characteristics of SBD exhibit close resemblance with an ideal thermionic emission model with an ideality factor of 1.3. SBD also exhibits strong photoelectrical response with a specific detectivity of 150 A/W and responsivity of 2.1 \u00d7 1010 Jones under 450 nm laser light illumination. In the end, to demonstrate the diversity of the proposed scheme, SBD based on WSe2 has also been fabricated and the results have been discussed. These results suggest a new route toward the SBD based numerous electronics and optoelectronics applications and can in principle be implemented using other two-dimensional materials as well.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Asymmetric modulations", "Electrical characteristic", "Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN)", "Laser light illumination", "Photoelectrical response", "Schottky barrier heights", "Temperature-dependent measurements", "Two-dimensional materials"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85042031281", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"], ["Materials Chemistry", "MATE", "2505"]], "AuthorData": {"56590942800": {"Name": "Khan M.", "AuthorID": "56590942800", "AffiliationID": "60007511", "AffiliationName": "School of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, Sungkyunkwan Advanced Institute of Nanotechnology (SAINT), Sungkyunkwan University"}, "36838604200": {"Name": "Rathi S.", "AuthorID": "36838604200", "AffiliationID": "60007511", "AffiliationName": "School of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, Sungkyunkwan Advanced Institute of Nanotechnology (SAINT), Sungkyunkwan University"}, "56591421400": {"Name": "Lim D.", "AuthorID": "56591421400", "AffiliationID": "60007511", "AffiliationName": "School of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, Sungkyunkwan Advanced Institute of Nanotechnology (SAINT), Sungkyunkwan University"}, "57210288630": {"Name": "Kim G.", "AuthorID": "57210288630", "AffiliationID": "60007511", "AffiliationName": "School of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, Sungkyunkwan Advanced Institute of Nanotechnology (SAINT), Sungkyunkwan University"}, "7202777409": {"Name": "Yun S.", "AuthorID": "7202777409", "AffiliationID": "60001558", "AffiliationName": "ICT Components and Materials Technology Research Division, Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute"}, "17436687200": {"Name": "Youn D.", "AuthorID": "17436687200", "AffiliationID": "60001558", "AffiliationName": "ICT Components and Materials Technology Research Division, Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute"}, "57203090873": {"Name": "Watanabe K.", "AuthorID": "57203090873", "AffiliationID": "60002414", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Materials Science"}, "55252500400": {"Name": "Taniguchi T.", "AuthorID": "55252500400", "AffiliationID": "60002414", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Materials Science"}}}
