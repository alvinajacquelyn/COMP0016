Parents are the gatekeepers of children\u2019s independent mobility. This mixed methods study investigates whether parent perceptions of the neighbourhood environment alignwith objectivemeasures of the neighbourhood built environment, and how perceived and objectivemeasures relate to parental licence for children\u2019s independentmobility. Parents participating in the Neighbourhood for Active Kids study (n = 940) answered an open-ended question about what would make their neighbourhoods better for their child\u2019s independent mobility, and reported household and child demographics. Objective measures of the neighbourhood built environment were generated using geographic information systems. Content analysis was used to classify and group parent-reported changes required to improve their neigbourhood. Parent-reported needs were then compared with objective neighbourhood built environment measures. Linear mixed modelling examined associations between parental licence for independent mobility and (1) parent neighbourhood perceptions; and (2) objectively assessed neighbourhood built environment features. Parents identified the need for safer traffic environments. No significant differences in parent reported needs were found by objectively assessed characteristics. Differences in odds of reporting needs were observed for a range of socio-demographic characteristics. Parental licence for independent mobility was only associated with a need for safer places to cycle (positive) and objectively assessed cycling infrastructure (negative) in adjusted models. Overall, the study findings indicate the importance of safer traffic environments for children\u2019s independent mobility.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Active transport", "Active travel", "Cycling", "Infrastructure", "Traffic safety", "Walking"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Built Environment", "Child", "Cities", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "New Zealand", "Parents", "Perception", "Residence Characteristics", "Walking"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85065301173", "SubjectAreas": [["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"], ["Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis", "ENVI", "2307"]], "AuthorData": {"12790879300": {"Name": "Smith M.", "AuthorID": "12790879300", "AffiliationID": "60005686", "AffiliationName": "School of Nursing, The University of Auckland"}, "57202586870": {"Name": "Amann R.", "AuthorID": "57202586870", "AffiliationID": "60005686", "AffiliationName": "School of Nursing, The University of Auckland"}, "55246086700": {"Name": "Cavadino A.", "AuthorID": "55246086700", "AffiliationID": "60005686", "AffiliationName": "School of Nursing, The University of Auckland"}, "36646763200": {"Name": "Raphael D.", "AuthorID": "36646763200", "AffiliationID": "60005686", "AffiliationName": "School of Nursing, The University of Auckland"}, "55836767400": {"Name": "Zhao J.", "AuthorID": "55836767400", "AffiliationID": "60005686", "AffiliationName": "School of Nursing, The University of Auckland"}, "7006210085": {"Name": "Kearns R.", "AuthorID": "7006210085", "AffiliationID": "60005686", "AffiliationName": "School of Environment, The University of Auckland"}, "57208619546": {"Name": "Forsyth E.", "AuthorID": "57208619546", "AffiliationID": "60005686", "AffiliationName": "School of Environment, The University of Auckland"}, "7004586354": {"Name": "Mackett R.", "AuthorID": "7004586354", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil, Environmental and Geomatic Engineering, University College London"}, "17435344700": {"Name": "Mackay L.", "AuthorID": "17435344700", "AffiliationID": "60023760", "AffiliationName": "Human Potential Centre, Auckland University of Technology"}, "55450402200": {"Name": "Ikeda E.", "AuthorID": "55450402200", "AffiliationID": "60023760", "AffiliationName": "Human Potential Centre, Auckland University of Technology"}, "26321430800": {"Name": "Carroll P.", "AuthorID": "26321430800", "AffiliationID": "60110548", "AffiliationName": "Social and Health Outcomes Research and Evaluation (SHORE), Massey University"}, "6601989568": {"Name": "Witten K.", "AuthorID": "6601989568", "AffiliationID": "60110548", "AffiliationName": "Social and Health Outcomes Research and Evaluation (SHORE), Massey University"}, "32167639400": {"Name": "Mavoa S.", "AuthorID": "32167639400", "AffiliationID": "60118547, 60026553", "AffiliationName": "Melbourne School of Population and Global Health, The University of Melbourne"}}}
