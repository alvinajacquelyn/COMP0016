Higher volume online postdilutional hemodiafiltration (OL-HDF), with increasing hematocrit increases the risk of clotting in the extracorporeal circuit (ECC). We wished to determine whether OL-HDF increased platelet activation and ECC clotting. Methods: Coagulation parameters, platelet, white cell, and endothelial activation markers were measured at the start and end of dialysis sessions in 10 patients and also pre- and post-dialyzer after 15 minutes using two different dialyzers designed for high volume OL-HDF; cellulose triacetate (TAGP) and polysulphone (PS), and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP). Patients were anticoagulated with a heparin bolus. Findings: At the start of OL-HDF, D dimers, thrombin antithrombin complexes (TATs), and soluble adhesions molecules (sICAM-1 and sVCAM-1) were increased. Post-treatment soluble P selectin (PS/PVP 26.7 \u00b1 7.1 versus 36.6 \u00b1 9.9; TAGP 28.7 \u00b1 7.2 versus 43.5 \u00b1 8.4 ng/ml, P < 0.001), and soluble CD40 ligand (PS/PVP 297 \u00b1 228 versus 552 \u00b1 272, TAGP 245 \u00b1 187 versus 390 \u00b1 205 ng/ml, P < 0.05) increased. Post-dialyzer concentrations increased versus pre-dialyzer for tissue factor (PS/PVP 117 \u00b1 12 versus 136 \u00b1 16, TAGP 100 \u00b1 25 versus 128 \u00b1 40 ng/ml, P < 0.05), factor VIIIc (PS/PVP 174 \u00b1 54 versus 237 \u00b1 83, TAGP 163 \u00b1 60 versus 247 \u00b1 102 IU/ml, P < 0.01), sVCAM-1 (PS/PVP 782 \u00b1 64 versus 918 \u00b1 140, TAGP 722 \u00b1 121 versus 889 \u00b1 168 ng/ml, P < 0.01), and D-dimers (PS/PVP 292 \u00b1 132 versus 355 \u00b1 167, TAGP 300 \u00b1 129 versus 391 \u00b1 171 ng/ml, P < 0.001). There was no macroscopic thrombus noted in the ECC, and no increase in microparticles, platelet factor-4, or TATs. Discussion: Despite being pro-thrombotic, with activation of platelets, and lymphocytes during passage through ECC, no macroscopic clotting, or increased TATs were noted during OL-HDF, and no major differences between cellulosic and polysulphone dialyzers.", "AuthorKeywords": ["cellulose", "coagulation cascade", "dialyzer", "Hemodiafiltration", "microparticles polysulfone", "platelet", "thrombosis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Blood Coagulation", "Female", "Hemodiafiltration", "Humans", "Male", "Platelet Activation", "Renal Dialysis"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85026526328", "SubjectAreas": [["Hematology", "MEDI", "2720"], ["Nephrology", "MEDI", "2727"]], "AuthorData": {"56664498100": {"Name": "Tangvoraphonkchai K.", "AuthorID": "56664498100", "AffiliationID": "60002875", "AffiliationName": "Department of Renal Medicine, Mahasarakham University Hospital"}, "55950236200": {"Name": "Riddell A.", "AuthorID": "55950236200", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Haemophilia Centre & Thrombosis Unit, Royal Free Hospital"}, "55437680000": {"Name": "Davenport A.", "AuthorID": "55437680000", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60032819", "AffiliationName": "UCL Centre for Nephrology, University College London, Royal Free Hospital"}}}
