Sound waves are currently shaped using phased array systems, even though the complex electronics required are expensive and hinder widespread use. Here we show how to control, direct, and manipulate sound using 2-dimensional, planar, acoustic metasurfaces that require only one driving signal. This offers the advantages of ease of use and versatility over currently available phased arrays. We demonstrate the creation of a haptic sensation and steering of a beam produced by a parametric speaker. This simple, yet highly effective, method of creating single-beam manipulators could be introduced in medical or manufacturing applications.", "AuthorKeywords": ["3D Printing", "Haptic", "Metamaterials", "Sound"], "IndexKeywords": ["3-D printing", "Acoustic levitation", "Haptic", "Haptic sensation", "Manufacturing applications", "Parametric speakers", "Phased array systems", "Ultrasound imaging"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85034750275", "SubjectAreas": [["Human-Computer Interaction", "COMP", "1709"], ["Hardware and Architecture", "COMP", "1708"], ["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"]], "AuthorData": {"57197782588": {"Name": "Jackowski-Ashley L.", "AuthorID": "57197782588", "AffiliationID": "60017317", "AffiliationName": "Interact Lab, University of Sussex"}, "55960652900": {"Name": "Memoli G.", "AuthorID": "55960652900", "AffiliationID": "60017317", "AffiliationName": "Interact Lab, University of Sussex"}, "22133254300": {"Name": "Caleap M.", "AuthorID": "22133254300", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Engineering, University of Bristol"}, "57197781797": {"Name": "Slack N.", "AuthorID": "57197781797", "AffiliationID": "60017317", "AffiliationName": "Interact Lab, University of Sussex"}, "7006891244": {"Name": "Drinkwater B.", "AuthorID": "7006891244", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Engineering, University of Bristol"}, "35389893300": {"Name": "Subramanian S.", "AuthorID": "35389893300", "AffiliationID": "60017317", "AffiliationName": "Interact Lab, University of Sussex"}}}
