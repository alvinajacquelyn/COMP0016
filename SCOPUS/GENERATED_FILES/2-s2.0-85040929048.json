All rights Reserved.We compared children who were positive for Ebola virus disease (EVD) with those who were negative to derive a pediatric EVD predictive (PEP) score. We collected data on all children <13 years of age admitted to 11 Ebola holding units in Sierra Leone during August 2014-March 2015 and performed multivariable logistic regression. Among 1,054 children, 309 (29%) were EVD positive and 697 (66%) EVD negative, with 48 (5%) missing. Contact history, conjunctivitis, and age were the strongest positive predictors for EVD. The PEP score had an area under receiver operating characteristics curve of 0.80. A PEP score of 7/10 was 92% specific and 44% sensitive; 3/10 was 30% specific, 94% sensitive. The PEP score could correctly classify 79%-90% of children and could be used to facilitate triage into risk categories, depending on the sensitivity or specificity required.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Cohort Studies", "Disease Outbreaks", "Ebolavirus", "Hemorrhagic Fever, Ebola", "Humans", "Infant", "Retrospective Studies", "Risk Factors", "Sierra Leone"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85040929048", "SubjectAreas": [["Epidemiology", "MEDI", "2713"], ["Microbiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2726"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"55750371200": {"Name": "Fitzgerald F.", "AuthorID": "55750371200", "AffiliationID": "101861071", "AffiliationName": null}, "7201775981": {"Name": "Klein N.", "AuthorID": "7201775981", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "University College London Great Ormond Street, Institute of Child Health"}, "55362398400": {"Name": "Wing K.", "AuthorID": "55362398400", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "57191263338": {"Name": "Naveed A.", "AuthorID": "57191263338", "AffiliationID": "101861071", "AffiliationName": null}, "57191269942": {"Name": "Gbessay M.", "AuthorID": "57191269942", "AffiliationID": "101861071", "AffiliationName": null}, "57189459199": {"Name": "Ross J.C.G.", "AuthorID": "57189459199", "AffiliationID": "101861071", "AffiliationName": null}, "57202349535": {"Name": "Checchi F.", "AuthorID": "57202349535", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "22938971200": {"Name": "Oza S.", "AuthorID": "22938971200", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "54882290500": {"Name": "Boufkhed S.", "AuthorID": "54882290500", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "36028820900": {"Name": "Williamson E.", "AuthorID": "36028820900", "AffiliationID": "114434400", "AffiliationName": "Farr Institute of Health Informatics"}, "7102767741": {"Name": "Yeung S.", "AuthorID": "7102767741", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "56431221600": {"Name": "Youkee D.", "AuthorID": "56431221600", "AffiliationID": "60011520, 60109217, 60177641", "AffiliationName": "Kings Sierra Leone Partnership, Kings Centre for Global Health, Kings College London"}, "57215086216": {"Name": "Jalloh M.B.", "AuthorID": "57215086216", "AffiliationID": "106999143", "AffiliationName": "34 Military Hospital, Republic of Sierra Leone Armed Forces"}, "6506493626": {"Name": "Sahr F.", "AuthorID": "6506493626", "AffiliationID": "106999143", "AffiliationName": "34 Military Hospital, Republic of Sierra Leone Armed Forces"}, "24166379900": {"Name": "Baion D.E.", "AuthorID": "24166379900", "AffiliationID": "113086428", "AffiliationName": "Ola During Children\u2019s Hospital, Sierra Leone Ministry of Health"}, "57191266453": {"Name": "Mustapha A.", "AuthorID": "57191266453", "AffiliationID": "113086428", "AffiliationName": "Ola During Children\u2019s Hospital, Sierra Leone Ministry of Health"}, "57191271343": {"Name": "Jah H.", "AuthorID": "57191271343", "AffiliationID": "113086428", "AffiliationName": "Cap Anamur (German Emergency Doctors), Ola During Children\u2019s Hospital"}, "57191265961": {"Name": "Lako S.", "AuthorID": "57191265961", "AffiliationID": "113086428", "AffiliationName": "Welbodi Partnership, Ola During Children\u2019s Hospital"}, "57191266433": {"Name": "Feury R.", "AuthorID": "57191266433", "AffiliationID": "117393745", "AffiliationName": "Western Area Emergency Response Centre"}, "55751670800": {"Name": "Bielicki J.", "AuthorID": "55751670800", "AffiliationID": "60003108, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "MRC Clinical Trials Unit at UCL"}, "35495600000": {"Name": "Gibb D.M.", "AuthorID": "35495600000", "AffiliationID": "60003108, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "MRC Clinical Trials Unit at UCL"}}}
