We develop a theoretical framework for the analysis of stabilized cut finite element methods for the Laplace-Beltrami operator on a manifold embedded in R d of arbitrary codimension. The method is based on using continuous piecewise linears on a background mesh in the embedding space for approximation together with a stabilizing form that ensures that the resulting problem is stable. The discrete manifold is represented using a triangulation which does not match the background mesh and does not need to be shape-regular, which includes level set descriptions of codimension one manifolds and the non-matching embedding of independently triangulated manifolds as special cases. We identify abstract key assumptions on the stabilizing form which allow us to prove a bound on the condition number of the stiffness matrix and optimal order a priori estimates. The key assumptions are verified for three different realizations of the stabilizing form including a novel stabilization approach based on penalizing the surface normal gradient on the background mesh. Finally, we present numerical results illustrating our results for a curve and a surface embedded in R 3 .", "AuthorKeywords": ["A priori error estimates", "Arbitrary codimension", "Condition number", "Cut finite element method", "Laplace-Beltrami operator", "Stabilization", "Surface PDE"], "IndexKeywords": ["A-priori estimates", "Codimension", "Condition number of the stiffness matrix", "Condition numbers", "Laplace-Beltrami operator", "Numerical results", "Priori error estimate", "Theoretical framework"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85052126397", "SubjectAreas": [["Analysis", "MATH", "2603"], ["Numerical Analysis", "MATH", "2612"], ["Modeling and Simulation", "MATH", "2611"], ["Computational Mathematics", "MATH", "2605"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"7004271452": {"Name": "B\u00fcrman E.", "AuthorID": "7004271452", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University College London"}, "7004355911": {"Name": "Hansbo P.", "AuthorID": "7004355911", "AffiliationID": "60016471", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, J\u00f6nk\u00f6ping University"}, "7203022296": {"Name": "Larson M.", "AuthorID": "7203022296", "AffiliationID": "60031040", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics and Mathematical Statistics, Ume\u00e5 University"}, "37089040500": {"Name": "Massing A.", "AuthorID": "37089040500", "AffiliationID": "60031040", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics and Mathematical Statistics, Ume\u00e5 University"}}}
