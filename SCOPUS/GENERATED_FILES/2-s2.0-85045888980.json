All rights reserved.Understanding how normally soluble peptides and proteins aggregate to form amyloid fibrils is central to many areas of modern biomolecular science, ranging from the development of functional biomaterials to the design of rational therapeutic strategies against increasingly prevalent medical conditions such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. As such, there is a great need to develop models to mechanistically describe how amyloid fibrils are formed from precursor peptides and proteins. Here we review and discuss how ideas and concepts from chemical reaction kinetics can help to achieve this objective. In particular, we show how a combination of theory, experiments, and computer simulations, based on chemical kinetics, provides a general formalism for uncovering, at the molecular level, the mechanistic steps that underlie the phenomenon of amyloid fibril formation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alzheimer's disease", "Coarse-grained simulations", "Computer simulations", "Drug discovery", "Global fit", "Inhibition", "Master equation", "Neurodegenerative diseases", "Oligomers", "Protein aggregation", "Protein misfolding", "Rate law", "Reaction order", "Scaling exponent", "Secondary nucleation", "Self-assembly"], "IndexKeywords": ["Alzheimer's disease", "Coarse-grained", "Drug discovery", "Global fit", "Master equations", "Protein aggregation", "Protein misfolding", "Rate laws", "Reaction orders", "Scaling exponent", "Secondary nucleation", "Amyloid", "Computer Simulation", "Drug Discovery", "Humans", "Kinetics", "Protein Folding"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85045888980", "SubjectAreas": [["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"]], "AuthorData": {"55638714700": {"Name": "Michaels T.C.T.", "AuthorID": "55638714700", "AffiliationID": "60077572, 60009982", "AffiliationName": "Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Harvard University"}, "36607855500": {"Name": "Habchi J.", "AuthorID": "36607855500", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Misfolding Diseases, Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge"}, "57183760000": {"Name": "Chia S.", "AuthorID": "57183760000", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Misfolding Diseases, Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge"}, "54795619000": {"Name": "Meisl G.", "AuthorID": "54795619000", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Misfolding Diseases, Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge"}, "7007094071": {"Name": "Vendruscolo M.", "AuthorID": "7007094071", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Misfolding Diseases, Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge"}, "56623994700": {"Name": "Dobson C.M.", "AuthorID": "56623994700", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Misfolding Diseases, Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge"}, "14012356200": {"Name": "Knowles T.P.J.", "AuthorID": "14012356200", "AffiliationID": "60121115, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Cavendish Laboratory, Department of Physics, University of Cambridge"}, "23669259400": {"Name": "\u0160ari\u0107 A.", "AuthorID": "23669259400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, Institute for the Physics of Living Systems, University College London"}}}
