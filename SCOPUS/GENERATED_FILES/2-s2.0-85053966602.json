Many common industrial contaminants present in the soil are flammable. Combustion of an organic phase contained within a porous medium involves an exothermic reaction, during which heat is transmitted from the burning to the pore space and the solid matrix. Contaminant destruction in such applications is largely dominated by smoldering (as opposed to flaming) combustion. The results described in this paper indicate that smoldering remediation is viable across a considerable range of porous media types and subsurface conditions.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Coal", "NAPL", "Organic compounds", "Smoldering combustion", "Soil remediation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Contaminated soils", "Industrial contaminants", "Innovative approaches", "NAPL", "Remediation technologies", "Smoldering combustion", "Soil remediation", "Subsurface conditions"], "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85053966602", "SubjectAreas": [["Engineering (all)", "ENGI", "2200"]], "AuthorData": {"7004558676": {"Name": "Torero J.L.", "AuthorID": "7004558676", "AffiliationID": "60031004", "AffiliationName": "The University of Queensland"}, "57214106727": {"Name": "Yerm\u00e1n L.", "AuthorID": "57214106727", "AffiliationID": "60031004", "AffiliationName": "The University of Queensland"}, "7007145814": {"Name": "Gerhard J.I.", "AuthorID": "7007145814", "AffiliationID": "60010884", "AffiliationName": "University of Western Ontario"}, "57184438200": {"Name": "Kinsman L.L.", "AuthorID": "57184438200", "AffiliationID": "60010884", "AffiliationName": "University of Western Ontario"}}}
