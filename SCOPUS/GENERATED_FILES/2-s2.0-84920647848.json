Whilst most reports have demonstrated in vitro neural cell responses of the CNTs, few studies have been performed on the in vivo efficacy of CNT-interfaced biomaterials in the repair and regeneration of neural tissues. Thus, we report here for the first time the in vivo functions of CNT-interfaced nerve conduits in the regeneration of transected rat sciatic nerve. Aminated CNTs were chemically tethered onto the surface of aligned phosphate glass microfibers (PGFs) and CNT-interfaced PGFs (CNT-PGFs) were successfully placed into three-dimensional poly(l/d-lactic acid) (PLDLA) tubes. An in vitro study confirmed that neurites of dorsal root ganglion outgrew actively along the aligned CNT-PGFs and that the CNT interfacing significantly increased the maximal neurite length. Sixteen weeks after implantation of a CNT-PGF nerve conduit into the 10 mm gap of a transected rat sciatic nerve, the number of regenerating axons crossing the scaffold, the cross-sectional area of the re-innervated muscles and the electrophysiological findings were all significantly improved by the interfacing with CNTs. This first in vivo effect of using a CNT-interfaced scaffold in the regeneration process of a transected rat sciatic nerve strongly supports the potential use of CNT-interfaced PGFs at the interface between the nerve conduit and peripheral neural tissues.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Carbon nanotubes", "Peripheral nerve regeneration", "Phosphate glass fibers", "Scaffold", "Sciatic nerve"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Axons", "Female", "Ganglia, Spinal", "Glass", "Lactic Acid", "Nanotubes, Carbon", "Nerve Regeneration", "Neurites", "Polymers", "Rats", "Rats, Sprague-Dawley", "Sciatic Nerve", "Tissue Scaffolds"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84920647848", "SubjectAreas": [["Biotechnology", "BIOC", "1305"], ["Biomaterials", "MATE", "2502"], ["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"]], "AuthorData": {"55372605600": {"Name": "Ahn H.S.", "AuthorID": "55372605600", "AffiliationID": "60170569, 60002877", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Tissue Regeneration Engineering, Dankook University"}, "57212315836": {"Name": "Kim M.S.", "AuthorID": "57212315836", "AffiliationID": "60170569, 60002877", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Tissue Regeneration Engineering, Dankook University"}, "55979794300": {"Name": "Lee J.Y.", "AuthorID": "55979794300", "AffiliationID": "60170569, 60002877", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Tissue Regeneration Engineering, Dankook University"}, "14019927600": {"Name": "Kim J.W.", "AuthorID": "14019927600", "AffiliationID": "60170569, 60002877", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Tissue Regeneration Engineering, Dankook University"}, "57218260931": {"Name": "Kim H.S.", "AuthorID": "57218260931", "AffiliationID": "60170569, 60002877", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Tissue Regeneration Engineering, Dankook University"}, "26643634100": {"Name": "Knowles J.C.", "AuthorID": "26643634100", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60013985", "AffiliationName": "Division of Biomaterials and Tissue Engineering, Eastman Dental Institute, University College London"}, "56591525500": {"Name": "Kim H.W.", "AuthorID": "56591525500", "AffiliationID": "60170568, 60002877", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomaterial Science, School of Dentistry, Dankook University"}, "7202748992": {"Name": "Hyun J.K.", "AuthorID": "7202748992", "AffiliationID": "60002877", "AffiliationName": "Department of Rehabilitation Medicine, College of Medicine, Dankook University"}, "56465263000": {"Name": "Hwang J.Y.", "AuthorID": "56465263000", "AffiliationID": "60170569, 60002877", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Tissue Regeneration Engineering, Dankook University"}, "35727919300": {"Name": "Shin U.S.", "AuthorID": "35727919300", "AffiliationID": "60170569, 60002877", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Tissue Regeneration Engineering, Dankook University"}}}
