To date all identified disease-causing variants were unique to the studied families, except for c.1576dup. We have detected six novel ZEB1 mutations; c.1749_1750del; p.(Pro584*) and c.1717_1718del; p.(Val573Phefs*12) in two Czech families, c.1176dup; p.(Ala393Serfs*19), c.1100C>A; p.(Ser367*), c.627del; p.(Phe209Leufs*11) in three British families and a splice site mutation, c.685-2A>G, in a patient of Sri Lankan origin. An additional British proband had the c.1576dup; p.(Val526Glyfs*3) mutation previously reported in other populations. Clinical findings were variable and included bilateral congenital corneal opacity in one proband, development of opacity before the age of 2 years in another individual and bilateral iris flocculi in yet another subject. The majority of eyes examined by corneal topography (10 out of 16) had an abnormally steep cornea (flat keratometry 46.5-52.7 diopters, steep keratometry 48.1-54.0 diopters). One proband underwent surgery for cryptorchidism. Our study further demonstrates that PPCD3 can present as corneal edema in early childhood, and that an abnormally steep keratometry is a common feature of this condition. As cryptorchidism has been previously observed in two other PPCD3 cases, its association with the disease warrants further investigation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Phenotype", "Posterior polymorphous corneal dystrophy type 3", "ZEB1"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Child", "Codon, Nonsense", "Corneal Dystrophies, Hereditary", "DNA Mutational Analysis", "Female", "Frameshift Mutation", "Homeodomain Proteins", "Humans", "Male", "Pedigree", "Phenotype", "RNA Splice Sites", "Sequence Deletion", "Transcription Factors", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84919651066", "SubjectAreas": [["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Genetics (clinical)", "MEDI", "2716"]], "AuthorData": {"56457229300": {"Name": "Evans C.J.", "AuthorID": "56457229300", "AffiliationID": "60013148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "14119954300": {"Name": "Liskova P.", "AuthorID": "14119954300", "AffiliationID": "60039507, 60016605", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, First Faculty of Medicine, Charles University in Prague and General University Hospital in Prague"}, "57197636332": {"Name": "Hardcastle A.J.", "AuthorID": "57197636332", "AffiliationID": "60013148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "35315591900": {"Name": "Davidson A.E.", "AuthorID": "35315591900", "AffiliationID": "60013148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "7004454391": {"Name": "Tuft S.J.", "AuthorID": "7004454391", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "51763434300": {"Name": "Dudakova L.", "AuthorID": "51763434300", "AffiliationID": "60039507, 60016605", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of the Biology and Pathology of the Eye, Institute of Inherited Metabolic Disorders, First Faculty of Medicine, Charles University in Prague and General University Hospital in Prague"}, "12773057900": {"Name": "Jirsova K.", "AuthorID": "12773057900", "AffiliationID": "60039507, 60016605", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of the Biology and Pathology of the Eye, Institute of Inherited Metabolic Disorders, First Faculty of Medicine, Charles University in Prague and General University Hospital in Prague"}, "56459106800": {"Name": "Hrabcikova P.", "AuthorID": "56459106800", "AffiliationID": "60003367", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, Palacky University Olomouc"}, "35608324400": {"Name": "Horinek A.", "AuthorID": "35608324400", "AffiliationID": "60039507, 60016605", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Biology and Human Genetics, First Faculty of Medicine, Charles University in Prague and General University Hospital in Prague"}, "7004322480": {"Name": "Filipec M.", "AuthorID": "7004322480", "AffiliationID": "113092844", "AffiliationName": "Lexum European Eye Clinic"}}}
