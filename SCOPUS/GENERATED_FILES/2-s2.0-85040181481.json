In this study we present the adsorptive removal of carbamazepine from water in the metal-organic frameworks UiO-66 and UiO-67 in comparison with a commercial activated carbon F400. While UiO-66 was ineffective in removing carbamazepine, UiO-67 showed superior performance by removing 95% of carbamazepine from a 100 mg L-1 aqueous carbamazepine solution in just 2 min. In contrast, it took F400 more than an hour to remove 88% of the carbamazepine under the same conditions. We further show that UiO-67 can be regenerated repeatedly with no or negligible carbamazepine removal capacity loss, which demonstrates its potential as a durable and promising adsorbent that can be used for the removal of carbamazepine from water.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adsorptive removal", "Carbamazepine", "Commercial activated carbons", "Metal organic framework", "Removal capacity", "Surface and ground waters"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85040181481", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"], ["Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering", "ENGI", "2209"]], "AuthorData": {"57200206320": {"Name": "Akpinar I.", "AuthorID": "57200206320", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "14061497000": {"Name": "Yazaydin A.", "AuthorID": "14061497000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}}}
