CIT problems have their roots in combinatorics. Mathematicians have been concerned with the NP-complete problem of finding minimal covering arrays (in other words, minimal CIT test suites) since early nineties. With the adoption of these techniques into the area of software testing, an important gap has been identified - namely consideration of real-world constraints. We show that indeed finding an efficient way of handling constraints during search is the key factor in wider applicability of CIT techniques.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Cit tests", "Combinatorial interaction testing", "Combinatorics", "Covering arrays", "Handling constraints", "Key factors", "Real world constraints"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84946918543", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"]], "AuthorData": {"36615643200": {"Name": "Petke J.", "AuthorID": "36615643200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Research, Evolution, Search and Testing, University College London"}}}
