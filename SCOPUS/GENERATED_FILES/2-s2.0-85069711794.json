Materials and methods: After institutional ethical approval, this retrospective study analyzed 33 patients with 34 RCC masses (29 CC-RCC and five NC-RCC; 19 low-grade and 10 high-grade CC-RCC), who underwent MRI between January 2011 and December 2012 on a 1.5-T scanner (Avanto, Siemens, Erlangen, Germany). The MRI protocol included T2-weighted imaging (T2WI), diffusion-weighted imaging [DWI; at b 0, 500 and 1000 s/mm2 with apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps] and T1-weighted pre and postcontrast [corticomedullary (CM) and nephrographic (NG) phase] acquisition. MR texture analysis (MRTA) was performed using the TexRAD research software (Feedback Medical Ltd., Cambridge, UK) by a single reader who placed free-hand polygonal region of interest (ROI) on the slice showing the maximum viable tumor. Filtration histogram-based texture analysis was used to generate six first-order statistical parameters [mean intensity, standard deviation (SD), mean of positive pixels (MPP), entropy, skewness and kurtosis] at five spatial scaling factors (SSF) as well as on the unfiltered image. Mann\u2013Whitney test was used to compare the texture parameters of CC-RCC versus NC-RCC, and high-grade versus low-grade CC-RCC. P value < 0.05 was considered significant. A 3-step feature selection was used to obtain the best texture metrics for each MRI sequence and included the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis and Pearson\u2019s correlation test. Results: The best performing texture parameters in differentiating CC-RCC from NC-RCC for each sequence included (area under the curve in parentheses): entropy at SSF 4 (0.807) on T2WI, SD at SSF 4 (0.814) on DWI b500, SD at SSF 6 (0.879) on DWI b1000, mean at SSF 0 (0.848) on ADC, skewness at SSF 2 (0.854) on T1WI and skewness at SSF 3 (0.908) on CM phase. In differentiating high from low-grade CC-RCC, the best parameters were: entropy at SSF 6 (0.823) on DWI b1000, mean at SSF 3 (0.889) on CM phase and MPP at SSF 5 (0.870) on NG phase. Conclusion: Several MR texture parameters showed excellent diagnostic performance (AUC > 0.8) in differentiating CC-RCC from NC-RCC, and high-grade from low-grade CC-RCC. MRTA could serve as a useful non-invasive tool for this purpose.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Fuhrman grade", "Magnetic resonance imaging", "Radiomics", "Renal cell carcinoma", "Texture analysis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Carcinoma, Renal Cell", "Contrast Media", "Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Female", "Humans", "Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted", "Kidney Neoplasms", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Meglumine", "Middle Aged", "Neoplasm Grading", "Neoplasm Staging", "Organometallic Compounds", "Prognosis", "Retrospective Studies"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85069711794", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiological and Ultrasound Technology", "HEAL", "3614"], ["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"], ["Gastroenterology", "MEDI", "2715"], ["Urology", "MEDI", "2748"]], "AuthorData": {"8076362900": {"Name": "Goyal A.", "AuthorID": "8076362900", "AffiliationID": "60009790", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences"}, "56829329300": {"Name": "Razik A.", "AuthorID": "56829329300", "AffiliationID": "60009790", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences"}, "35722206000": {"Name": "Kandasamy D.", "AuthorID": "35722206000", "AffiliationID": "60009790", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences"}, "57196545589": {"Name": "Sharma R.", "AuthorID": "57196545589", "AffiliationID": "60009790", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences"}, "7103146511": {"Name": "Seth A.", "AuthorID": "7103146511", "AffiliationID": "60009790", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences"}, "8719769800": {"Name": "Das P.", "AuthorID": "8719769800", "AffiliationID": "60009790", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences"}, "8556612100": {"Name": "Ganeshan B.", "AuthorID": "8556612100", "AffiliationID": "60090043, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Nuclear Medicine, University College London"}}}
