Joint Hypermobility Syndrome (JHS) is a connective tissue disorder that often runs in families and may present with a complex array of signs and symptoms. JHS is under-recognised and often poorly managed by the medical and physiotherapy professions. OBJECTIVES: The primary aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of GJH and JHS in patients attending a Musculoskeletal Triage Clinic. Secondary aims of this study were to explore the health-related quality of life, pain levels, primary pain area and number of painful joints in patients with and without JHS. METHOD: A cross-sectional study design was used. The participant population included a convenience sample from patients attending a Musculoskeletal Triage Clinic based in a Primary Care setting in London. The main outcome tools were the Beighton Score, Brighton Criteria, the EQ-5D-5 L and the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). RESULTS: A total of 150 participants were recruited into the study. GJH was recorded in 19% of participants and JHS was recorded in 30% of participants. Participants with JHS reported a greater number of painful joints (p < 0.05) than those without. No difference was found in the EQ-5D-5 L and the global VAS scores between the group with JHS and the group without. Participants with JHS (p < 0.01) were found to be more likely to present with wrist/hand pain as their main problem compared to those without JHS. CONCLUSIONS: This study found GJH in 19% and JHS in 30% of participants attending a Musculoskeletal Triage Clinic. This study also found that patients with JHS are likely to present with a greater number of painful joints and are more likely to present with wrist/hand pain as their main problem than those without JHS.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Hypermobility", "Joint Hypermobility Syndrome", "Musculoskeletal Triage Clinics", "prevalence"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84914104353", "SubjectAreas": [["Physical Therapy, Sports Therapy and Rehabilitation", "HEAL", "3612"], ["Rehabilitation", "MEDI", "2742"], ["Occupational Therapy", "HEAL", "3609"]], "AuthorData": {"56436024300": {"Name": "Connelly E.", "AuthorID": "56436024300", "AffiliationID": "60025980", "AffiliationName": "Therapy Centre, West Middlesex University Hospital"}, "7101870169": {"Name": "Hakim A.", "AuthorID": "7101870169", "AffiliationID": "60020849, 60159931", "AffiliationName": "Whipps Cross Hospital, Barts Health NHS Trust"}, "56435808900": {"Name": "Davenport S.", "AuthorID": "56435808900", "AffiliationID": "60032760", "AffiliationName": "University of Hertfordshire"}, "20434379700": {"Name": "Simmonds J.", "AuthorID": "20434379700", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Child Health, University College London"}}}
