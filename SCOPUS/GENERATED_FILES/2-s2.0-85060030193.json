However, there are limitations to the techniques used, including the small number of donors available, samples often representing uncommon cases, and impossibility of follow-up. Correlative studies have demonstrated that MRI is sensitive to the different pathological substrates of multiple sclerosis (inflammation, demyelination, and neuro-axonal loss). The role of MRI in evaluating other pathological processes, such as leptomeningeal involvement, central vein and rim of lesions, microstructural abnormalities, iron accumulation, and recovery mechanisms, has been investigated. Although techniques used for quantifying pathological processes in different regions of the CNS have advanced diagnosis and monitoring of disease course and treatment of multiple sclerosis, new perspectives and questions have emerged, including how different pathological processes interact over the disease course and when remyelination might occur. Addressing these questions will require longitudinal studies using MRI in large cohorts of patients with different phenotypes.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Brain", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Multiple Sclerosis", "Neuroimaging", "Spinal Cord"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85060030193", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"7202268530": {"Name": "Filippi M.", "AuthorID": "7202268530", "AffiliationID": "60009622, 60082964", "AffiliationName": "Neuroimaging Research Unit and Department of Neurology, Institute of Experimental Neurology, Division of Neuroscience, San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Vita-Salute San Raffaele University"}, "34973365100": {"Name": "Rocca M.A.", "AuthorID": "34973365100", "AffiliationID": "60009622, 60082964", "AffiliationName": "Neuroimaging Research Unit and Department of Neurology, Institute of Experimental Neurology, Division of Neuroscience, San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Vita-Salute San Raffaele University"}, "7007154204": {"Name": "Br\u00fcck W.", "AuthorID": "7007154204", "AffiliationID": "60021110", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neuropathology, University Medical Center"}, "54784420800": {"Name": "Hametner S.", "AuthorID": "54784420800", "AffiliationID": "60021110", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neuropathology, University Medical Center"}, "6506754661": {"Name": "Preziosa P.", "AuthorID": "6506754661", "AffiliationID": "60021110", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neuropathology, University Medical Center"}, "6603989032": {"Name": "Stadelmann C.", "AuthorID": "6603989032", "AffiliationID": "60021110", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neuropathology, University Medical Center"}, "7004057758": {"Name": "Chard D.", "AuthorID": "7004057758", "AffiliationID": "60024544, 60172638", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health Research, University College London Hospitals Biomedical Research Centre"}, "7102945505": {"Name": "Fazekas F.", "AuthorID": "7102945505", "AffiliationID": "60006224", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Medical University of Graz"}, "6602781849": {"Name": "Enzinger C.", "AuthorID": "6602781849", "AffiliationID": "60006224", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Medical University of Graz"}, "26643174700": {"Name": "Geurts J.J.G.", "AuthorID": "26643174700", "AffiliationID": "60001157, 60002483, 60001997", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anatomy and Neurosciences, MS Center Amsterdam, Neuroscience Amsterdam, Amsterdam University Medical Centers"}, "7006688141": {"Name": "Kuhlmann T.", "AuthorID": "7006688141", "AffiliationID": "60006490", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neuropathology, University Hospital M\u00fcnster"}, "7102462625": {"Name": "Rovira \u00c0.", "AuthorID": "7102462625", "AffiliationID": "60012486, 60023020", "AffiliationName": "Section of Neuroradiology and MRI Unit, Department of Radiology, Hospital Universitari Vall d'Hebron, Universitat Aut\u00f2noma de Barcelona"}, "8711451500": {"Name": "Schmierer K.", "AuthorID": "8711451500", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "The Blizard Institute (Neuroscience), Barts and The London School of Medicine & Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London"}, "null": {"Name": null, "AuthorID": null, "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
