In addition, it compares the trait EI scores of their offspring (N = 81; Mage = 11.71; SDage = 2.15; 51 boys and 30 girls). Results showed that parents with drug addiction exhibited lower levels of trait EI and poorer general health than peers. In addition, global trait EI and two of its subscales, Well-being and Emotionality, had stronger correlations with depression in the addiction than in the comparison group. Well-being was a significant predictor of general health and its subscales (Somatic symptoms, Anxiety/insomnia, Social dysfunction, and severe depression) in both groups. No differences were found between the offspring of the two groups.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Addiction", "Children of parents with drug addiction", "Mental health", "Substance abuse", "TEIQue"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85053052158", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychology (all)", "PSYC", "3200"]], "AuthorData": {"57203817370": {"Name": "Aslanidou G.", "AuthorID": "57203817370", "AffiliationID": "60015331", "AffiliationName": "Aristotle University of Thessaloniki"}, "7801336441": {"Name": "Stogiannidou A.", "AuthorID": "7801336441", "AffiliationID": "60015331", "AffiliationName": "Aristotle University of Thessaloniki"}, "6603597461": {"Name": "Petrides K.", "AuthorID": "6603597461", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
