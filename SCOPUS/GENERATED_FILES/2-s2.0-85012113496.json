Here we have replicated our previous findings demonstrating reduced expression of nuclear-encoded oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) subunits and subunits required for the translation of mitochondrial-encoded OXPHOS genes in blood from people with Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment. Interestingly this was accompanied by increased expression of some mitochondrial-encoded OXPHOS genes, namely those residing closest to the transcription start site of the polycistronic heavy chain mitochondrial transcript (MT-ND1, MT-ND2, MT-ATP6, MT-CO1, MT-CO2, MT-C03) and MT-ND6 transcribed from the light chain. Further we show that mitochondrial DNA copy number was unchanged suggesting no change in steady-state numbers of mitochondria. We suggest that an imbalance in nuclear and mitochondrial genome-encoded OXPHOS transcripts may drive a negative feedback loop reducing mitochondrial translation and compromising OXPHOS efficiency, which is likely to generate damaging reactive oxygen species.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alzheimer's disease (AD)", "Biomarker", "Blood", "Gene expression", "Mild cognitive impairment (MCI)", "Mitochondria", "Oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS)"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Alzheimer Disease", "Biomarkers", "Cognitive Dysfunction", "Female", "Gene Expression", "Genes, Mitochondrial", "Humans", "Male", "Mitochondria", "Oxidative Phosphorylation", "Reactive Oxygen Species", "Transcription, Genetic"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85012113496", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Aging", "BIOC", "1302"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Developmental Biology", "BIOC", "1309"], ["Geriatrics and Gerontology", "MEDI", "2717"]], "AuthorData": {"8854048100": {"Name": "Lunnon K.", "AuthorID": "8854048100", "AffiliationID": "60111707, 60026479", "AffiliationName": "University of Exeter Medical School, University of Exeter"}, "15733082600": {"Name": "Keohane A.", "AuthorID": "15733082600", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London"}, "35218215500": {"Name": "Pidsley R.", "AuthorID": "35218215500", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London"}, "8931613700": {"Name": "Newhouse S.", "AuthorID": "8931613700", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London"}, "6504179243": {"Name": "Riddoch-Contreras J.", "AuthorID": "6504179243", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London"}, "7003409002": {"Name": "Schalkwyk L.", "AuthorID": "7003409002", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London"}, "8931612400": {"Name": "Dobson R.", "AuthorID": "8931612400", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London"}, "7403541196": {"Name": "Powell J.", "AuthorID": "7403541196", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London"}, "7005575001": {"Name": "Lovestone S.", "AuthorID": "7005575001", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London"}, "7004828085": {"Name": "Hodges A.", "AuthorID": "7004828085", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London"}, "56461245700": {"Name": "Devall M.", "AuthorID": "56461245700", "AffiliationID": "60111707, 60026479", "AffiliationName": "University of Exeter Medical School, University of Exeter"}, "57193266718": {"Name": "Thubron E.B.", "AuthorID": "57193266718", "AffiliationID": "60177635", "AffiliationName": "Diabetes Research Group, Faculty of Life Sciences and Medicine, King's College London"}, "7402152949": {"Name": "Malik A.N.", "AuthorID": "7402152949", "AffiliationID": "60177635", "AffiliationName": "Diabetes Research Group, Faculty of Life Sciences and Medicine, King's College London"}, "57192384661": {"Name": "Soininen H.", "AuthorID": "57192384661", "AffiliationID": "60103673, 60024252", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, University of Eastern Finland and Kuopio University Hospital"}, "6701675936": {"Name": "K\u0142oszewska I.", "AuthorID": "6701675936", "AffiliationID": "60006651", "AffiliationName": "Medical University of Lodz"}, "7006313835": {"Name": "Mecocci P.", "AuthorID": "7006313835", "AffiliationID": "60003003, 60016041", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Gerontology and Geriatrics, University of Perugia"}, "7004174854": {"Name": "Tsolaki M.", "AuthorID": "7004174854", "AffiliationID": "60015331", "AffiliationName": "3rd Department of Neurology, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki"}, "35241026200": {"Name": "Vellas B.", "AuthorID": "35241026200", "AffiliationID": "60102124, 60000905", "AffiliationName": "INSERM U 558, University of Toulouse"}}}
