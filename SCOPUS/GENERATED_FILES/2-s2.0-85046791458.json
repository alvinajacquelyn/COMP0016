All rights reserved.Background: Preliminary studies have indicated that training staff in Positive Behaviour Support (PBS) may help to reduce challenging behaviour among people with intellectual disability (ID). Objective: To evaluate whether or not such training is clinically effective in reducing challenging behaviour in routine care. The study also included longer-term follow-up (approximately 36 months). Design: A multicentre, single-blind, two-arm, parallel-cluster randomised controlled trial. The unit of randomisation was the community ID service using an independent web-based randomisation system and random permuted blocks on a 1: 1 allocation stratified by a staff-to-patient ratio for each cluster. Setting: Community ID services in England. Participants: Adults (aged > 18 years) across the range of ID with challenging behaviour [\u2265 15 Aberrant Behaviour Checklist - Community total score (ABC-CT)]. Interventions: Manual-assisted face-to-face PBS training to therapists and treatment as usual (TAU) compared with TAU only in the control arm. Main outcome measures: Carer-reported changes in challenging behaviour as measured by the ABC-CT over 12 months. Secondary outcomes included psychopathology, community participation, family and paid carer burden, family carer psychopathology, costs of care and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Data on main outcome, service use and health-related quality of life were collected for the 36-month follow-up. Results: A total of 246 participants were recruited from 23 teams, of whom 109 were in the intervention arm (11 teams) and 137 were in the control arm (12 teams). The difference in ABC-CT between the intervention and control arms [mean difference -2.14, 95% confidence interval (CI) -8.79 to 4.51; p = 0.528] was not statistically significant. No treatment effects were found for any of the secondary outcomes. The mean cost per participant in the intervention arm was \u00a31201. Over 12 months, there was a difference in QALYs of 0.076 in favour of the intervention (95% CI 0.011 to 0.140 QALYs) and a 60% chance that the intervention is cost-effective compared with TAU from a health and social care cost perspective at the threshold of \u00a320,000 per QALY gained. Twenty-nine participants experienced 45 serious adverse events (intervention arm, n = 19; control arm, n = 26). PBS plans were available for 33 participants. An independent assessment of the quality of these plans found that all were less than optimal. Forty-six qualitative interviews were conducted with service users, family carers, paid carers and service managers as part of the process evaluation. Service users reported that they had learned to manage difficult situations and had gained new skills, and carers reported a positive relationship with therapists. At 36 months\u2019 follow-up (n = 184), the mean ABC-CT difference between arms was not significant (-3.70, 95% CI -9.25 to 1.85; p = 0.191). The initial cost-effectiveness of the intervention dissipated over time. Limitations: The main limitations were low treatment fidelity and reach of the intervention. Conclusions: Findings from the main study and the naturalistic follow-up suggest that staff training in PBS as delivered in this study is insufficient to achieve significant clinical gains beyond TAU in community ID services. Although there is an indication that training in PBS is potentially cost-effective, this is not maintained in the longer term. There is increased scope to develop new approaches to challenging behaviour as well as optimising the delivery of PBS in routine clinical practice.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Antipsychotic Agents", "Behavior", "Caregivers", "Cost-Benefit Analysis", "England", "Female", "Health Expenditures", "Health Personnel", "Humans", "Inservice Training", "Intellectual Disability", "Male", "Mental Health", "Middle Aged", "Quality of Life", "Quality-Adjusted Life Years", "Severity of Illness Index", "Single-Blind Method", "State Medicine"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85046791458", "SubjectAreas": [["Health Policy", "MEDI", "2719"]], "AuthorData": {"6701753786": {"Name": "Hassiotis A.", "AuthorID": "6701753786", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, University College London"}, "15052270500": {"Name": "Poppe M.", "AuthorID": "15052270500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, University College London"}, "56079439400": {"Name": "Strydom A.", "AuthorID": "56079439400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, University College London"}, "55576291300": {"Name": "Vickerstaff V.", "AuthorID": "55576291300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, University College London"}, "56591241100": {"Name": "King M.", "AuthorID": "56591241100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, University College London"}, "55821043700": {"Name": "Ratti V.", "AuthorID": "55821043700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, University College London"}, "13605005900": {"Name": "Hall I.", "AuthorID": "13605005900", "AffiliationID": "100316826", "AffiliationName": "Tower Hamlets Community Learning Disability Service, Mile End Hospital"}, "55555749400": {"Name": "Crabtree J.", "AuthorID": "55555749400", "AffiliationID": "100316826", "AffiliationName": "Tower Hamlets Community Learning Disability Service, Mile End Hospital"}, "7005718930": {"Name": "Omar R.", "AuthorID": "7005718930", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Statistical Science, University College London"}, "55541432300": {"Name": "Hunter R.", "AuthorID": "55541432300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London PRIMENT Clinical Trials Unit"}, "57194185191": {"Name": "Bosco A.", "AuthorID": "57194185191", "AffiliationID": "60015138, 60172395", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Mental Health, University of Nottingham"}, "7202059682": {"Name": "Biswas A.", "AuthorID": "7202059682", "AffiliationID": "60171752", "AffiliationName": "Leicestershire Partnership NHS Trust, Frith Hospital"}, "56151149200": {"Name": "Blickwedel J.", "AuthorID": "56151149200", "AffiliationID": "60000064, 60022020", "AffiliationName": "Warwick Medical School, University of Warwick"}, "12772931600": {"Name": "Cooper V.", "AuthorID": "12772931600", "AffiliationID": "60160436", "AffiliationName": "Challenging Behaviour Foundation"}, "55952113100": {"Name": "Howie W.", "AuthorID": "55952113100", "AffiliationID": "60011277", "AffiliationName": "South West London and St George\u2019s Mental Health Trust, Wandsworth Community Mental Health Learning Disabilities Team, Springfield University Hospital"}, "57203219698": {"Name": "Crawford M.", "AuthorID": "57203219698", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Mental Health, Department of Medicine, Imperial College London"}}}
