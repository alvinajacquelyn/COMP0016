Regulatory T (Treg) cells can use CTLA-4 to elicit suppression; however, CTLA-4 also operates in conventional T cells, reputedly by triggering inhibitory signals. Recently, interactions mediated via the CTLA-4 cytoplasmic domain have been shown to preferentially affect Treg cells, yet other evidence suggests that the extracellular domain of CTLA-4 is sufficient to elicit suppression. Here, we discuss these paradoxical findings in the context of CTLA-4-mediated ligand regulation. We propose that the function of CTLA-4 cytoplasmic domain is not to transmit inhibitory signals but to precisely control the turnover, cellular location, and membrane delivery of CTLA-4 to facilitate its central function: regulating the access of CD28 to their shared ligands.", "AuthorKeywords": ["CD28", "Costimulation", "CTLA-4", "T cell activation", "T cell tolerance"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Antigen-Presenting Cells", "Cell Movement", "CTLA-4 Antigen", "Down-Regulation", "Humans", "Ligands", "Protein Binding", "Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs", "Protein Transport", "Signal Transduction", "T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84961289524", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"]], "AuthorData": {"7402359366": {"Name": "Walker L.", "AuthorID": "7402359366", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Immunity and Transplantation, University College London Division of Infection and Immunity"}, "7005289543": {"Name": "Sansom D.", "AuthorID": "7005289543", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Immunity and Transplantation, University College London Division of Infection and Immunity"}}}
