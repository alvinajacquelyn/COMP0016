Published under the terms of the CC BY 4.0 licenseDespite recently uncovered connections between autophagy and the endocytic pathway, the role of autophagy in regulating endosomal function remains incompletely understood. Here, we find that the ablation of autophagy-essential players disrupts EGF-induced endocytic trafficking of EGFR. Cells lacking ATG7 or ATG16L1 exhibit increased levels of phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PI(3)P), a key determinant of early endosome maturation. Increased PI(3)P levels are associated with an accumulation of EEA1-positive endosomes where EGFR trafficking is stalled. Aberrant early endosomes are recognised by the autophagy machinery in a TBK1- and Gal8-dependent manner and are delivered to LAMP2-positive lysosomes. Preventing this homeostatic regulation of early endosomes by autophagy reduces EGFR recycling to the plasma membrane and compromises downstream signalling and cell survival. Our findings uncover a novel role for the autophagy machinery in maintaining early endosome function and growth factor sensing.", "AuthorKeywords": ["autophagy", "early endosomes", "EGFR", "galectin", "signalling"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Autophagy", "Cell Line", "Cell Survival", "Endocytosis", "Endosomes", "Epidermal Growth Factor", "ErbB Receptors", "Galectins", "Humans", "Mice", "Monensin", "Phosphatidylinositol Phosphates", "Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases", "rab GTP-Binding Proteins", "Signal Transduction"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85071102168", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"]], "AuthorData": {"57190227194": {"Name": "Fraser J.", "AuthorID": "57190227194", "AffiliationID": "60027272, 60012754", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Research UK Edinburgh Centre, Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine, University of Edinburgh"}, "57200014781": {"Name": "Simpson J.", "AuthorID": "57200014781", "AffiliationID": "60027272, 60012754", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Research UK Edinburgh Centre, Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine, University of Edinburgh"}, "57195481336": {"Name": "Fontana R.", "AuthorID": "57195481336", "AffiliationID": "60027272, 60012754", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Research UK Edinburgh Centre, Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine, University of Edinburgh"}, "8695882700": {"Name": "Gammoh N.", "AuthorID": "8695882700", "AffiliationID": "60027272, 60012754", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Research UK Edinburgh Centre, Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine, University of Edinburgh"}, "55221816600": {"Name": "Kishi-Itakura C.", "AuthorID": "55221816600", "AffiliationID": "60000661", "AffiliationName": "Signalling Programme, Babraham Institute"}, "7003359642": {"Name": "Ktistakis N.T.", "AuthorID": "7003359642", "AffiliationID": "60000661", "AffiliationName": "Signalling Programme, Babraham Institute"}}}
