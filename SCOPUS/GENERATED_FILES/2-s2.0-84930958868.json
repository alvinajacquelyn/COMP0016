Previous studies have shown that the movement of water molecules has a significant effect on the properties of clathrate hydrates. In this Article, a method is presented to incorporate the effect of water movement with as much rigor as possible. This method is then used to calculate the Langmuir constant of the guest species in a clathrate hydrate. Unlike previous studies on modeling of clathrate hydrate thermodynamics, the method presented in this paper does not regress either the intermolecular potentials or the properties of the empty hydrate from clathrate phase equilibria data. Also the properties of empty hydrate used in the theory do not depend on the nature and composition of the guest molecules. The predicted phase equilibria from the resulting theory are shown to be highly accurate and thermodynamically consistent by comparing them with the phase equilibria computed directly from molecular simulations.
