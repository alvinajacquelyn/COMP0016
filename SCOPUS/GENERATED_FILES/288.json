However, it is not trivial to generate subcategories of high quality, due to the difficulty in measuring the similarity between positive instances. In this letter we propose a new weakly supervised clustering method to achieve better sub-categorization. Our method provides a more precise measurement of the similarity by aligning the positive instances through latent variables and filtering the aligned features. As a better alternative to the initialization step of the latent-SVM algorithm for the learning of the multi-component models, our method can lead to a superior performance gain for object detection. We demonstrate this on various real-world datasets.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Latent-SVM", "multi-component models", "object detection", "subcategory clustering"], "IndexKeywords": ["Feature alignment", "Latent-SVM", "Multicomponent model", "Object Detection", "subcategory clustering"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84907545992", "SubjectAreas": [["Signal Processing", "COMP", "1711"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"50361846000": {"Name": "Ruan Z.", "AuthorID": "50361846000", "AffiliationID": "60025278", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University"}, "7407146835": {"Name": "Wang G.", "AuthorID": "7407146835", "AffiliationID": "60025278", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University"}, "7404513280": {"Name": "Lin X.", "AuthorID": "7404513280", "AffiliationID": "60025278", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University"}, "7202881908": {"Name": "Xue J.", "AuthorID": "7202881908", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Statistical Science, University College London"}}}
