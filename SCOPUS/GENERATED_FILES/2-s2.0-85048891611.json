Solar type III radio bursts contain a wealth of information about the dynamics of electron beams in the solar corona and the inner heliosphere; this information is currently unobtainable through other means. However, the motion of different regions of an electron beam (front, middle, and back) have never been systematically analysed before. Aims. We characterise the type III burst frequency-time evolution using the enhanced resolution of LOFAR (LOw Frequency ARray) in the frequency range 30-70 MHz and use this to probe electron beam dynamics. Methods. The rise, peak, and decay times with a ~0.2 MHz spectral resolution were defined for a collection of 31 type III bursts. The frequency evolution was used to ascertain the apparent velocities of the front, middle, and back of the type III sources, and the trends were interpreted using theoretical and numerical treatments. Results. The type III time profile was better approximated by an asymmetric Gaussian profile and not an exponential, as was used previously. Rise and decay times increased with decreasing frequency and showed a strong correlation. Durations were shorter than previously observed. Drift rates from the rise times were faster than from the decay times, corresponding to inferred mean electron beam speeds for the front, middle, and back of 0.2, 0.17, 0.15 c, respectively. Faster beam speeds correlate with shorter type III durations. We also find that the type III frequency bandwidth decreases as frequency decreases. Conclusions. The different speeds naturally explain the elongation of an electron beam in space as it propagates through the heliosphere. The expansion rate is proportional to the mean speed of the exciter; faster beams expand faster. Beam speeds are attributed to varying ensembles of electron energies at the front, middle, and back of the beam.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Solar wind", "Sun: corona", "Sun: flares", "Sun: particle emission", "Sun: radio radiation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Electron beam dynamics", "Electron beam transport", "Enhanced resolutions", "Sun : corona", "Sun: flares", "Sun: particle emissions", "Sun: radio radiation", "Wealth of information"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85048891611", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"26435468500": {"Name": "Reid H.", "AuthorID": "26435468500", "AffiliationID": "60001490", "AffiliationName": "SUPA School of Physics and Astronomy, University of Glasgow"}, "7003423386": {"Name": "Kontar E.", "AuthorID": "7003423386", "AffiliationID": "60001490", "AffiliationName": "SUPA School of Physics and Astronomy, University of Glasgow"}}}
