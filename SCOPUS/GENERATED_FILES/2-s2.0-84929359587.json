An in vivo porcine model was developed to optimise the magnetic technique by evaluating the effect of differing volume, concentration and time of injection of magnetic tracer. A total of 60 sentinel node procedures were undertaken. There was a significant correlation between magnetometer counts and iron content of excised sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) (r = 0.82; P<. 0.001). Total number of SLNs increased with increasing volumes of magnetic tracer (P<. 0.001). Transcutaneous magnetometer counts increased with increasing time from injection of magnetic tracer (P<. 0.0001), plateauing within 60. min. Increasing concentration resulted in higher iron content of SLNs (P = 0.006). Increasing magnetic tracer volume and injecting prior to surgery improve transcutaneous 'hotspot' identification but very high volumes, increase the number of nodes excised. From the Clinical Editor: Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is the standard of care for axillary staging of breast cancer patients. Although the current gold standard technique is the combined injection of technetium-labelled nanocolloid and blue dye into the breast, the magnetic technique, using superparamagnetic carboxydextran-coated iron oxide (SPIO), has also been demonstrated as a feasible alternative. In this article, the authors set up to study factors in order to optimize the magnetic tracers.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Magnetic tracer", "Sentinel lymph node biopsy", "Sentinel lymph node biopsy", "SLNB: magnetic technique", "SPIO", "Superparamagnetic iron oxide"], "IndexKeywords": ["Magnetic techniques", "Magnetic tracers", "Sentinel lymph node biopsies", "SPIO", "Superparamagnetic iron oxides", "Animals", "Contrast Media", "Magnetic Fields", "Magnetometry", "Models, Biological", "Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy", "Swine"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84929359587", "SubjectAreas": [["Bioengineering", "CENG", "1502"], ["Medicine (miscellaneous)", "MEDI", "2701"], ["Molecular Medicine", "BIOC", "1313"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Pharmaceutical Science", "PHAR", "3003"]], "AuthorData": {"57220821601": {"Name": "Ahmed M.", "AuthorID": "57220821601", "AffiliationID": "60009797, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "Research Oncology, Division of Cancer Studies, King's College London, Guy's Hospital"}, "55425855800": {"Name": "Anninga B.", "AuthorID": "55425855800", "AffiliationID": "60009797, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "Research Oncology, Division of Cancer Studies, King's College London, Guy's Hospital"}, "56644323000": {"Name": "Peek M.", "AuthorID": "56644323000", "AffiliationID": "60020599", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Biomedical Technology and Technical Medicine, Universiteit Twente"}, "7005904555": {"Name": "Pinder S.", "AuthorID": "7005904555", "AffiliationID": "60009797, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "Research Oncology, Division of Cancer Studies, King's College London, Guy's Hospital"}, "8415555100": {"Name": "Douek M.", "AuthorID": "8415555100", "AffiliationID": "60009797, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "Research Oncology, Division of Cancer Studies, King's College London, Guy's Hospital"}, "25932351400": {"Name": "Van Hemelrijck M.", "AuthorID": "25932351400", "AffiliationID": "60009797, 60177635", "AffiliationName": "King's College London, School of Medicine, Cancer Epidemiology Group, Guy's Hospital"}, "36476637700": {"Name": "Pouw J.J.", "AuthorID": "36476637700", "AffiliationID": "60020599", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Biomedical Technology and Technical Medicine, Universiteit Twente"}, "56644971600": {"Name": "Vreemann S.", "AuthorID": "56644971600", "AffiliationID": "60020599", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Biomedical Technology and Technical Medicine, Universiteit Twente"}, "7005647335": {"Name": "ten Haken B.", "AuthorID": "7005647335", "AffiliationID": "60020599", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Biomedical Technology and Technical Medicine, Universiteit Twente"}, "7006435054": {"Name": "Pankhurst Q.", "AuthorID": "7006435054", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}}}
