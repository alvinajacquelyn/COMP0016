Downloading of the abstract is permitted for personal use only.Catheter-based Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) devices allow real-time and comprehensive imaging of the human esophagus. Hence, they provide the potential to overcome some of the limitations of endoscopy and biopsy, allowing earlier diagnosis and better prognosis for esophageal adenocarcinoma patients. However, the large number of images produced during every scan makes manual evaluation of the data exceedingly difficult. In this study, we propose a fully automated tissue characterization algorithm, capable of discriminating normal tissue from Barrett's Esophagus (BE) and dysplasia through entire three-dimensional (3D) data sets, acquired in vivo. The method is based on both the estimation of the scatterer size of the esophageal epithelial cells, using the bandwidth of the correlation of the derivative (COD) method, as well as intensity-based characteristics. The COD method can effectively estimate the scatterer size of the esophageal epithelium cells in good agreement with the literature. As expected, both the mean scatterer size and its standard deviation increase with increasing severity of disease (i.e. from normal to BE to dysplasia). The differences in the distribution of scatterer size for each tissue type are statistically significant, with a p value of < 0.0001. However, the scatterer size by itself cannot be used to accurately classify the various tissues. With the addition of intensity-based statistics the correct classification rates for all three tissue types range from 83 to 100% depending on the lesion size.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Classification", "Esophagus", "Intensity-based Statistics", "Optical Coherence Tomography", "Scatterer Size"], "IndexKeywords": ["Automated detection", "Barrett's esophagus", "Classification rates", "Epithelium cells", "Esophageal epithelial cells", "Esophagus", "Scatterer size", "Threedimensional (3-d)"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85045630411", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Biomaterials", "MATE", "2502"], ["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"], ["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"56048332600": {"Name": "Kassinopoulos M.", "AuthorID": "56048332600", "AffiliationID": "60071343", "AffiliationName": "KIOS Research Center for Intelligent System and Networks, Dept. of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Cyprus"}, "7004478466": {"Name": "Pitris C.", "AuthorID": "7004478466", "AffiliationID": "60071343", "AffiliationName": "KIOS Research Center for Intelligent System and Networks, Dept. of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Cyprus"}, "57202762172": {"Name": "Dong J.", "AuthorID": "57202762172", "AffiliationID": "60029929, 60002746", "AffiliationName": "Wellman Center for Photomedicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School"}, "7006907866": {"Name": "Tearney G.", "AuthorID": "7006907866", "AffiliationID": "60029929, 60002746", "AffiliationName": "Wellman Center for Photomedicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School"}}}
