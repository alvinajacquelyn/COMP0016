Positive cores were classified by cancer definitions: (1) any-cancer; (2) definition-1 [\u2265Gleason 4 + 3 or \u2265 6 mm cancer core length (CCL)] [high risk significant]; and (3) definition-2 (\u2265Gleason 3 + 4 or \u2265 4 mm CCL) cancer [intermediate\u2013high risk significant]. For each, logistic-regression mp-MRI models were derived from the training cohort and validated internally and with the temporal cohort. Sensitivity/specificity and the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC-AUC) curve were calculated. LR model performance was compared to radiologists\u2019 performance.Results: Twenty-eight of 70 patients from the training cohort, and 25/85 patients from the temporal validation cohort had significant cancer on TPM. The ROC-AUC of the LR model for classification of cancer was 0.73/0.67 at internal/temporal validation. The radiologist A/B ROC-AUC was 0.65/0.74 (temporal cohort). For patients scored by radiologists as Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (Pi-RADS) score 3, sensitivity/specificity of radiologist A \u2018best guess\u2019 and LR model was 0.14/0.54 and 0.71/0.61, respectively; and radiologist B \u2018best guess\u2019 and LR model was 0.40/0.34 and 0.50/0.76, respectively.Conclusions: LR models can improve classification of Pi-RADS score 3 lesions similar to experienced radiologists.Key Points: \u2022 MRI helps find prostate cancer in the anterior of the gland\u2022 Logistic regression models based on mp-MRI can classify prostate cancer\u2022 Computers can help confirm cancer in areas doctors are uncertain about", "AuthorKeywords": ["Diagnosis, computer assisted", "Logistic models", "Magnetic resonance imaging", "Prostatic neoplasms"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Biopsy", "Diagnosis, Differential", "Humans", "Logistic Models", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Prostate", "Prostatic Neoplasms", "Reproducibility of Results", "ROC Curve"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84920833453", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"15076612600": {"Name": "Dikaios N.", "AuthorID": "15076612600", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Radiology, University College London Hospital"}, "55912741400": {"Name": "Alkalbani J.", "AuthorID": "55912741400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Imaging, University College London"}, "57197258948": {"Name": "Sidhu H.S.", "AuthorID": "57197258948", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Imaging, University College London"}, "56477967700": {"Name": "Fujiwara T.", "AuthorID": "56477967700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Imaging, University College London"}, "55642708000": {"Name": "Halligan S.", "AuthorID": "55642708000", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Radiology, University College London Hospital"}, "57203543924": {"Name": "Taylor S.", "AuthorID": "57203543924", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Radiology, University College London Hospital"}, "7202372276": {"Name": "Atkinson D.", "AuthorID": "7202372276", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Radiology, University College London Hospital"}, "17036141700": {"Name": "Punwani S.", "AuthorID": "17036141700", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Radiology, University College London Hospital"}, "15053220400": {"Name": "Kirkham A.", "AuthorID": "15053220400", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Radiology, University College London Hospital"}, "7402266611": {"Name": "Allen C.", "AuthorID": "7402266611", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Radiology, University College London Hospital"}, "55556214500": {"Name": "Abd-Alazeez M.", "AuthorID": "55556214500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Urology, University College London"}, "8147855500": {"Name": "Ahmed H.", "AuthorID": "8147855500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Urology, University College London"}, "7004667094": {"Name": "Emberton M.", "AuthorID": "7004667094", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Urology, University College London"}, "8972541300": {"Name": "Freeman A.", "AuthorID": "8972541300", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Histopathology, University College London Hospital"}}}
