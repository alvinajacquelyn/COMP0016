At the same time, people regularly get confused between the two terms usability and user experience because they are strongly related to each other. In this paper, we first present a collection of usability and user experience definitions from previous studies. Then we provide a survey of different viewpoints about the interrelated relationship between them with the aim to answer the following questions: 'Is User Experience part of Usability satisfaction?' or 'Is Usability a part of User Experience?'", "AuthorKeywords": ["(User Experience", "component", "Difference", "Relation)", "Usability", "UX"], "IndexKeywords": ["component", "Difference", "Relation)", "Usability", "User experience"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85047390987", "SubjectAreas": [["Artificial Intelligence", "COMP", "1702"], ["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"], ["Information Systems", "COMP", "1710"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"], ["Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality", "ENGI", "2213"], ["Control and Optimization", "MATH", "2606"]], "AuthorData": {"56602301900": {"Name": "Hassan H.", "AuthorID": "56602301900", "AffiliationID": "60010294", "AffiliationName": "Information Systems Dept., Faculty of Computers and, Information, Cairo University"}, "14051997800": {"Name": "Galal-Edeen G.", "AuthorID": "14051997800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
