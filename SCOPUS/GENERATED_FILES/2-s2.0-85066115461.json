Methods: One hundred and thirty-six patients (101 with AIS, and 35 with TIA) were included. Acute-phase serum neurofilament light chain (sNfL) was analyzed with a novel ultrasensitive single molecule array (Simoa). Cerebral infarction volume was measured from brain computed tomography in the subacute phase (>2 days). Stroke aetiology was defined by trial of ORG 10172 in acute stroke treatment classification, severity by National Institute of Health stroke scale (NIHSS) and the degree of disability by the Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) after 90 days. Results: sNfL was markedly higher in patients with AIS (89.5 pg/mL [IQR: 44.7-195.3]) than with TIA (25.2 pg/mL [IQR: 14.6-48.0]), P= <.001), also after adjusting for age, NIHSS, and stroke volume (P= .003). In receiver operating characteristic analysis, sNfL concentration greater than or equal to 49 pg/mL proved to be the best cut-off value to differentiate between patients with stroke and those with TIA (sensitivity of 73% and specificity of 80%). sNfL concentration significantly correlated with cerebral infarction volume (r = .413, P= <.001), this association remained significant after adjusting for established predictors (P= .019). Patients with AIS due to cardioembolism or large artery atherosclerosis had the highest sNfL concentrations. NIHSS on admission (r = .343, P = <.001) and mRS scores after 3 months (r = .306, P = .004) correlated with sNfL concentration, however functional outcome 3 months after stroke was not associated with sNfL after adjusting for potential confounders. Conclusions: Cases with stroke were distinguishable from those with TIA following the determination of sNfL in the blood samples. The presence and amount of axonal damage estimated by sNfL correlated with the final cerebral infarction volume but was not predictive of degree of disability.", "AuthorKeywords": ["biomarker", "Ischemic", "light", "neurofilament", "Simoa", "stroke", "TIA"], "IndexKeywords": ["Biomarkers", "Brain", "Brain Infarction", "Disability Evaluation", "Female", "Finland", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Neurofilament Proteins", "Predictive Value of Tests", "Prognosis", "Prospective Studies", "Severity of Illness Index", "Time Factors", "Tomography, X-Ray Computed", "Up-Regulation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85066115461", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Rehabilitation", "MEDI", "2742"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"15820022200": {"Name": "Onatsu J.", "AuthorID": "15820022200", "AffiliationID": "60024252", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, NeuroCenter, Kuopio University Hospital"}, "57220407641": {"Name": "J\u00e4k\u00e4l\u00e4 P.", "AuthorID": "57220407641", "AffiliationID": "60103673", "AffiliationName": "Unit of Neurology, Institute of Clinical Medicine, University of Eastern Finland"}, "6508170833": {"Name": "Herukka S.K.", "AuthorID": "6508170833", "AffiliationID": "60103673", "AffiliationName": "Unit of Neurology, Institute of Clinical Medicine, University of Eastern Finland"}, "7003680579": {"Name": "Vanninen R.", "AuthorID": "7003680579", "AffiliationID": "60103673", "AffiliationName": "University of Eastern Finland, Department of Clinical Radiology, University of Eastern Finland"}, "56247329500": {"Name": "Korhonen M.", "AuthorID": "56247329500", "AffiliationID": "60024252", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Radiology, Kuopio University Hospital"}, "35743275900": {"Name": "Hedman M.", "AuthorID": "35743275900", "AffiliationID": "60024252", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Radiology, Kuopio University Hospital"}, "55994850100": {"Name": "Taina M.", "AuthorID": "55994850100", "AffiliationID": "60024252", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Radiology, Kuopio University Hospital"}, "36931000800": {"Name": "Mustonen P.", "AuthorID": "36931000800", "AffiliationID": "60098935", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Keski-Suomi Central Hospital"}, "7005419796": {"Name": "Pulkki K.", "AuthorID": "7005419796", "AffiliationID": "60103673", "AffiliationName": "Eastern Finland Laboratory Center and Department of Clinical Chemistry, University of Eastern Finland"}, "57208899083": {"Name": "Zetterberg H.", "AuthorID": "57208899083", "AffiliationID": "121484674", "AffiliationName": "UK Dementia Research Institute"}, "56415176000": {"Name": "Blennow K.", "AuthorID": "56415176000", "AffiliationID": "60031699", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Neurochemistry Laboratory, Sahlgrenska University Hospital"}, "55883397700": {"Name": "H\u00f6glund K.", "AuthorID": "55883397700", "AffiliationID": "60031699", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Neurochemistry Laboratory, Sahlgrenska University Hospital"}}}
