We explored and compared how persons\u2019 social and physical context shapes their illness representations regarding HTN and the coping strategies they develop and adapt to mitigate challenges in self-managing HTN. Methods: A cross sectional multisite qualitative study using semi-structured interviews among 55 Ghanaians with HTN living in The Netherlands and urban and rural Ghana. A thematic approach was used in data analysis. Results: Family HTN history, personal experiences with HTN and outcomes of using biomedical and traditional treatments shaped participants\u2019 illness representations and coping strategies. Migrants and urban non-migrants modified medication schedules and integrated taking medication into daily routine activities to cope with experienced side effects of taking antihypertensive medication while rural non-migrants used traditional remedies and medicines to mitigate experienced medication side effects and/or in search for a cure for HTN. Conclusion: Contextual factors within participants\u2019 social and physical environments shape their illness representations and coping strategies for HTN though interactive phrases. Practice implications: Health professionals should harness the relationships within peoples\u2019 social and physical environments, encourage implementation of family-wide behavioural changes and involve family and communities in HTN treatment to enhance patients\u2019 self-management of HTN.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Africans", "Alcohol recommendations", "Context", "Coping strategies", "Dietary recommendations", "Hypertension", "Medication adherence", "Migrants", "Patient views", "Physical activity recommendations", "Self-management", "Smoking recommendations", "Social and cultural norms and practices", "Social support", "Traditional medicine for hypertension", "Urban and rural Africans"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adaptation, Psychological", "Adult", "Aged", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Female", "Ghana", "Humans", "Hypertension", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Netherlands", "Qualitative Research", "Self-Management", "Transients and Migrants"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85064150518", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"55821200700": {"Name": "Nyaaba G.N.", "AuthorID": "55821200700", "AffiliationID": "60105961, 60001576", "AffiliationName": "Barcelona Institute for Global Health (IS Global), University of Barcelona"}, "55940388300": {"Name": "Agyemang C.", "AuthorID": "55940388300", "AffiliationID": "60002483, 60117142", "AffiliationName": "Department of Public Health, Amsterdam Public Health Research Institute, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam University Medical Centres"}, "15070089000": {"Name": "Beune E.", "AuthorID": "15070089000", "AffiliationID": "60002483, 60117142", "AffiliationName": "Department of Public Health, Amsterdam Public Health Research Institute, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam University Medical Centres"}, "7003354375": {"Name": "Stronks K.", "AuthorID": "7003354375", "AffiliationID": "60002483, 60117142", "AffiliationName": "Department of Public Health, Amsterdam Public Health Research Institute, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam University Medical Centres"}, "57195151553": {"Name": "Masana L.", "AuthorID": "57195151553", "AffiliationID": "60022415", "AffiliationName": "Medical Anthropology Research Centre-URV Tarragona"}, "15118884800": {"Name": "de-Graft Aikins A.", "AuthorID": "15118884800", "AffiliationID": "60017910", "AffiliationName": "Regional Institute for Population Studies, University of Ghana"}, "55627084200": {"Name": "Larrea-Killinger C.", "AuthorID": "55627084200", "AffiliationID": "60001576", "AffiliationName": "Department of Social Anthropology, University of Barcelona"}}}
