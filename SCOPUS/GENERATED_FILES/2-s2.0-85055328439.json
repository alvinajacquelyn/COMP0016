Previous quantitative and qualitative studies have shown that football interventions can contribute to emotional and physical recovery as well as offer a context for people to connect to others and foster social skills. In the present study, qualitative interviews were conducted with thirty participants and five stakeholders involved in the London based football intervention, Coping Through Football (CTF). These aimed to capture their experiences of the intervention, as well as to gain an understanding of challenges and difficulties that participants have encountered there. Themes evidenced the strong impact of relational experiences which led to increased confidence and social skills. Both physical exercise and lifestyle advice also had a positive impact on physical well-being and lifestyle choices. Different paths to recovery were reported: participants benefitted from the intervention in very individual ways that depended on personal needs and motivation. The answers to the interview questions given by the participants as well as stakeholders highlighted problems surrounding recruitment and inclusion of women, on pitch conflicts and different levels of fitness and level of play. Overall, the findings underline the potential of football interventions as an adjunct treatment form that can lead to increased physical, emotional and social well-being of people with mental health problems as well as challenges that need to be addressed in the planning and implementation of such interventions.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Football", "Mental health", "Physical activity", "Qualitative research", "Recovery", "Soccer"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85055328439", "SubjectAreas": [["Applied Psychology", "PSYC", "3202"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"55662424300": {"Name": "Friedrich B.", "AuthorID": "55662424300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London"}, "7004241930": {"Name": "Mason O.J.", "AuthorID": "7004241930", "AffiliationID": "60021097", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, University of Surrey"}}}
