Fundus examination identified a right macular lesion suggestive of a choroidal neovascular membrane (CNVM). Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) confirmed the presence of a CNVM. She was treated with 2 monthly intravitreal injections of bevacizumab, associated with OCTA evidence of regression of the CNVM and improvement in her visual acuity. OCTA is a novel, non-invasive method of imaging the retinal vasculature. Images are acquired rapidly, with no associated side effects, offering advantages over the current gold standard technique-fundus fluorescein angiography.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Angiogenesis Inhibitors", "Bevacizumab", "Choroid", "Choroidal Neovascularization", "Female", "Fluorescein Angiography", "Humans", "Macular Degeneration", "Middle Aged", "Tomography, Optical Coherence", "Vision Disorders", "Visual Acuity"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85013842244", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"12142110800": {"Name": "Mohla A.", "AuthorID": "12142110800", "AffiliationID": "60016691, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, UK UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "36646250000": {"Name": "Khan K.", "AuthorID": "36646250000", "AffiliationID": "60016691, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, UK UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "57190221940": {"Name": "Kasilian M.", "AuthorID": "57190221940", "AffiliationID": "60016691, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, UK UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "7101991490": {"Name": "Michaelides M.", "AuthorID": "7101991490", "AffiliationID": "60016691, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, UK UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}}}
