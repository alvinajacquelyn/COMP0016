To compare symptom clusters with scales, and to explore their value in PROMs interpretation and symptom management. Methods: A dataset called RT01 (ISCRTN47772397) of 843 prostate cancer patients was used. PROMs were reported with the University of California, Los Angeles Prostate Cancer Index (UCLA-PCI). Symptom clusters were explored with hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) and average linkage method (correlation > 0.6). The reliability of the Urinary Function Scale was evaluated with Cronbach\u2019s Alpha. The strength of the relationship between the items was investigated with Spearman\u2019s correlation. Predictive accuracy of the clusters was compared to the scales by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Presence of urinary symptoms at 3 years measured with the late effects on normal tissue: subjective, objective, management tool (LENT/SOM) was an endpoint. Results: Two symptom clusters were identified (urinary cluster and sexual cluster). The grouping of symptom clusters was different than UCLA-PCI Scales. Two items of the urinary function scales (\u201cnumber of pads\u201d and \u201curinary leak interfering with sex\u201d) were excluded from the urinary cluster. The correlation with the other items in the scale ranged from 0.20 to 0.21 and 0.31 to 0.39, respectively. Cronbach\u2019s Alpha showed low correlation of those items with the Urinary Function Scale (0.14\u20130.36 and 0.33\u20130.44, respectively). All urinary function scale items were subject to a ceiling effect. Clusters had better predictive accuracy, AUC = 0.70 \u20130.65, while scales AUC = 0.67\u20130.61. Conclusion: This study adds to the knowledge on how cluster analysis can be applied for the interpretation and utilisation of PROMs. We conclude that multiple-item scales should be evaluated and that symptom clusters provide a study-specific approach for modelling and interpretation of PROMs.", "AuthorKeywords": ["PROMs analysis", "Summative scores", "Symptom clusters", "UCLA-PCI", "Urinary symptoms"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Biomedical Research", "Humans", "Male", "Patient Reported Outcome Measures", "Prostatic Neoplasms", "Reproducibility of Results", "Sickness Impact Profile", "Syndrome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85016115361", "SubjectAreas": [["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"48861533600": {"Name": "Lemanska A.", "AuthorID": "48861533600", "AffiliationID": "60021097", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, School of Health Sciences, University of Surrey"}, "7003560633": {"Name": "Faithfull S.", "AuthorID": "7003560633", "AffiliationID": "60021097", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, School of Health Sciences, University of Surrey"}, "56643392600": {"Name": "Chen T.", "AuthorID": "56643392600", "AffiliationID": "60021097", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical and Process Engineering, University of Surrey"}, "7004428943": {"Name": "Dearnaley D.P.", "AuthorID": "7004428943", "AffiliationID": "60017166, 60010337", "AffiliationName": "The Institute of Cancer Research & Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust"}, "12139241000": {"Name": "Jena R.", "AuthorID": "12139241000", "AffiliationID": "60120001, 60017488", "AffiliationName": "University of Cambridge Department of Oncology, Cambridge Biomedical Campus, Addenbrooke\u2019s Hospital"}, "55836382400": {"Name": "Sydes M.R.", "AuthorID": "55836382400", "AffiliationID": "60003108, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "MRC Clinical Trials Unit at UCL, Institute of Clinical Trials and Methodology"}}}
