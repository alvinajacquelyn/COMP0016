Recent research has shown early feasibility of methods for compilation of as-damaged building information models (BIM) from as-damaged point cloud data and \"as-built\" models. Yet research efforts to develop and rigorously test appropriate methods are seriously hampered by the obvious scarcity of access for researchers to earthquake-damaged buildings for surveying specimens and hence the lack of terrestrial laser scanning data of post-earthquake buildings. Full-scale or reduced-scale physical models of building components can be built and damaged using a shaking table or other structural laboratory equipment, and these can be scanned, all at reasonable cost. However, equivalent full-scale building samples are unavailable. The solution is to synthesize accurate and representative data sets. A computational approach for compiling such data sets, including BIM modeling of damaged buildings and synthetic scan generation, is proposed. The approach was validated experimentally through compilation of two full-scale models of buildings damaged in earthquakes in Turkey.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Building information modeling", "Damaged building", "Earthquake damage", "Experimental dataset", "Laser scanning emulator", "Synthetic point clouds"], "IndexKeywords": ["Building Information Model - BIM", "Earthquake damages", "Experimental dataset", "Laser scanning", "Point cloud"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84968901934", "SubjectAreas": [["Civil and Structural Engineering", "ENGI", "2205"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"]], "AuthorData": {"55720988200": {"Name": "Ma L.", "AuthorID": "55720988200", "AffiliationID": "60022403, 60072465", "AffiliationName": "Virtual Construction Laboratory, National Building Research Institute, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology"}, "56528471500": {"Name": "Zeibak-Shini R.", "AuthorID": "56528471500", "AffiliationID": "60022403, 60072465", "AffiliationName": "Virtual Construction Laboratory, National Building Research Institute, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology"}, "57196927135": {"Name": "Aryal A.", "AuthorID": "57196927135", "AffiliationID": "60022403, 60072465", "AffiliationName": "Virtual Construction Laboratory, National Building Research Institute, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology"}, "7102941790": {"Name": "Sacks R.", "AuthorID": "7102941790", "AffiliationID": "60022403", "AffiliationName": "Dept. of Structural Engineering and Construction Management, Faculty of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology"}, "6701579835": {"Name": "Filin S.", "AuthorID": "6701579835", "AffiliationID": "60022403", "AffiliationName": "Dept. of Transportation and Geo-Information, Faculty of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology"}}}
