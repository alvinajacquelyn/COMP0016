A representative set of drive facets was derived from an extensive corpus of human attributes (Study 1). Operationalised using an International Personality Item Pool version (the Drive:IPIP), a three-factor model was extracted from the facets in two samples and confirmed on a third sample (Study 2). The multi-item IPIP measure showed congruence with a short form, based on single-item ratings of the facets, and both demonstrated cross-informant reliability. Evidence also supported the measures' convergent, discriminant, concurrent, and incremental validity (Study 3). Based on very promising findings, the authors hope to initiate a stream of research in what is argued to be a rather neglected niche of individual differences and non-cognitive assessment.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Drive", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Models, Psychological", "Motivation", "Personality", "Personality Assessment", "Principal Component Analysis", "Psychometrics", "Reproducibility of Results"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84978710899", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"54913642400": {"Name": "Siegling A.", "AuthorID": "54913642400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "London Psychometric Laboratory, University College London"}, "6603597461": {"Name": "Petrides K.", "AuthorID": "6603597461", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "London Psychometric Laboratory, University College London"}}}
