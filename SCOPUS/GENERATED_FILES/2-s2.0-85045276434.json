Such potential is especially important within the context of reducing the emissions of both greenhouse gases (GHG) and toxic pollutants that adversely impact air quality and human health. To illustrate how fuel design on a molecular level may be exploited to reduce these emissions, the combustion and emission properties of three potential future fuels, geraniol, diethyl carbonate, and a biodiesel (soy methyl ester), were evaluated along with a fossil diesel. The fuels were assessed using \"smoke point\" tests and a Stirling engine. The purpose of the demonstration was to highlight to a general audience several burning characteristics of some possible future fuels, and thus the potential for the development of clean burning \"designer\" fuels. During the 15 min demonstration, significant differences in the combustion properties of the different fuels were shown. For example, the conventional fossil diesel fuel produced a significant amount of soot in flame tests, whereas diethyl carbonate, which is a potential second-generation biofuel, produced visibly lower amounts of soot.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Chemical Engineering", "Demonstrations", "Fatty Acids", "General Public", "Green Chemistry", "Public Understanding/Outreach"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85045276434", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Education", "SOCI", "3304"]], "AuthorData": {"56194860200": {"Name": "Eveleigh A.", "AuthorID": "56194860200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London, Roberts Building"}, "55174359600": {"Name": "Hellier P.", "AuthorID": "55174359600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London, Roberts Building"}, "57201553808": {"Name": "K\u00e4rcher V.", "AuthorID": "57201553808", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London, Roberts Building"}, "55745306300": {"Name": "Talibi M.", "AuthorID": "55745306300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London, Roberts Building"}}}
