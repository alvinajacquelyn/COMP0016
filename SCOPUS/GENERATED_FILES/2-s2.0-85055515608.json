This work proposes a new frequency-domain channel estimation and equalisation method, then investigates the employment of both OFDM and SEFDM pilot symbols for channel estimation to find channel state information (CSI). It is experimentally shown that the new method offers a reduction in the computational complexity compared to conventional time-domain estimation and equalisation for SEFDM systems with a similar system performance. The design of the baseband signal generation and signal detection using IFFT and FFT structure implemented using LabVIEW communication design suite is described in detail together with the baseband design of the system used to effect signal synchronisation and channel estimation and equalisation.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Baseband signals", "Communication design", "Design and implementations", "Experimental evaluation", "Experimental system", "Frequency-domain channel estimation", "Non-orthogonal", "Spectral efficiencies"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85055515608", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"], ["Signal Processing", "COMP", "1711"]], "AuthorData": {"57191579684": {"Name": "Ozan W.", "AuthorID": "57191579684", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "57151150900": {"Name": "Ghannam H.", "AuthorID": "57151150900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "55846144300": {"Name": "Xu T.", "AuthorID": "55846144300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "55103012600": {"Name": "Haigh P.", "AuthorID": "55103012600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "7003497031": {"Name": "Darwazeh I.", "AuthorID": "7003497031", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}}}
